To be fair , this article could just as easily have been called “ Waking a Zombie World ” .
While various people and governments point to the USA as the bad actor in this mess , in fact it has taken dozens of nations to form this conga line to hell and the rest of the world is far from blameless .
Nor is America the sole residence of the world ’s zombie population .
However , since this writer and much of the ZH readership reside in American , we will assume an American ( ego ) centric focus .
My apologies for the delay in posting this article which I had promised some time ago .
In my defense , there are hundreds of thick and dusty books on this subject at the local library , proof that it ’s not very easy to condense this complex subject into a 10 minute read .
In fact , it ’s impossible to do so and not even worth trying .
While you can break visible light down to its primary colors , it ’s actually composed of millions .
The same applies to this subject .
What I finally decided to do was break it down into separate postings so that the reader could find the courage and stamina to actually read it .
Even with the division , be forewarned that this first posting is still a long read .
This article is an effort to understand what ’s really going on , why Americans ( and the rest of the world ) appear to be frozen in place , seemingly helpless and hopeless in the face of incredible corruption and thieving .
A quick review of history shows us this is n’t the first time it has happened , though it may be the biggest since the 1930’s .
In fact , these types of disasters seem to occur regularly , following a well worn script to its inevitable conclusion .
The bad guys escape with the loot while the general population looks on , tails between the legs , hands in pockets and eyes cast down , impotent to the end .
Why do we allow ourselves to be used and abused like this ?
Why are we spectators to our own destruction ?
While the human condition can’t always be quantified , it can be understood to some extent , but only if we ’re willing to peer into some extremely uncomfortable places .
My ultimate goal in writing this “ End of Empire ” series is to promote reflection and understanding .
Significant and lasting political and social change will not occur until we elevate our understanding and awareness far above where it is today .
I most definitely do n’t have all the answers and anyone who claims they do is smoking the good stuff and should share their stash with this formerly long haired hippie .
Pass the bong dude .
In this article , I ’ll describe how I see myself , the world and the people who live in it .
By doing so , the reader will be looking over my shoulder at the workings of the human psyche , or at least my interpretation of the psyche .
What you will not find is the consensus view on this subject .
For that , all you need do is pop open a standard psychology 101 text book and dive in .
The reason I leave the beaten path is simple .
The really interesting ideas are usually found way out on the fringe and deep in the weeds .
That ’s not to say you ca n’t find “ truth ” or accurate knowledge within the consensus , just that cutting edge ideas and concepts are n’t tolerated well among the establishment .
In my opinion , the established leaders rarely go into areas that are n’t well traveled and seldom stray from their own fields of expertise .
Ironically , in a discipline that devotes much ink to the discussion of the ego , the principal players ’ egos prevent little more than incremental forward progress .
When you ’re sipping from government and corporate grants , you do n’t often make waves .
Now for the fine print disclaimer .
My understanding is ever changing and evolving and I reserve the right to change my opinion before I finish this sentence or this series .
The one constant thing in life is change .
All I ask of the reader is to read this in its entirety and in the order written .
When mucking around in the bushes , it ’s very easy to take things out of context when you do n’t read the context .
The subject is so involved and complex that each paragraph could be expanded into 8 more and still not be complete .
I ask the reader to consider that I just might have left some things out of this article in the interest of brevity and not because I ’m clueless .
Established “ facts ” are often facts the consensus believes can be or has been proven , which in the field of psychology is usually what the majority believes to be fact .
Circular logic is often accepted by the consensus because it substantiates and validates the consensus .
We see this in religion , politics , science , finance , in every human behavior .
Because of this , it ’s impossible to understand ourselves and our world without a fundamental knowledge of psychology and philosophy and the willingness to break the boundaries of accepted thought and leave the pack .
From my point of view , only when I began to color ( way ) outside the lines did I begin to pull together seemingly unconnected ideas and concepts into a bigger , more coherent picture .
Psychology helps me understand why we do what we do and philosophy forces me ( at least temporarily ) to abandon any notions of right or wrong , good and bad , better or worse and see life as it really is .
When thinking philosophically , I must leave my biases and prejudices at the door .
I use these two tools , along with others , to gain ( and hopefully maintain ) perspective .
Since I ’m not a classically trained psychologist with a consensus belief system , I ’m at liberty to explore multiple ideas and concepts that are n’t constrained by a formal ideology or professional field of expertise .
From my point of view , I ’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain .
Instead of herding everything I learn into rigid categories for emotional and intellectual comfort , I try to follow the rabbit wherever it goes .
After decades of trying to do things “ my way or the highway ” I ’ve learned the hard way it ’s best to navigate life with an open mind and a loosely held belief system , in the same manner one might gently cradle a delicate butterfly rather than desperately clutch a huge sack of potatoes .
By doing so , when something does n’t fit my worldview or belief system , I simply let go and let it mold itself into any shape that ’s required to fit the new information .
Contrary to what one might think , this does n’t result in radical changes but rather subtle movements .
The key is mental and emotional flexibility and with lots of practice and a healthy dose of courage , it can be as easy as that .
While this process might sound nonsensical , impossible even ( “ you have to believe something ” I ’ve been told ) it ’s actually very easy and quite liberating once you exercise it on a regular basis .
Very young children do it every day , until it ’s finally conditioned out of them using an extremely effective program of dogmatic repetition and indoctrination administered by our state sponsored training institutions known as the public and private school system .
For those children who require additional training , there are 4 more years of intensive focus available for a substantial additional charge .
Finally , in those tragic cases where a few unfortunate children refuse to absorb their conditioning , graduate school is offered .
Quite frankly , it ’s their last and only hope and it ’s usually financed with huge loans and paid back in monthly installments , assuming they finally secure gainful employment once released onto an unsuspecting and vulnerable world .
These adult children are hopelessly institutionalized and those who survive this level of indoctrination have historically done the most damage to society .
All kidding aside ( well , actually I was n’t kidding ) the training I just described is not known to produce an open mind and a flexible belief system .
As I continue to work on reversing and repairing a lifetime of damage to my own psyche and spirit , the perspective gained from this flexibility allows me to forcibly move my dominant ego to the back of the bus and away from the controls .
I say forcibly because the ego is the original and ultimate control freak , a crisis manger that knows it all and wo n’t willingly release command .
The ego will not go quietly into the night .
By corralling the egoic mind , it enables my intellect and awareness to explore areas my ego would normally shield from me .
It took me the longest time to realize that what I thought was “ me ” , my “ self ” , my conscious mind talking and thinking was often and sometimes exclusively my ego , which is a very constrained and purposely narrow slice of my full consciousness .
In essence , I discovered that my ego , that constant companion I ’d always assumed was “ me ” , was n’t actually “ me ” .
Worse yet , I realized my ego lied to me .
As a matter of fact , my ego lied to me all the time , in a very successful attempt to shield me from myself and the world around me .
It appears I really am wearing rose colored glasses , placed there by an hyper vigilant ego perfectly adapted to an environment made dangerous by lions , tigers and bears ( oh my ) but mostly useless and quite self destructive in a modern world of townhouses and tea parties .
While the ego is wonderfully capable of piloting the ship through dangerous shoals and shark infested waters , it is not well suited to the everyday mundane task of cruise ship captain .
It is time to extract the ( ego ) maniac from the pilot house and put him in charge of the bilge pumps .
However , you do n’t want to remove the ego completely because you need it in a pinch .
While the ego will scream and holler at first , ( usually manifested in fear and anxiety ) it really is n’t comfortable handling delicate cruise ship piloting duties 24 / 7 .
Once you negotiate a truce with your ego by assuring your ego you need it during crisis situations , the ego will stay busy rebuilding the bilge pumps and manning the life boats , where it really is much happier .
You really do n’t want the antisocial and paranoid head of security running the public relations department all the time .
Do n’t believe me ?
Think this is silly ?
Well , you might be correct , but consider the following .
Have you ever experienced a situation where you ’re talking to someone , carrying on a somewhat heated conversation ( meaning your ego is front and center ) and yet at the same time you mentally float off and find yourself watching yourself as you argue with the person ?
Or something happens and you react instinctively , yet at the same time and in the back of your mind , you ’re asking yourself why you ’re doing or saying this or that ?
I ’m talking about real time here , not after the fact .
Sort of like watching yourself while also being in the “ here and now ” .
This actually happens to many people but rarely do they talk about it publically , for fear of being branded crazy or weird .
I suggest that if you ’ve never experienced this , it might be because you ’ve never tried or you ’re more egocentric than some ( that ’s not necessarily a bad thing , it just is what it is ) and you might benefit from being aware of it .
To go a little further with this idea ( and deeper into the weeds ) as I ’ve learned to control my dreams ( I submit that dreaming is simply a different aspect of consciousness ) there are times when I ’m in my dream ( seeing through my dream eyes in my dream body so to speak ) while also watching myself in my dream , in exactly the same manner as described above .
But I ’ve also experienced ( more accurately controlled ) the third perspective while dreaming , moving in and out of my dream body at will , disembodied from myself , while at the same time watching me watch my ego in the dream .
There are other perspectives as well ( out of your dream body and into someone else ’s dream body , which I find exhilarating ) but I do n’t wish to scare off the reader too soon .
I see all this as simply different perspectives or dimensions of the same consciousness .
I humorously call this dream state the ultimate expression of me , myself and I ( and that guy ) .
While some people get physically and emotionally upset when I discuss this ( yes , some people become quite threatened by things like this ) if science can rationally discuss string and membrane theory , quantum mechanics and 11 dimensions , I can talk about expanded consciousness .
For those readers experiencing a queasy stomach right about now , wondering who this lunatic is , you ’re welcome to exit stage right if you like .
For those readers who regularly read my comments on ZH , I ’ll quote my all time favorite line from the movie “ Starman ” .
“ You wanted crazy , you got crazy . ” :>)
Circling back , this heightened awareness has many different names in other cultures and ( not surprisingly ) it ’s that place or level one wishes to reach during meditation , Yoga or intense concentration .
Many “ creative ” and “ religious ” people have reported reaching a heightened state of awareness during moments of greatest inspiration and concentration .
( I ’ll touch the “ religious ” third rail in my next article . )
This heightened awareness can only be reached by taking the ego out of the driver ’s seat and engaging yourself .
You , or more accurately your consciousness , can be found in this area of higher awareness , where your true creativity and knowledge is located .
This is where you find the more fully formed you , not the everyday ego we all assume is us , which is what is exposed to the world when we ’re on automatic pilot .
This higher awareness is where your gut instinct resides , the place where problems are sorted out when you “ sleep on it ” , where you put something in the back of your mind for processing .
If you think about it , there are dozens of popular cliché ’s we use every day that actually describe a higher level of consciousness .
While we kind of , maybe , sort of , accept this as possible , we rarely spend any time attempting to engage this area at will and use this power to our benefit .
Just think , all those wasted years in my late teens and early 20 ’s taking hallucinogenic drugs and looking for me when I was actually right here all the time . :>)
You really can have lots of fun with this if you do n’t take yourself too seriously and regularly tickle the funny bone .
( I ’ll cover more thoroughly the “ hallucinogenic drugs ” third rail next time . )
My little laugh at my own expense actually highlights that most basic and fundamental aspect of being human , the longing or yearning for “ meaning ” that humans have described for thousands of years .
Think of the tens of thousands of books , poems and songs written over the ages describing the search for the meaning and purpose of life .
As you might suspect , I have some ideas on the subject but not here , not now .
By the way , Microsoft ’s “ Word ” spell check does n’t like this article .
Too many me , myself and I ’s ( which Word as king narcissist automatically corrects to read “ me , me , me ” ) has Bill Gates ’ crowning achievement all worked up .
Anyway , the phenomenon of watching your ego while awake and aware is sometimes called perspective but also has many other names and explanations .
The real question is how are you able to do this if “ you ” are your ego and your ego is “ you ” ?
How can you be “ you ” and also be watching yourself at the same time ?
It ’s almost as if you ’re of two minds as the saying goes .
In my opinion , the ego is a narrow slice of and a distinct part of your total consciousness ( but a part of it none - the - less ) something I call my basic self , where my mental reflexes lay , the emotional me , the crisis manager , my reptilian brain for lack of a better term .
You can actually train yourself to step back and watch your ego at will , though it can be more difficult during times of stress , when the dominant ego asserts it ’s primacy over your consciousness .
Interestingly , during deep concentration or during meditation , when I ’ve moved the ego into the background and my consciousness forward , I sense there are additional levels of awareness .
It ’s my understanding that it ’s possible for the more highly developed conscious being ( shamans , Dali Lama , etc ) to “ go ” much further than I can even conceive of .
This is a rabbit hole that ’s very deep , endless even , and while I ’ll never fully explore it in my lifetime , it ’ll be loads of fun trying .
Once you begin to practice this , you find it ’s much easier to subvert your ego because you no longer identify yourself with the ego .
“ You ” are not your ego and your ego is not “ you ” .
“ You ” are the master , the overseer , the conscious being and your ego is your servant , in the same manner your arm is a part of you but not “ you ” .
( Unless of course you ’re Peter Seller ’s arm in “ Dr Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb ” a wonderfully powerful examination of global insanity created and accepted by the consensus reality . )
Interestingly , it appears that for the last six thousand years , the ego has gained more and more control over the human psyche ; to the point where today it remains dominant nearly all the time .
In fact , there is growing evidence that ancient man did n’t “ think ” or experience reality in the same way we do today .
But since we know of nothing else , of no other way to be , we assume this is normal and natural .
My studies indicate it has n’t always been normal for the ego to be primary , front and center , crowding out our greater awareness , pushing it into the background .
( I ’ll expand on this in the next article . )
Of course , at times you do want a dominant ego , such as when a car is about to strike you , the ladder is about to fall or someone is waving a gun in your face .
You want and need that part of your consciousness to dominate , when any hesitation might kill you .
But not when you ’re sitting in the board room or on the throne in the bathroom .
Servants do n’t dominant the master but instead follow the masters bidding .
BTW , please do n’t get hung up on the word “ control ” because it ’s not about control of the ego as much as understanding , awareness and perspective of the ego and your consciousness .
The next step in understanding your consciousness ( once you understand the separation of “ you ” and your ego ) is to understand that , contrary to conventional wisdom , there is no clear division of the conscious mind separated from the unconscious mind , with the ego mixed into the mess .
Instead , understand that there is only a totality called consciousness ( including the collective consciousness , which will be discussed in the next article ) and the ego is constraining your view of your own total consciousness in the same way a massively large but completely dark warehouse might appear to you if all you have is a small flashlight which only illuminates a very small area .
Now consider that your ego , which is usually controlling the direction and intensity of the flashlight , is a hyper alert , very frightened and extremely strong child wandering through the pitch black vastness completely alone .
Clearly the child is not in the mood to explore and understand .
In fact , the child will deliberately ignore anything that could possibly be threatening , frightening or even confusing .
You will be blind to many things because your ego will simply not illuminate it for you .
Even if the ego recedes into the background , it still very effectively filters “ reality ” or “ truth ” if you ’re not aware of the ego and its methods .
You ca n’t see what you do n’t know about or what you ’re not aware of .
( This reminds me of that wonderfully obtuse but factually correct statement by Donald Rumsfeld .
“ You have your known knowns , your known unknowns and your unknown unknowns . ” )
Your ego is a crisis manager and is always on high alert and not rational or logical under any circumstances .
In fact , the term “ rational or logical ego ” is the ultimate oxymoron .
The ego ’s fight or flight survival instincts , when allowed to be the dominant emotion , is not very well suited to exploration and understanding of the darkened area of your consciousness , which requires curiosity , insight , reflection , sensitivity , etc .
However , the ego is very well adapted to deal with crisis , hunger , severe physical stress and so on , making the ego an excellent crisis manager .
The ego , which is always on high alert though not always dominant , will “ see ” things such as scary shapes or movement and “ hear ” noises that for the most part will be a complete fabrication .
Now switch on the overhead flood lights , illuminating the entire warehouse , and suddenly all those previously frightening shapes and sounds turn out to be easily recognizable familiar objects .
While I do n’t know how to ( fully ) turn on my mental flood lights , I ’m absolutely convinced that if we were able to switch the lights on , we would laugh heartily at our own foolishness and insanity , for it would all make sense once we could see the big picture .
We ’ve all seen those picture grabs that are nearly impossible to decipher ( like a circle with rods radiating outward ) until we pull back to see the entire perspective ( a Ferris or bicycle wheel ) and suddenly it all makes sense .
While I ’m a long way from this level of awareness , significant progress can still be realized if I understand that I ’m no longer compelled to allow my ego to dominate and distort everything all the time .
Just as important , knowing the past is littered with distortions and lies perpetrated by the ego , I must begin the process of re-examination and reflection .
In addition , once I understand what the ego is and its role in my existence , I can more easily see through the ego ’s distortion and subterfuge .
While my ego still throws the occasional temper tantrum in the middle of the supermarket , I ’ve learned to recognize the warning signs and not take it personally , pun intended .
Even if I ’m unable to stop the ego tantrum , I can still quickly escort my ego outside and lock it in the car .
Understanding the circumstances that color my perception will go a long way towards dealing with it .
The scary monster creeping up behind me is very often my ego .
In truly dysfunctional individuals , where the ego is extremely dominant and in constant tension with the conscious mind , I suspect the ego deliberately sabotages the individual to create crisis after crisis in order to “ feel ” needed and useful .
While the ego might be an excellent crisis manager , once we recognize that the ego sees the world from an extremely narrow point of view , we should n’t ever expect the ego to act like a mature adult , applying reason and insight to lessons learned in order to modify future behavior .
The ego is the one tiger that will never change its stripes .
This might explain why some people seem to be extremely self destructive yet when carefully questioned , report that they ’re completely clueless about their behavior .
Understanding the ego and its effect on human behavior helps explain , or at least helps one understand , all kinds of bizarre human behavior .
Remember , the ego does n’t make moral judgments as we understand “ moral ” to be ( right or wrong , just or unjust , good or bad ) but simply “ sees ” the world from its own narrow point of view , that of harm or no harm to itself or to the entire consciousness that it ’s a part of .
Actually , the ego sees itself as a separate and distinct entity rather than a part of the bigger whole .
The ego sees itself as THE captain of the ship and everything else as passengers and cargo that the ego is responsible for .
Thus , the ego sees itself as besieged on all sides by danger and oppression , under constant assault and in continuous survival mode .
Psychopathic or sociopathic behavior is more understandable when seen through the eyes of the controlling ego .
If the ego has completely taken over the conscious being and is continuously and permanently in control , from the point of view of the ego , it ’s constantly fighting for its very existence and anything goes .
The insanity of the psychopath / sociopath makes perfect sense when you understand that the ego is permanently in the psychopath ’s drivers seat .
Circling back to the concept of a lightly held worldview , I ’m not actually abandoning everything I know and believe each time I let go .
Instead I ’m simply changing my perspective .
Each time I come face to face with a fact or idea that I might have previously rejected as impossible or unbelievable , instead of meeting it with “ no ” and rejecting it outright , I can first try “ why not ” .
It requires letting go of my defensive position , my ego , my fight or flight crisis management reflex and trusting that I can emotionally and mentally withstand a shock to my belief system , that the new information is valuable to me rather than threatening .
The thing is , once I let go , there is no shock to the system because there ’s nothing there to resist .
If you do n’t “ own ” your belief system , there is nothing to lose when it must be released for reconditioning .
It can be difficult at times to leave the old conditioning behind and it shows when I write “ I believe ” because those words implies ownership of a belief system .
Habits are obvious indications of conditioning .
Think about that old joke , how it ’s not the fall that kills you but the sudden stop .
By removing the need to withstand assaults to your rigid belief system ( because it ’s light and flexible and easily released ) there ’s no sudden stop .
It ’s as if you ’re a screen door , barely affected by the gust of wind passing through .
It ’s really remarkable how many doors you suddenly find open once you stop pounding on the closed door in front of you and look around .
By letting go of the desperate urge ( created by the ego ) to control or restrict the information flow , suddenly we recognize that no idea or concept can harm us ( manifested as fear and anxiety ) unless we oppose it .
It ’s never a question of being able to learn new things ; the problem lay with letting go of the old stuff .
This is why children are more easily trained and so impressionable .
They ’re an open book , with very little old baggage to overcome and plenty of open space to be filled .
Worse ( and this realization has brought me to tears a few times ) we , you and I , our society , are teaching our own children ’s ego to be dominant and to control , to lie and to cheat .
Because the ego has no mechanism to distinguish between right and wrong , while the higher consciousness might better understand the difference between a “ white ” lie and full blown deceit , the ego simply sees this incoming information as tools to be used , usually against the consciousness and its human host , your son or daughter .
I ’ll never forget the day a few decades back when I was trying to explain to my 4 year old son ( to answer his question ) the difference between a small lie and a big lie .
My son was completely bewildered and I could see it in his eyes .
I realized then and there that I was creating my very own Frankenstein ’s monster .
I was teaching my son how to rationalize and justify and game the system , to accept the conditioning , to be part of the hive mentality .
And even when I fought against this insanity , society was more than willing to pick up the slack .
While we ’re training our child about hot stoves and thin ice , we ’re also teaching the ego how to lie , cheat and deceive .
As we are ( in ) forming the child ’s consciousness , we are ( in ) forming the ego .
This is a difficult rabbit hole to go down , to recognize that you ’re harming your child , but it does deserve serious thought .
Well meaning people have tried to assure me that I was just doing what I thought was best to reinforce and validate their denial ( no I was n’t , I recognized what I was doing but I was too weak , lazy and conditioned to fight my own conditioning all the time ) or that if I did n’t teach my child , he would not have been as well adjusted as he obviously was ( being well adjusted to a sick and insane society is not a good thing ) but I ’ve made peace with myself on this matter .
Just realize that anyone travelling down this road must deal with this speed bump eventually .
However , with regard to learning about yourself and your consciousness , you can be a wide eyed and fearless little child again ; open to new ideas and concepts , resilient and adaptable , a dry sponge waiting to be filled with water .
It ’s a matter of willingness , not ability or intelligence .
In fact initially , when you ’re first learning this process , thinking often gets in the way because the conditioned egocentric intellectual process is the old rut you ’re stuck in and something to be avoided .
You do n’t want to push yourself into the same rut you ’re pushing yourself out of .
I often think of life and our perception of reality as a jigsaw puzzle .
There are countless puzzle pieces in front of us and from the moment we ’re born ( I suggest it starts before birth ) we begin assembling the pieces into a coherent picture .
While most of the more complex puzzle construction takes place during the training and conditioning phase we call our education , our basic concepts and beliefs are cemented into place by 5 or 6 years of age .
Think of the children as Zombies in training .
We are conditioned , well before the officially structured conditioning ever begins , to believe that the world ( reality ) is finite , quantifiable and static .
Obviously the consensus view of how the pieces fit together is predetermined by society long before you ’re born and very often the pieces do n’t fit together very well .
Because we trust those around us to know better , we simply accept what we ’re told , that the ill fitting pieces are natural and to be expected .
As we grow older and develop more independence , while we can clearly see there are pieces left over even when our education is done , we ’re assured by society that these pieces are inconsequential , not needed , unimportant and immaterial .
And quite frankly , society tends to ostracize those who ask difficult and uncomfortable questions .
So as we navigate our lives , when outlier or incompatible information pushes to the top of the froth , we follow our conditioning and compare these stray and orphan pieces against our ever changing list of socially acceptable facts .
The vast majority of the time we simply discard them when they do n’t fit our view or that of society .
Let ’s look at this a little closer .
How many times over the past 12 months have you been reading a book , newspaper , magazine , trolling the Internet , listening to a news program , whatever , when something leaps to the center of your attention and immediately prompts a “ What the hell ” response .
Here ’s a stray puzzle piece that for whatever reason has been thrust into view .
It does n’t fit anywhere in your personal puzzle but there it is , commanding your attention and demanding resolution .
But this piece is “ out there ” and for some reason you may feel a little uncomfortable , fearful , angry even .
While it ’s just one little piece of the puzzle , it feels threatening to you .
How dare this puzzle piece jump out in front of you and disturb your peaceful day .
Or maybe not , maybe you have no feeling either way .
But still it does n’t fit .
So what do you do ?
Do you spend the next 3 hours re-examining your belief system or this puzzle piece in an honest attempt to understand the outlier .
Of course you do n’t , because the piece does n’t fit .
Out it goes , usually never to be seen again .
I cannot overemphasize how powerful the impulse is for the conditioned person ( again , the Zombie ) to stay within societies boundaries and discard the outlier puzzle pieces .
Interestingly , the type of information ( how contrary it is to the consensus opinion of society ) is not always the sole or even principal determination used by the person when deciding what to do with it .
The credibility of the purveyor of this information is often more important .
For example , if the source of the information is suspect , the piece can be ( more ) easily discarded .
However , if the source is extremely credible , the conditioned person faces a crisis of confidence .
While they trust the source , the information is very disturbing .
The ego sees this emotional stress and conflict as a crisis and struggles mightily to compel the person , through fear and anxiety , to reject the puzzle piece and return to emotional stability .
If the person rejects the information , the ego will turn down ( but never off ) the fear and anxiety .
Even the credibility of the information itself is sometimes immaterial .
The person often does n’t even want to look at it very closely because doing so will simply make the crisis more difficult to deal with .
It ’s not the information that ’s threatening as much as the person ’s view of how that information will affect their position in society .
If society is telling them that anyone who accepts this information will be rejected or ostracized , the information is downright dangerous to the person .
The deeper the conditioning and the more the person has surrendered his identity to society and its conditioning , the deeper the crisis will be .
This is the reason why so many people go through life with closed minds , seemingly certain they know precisely what ’s right and wrong .
In many ways , these people are protecting themselves from emotional crisis , though they would never admit that to themselves or to others because this insight is emotionally threatening .
The dog is chasing its tail in a positive feedback loop .
If the leaders of a society wish to manipulate the population ( duh ) this explains why the leaders ( we ’re not just talking politicians here ) would lie to their citizens , something I ’ve repeatedly talked about on ZH .
If the person ( the conditioned mind ) in crisis is confronted with information they desperately wish to reject , but the information or source is extremely credible , the person needs emotional help to discard the information .
The ego is pounding on the person in the form of fear and anxiety to drop this hot potato , to resolve the crisis .
The person is desperate for emotional cover to relieve their suffering .
If they reject the information in order to stop the emotional pain and be accepted in the eyes of society ( which is extremely important to the conditioned person ) then they must personally reject the information and the source .
But they know deep down ( though not always consciously ) that they should at least look at the information more closely and quite possibly embrace it .
This is what ’s causing the crisis , the knowledge that it could be true .
The conditioned mind always knows what the “ truth ” is and this exerts ( additional ) pressure on the conditioned mind , even if the conditioned mind is not aware of it .
The person needs to receive permission to do what they want to do , which is to reject the information in a manner that allows them to relieve the emotional pain ( denial will help them feel better about themselves ) and still assure them of society ’s acceptance .
In other words , in this case they wish to reject the info in a personally and socially acceptable manner .
By the way , it does n’t matter if “ society ” is not aware of this person ’s crisis .
It ’s all about how the person see ’s himself in relation to society .
I will stress again that we ’re talking about the conditioned mind here , the so called Zombie .
People will reject information while alone at home just as quickly as they would in a public setting .
To even be in possession ( intellectually or physically , it does n’t matter ) of the information is often very threatening .
I ’m reminded of the Japanese person talking on the outdoor payphone and bowing while talking .
In the person ’s mind and manner ( meaning in the consciousness ) the other person is physically there .
This is an important dynamic to understand and it helps explain the “ phantom limb syndrome ” many amputee ’s experience .
Experiments have shown that when you see a movie of someone lifting their arm , the part of your brain that controls your own arm lights up in the same manner as it does when you actually lift your own arm .
The actual electrical impulses that would move the arm are blocked by another part of the brain ( I think it ’s your consciousness that blocks it ) which apparently knows the difference between pictures and “ reality ” .
But your brain does n’t perceive any difference between the picture and the real thing .
I guess this also explains the multibillion dollar pornography business , does n’t it ? :>)
Perception is reality , at least to your brain .
When the politician ( as the social leader ) lies to the conditioned person ( a social animal ) about the information , the politician has in effect just given the conditioned mind the good housekeeping stamp of approval to do the same .
Accepting the lie is good and acceptable to society because Daddy ( society ’s leader ) says so .
We ’re talking about infantile responses here when examining the conditioned mind .
The political leader , the “ official ” head of the society , has just told the person exactly what they want to hear .
Daddy said it ’s not true , the source is mistaken , crazy even , ignore that man behind the curtain , Daddy ’s the great and mighty OZ .
The conditioned mind can now safely reject the information and remain in good graces in society .
Since society is willing to accept the lie , the person can do so as well .
In effect , it is n’t a lie anymore because society ( by way of society ’s leaders ) says it is n’t a lie .
To the person reading this description of the dynamics of this personal and public subterfuge , it sounds incredible , unbelievable even .
Yet this insanity goes on all the time , often in very subtle ways .
You and I do this but since our ego wo n’t let us see ourselves clearly , deliberately obscuring our own self deceit and then papering it over with denial ( and then denying the denial ) we often remain convinced that others may do this but we do n’t .
But of course we do .
Let me also assure you that these dynamics are thoroughly understood and utilized by private parties ( corporate advertising , sales organizations , etc ) and government entities .
Consider the entire alphabet soup of overt and covert government agencies here , including more and more private contractors doing the dirty work for the government these days .
What exactly do you think is going on when you hear the term “ psychological operations ” and who do you think those “ psyops ” are being directed towards ?
Do you remember those mind control “ experiments ” conducted by the US government in the 50’s and 60’s , which were piggybacking on the work done by the Nazi doctors ?
( But let ’s not go there , that ’s on society ’s no - no list . )
The key for those who wish to manipulate and control the population is to maintain and extend the conditioning of society .
I ’ll give you one guess what the principal tool is and how this is accomplished .
I ’ll even give you a hint ; the word contains the letters “ T ” and “ V ” .
I ’ll cover this more thoroughly in part 2 when I talk about control mechanisms .
The puzzle piece itself may be perfectly formed and acceptable in another time or place , or with another person , easily taken in and absorbed .
But for this conditioned person , here and now , and for whatever reason , it ’s discarded .
Why ?
If you wish to overcome your conditioning , what ’s wrong with simply seeing it as a stray puzzle piece that does n’t yet have a home in your worldview or belief system ?
Rather than trashing it , you can place it back on the table for future reference .
It really is that simple once you recognize that you ’re creating the problem here , not the puzzle piece .
I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve been able to pick up puzzle pieces months or years later that finally seem to fit , greatly contributing to my personal growth .
I ’m certain if I ’d trashed them , it ’s very likely they ’d never be available again .
This is because the more pieces I discard the deeper I surrender myself to societies conditioning .
Each time we discard something , we must force ourselves deeper and deeper into denial in order to live with ourselves .
The damage is cumulative and creates a growing dysfunction and neurosis .
We must first deny it ever happened and them we must deny we ever denied it ever happened .
This level of mental and emotional deceit can back up and needs to be cleared out occasionally or serious psychosis will develop .
What happens when the toilet becomes jammed and wo n’t flush away life ’s waste ?
A crisis is what happens .
As individuals and as a society , we ’re growing more emotionally unstable each day .
Witness the dramatic increase in school and work shootings & suicides over the past 30 years , to name just one example .
Have n’t you ever wondered where this insanity is coming from ?
Does n’t a little siren go off in the back of your head every time someone goes “ postal ” ?
Our insanity is increasing , which explains a population growing more obese , more dependent on drugs and distraction to make it through each day .
It stands to reason then that the most disturbing puzzle pieces , and thus those most likely to be rejected by the conditioned mind , are those that pertain to society itself .
To recognize that society ’s leaders not only lie to us but may be trying to harm us ( something that is obvious to the less condition mind ) is nearly unthinkable .
Similarly , recognizing that your spouse is sexually abusing your children or your father is molesting the neighborhood children is also extremely difficult to accept .
To the conditioned mind , it is literally unimaginable .
The ego will throw up a nearly impenetrable barrier to shield the conditioned mind from this information .
How many times have you left a bad relationship and said something like “ I never saw it coming ” or “ How could I have been so blind ” ?
Your ego shielded you from the ( coming ) emotional trauma by blinding you to reality .
Everyone else knew for months your spouse was cheating on you .
Why did n’t you ?
Sadly , this tendency is conditioned into us from birth and builds upon itself in an out - of - control positive feedback loop that acts as a control mechanism .
While some might claim this is natural or just human nature to do so , I think just the opposite .
I believe that the control mechanisms , the training and conditioning combined with social peer pressure and its positive feedback loop has been so completely assimilated into our very fabric and perception that it has become indistinguishable from reality , thus it is reality and by extension normal or natural .
Perception , when fully and unquestionably accepted , is reality .
In every sense of the word , we create our own realty on the fly , in real time , simply by the decisions we do or do n’t make , the beliefs we maintain , which in turn are filtered by our rigid worldview , which is then reinforced by society and promoted by what I call “ bad actors ” .
Our rigid worldview is reinforced and encouraged by everything we interact with on a daily basis , enabling us to grow mentally lazy and intellectually stagnant .
We ’re assured by science that our material world is measurable , quantifiable , consistent and stable .
We ’ve been assured that most of the secrets of the universe have been teased out and independently confirmed , that matter and energy follow iron clad rules of physics and the few small inconsistencies will soon be worked out , as soon as that fancy new CERN collider in Geneva is fired up and working at full power .
So how do we deal with some genuinely strange ( scientific ) puzzle pieces that are only now becoming widely accepted and that seem to be directly related to consciousness ?
For instance , a scientific experiment confirmed that subatomic particles can instantly “ communicate ” across vast distances .
In other words , “ communicate ” faster than the speed of light .
This flies in the face of everything we think we know and breaks every rule we ’ve been taught .
Or my personal favorite , the now established fact that by simply observing something , we affect it .
Matter ca n’t be accurately measured because it ’s changed simply by being observed .
When we “ observe ” something , what we ’re really doing is directing our consciousness towards it , bringing the observed into of sphere of awareness .
So does this mean our consciousness is a form of energy that can influence or even change other forms of energy ( matter is energy in a different form or energy state ) thus bringing full circle my constant refrain that perception is reality ?
If our consciousness is energy , then can it be destroyed ( energy and matter are never destroyed , only changed in form or frequency ) can it “ die ” when the human body dies ?
Clearly this information warrants careful study with an unbiased eye .
Or do we just chuck these outliers out the window and sleep better now that we ’ve maintained our rigid worldview ?
Is this a science , physics or consciousness puzzle piece ?
The rabbit hole really is bottomless when you get up a head of steam .
As much as I would love to believe that there ’s a magic pill or a dynamic leader or a puzzle piece of information that would change all of this if only my neighbor would swallow it , vote for it or read it , the inescapable conclusion is that there ’s no magic cure in the wings , waiting to be applied to fix what is broken .
However , the unraveling has only just begun and I actually possess what I consider to be a realistic expectation that this mess will not completely implode into a seething roiling fireball of destruction .
How does it end ?
I do n’t really know but I will hazard a guess sometime down the line .
If we ’re honest about this , we all want our baubles and trinkets and a good paying job as well .
We want everything to change and nothing to change .
We want our cake and we want to eat it too .
So where does this leave us ?
Well , depending upon your point of view , either you ’ve just wasted a chuck of your time reading this or your perspective is a little bit broader than it was earlier .
As I stated at the beginning , if we ’re ever going to understand why we ’re frozen in place while our country is carted off piece by piece , we need to throw conventional wisdom out the door and look for alternative explanations .
Every time I devote some time examining this question , I find myself falling deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole .
One link leads to another which leads to another which leads to another .
But I do have some ideas I ’d like to share with you next time .
How do you disempower a corrupt system ?
By empowering yourself .
How do you awaken a sleeping population ?
By awakening yourself .
How do you heal a toxic society ?
By healing yourself .

I wish to address one housekeeping item .
There have been requests for me to include web links in my articles and I ’ve made a deliberate and conscious decision not to .
If you think about it for a moment , bibliographies , footnotes and web links are all intended to validate and legitimize the writer .
All of the ideas and concepts I ’ve discussed in this article can easily be found and I urge you to do so .
Just be prepared to be snowed under .
But I resist leaving a trail of bread crumbs for a number of reasons , one of which is primary and explained below .
There is no doubt in my mind that my biggest and most exciting discoveries and insights came from unexpected clicks of the mouse .
More than a few times I ’d start an evening of research with a specific subject in mind .
But after a few clicks of the mouse , I ’d quickly find myself deep in the weeds and far off the beaten path .
I would rarely make it back to my original destination and that was just fine with me .
If the reader really is interested in exploring further , the journey must be entirely yours and yours alone .
I ’ve found that when venturing off the beaten path ( and I assure you the answers are way off the consensus reality path ) it ’s best if you find your own way .
My hope is that whatever you learn be yours , from your own hand , your own research , irrefutable in your mind and thus immensely valuable and indispensible to you .
The purpose of the journey is not the destination but the journey itself .
Each trip is unique and your experience is a product of the path you take .
I ’ve studied the Masters long enough to see the wisdom in their methods so I ’ll simply repeat what they teach .
I ’ll point you in the right direction but the rest is up to you .
Stay tuned for part 2 of this exploration , coming to a theater near you .
Alexander Lebedev , a Russian billionaire and former KGB agent , has bought one of Britain 's major newspapers , The Independent .
Lebedev , who also owns Britain 's Evening Standard , bought the money - losing The Independent and its companion paper , The Independent on Sunday , for 1 British pound , The Guardian newspaper reports .
The Independent started almost 25 years ago as a quality paper that was not tied to a political party or ideology .
Lebedev has agreed to pay about $ 14 million over the next 10 months to take on the paper 's future liabilities , The Independent said in announcing the sale .
The Times of London has reported that Lebedev , who earned his billions in the energy , media , banking and transportation sector in Russia , worked as a KGB spy at the Russian Embassy in London in the 1980s .

TULSA , Okla . —
It was “ Pretty Woman ” without the Hollywood ending .
A Manhattan real - estate developer tried to save a wayward escort — à la Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the popular 1990 film — by giving her more than $ 100,000 to start a new life .
Instead , he get conned , as she took the money but went back to her old tricks , he claims in a suit filed last week in Manhattan Supreme Court .
Robert Brot , 57 , says he met Lindsey DeLeon , 26 , on a dating Web site in October 2008 , fell in love and wanted to marry her .
He knew she had two kids , was deep in debt and had turned to stripping and escort work to make ends meet , the lawsuit says .
But the divorced father of two — who runs the multimillion - dollar development firm the J Companies with his brother — wanted to help her .
“ He ’s got a really big heart , and he intended to help rescue her , ” said his lawyer , Andrew Miltenberg .
“ He fell in love with a woman , and he thought he was helping her turn her life around . ”
But unlike those of the call girl with a heart of gold played by Roberts , DeLeon ’s intentions were driven by greed alone , the suit charges .
“ She had other ideas for him and his money , ” Miltenberg said .
Brot helped her move here from Wyoming so they could live together .
He also agreed to pay for her to go to school so she could build a career in real estate .
The understanding was that she ’d repay him once she was earning money on her own , the suit says .
“ She ’s ridiculously sweet , ” said a source who knows her .
“ That ’s how she gets her way . ”
At first , DeLeon did what she knew best — landing a job as a stripper and doing escort work on the side to pay off her debt to him , Brot said .
Then , in February 2009 , she told him that she had to return home to Oklahoma to deal with a family issue and sort out a custody battle over her two kids , the suit says .
Brot agreed to pay for her to move back and even for an apartment there .
In March of last year , DeLeon got a job in Tulsa — as a stripper , according to the suit .
A concerned Brot told her that if she married him , he would waive the debt .
She replied that she would think about it and agreed in the meantime not to go back into the escort trade , the suit alleges .
But by July , she was selling herself again , he learned .
This time , he turned his back on her , the suit says .
In an online erotic - services ad at Cityvibe.com featuring pictures of DeLeon , the description reads : “ Sweet Southern Redhead with Natural DDD’s . ”
“ I am a young , vivacious , sweet redhead with a VERY naughty side , ” the ad reads .
In all , Brot says , he forked over $ 118,061 to DeLeon during their brief affair — $ 105,380 of which she still owes him .
He is suing for the return of the outstanding loan plus interest and legal fees .
DeLeon , reached last night by The Post , would only say , “ I was not aware of the lawsuit .
I ca n’t comment before talking to my attorney . ”
She declined to say if she had ever worked as an escort .
What is known is that she pleaded guilty in 2007 in Oklahoma to writing bogus checks and was ordered to pay $ 4,500 in restitution .
Still , a Tulsa relative defended DeLeon and called Brot a bitter , “ jilted ” lover .
“ There ’s so much more to this story , ” the relative said .
“ He ’s really angry .
I think he ’s jilted and trying to hurt her as much as he got hurt . ”
Miltenberg countered that Brot only had the best intentions .
“ For Robert , it was a real relationship , ” the lawyer said .
“ The guy got his heart broken .
He really got taken in . ”

A building housing a head shop in North Frederick Street , Dublin , was damaged by fire last night .
The alarm was raised shortly before 9.30 pm .
The Dublin Fire Brigade was quickly on the scene and brought the blaze under control .
It is believed the small fire started in the front of the Happy Hippy shop , causing minor damage .
A garda technical examination is to be carried out later to determine what caused last night 's fire .
Meanwhile , Fine Gael Health Spokesperson James Reilly has suggested that an amendment be placed in the Finance Bill to legally require head shops to have a licence to operate .
Deputy Reilly said the Bill to deal with the regulation of head shops was expected to be put before the House next month and to be made law by June .
He said this would be a satisfactory short - term measure to deal with the problems of head shops .
He also said the Minister for the Environment could introduce a regulation around opening times .
The Taoiseach said if the legislation was coming as fast as the Deputy had envisaged , it would be best to deal with it in the primary legislation on the issue .
One of the great benefits of owning a kegerator is tinkering with and modifying it .
One of the most popular modifications is to add an additional tap or two .
To modify your kegerator to dispense additional beers , you will need to split your CO2 lines .
You will probably want more than one tap on hand , so your kegerator can dispense from sanke kegs , soda or Cornelius kegs , or whatever keg may appear at your doorstep .
Splitting your CO2 lines can be as simple as a t - joint or as complicated as a multi-tap regulator for dispensing different beers at different pressures .
We will look here at the kits and equipment currently available on the market and processes for modifying you kegerator for dispensing any kind of beer from commercial to home and craft brew .
For adding a quick extra beer tap onto your kegerator , a stainless steel or plastic t- or cross joint will do the job of splitting the CO2 to the different kegs – but gas leakage may occur if your keg tap is n’t maintained properly .
This is the most inexpensive way of splitting your CO2 line , and all you will need is the appropriate taps for the beer you want to dispense , surgical tubing , hose clamps , and of course the kegs of beer .
Adding an inline valve will even make it so that you can minimize gas wastage when changing kegs .
The T - splitter will cost you less than $ 5 and the inline valve probably less , and you can find for these items online or at your local hardware store in the plumbing section .
Aquarium supply stores may also have the fittings .
You will still need beer taps – more on that later
A more refined approach to splitting CO2 lines is the use of a gas distributor .
These units have one gas in and multiple gas outs to facilitate multi tap kegerator modifications .
The gas distributor has valves for each of the line - outs , and you can use a gas distributor to split your gas out in multiple directions .
Gas distributors are available in a number of configurations .
Two way gas distributors cost roughly $ 40 , while the larger multi tap distributors with 6 - 8 line - outs can cost $ 120 or more .
For a draft beer system that requires dedicated individual pressures for different beers , a secondary regulator panel or a dual body CO2 regulator is necessary .
This is very advanced stuff most people need not go into this much detail , but these units will cost upwards of $ 150 just for the regulator panel , the price depending on how many regulators you need , or $ 120 and up for a dual body CO2 regulator .
If you want to force carbonate your beer while dispensing beer from the same unit , a secondary regulator panel or dual body CO2 regulator may be the modification you want to make to your kegerator .
One factor to keep in mind when splitting your kegerator ’s CO2 line is that your operating pressure will decrease depending on the length of tubing you use .
When long lengths of tubing are used , the tubing expands and makes it difficult to keep the CO2 pressure at a constant rate .
The same also goes for beer lines .
If you cannot avoid having a long - draw system , you will need to use certain materials for the majority of the draw in order to ensure optimum beer quality and cleanliness .
You should strive to have no longer than six feet of regular surgical tubing from CO2 canister to keg , or 12 feet of beer lines all together from between keg and faucet .
Although there are some exceptions , long - draw systems still push beer from the keg via CO2 .
The standard flexible surgical tubing is used , but coupled with a special “ barrier tubing ” soon after leaving the keg .
Barrier tubing is thicker than regular surgical tubing and has a mesh cover , which keeps the vinyl tubing from expanding and causing CO2 pressure irregularities .
With the use of a tubing flare tool , you can create your own stainless steel tubing for your beer lines as well , which are by far the most durable and cleanest options , although they are harder to build and modify .

Belarus is a European country — pop. 9.85 m — that most folks would have difficulty finding on a map .
( It ’s on the western border of Russia . )
It ’s not a place you ’d expect to find a top - flight custom motorcycle designer , but a Belarusian machine won the Best Streetfighter trophy at the last Custombike show in Germany .
And that same bike has just won the Best International Builder award at the Verona expo in Italy .
The bike is called DUster and it ’s from YSC , a name to look out for in the future .
Owner Yuri Shif has created a very original look — baroque is the word that springs to my mind — using a Ducati Monster engine and transmission .
The frame , bodywork and swingarm suspension are Shif ’s own creations and the front fork is a modified Showa item .
Custom perimeter brakes give the wheels a clean profile .
It ’s to Shif ’s huge credit that he has achieved success in a country without a mainstream custom culture , and without a huge network of parts designers and suppliers .
DUster will no doubt be heading Stateside soon : what kind of reception do you think the radical styling will get ?
Check the Bike EXIF Facebook page for more just - released studio shots of DUster .
Mayawati will receive more money garlands , supporters say ( Photo : Krishan Saith )
Controversial Indian politician Mayawati has been given a second garland made entirely of money , this time worth 1.8 m rupees ( $ 39,000 ) .
Her party says she will now be given money garlands wherever she goes .
The move follows criticism of Ms Mayawati for accepting a garland of 1,000 - rupee notes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on Monday .
Ms Mayawati , who champions the cause of the poorest of the poor , is criticised for amassing vast personal wealth .
She is India 's first woman Dalit ( formerly " untouchable " ) chief minister and has a huge following among those at the bottom of the Hindu caste system .
She has spoken many times about her ambition to be prime minister of India but was dealt a setback in general elections last year .
' Defiant '
The latest garland was put around Ms Mayawati 's neck at a meeting in the city of Lucknow , capital of Uttar Pradesh state which she governs .
" We today [ Wednesday ] presented another garland of 1.8 m rupees to the party supremo collected by party units in all 18 divisions in the state , " state minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui told Reuters news agency .
" Wherever she goes , she will henceforth be greeted with garlands of notes and not with garlands of flowers , " he was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India .
Photographs of Ms Mayawati receiving the garland on Wednesday were shown on television channels in India .
On Monday supporters gifted her a garland estimated to have cost between $ 400,000 and $ 2 m .
Ms Mayawati's actions are a defiant response to her critics , the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says .
In the past few years , she has amassed massive personal wealth , throwing lavish birthday parties and accumulating diamond jewellery .
She has also been taken to court for commissioning massive statues of past Dalit icons and herself at great public expense .
Ms Mayawati 's critics accuse her of wasting precious government funds in one of India 's most backward states .
Uttar Pradesh has soaring crime , poor health services and very high illiteracy rates .

We must stop this flawed policy of dividing people up into ethnic minorities and embrace the vision of One People , One Destiny .
Multiculturalism promotes an ideal of segregation not integration or engagement .
It robs people of a common shared destiny as Australians .
It robs me of my identity as an Australian .
We can appreciate and acknowledge our respective heritage and beliefs as long as it does not conflict with the values of our liberal democracy .
I always believed that being Australian is not a race but an attitude .
It is about having and believing in a set of shared values .
It is a civic rather than an ethnic conception of nationhood .
I was born in Sri Lanka and my story , like most migrant stories , is a tale of access to opportunity .
My family escaped the ravages of war to seek a better life in Australia .
The fact that I was born in Sri Lanka makes me , in many people 's eyes , a Sri Lankan .
But I am an Australian .
Period .
And proud of it .
I do not believe in hyphenated nationalities .
Why do I need to defend my Australianness in my own country ?
In Europe , where I am based , all my friends consider me as an Aussie .
Never once did they ask : " So where are you really from ? "
In fact they 've anointed me Australia 's de facto ambassador to Europe .
Let me use an example .
I have a friend who was adopted , and she says that " her mother and the woman who gave birth to her are two different people " .
It is similar for me : the country that I was born in and my motherland are two different countries .
Australia is my motherland .
A good mate of mine once said : " Mate , you are more Aussie than Kath and Kim . "
We all have a heritage – I have a Saiva Tamil Hindu one – but it does not conflict with my identity as an Australian .
Whether your ancestry is from the British Isles or from the Dreamtime we should appreciate that .
But our nationality is Australian .
This is what unity in diversity means .
We all came to this country in different canoes but we are all in the same boat now .
The findings of a new Australian study , led by Dr Gomathi Sitharthan at the University of Sydney ’s Graduate Program in Sexual Health , have revealed that almost 70 percent of men and 30 percent of women are hooked to pornography online .
Noting that there are people who watch porn for up to 18 hours a day , Dr Sitharthan said : “ Viewing porn online becomes a major problem only when people become so preoccupied that they spend 16 to 18 hours a day doing nothing else but watching porn , with serious impacts on relationships , work , studies , and finance . ”
The researchers found that excessive viewing of porn , especially from an easily - accessible source like the Internet , can lead to family breakdowns , anxiety and depression .
However , since the issue is highly sensitive in nature , most of the porn addicts find it very difficult to come clean about it .
Though the number of porn addicts – including students , teachers , lawyers , health practitioners and even priests - reaching counseling centres for help has increased considerably , most people confess about their addiction only after a couple of counseling sessions .
The survey , which was conducted with the aim of finding out more about the extent of online porn viewing in Australia , has found that , other than counseling , there is hardly any other form of help available for people who are addicted to porn .

Even as California sinks under a massive budget crisis , the $ 8.7 million the state used to research the use of marijuana for medical purposes now seems money well spent .
The state - funded Center for Medical Cannabis Research at the University of California , San Diego has confirmed
that pot is effective in reducing muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain caused by certain neurological injuries or illnesses , according to a report issued Wednesday [ The New York Times ] .
In four clinical trials , participants suffering from multiple sclerosis , AIDS or diabetes , along with healthy volunteers injected with a chili pepper substance to induce pain , were randomly assigned to receive cigarettes filled with marijuana
[ The New York Times ] .
The researchers reported that not everybody who smoked marijuana felt better -- but a substantial percentage of those who were in pain said they felt better , and the figure was comparable to the percentage of people who experienced relief after taking other pain medications .
" I think that clearly cannabis has benefits , " said Dr. Donald I. Abrams , a San Francisco oncologist who led that study .
" This substance has been a medicine for 2,700 years ; it only has n't been a medicine for 70 " [ Los Angeles Times ] .
The federal government currently views marijuana as an illegal substance with no medical value -- but this unusual set of studies sanctioned by California could cause lawmakers to question that categorization .
Said State Senator Mark Leno :
" This is the first step in approaching the ( U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) , which has invested absolutely nothing in providing scientific data to resolve the debate " [ San Francisco Chronicle ] .
The state 's voters approved medical marijuana in 1996 ( 13 other states have since passed similar laws ) , and California has fairly open rules for who is eligible for medical marijuana .
Anyone who can get a doctor to write a recommendation , based on just about any medical condition , can buy marijuana in California [ Wall Street Journal ] .
Doctors who conducted the study , however , noted that people who smoke pot must be mindful of what they are inhaling .
They pointed out that inhaling any smoke brings potential cardiovascular risks , and also mentioned that their patients reported some mild side effects , including dizziness .
The results of the study come at a time when further funding for the program seems unlikely because of California 's budget crisis .
But a
California ballot measure that would attempt to legalize the drug ’s use by adults 21 and older is likely to come to a vote later this year [ Wall Street Journal ] .

HIROSHIMA vs.. DETROIT -- 64 years later -- Who Won the War ?
It was a picture that shocked viewers around the world : a Chinese toddler chained to a post outside a shopping centre in the freezing Beijing winter .
However , behind the image of two - year - old Jingdan lies a tale not of intentional cruelty but , it seems , one of misplaced love and fear : his sister disappeared from the same spot just two weeks ago .
" I was afraid I would lose him too , " their father , Chen Chuanliu , said today .
Four - year - old Jinghong has not been seen since 22 January , when Chen left her playing with friends while he worked .
Although Beijing is generally regarded as safe , he , like nearby residents , believes she has been abducted .
Tens of thousands of children go missing each year in China ; most are the offspring of impoverished migrant workers like Chen , snatched and then sold on for anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand pounds .
Officials have warned that the problem is on the rise .
Boys are often sold to families desperate for an heir ; girls can be reared as future brides for rural men .
Both sexes are taken for labour or to beg for gangs , say experts .
The problem has grown so acute that authorities have launched a campaign to crack down on child trafficking .
Last year they created a national DNA database to reunite families and a website featuring the photographs and details of rescued children .
Officials say they have saved around 2,000 children and returned at least some to their parents .
But Chen has little hope of reunion .
" It will be hard to find my daughter because I do n't have a photo , " he said– the family could not afford one .
" The police did n't tell me anything – I do n't know whether they have opened a case or not .
They just told me to look around the area myself . "
Officers told local media this week that they were looking for Jinghong and were obtaining footage from surveillance cameras – well over a week after her father urged them to do so .
The Guardian 's calls rang unanswered .
" The police said they saw [ the surveillance footage ] , but I 'm not sure if they really did or not , " he said .
" I think the most valuable time for watching it was right after she went missing . "
Chen is not an expressive man .
When asked about Jinghong it was several minutes before he began to speak : " Her hair is messy , like mine , and quite short .
She has a scar on her forehead .
Her face is not round , but sort of egg - shaped , and she is about the height of this table .
" But kidnappers could change her clothes and clean her hair so she looks quite different . "
Her birth was particularly precious because he and his wife were already in their late thirties .
He supported the family by driving a motorcycle taxi , making 50 yuan ( £ 4.60 ) a day .
His wife , Yang Caihong , has learning disabilities and is unable to care for the children , and the couple have no relatives in the city .
Although the family have lived in Beijing for years , China 's household registration system means they are still regarded as migrants and – unlike official residents – not entitled to free nursery care .
So , from the age of just 40 days , Jinghong was taken to the shopping centre while her mother collected scrap there to sell to recyclers .
Chen tried to keep an eye on his children between fares , but people in the area worried .
They bought milk and snacks to feed them up and returned Jinghong to her parents if she strayed .
" She was a very brave little girl – she dared to do all kinds of things .
I think that was why she [ could be ] taken away , " said Mr Zhang , a resident who believes she was abducted .
This week 's publicity has led to a potential offer of free care at a private kindergarten for her little brother , Jingdan .
" This boy was noticed because of the locked chain , " a local official told reporters .
" But in fact there are many little children from migrant families roaming around in Beijing . "
Over the years I have used a whole bunch of Music Libraries , streaming programs , download tools , websites and formats for maintaining a way of listening to music I liked and as good as they have all been , not a single one has been perfect .
I am currently with Spotify , which is the current best ( or I would n’t be with it ) that I have seen , which is good for its simplicity , range of available songs which are stream - able and ultimately is currently cleaning up because it was early to jump to a new model for music sales .
Give it a few years and most of the media we used to pay for on disks , tapes , digital download will be streamed to us ( or streamcached ) – its a way the industries can move forward with technology instead of battling it and millions and millions of pirates .
Games , tv , films , music will all become services fed to whatever technology we want them fed too , putting the control of the flow of data back in the hands of the owners , reaffirming ownership laws and creating a new dynamic between creative arts and media consumption .

This I think is a given at this point , but anyway .
I wanted to write this post to put down some ideas I have had recently after I started using a few new music services .
So this really is just an idea dump more than anything ( if you have n’t a lot of time just JUMP TO THE IDEAS and perhaps you can tell me what you think in a comment ! )
If I had intentions to move into music software perhaps I would write something along these lines , but to be honest I would prefer if Spotify or similar invested some of their first few years profits and did it :p
So the best thing about switching the model up on music ?
Well it does make piracy less of an issue by charging a fairer rate ( e.g. Spotify is £ 10 a month here ) for a better service – it does n’t eliminate it but it makes a step towards a feeder / reciever relationship which takes back control slightly .
But really as long as the music is good the listeners do n’t care about that money / buying / business part of the affair , all they ( or rather we ) want is to have access to listen to the music we want , when we want it , where we want it so we can enjoy it without concern of the business , this is why subscription is the right way if you ask me – although I would n’t be surprised if other dynamic / hybrid models pop up .
What else is good ?
Well it takes the files off of your computer , which on the front of it seems like an instant win because you save some space and do n’t have to worry about hardware failure , but really its a lot better than that .
It separates that management process from the whole business of collecting music , you can effectively manage and listen too a music collection from your home , phone , work , friends house , web cafe , wherever you can get access .
All this is great and currently available in Spotify , but ultimately the best thing about this new model we are adopting is the data , and that it is all in the cloud .
It ’s this data that could take the experience of music to a whole new level .
CD ’s , Tapes and other redundant media allowed for a start at this – Top of the Pops for example provided a weekly countdown of the most sold song ’s – but with the music service coming direct from the cloud there is nothing stopping you moving this too a whole new level .
Top of the NOW
Top of the Minute , Hour , Day , Week
Top of the Mondays , Tuesdays , Wednesdays
Top of the Month , Quarter , Year , Decade , Century
This allows people to listen to music in a whole new way .
Spotify and some websites do process this data and this kind of breakdown is pretty much all available now .
Breaking down this data can also globally create billions of niche statistics .
From Top Rock Track of 27th of February 2010 to Most overall listened too blue grass album this week .
Now this is no small amount of data and visually defining a GUI or a system to easily transverse the breadth of options without drowning the user would be a challenge .
One I think that can be pieced together using the combination of search technology , social media and a little bit of flair .

My idea ’s for a new way to listen to music ?
Granted a few of the below ideas are amalgamations of current systems but nethertheless they would still improve my experience as a music consumer .
( Broken up in no particular order just to make them more readable !!!)
Simpler listening – playlists are good , as is the capacity to play a specific song , but 75 % of the time you just want a mood of music ( see below )
– playlists are good , as is the capacity to play a specific song , but 75 % of the time you just want a mood of music ( see below )
Switch playlists with streams – playlists serve a purpose but we are now superceding limits , jumping boundaries – we should be listening to streams of songs not finite lists
– playlists serve a purpose but we are now superceding limits , jumping boundaries – we should be listening to streams of songs not finite lists
With all that data music providers should be doing more – Top of the NOW for example
for example A more linked architecture – Elements such as bands , band members , albums , tracks , tempos , instruments , dates , geo-location data could all be better linked and presented
– Elements such as bands , band members , albums , tracks , tempos , instruments , dates , geo-location data could all be better linked and presented With a better architecture you could have things such as “ Awards ” for “ Best indy band of the week ” etc. awarded to each band
Music will progress socially – and this should be addressed by the software we use to listen to it , not “ facebook ” for music fyi
– and this should be addressed by the software we use to listen to it , not “ facebook ” for music fyi Social listening – capacity for relational data , friendship links , follows / subscriptions , groups and fans
– capacity for relational data , friendship links , follows / subscriptions , groups and fans Friend stream following – listen in realtime to the same stream of music
– listen in realtime to the same stream of music Global digital DJ’ing – allow for digital concerts and DJ sets , democratisation of music selection presentation
– allow for digital concerts and DJ sets , democratisation of music selection presentation Shared streams – communities could vote on songs to create streams of genre or other element specific music
– communities could vote on songs to create streams of genre or other element specific music Rivers via Stream merging – 10 friends could merge their party streams to create a river of music , perfect for a house party and not complicated or time consuming
Song UX – band , artist management – A better system to allow artists / bands / label ’s to manage the user experience of a listener when they are listening to their track
– band , artist management – A better system to allow artists / bands / label ’s to manage the user experience of a listener when they are listening to their track WikiMusic – band / artist tributes , photo ’s , fan art , tributes etc. could be cooperatively uploaded by the supporting community
– band / artist tributes , photo’s , fan art , tributes etc. could be cooperatively uploaded by the supporting community VOIP karaoke – integration of audio back up the stream could produce some interesting options such as remote karaoke sessions
– integration of audio back up the stream could produce some interesting options such as remote karaoke sessions New and Hot – catch up service – see whats hot with your friends that you have never listened to before
– catch up service – see whats hot with your friends that you have never listened to before MixTapes – A classic gift perhaps for the lazy or late thinker , either way the idea could be sound – create a time specific stream of music and save it forever / share / send it
– A classic gift perhaps for the lazy or late thinker , either way the idea could be sound – create a time specific stream of music and save it forever / share / send it Streamchat – while listening to certain artists , songs , streams , rivers a chat room could enhance the experience
Intermission management – I saw this as an idea for a software on dragons den years ago – I still cant believe no music player can mix between songs automatically and well
With the architecture of society built into the music system this would allow for some really fantastic developments – these are just a few of my idea ’s on the subject and I am sure there ’s a whole lot more that can be effectively mined from the music consumption data or added to the gui’s of the systems we use to feed our ears to enhance the overall experience .
I think as we move forward with the consumption of media a better intelligence will drive an ever evolving , improving experience which will allow humans to take hold of media in a more fluid , social way for their own enjoyment .
I also think that the majority of the ideas here would work for video based media as well and I look forward to the day where we have an integrated social multimedia experience .
Watching Dr. Who on iPlayer ?
why not watch it together with your friend who ’s living across the world and have a chat about it ?
– no literally – why not ?
CA Felony Marijuana Cases Tossed Out
In California , felony marijuana cases are being tossed out of court because of a gray area in the law .
How much medical marijuana is too much ?
The question has stumped police , prosecutors and defense attorneys after a recent Supreme Court ruling , the Associated Press reports .
The high court struck down a state law that imposed an 8 - ounce limit and instead entitled patients to a " reasonable " amount of the drug to treat their ailments .
As a result , medical marijuana cases have been tossed out because no one can say confidently the exact amount of medical marijuana patients may legally possess .
That has left California 's marijuana policy in a gray area and made the law harder to enforce .
Law enforcement officials have complained about being stuck in the middle while some prosecutors have backed away from felony marijuana cases .
Defense attorneys have argued against clear - cut limits that would allow a strict interpretation of the law .
The onus of cracking down on medical marijuana laws also has been put on states by the federal government , making it especially challenging .
The murky legal landscape may only become more confusing if state voters legalize marijuana under the Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 .
So far , there have been varying approaches from county for county in the way law enforcement is handling medical marijuana cases .
To clear up some of the confusion and develop guidelines , the Supreme Court has said a political push must come from state voters .
California voters legalized medical marijuana in 1996 but since then local law enforcement and federal authorities continue to wrestle how the laws should be upheld .
In 2006 , he and a team of collaborators began a survey of the metabolites of thalidomide .
William D. Figg of the National Cancer Institute purified them , and Dr. Vargesson and his colleagues tested them in chick embryos .
As they described in a report last year , they found that only one metabolite they tested , known as CPS49 , caused the chicks to fail to develop wings .
The scientists also noticed something else about CPS49 : within minutes of being injected into an embryo , it started killing developing blood vessels .
Dr. Vargesson and his colleagues proposed that the death of these new blood vessels stopped the limb bud from taking its final shape .
In a healthy embryo , patches of cells along its sides swell into buds that stretch out into arms and legs .
The proliferation of the cells triggers genes in the limb bud , which make proteins that sculpt the limb .
CPS49 , Dr. Vargesson argued , starves the limb , causing many cells to die .
The surviving cells do not get the proper signals and fail to develop .
This model could account for how thalidomide could have such a drastic effect on limbs without causing much damage elsewhere in the body .
Limbs develop relatively late , beginning about 23 days after the start of pregnancy .
An embryo exposed to thalidomide at that point would suffer damage to its limbs , Dr. Vargesson said , while the rest of it would suffer less damage because its blood vessels were already mature .
Even if Dr. Vargesson ’s model turned out to be right , it was missing some key pieces .
In order for thalidomide to do its damage , it must grab on to some particular kind of molecule in the embryo .
To find that target , Dr. Hiroshi Handa of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and his colleagues coated microscopic beads with thalidomide .
They then immersed the beads in various proteins .
As they report in the current issue of Science , a protein known as cereblon latched on tightly to the thalidomide .
“ We were very surprised , ” Dr. Handa said .
While scientists have identified scores of genes involved in the development of arms and legs , no one had ever suspected cereblon of playing a role .
In fact , no one was sure what cereblon did .
Some Dems walk plank with ' yes ' vote
The polarizing health care votes cast late Sunday will have a profound effect on reelection campaigns across the nation , leaving a host of House Democrats — and a few Republicans — to explain or defend a politically treacherous vote that could determine control of the House come November .
Some members of Congress will end up with primary challenges as a result .
Others may have signed their own political death warrant .

Here is POLITICO 's rundown of lawmakers whose reelection prospects have been significantly imperiled by their announced support of — or opposition to — health care reform .
The tough - district Democrats
The most immediate blowback from the votes will be felt by Democrats in marginal and conservative - minded districts .
They are now assured of being attacked as accomplices to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who is not especially popular in many of those districts .
Of these members , many are in their first or second terms , and their path to Washington was greased by strong Democratic years in 2006 and 2008 .
Now , however , their support for the health care bill will put them in an unfamiliar defensive posture in an already tough year , without a popular Democratic presidential nominee leading the ticket or a GOP majority to campaign against .
Members in this category include Reps. Harry Mitchell of Arizona , Chris Carney of Pennsylvania and Baron Hill of Indiana , each of whom was elected in the 2006 Democratic wave and represents a seat that George W. Bush carried twice .
And virtually every freshman Democrat who won a marginal district in 2008 will need to mount a vigorous explanation of the benefits of a " yes " vote - especially members like Reps .
Mark Schauer of Michigan and Dina Titus of Nevada , who won Republican - held seats .
Some veterans - among them nine - term Rep. Earl Pomeroy , who hails from solidly Republican North Dakota , and West Virginia Reps .
Alan Mollohan and Nick Rahall - will also feel the heat .
By the time the clock ticked down on the health care vote late Sunday evening , a handful of junior Democrats holding marginal seats had also cast ' yes ' votes that will be the staple of GOP attacks , including Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , Wisconsin Rep. Steve Kagen , Florida Rep. Ron Klein , and Illinois Reps. Bill Foster and Debbie Halvorson .
Two first - term women , however , stand out for being in extreme jeopardy : Florida Rep. Suzanne Kosmas and Colorado Rep. Betsy Markey , both of whom went from no on the November health care vote to yes in March and both of whom represent GOP - leaning seats that voted for presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 .
After Markey announced her support for the bill last week , the National Republican Congressional Committee immediately blasted out an e-mail labeling her " Betsy Margolies - Mezvinsky " - a reference to former Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies - Mezvinsky , who lost her seat in 1994 after taking a bullet for the party and casting a tough vote for President Bill Clinton 's budget .
Republicans are convinced a handful of vulnerable junior Democrats who have backed the economic stimulus , cap and trade and both health care bills - a roster that includes Ohio Reps .
Mary Jo Kilroy and Steve Driehaus , New Hampshire Rep. Carol Shea -Porter and Virginia Rep. Thomas Perriello - are imperiled by tripling down on an ambitious Democratic agenda that has n't been completely embraced by their competitive House districts .
" The biggest question for a Democrat in a swing district is , ' Are you independent of your party and your president ? ' " said Brad Todd , a GOP media consultant .
" And anyone who votes for this legislation is not seen as independent . "
Vic Fazio , a former California congressman who chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , said the key for vulnerable Democrats who backed Sunday 's bill was to highlight the benefits of the legislation - and vigorously respond to attacks .
" You have to be very aggressive .
You do n't sit back and allow the attack , " said Fazio .
" You have to make it the first thing and last thing to talk about . "
" Not everyone will have the intestinal fortitude to do it , " added Fazio .
" But every one of these members - including those who voted against [ the bill ] - will have to explain it to somebody . "
The switchers
Several Democrats in competitive seats will face tough questions about why they supported the bill after opposing it during the House 's first vote in November - a list that includes Kosmas , Markey and freshman Ohio Rep .
John Boccieri , who explained his vote in a news conference in front of the Capitol that was televised live on CNN .
On Saturday evening , the NRCC blasted out an e-mail to reporters with the header : " Dems Clap for Boccieri's Flip - Flop . "
" Members who switched from no to yes will really have the difficulty , " predicted Tom Davis , the former Virginia congressman who chaired the NRCC .
" I just think switching from no to yes makes you look like you were strong - armed . "
Larry Sabato , a University of Virginia political scientist , said those Democrats who went the other way - switching from yes in last fall 's health care vote to no on Sunday - will not be able to escape the heat , either .
Members in this category include Reps. Zack Space of Ohio and Michael Arcuri of New York , both of whom represent districts that voted for Bush twice .
" I 've listened to some of the flippers , and they have very good explanations for their change of heart .
Problem is , [ Sen . ]
John Kerry had a good explanation for his : ' I voted for it before I voted against it . '
Few voters are going to listen to their paragraph - length explanation , " said Sabato .
The upwardly mobile
For those Democrats running statewide in swing or conservative states , there is also risk of political fallout from the health care bill .
In Indiana , Rep. Brad Ellsworth , who is running for the Senate seat left open by the retirement of Sen .
Evan Bayh , is already coming under withering attack for his support for the health care bill .
Also bound to face sharp scrutiny for their votes in favor of the bill - though perhaps not as much as Ellsworth - are Reps .
Paul Hodes , running for the Senate in New Hampshire , and Kendrick Meek , running for the Senate in Florida .
According to a Public Policy Polling survey conducted this month , 42 percent of Florida voters said they supported the health care reform push , while 50 percent said they opposed it .
Republicans will have a harder time boxing in two House Democrats running for statewide office in conservative states who voted against the bill Sunday : Louisiana Rep. Charlie Melancon , who is running for the Senate , and Alabama Rep. Artur Davis , a gubernatorial candidate who was an outspoken backer of Barack Obama 's in 2008 .
The ' no ' votes
Lost in the focus on the political risk attached to supporting the health bill is the very real downside to voting no .
Arcuri , for one , lost the support of New York 's influential Working Families Party , which vowed not to allow him to run on its ballot line and said it would recruit an opponent to run against him in November .
Freshman Rep. Mike McMahon , another " no " vote who holds a Staten Island , N.Y. - based district that McCain won , is also facing the threat of losing the Working Families Party line .
The Service Employees International Union , meanwhile , has signaled that it is open to finding a primary challenger to McMahon ; and it's running a tough ad in the Staten Island Advance targeting the congressman 's vote .
Michigan Rep. Bart Stupak emerged as a " yes " vote after reaching a deal with the White House on Sunday afternoon .
But Stupak 's opposition to the bill 's treatment of abortion funding has already earned him a Democratic primary challenge from Charlevoix County Commissioner Connie Saltonstall , who last week won the backing of the National Organization for Women .
Democrats , for their part , are pledging to target a handful of potentially vulnerable Republicans from competitive seats over their opposition to the bill .
Last week , as the votes neared , the DCCC sent out a wave of press releases blasting GOP members including Washington Rep. Dave Reichert and California Reps. Mary Bono Mack and Dan Lungren .
The likelihood of success is much higher for another Republican who ranks high on the DCCC target list : Louisiana Rep .
Anh " Joseph " Cao , who voted against the bill despite holding a heavily Democratic , New Orleans - area seat that gave Obama 75 percent of the vote .
The tragic earthquake in Haiti has had me wondering about U.S. Sugar policy .
I should warn readers in advance that both Haiti and sugar policy are topics I know little about .
All I really know about Haiti is that it shares a history with many similarities to other struggling Caribbean islands , with roots in colonial sugar plantations , rum and slavery , only much , much worse .
And my knowledge of U.S. Sugar policy is somewhat superficial .
So , here 's the basics of U.S. sugar policy .
Like other agricultural policies , U.S. sugar policy got its start in 1934 during the Great Depression .
With prices of agricultural commodities ( and everything else ) plummeting , the government wanted to support prices in an effort to support farmers ' incomes .
After all , back then , a lot more of us were farmers , and unlike today , most farmers were poor .
A lot of what the government did back then , even if it had good intentions , probably did more harm than good .
People were hungry too , and one thing they did was destroy crops and limit agricultural production in an effort to support prices , which did n't help people to eat .
But these policies probably did help to support farm incomes .
And to some extent they still do .
But an important thing to realize is that sugar was different .
It was ( and is ) different from the other commodities because the U.S. imports a lot of it .
Thus , to support prices , the government did not need to limit domestic production as much as it needed to limit imports .
So , ever since the 1930s , the U.S. has supported a minimum price for sugar by placing a quota on the amount of sugar imports .
( Two short - lived exceptions were in the early 70s and early 80s , when world prices spiked and the quota was lifted . )
Restricting imports has kept domestic sugar prices higher and less variable than world prices , which has created considerable rents to the favored exporting nations with large quotas .
The price supports led to much greater domestic sugar production than there would have been otherwise , a lot of it around the Everglades in Florida , with some significant environmental problems as a consequence .
The quotas and price supports also spurred the development of corn syrup which could be made from domestically produced corn .
Here 's a picture showing U.S. and world sugar prices , adjusted for inflation : Europe has also supported sugar prices by limiting imports .
In fact , the support prices in Europe have been similar or greater than those in the U.S. Many of the Caribbean islands have been beneficiaries of this quota - generated largess , with other less or unfavored nations left to market their sugarcane at world prices , which could be as little as one - third U.S. and European prices .
But beginning in 2005 , Europe began winding down its sugar import restrictions .
This has caused production to decline in Europe and those Caribbean nations that had favored export status to Europe at their elevated prices .
It has also caused world sugar prices to rise .
While U.S. sugar policy is alive and well it is under increasing pressure , in part due to rising sugar prices , pressure from food producers , but probably also due to trade liberalization in Europe .
So what does all of this have to do with Haiti ?
Well , one of the most fascinating and tragic dichotomies is that between the Dominican Republic and Haiti .
By Caribbean standards , the Dominican Republic comparatively modern and wealthy while Haiti , in contrast , is one of Caribbean 's and world 's poorest nations .
Yet the Dominican Republic and Haiti share the same island .
The Dominican Republic also possesses the largest share of U.S. sugar quota , equal to well over 20 times that of Haiti's .
( See here And so I wonder : How much of the Dominican Republic 's success relative to that of Haiti has to do with the fact that it received a much larger share of the U.S. sugar quota ?
There 's probably not a clear answer to this question .
But it stands to reason that U.S. policy has at least something do with Haiti 's larger challenges , which have , in turn , made them so vulnerable to natural disasters .
Here is some background reading on sugar policy

Imagine holding the entire sun in the palm of your hand .
Now you can .
A new iPhone app developed by NASA - supported programmers delivers a live global view of the sun directly to your cell phone .
Users can fly around the star , zoom in on active regions , and monitor solar activity .
" This is more than cool , " says Dick Fisher , director of NASA 's Heliophysics Division in Washington DC .
" It 's transformative .
For the first time ever , we can monitor the sun as a living , breathing 3 - dimensional sphere . "
[ image - 78 ]
The name of the app is " 3D Sun " and it may be downloaded free of charge at Apple 's app store .
Just enter " 3D Sun " in the Store 's search box or visit http://3dsun.org for a direct link .
Realtime images used to construct the 3 - dimensional sphere are beamed to Earth by the Solar - Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) , a pair of spacecraft with a combined view of 87 % of the solar surface .
STEREO -A is stationed over the western side of the sun , while STEREO - B is stationed over the east .
Together , they rarely miss a thing .
Telescopes onboard the two spacecraft monitor the sun in the extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
" That 's why the 3D sun looks false - color green , " explains Lika Guhathakurta , STEREO program scientist at NASA Headquarters .
" These are not white - light images . "
That 's okay because EUV is where the action is .
Solar flares and new sunspots shine brightly at these wavelengths .
EUV images also reveal " coronal holes , " vast dark openings in the sun 's atmosphere that spew streams of solar wind into the solar system .
Solar wind streams that hit Earth can spark intense displays of Northern Lights .
" With this app , you can spin the sun , zoom in on sunspots , inspect coronal holes -- and when a solar flare erupts , your phone plays a little jingle to alert you ! " says Guhathakurta .
Indeed , many users say that 's their favorite part -- the alerts .
The app comes alive on its own when the sun grows active or when interesting events are afoot .
For example , a recent alert notified users that a comet just discovered by STEREO - A was approaching the sun .
When the comet was destroyed by solar heating , the app played a movie of Comet STEREO 's last hours .
[ image - 59 ]
Another remarkable aspect of the app is that it shows the far side of the sun -- the side invisible from Earth .
" This means sunspots cannot take us by surprise , " Guhathakurta points out .
Recently , STEREO - B was monitoring a far side sunspot ( AR1041 ) when the sunspot 's magnetic field erupted .
For the first time in almost two years , an active region on the sun produced a strong " M - class " solar flare .
The unexpected interruption of the sun 's deep solar minimum was invisible from Earth , but anyone with the 3D Sun had a ringside seat for the blast .
3D Sun was created by a team of programmers led by Dr. Tony Phillips , editor of Science@NASA .
He says that version 1 of the app is just the beginning .
Soon - to - be released 3D Sun 2.0 will offer higher - resolution images and multiple extreme ultraviolet wavelengths ( preview ) .
These additions will reveal even more solar activity than before .

Bets by some of the same banks that helped Greece shroud its mounting debts may actually now be pushing the nation closer to the brink of financial ruin .
Echoing the kind of trades that nearly toppled the American International Group , the increasingly popular insurance against the risk of a Greek default is making it harder for Athens to raise the money it needs to pay its bills , according to traders and money managers .
These contracts , known as credit - default swaps , effectively let banks and hedge funds wager on the financial equivalent of a four - alarm fire : a default by a company or , in the case of Greece , an entire country .
If Greece reneges on its debts , traders who own these swaps stand to profit .
“ It ’s like buying fire insurance on your neighbor ’s house  you create an incentive to burn down the house , ” said Philip Gisdakis , head of credit strategy at UniCredit in Munich .

When a home energy audit pays
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government is expected to unveil a new program in the next couple of months that if approved may reimburse homeowners for up to half the cost of making their homes more efficient , but do n't start shopping for new kitchens just yet .
Homeowners will get the most return for the money in simple upgrades like caulking the windows , putting insulation in the attic , and changing the light bulbs - not new windows , refrigerators or dishwashers .
What 's on the table
The average American home wastes a lot of energy .
A complete energy retrofit - which could include caulking and insulation as well as new windows , appliances and boiler , could slice a home 's energy consumption in half , according to Lane Burt , manager of building energy policy at Natural Resources Defense Council .
But getting all that work done might run into the tens of thousands of dollars .
And any new federal program - which is still being drafted and is not guaranteed to become law - would cap the government reimbursements at $ 12,000 , said Burt .
Homeowners need not despair .
There are some simple improvements that are relatively cheap and can pay for themselves quickly .
Just adding the insulation , caulking and lights might run an average homeowner $ 5,000 to $ 7,000 , he said .
That could shave about 30 % off a home 's energy bill each month .
And if the government picks up half the cost , the payback time for homeowners would be just a few years .
" It 's a win - win - win , " said Burt .
" It creates jobs , it saves energy , and it saves consumers money . "
Consumer watchdog groups back up Burt 's claim .
" I do n't know of anyone who 's looked at them and said they are not a good idea , " said Mark Cooper , director of research for the Consumer Federation of America .
" The average consumer can save a big chunk of change by getting the work done . "
What to look for
Experts say there are a few things to look for when getting an energy audit and retrofit work done .
First , find a contractor licensed by the Building Performance Institute or the Residential Energy Services Network .
These contractors have been trained to first test a home and see how much energy it is losing , then make renovations on all the systems in the building .
As of now there are no incentives in the proposed program for do - it - yourselfers .
That 's partly because the program is designed to create jobs by putting out - of - work contractors back on the job .
But it 's also done to ensure the work is done right - a house that 's sealed up too tight could rot from mold or trap too much carbon monoxide .
Second , hire an energy contractor using the same diligence you would with any other contractor .
Call around for price quotes and check references .
If you have any problems report them to your state 's attorney general .
The big picture
The proposed program is part of a broader jobs initiative designed first and foremost to put people back to work .
The original proposal , which called for $ 23 billion to be spent on energy retrofits , was estimated to create over half a million jobs , according to CleanEdison , an association of green building professionals .
Those familiar with the proposal say the final bill may set aside $ 10 billion for energy retrofits .
Still , it 's a lot more than is currently being done - while some states have reimbursement programs , there is no federal plan .
The original stimulus bill contained $ 5 billion for low income homeowners and money to retrofit federal buildings , but nothing for middle income Americans .
The new proposal has no income restriction .
But in addition to creating jobs and saving consumers money , it also lays the framework for an energy efficient economy and achieving the 80 % reduction in greenhouse gases most scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global warming .
That 's a target that can't be hit with building wind farms and solar plants alone .
Some 40 % of all energy used in this country goes to buildings , mostly in the form of heating , cooling and lighting .
" You do n't get an 80 % reduction by 2050 without retrofitting nearly every building in the country , " said Burt .

In the aftermath of the Copenhagen climate conference , those who defended the widely condemned outcome tended to talk about it as a “ step in the right direction ” .
This was always a tendentious argument , given that tackling climate change cannot be addressed by half measures .
We ca n’t make compromises with nature .
Bolivia , however , believed that Copenhagen marked a backwards step , undoing the work built on since the climate talks in Kyoto .
That is why , against strong pressure from industrialised countries , we and other developing nations refused to sign the Copenhagen Accord and why we are hosting an international meeting on climate change in Cochabamba , Bolivia , from April 19 to 22 , 2010 .
In the words of the Tuvalu negotiator , we were not prepared to “ betray our people for 30 pieces of silver ” .
Our position was strongly criticised by several industrialised countries , who did their brazen best to blame the victims of climate change for their own unwillingness to act .
However , recent communications by the European Commission have confirmed why we were right to oppose the Copenhagen accord .
In a report called International climate policy post -Copenhagen , the commission confirmed that the pledges by developed countries are equal to between 13.2 % and 17.8 % in emissions reductions by 2020 – far below the required 40 % - plus reductions needed to keep global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees celsius .
The situation is even worse once you take into account what are called “ banking of surplus emission budgets ” and “ accounting rules for land use , land use change and forestry ” .
The Copenhagen Accord would actually allow for an increase in developed country emissions of 2.6 % above 1990 levels .
This is hardly a forward step .
This is not just about gravely inadequate commitments , it is also about process .
Whereas before , under the Kyoto Protocol , developed countries were legally bound to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage , now countries can submit whatever targets they want without a binding commitment .
This dangerous approach to climate negotiations is like building a dam where everyone contributes as many bricks as they want regardless of whether it stops the river .
The Copenhagen Accord opens the dam and condemns millions .
Various estimates suggest that the commitments made under the accord would lead to increases of between three to four degrees celsius – a level that many scientists consider disastrous for human life and our ecosystems .
For Bolivia , the disastrous outcome of Copenhagen was further proof that climate change is not the central issue in negotiations .
For rich countries , the key issues in negotiations were finance , carbon markets , competitiveness of countries and corporations , business opportunities along with discussions about the political makeup of the US Senate .
There was surprisingly little focus on effective solutions for reducing carbon emissions .
President Evo Morales of Bolivia observed that the best way to put climate change solutions at the heart of the talks was to involve the people .
In contrast to much of the official talks , the hundreds of civil society organisations , communities , scientists and faith leaders present in Copenhagen clearly prioritised the search for effective , just solutions to climate change against narrow economic interests .
To advance an agenda based on effective just solutions , Bolivia is therefore hosting a Peoples ’ Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth on April 19 - 22 , and inviting everyone to participate .
Unlike Copenhagen , there will be no secret discussions behind closed doors .
Moreover the debate and proposals will be led by communities on the frontlines of climate change and by organisations and individuals dedicated to tackling the climate crisis .
All 192 governments in the UN have also been invited to attend and encouraged to listen to the voices of civil society and together develop common proposals .
We hope that this unique format will help shift power back to the people , which is where it needs to be on this critical issue for all humanity .
We do n’t expect agreement on everything , but at least we can start to discuss openly and sincerely in a way that did n’t happen in Copenhagen .

Convocatoria Asamblea de los Movimientos Sociales
Cochabamba , Bolivia , 19 de abril de 2010 , 10 h
Nosotras y nosotros activistas de diferentes movimientos sociales , caracterizamos el momento actual por la prepotencia de Estados Unidos , Unión Europea y las transnacionales , que se expresó en Copenhague cuando muy pocos países intentaron imponer un resultado , que no fue acordado en la COP 15 , de no hacer nada para detener el incremento de la temperatura del Planeta y el daño climático .
El incremento de la presencia militar y bases militares en diversas partes del mundo , invasiones y ocupaciones “ humanitarias ” indican que la guerra , la ocupación de mercados y territorios , la presencia militar para el control de recursos energéticos , el agua y la biodiversidad son parte de las estrategias de salida a la crisis civilizatoria del capitalismo y su lógica sacrificial , depredadora , racista y patriarcal que se disfraza en negociaciones ilegitimas en nombre de la crisis climática .
Nuestra respuesta está en lucha por el derecho de los pueblos a vivir bien en los territorios , contra las falsas soluciones a las crisis , contra la militarización como respuesta a la misma , contra las acciones de transnacionales que con la connivencia o apoyo de gobiernos o instituciones multilaterales como el Banco Mundial acaparan territorios para el monocultivo y para la privatización del aire y la creación de mercados especulativos de los llamados “ créditos de carbono ” .
En este sentido estaremos presentes en la Conferencia Mundial de los Pueblos sobre el Cambio Climático y los Derechos de la Madre Tierra .
Cochabamba donde organizaremos una Asamblea de los Movimientos Sociales en seguimiento a nuestros esfuerzos y articulaciones en la lucha , con una dupla tarea :
- debatir y organizar nuestro apoyo a las propuestas y iniciativas de los gobiernos comprometidos con los derechos de los pueblos y de la naturaleza ;
- debatir y organizar nuestra agenda como movimientos sociales para potencializar nuestras alternativas y resistencias a la expansión de las relaciones de mercado a todos los dominios de la relación entre las personas y de ellas con la naturaleza , la ofensiva de las transnacionales y de la militarización .

Invitation to the Assembly of Social Movements
Cochabamba , Bolivia , April 19 , 2010 , 10 am
We , activists of many diverse social movements , characterize this current moment as one of arrogance and authoritarianism on the part of the United States , the European Union and transnational corporations .
This was demonstrated in Copenhagen when very few countries tried to create an outcome that was in disagreement with the COP 15 , and did nothing to stop global warming and the climate crisis .
The increase of military presence and military bases in various parts of the world , “ humanitarian ” invasions and occupations which indicate war , the occupation of markets and territories , and the military presence to control energy resources , water , and natural biodiversity are all tactics derived from civilization ’s crisis of capitalism and the logics of exploitation , racism , and patriarchy .
These tactics also work to disguise the climate crisis in illegitimate negotiations .
Our response is to fight for the right of all people to live decent lives in their communities , against false solutions to crises , against militarization as a solution , and against the actions of transnational corporations .
These transnationals , with the support of governments or multilateral institutions like the World Bank , undermine national borders for the production of monocultures and for the privatization of air and the creation of speculative markets called “ carbon credits . ”
It is in this context that we present to the People ’s World Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth .
In Cochabamba we have organized an Assembly of Social Movements , a continuation of our efforts and articulations in the fight , with two goals :
- To discuss and organize our support of the proposals and initiatives of governments committed to the rights of people and the environment ;
- To discuss and organize our agenda as social movements to promote our alternatives and our resistence to the marketization of the relationship between people and between people and their environment — the offense of transnationals and militarization .

Convocation à l’Assemblée des Mouvements sociaux
Cochabamba , Bolivia , le 19 avril 2010 , 10 h
Nous , militants et militantes de divers mouvements sociaux , pensons que l’époque actuelle est marquée par la toute - puissance des Etats - Unis , la Union Européenne et des multinationales .
Ceci a été flagrant à Copenhague où très peu de pays ont essayé d’imposer un résultat en désaccord avec la COP 15 et rien n’a été fait pour arrêter le réchauffement climatique et la crise climatique .
L’augmentation de la présence militaire et des bases militaires dans différentes parties du monde , les invasions et les occupations ” humanitaires ” indiquent bien que la guerre , l’occupation des marchés et des terres , la présence militaire pour contrôler les ressources énergétiques , l’eau , la biodiversité sont des stratégies de sortie de la crise de civilisation du capitalisme et de sa logique déprédatrice , raciste et patriarcale .
Ces stratégies invoquent la crise climatique pour mener des négociations illégitimes .
Nous répondons en luttant pour le droit des peuples à bien vivre sur leur terre , contre les fausses solutions à la crise , contre la militarisation en tant que réponse à la crise , et contre les actions des multinationales .
Ces multinationales , avec l’appui des gouvernements ou des institutions multilatérales comme la Banque mondiale , accaparent des terres pour la monoculture , privatisent l’air et créent des marchés spéculatifs appelés “ crédits compensatoires du carbone ” .
Voilà pourquoi nous , les mouvements sociaux , serons présents à la Conférence mondiale des Peuples sur le Changement climatique et les Droits de la Terre - Mère , à Cochabamba où , dans la logique de nos travaux , nous organiserons une Assemblée des Mouvements sociaux sur deux axes :
- débat et organisation de notre soutien aux propositions et initiatives des gouvernements engagés dans la protection des droits des peuples et de la nature ;
- débat et organisation de notre programme en tant que mouvements sociaux
pour renforcer nos alternatives et notre résistance à l’expansion de la marchandisation des personne et de la nature , à l’offensive des multinationales et à la militarisation .

The world ’s lowest - cost refrigerator will be launched in March .
The bullock cart stops in one of the dusty alleys in Osnamabad , a small town in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra .
And two village girls , dressed in traditional Marathi Kasta Saree , step out in style with the products they have helped co-create with engineers at Godrej & Boyce .
The quality of the sales pitch of the Class 10 - pass girls would do an MBA proud .
For , they know the products well , as the company involved them right from the conception stage to designing and marketing its ‘ nano ’ refrigerators , named Chotukool ( Little Cool ) .
The refrigerators , which are being test marketed in a few towns in Maharashtra , are set for a nationwide commercial launch in March .
For Chotukool , the Godrej group has junked the traditional model of a proprietary channel with a sales force and a distributor - dealer chain and has joined hands with micro-finance institutions .
This new distribution ecosystem is just one of the unique experiments that Godrej is trying out to make a splash in the bottom of the pyramid refrigerator market .
There are many more .
Chotukool does not have a compressor .
It looks like a 43 litre cool box , which is loaded from the top , and can run on battery .
The refrigerator weighs only 7.8 kg , runs on a cooling chip and a fan similar to those used to cool computers .
Given the power shortage in the countryside , it also uses high - end insulation to stay cool for hours without power .
The operational cost is low : the refrigerator consumes half the power consumed by regular refrigerators .
But the clear winner is its cost .
At Rs 3,250 , it costs almost 35 per cent less than the cheapest category of refrigerators available in the market today .
Apart from involving village girls in selling the products at a commission of Rs 150 per product sold ( something that the company claims will reduce the distribution and marketing costs by 40 per cent ) , Godrej has gone in for several engineering innovations to keep the price low .
The size is small and the number of parts in Chotukool has been reduced to just 20 instead of 200 that go into regular refrigerators .
“ It ’s a reverse engineering of sorts , ” says G Sunderraman , vice president , corporate development , Godrej & Boyce .
Sunderraman says the idea to target the bottom of the pyramid customers was given shape at a workshop with Clayton M Christensen , Harvard University professor , best known for his ideas on disruptive innovation .
The idea discussed in the workshop was to involve villagers right from the design to selling of the product .
The company did that in right earnest ever since it unveiled the first prototype of Chotukool in September last year .
The product has gone in for several alterations after every little detail , including pricing and colour ( red and blue were the clear winners ) was discussed with a select group of villagers and micro-finance institutions .
The Godrej group is betting big on Chotukool .
“ It will certainly help us in overtaking competition , ” says Sunderraman .
The group lost its leadership position to Korean giants LG and Samsung and Whirlpool of the US a few years ago .
Godrej & Boyce is currently the fourth largest player in the over three million units market .
But analysts say the cheapest segment is not the largest selling category in refrigerators .
The largest selling category with over 50 per cent market share is the 160 to 170 litre size models priced at about Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,500 .
Hence , making Chotukool a success will be a long haul for the group , more so in a category which needs volumes to compensate for the ultra - thin margins .
But Sunderraman is unfazed .
“ We are trying to create a market segment which would evolve gradually .
Eventually , it should have a significant share of the market , ” he says .
In any case , Chotukool is bound to attract a huge new group of consumers in a country where fewer than one in five homes has a refrigerator .
It is also in tune with what Guru C K Prahalad has been saying for some time now — serving the poorest of the world can and should be good for business .
Prahalad would be happy with the inventiveness of the people connected with Chotukool .
Republicans are livid about the timing of Sen. Evan Bayh ’s ( D - Ind. ) retirement announcement .
They have at least four candidates in the upcoming primary while the Indiana Democratic Party will get to decide its nominee .
Indiana required nominating petitions to be filed by noon Tuesday .
Bayh announced Monday he would not seek reelection , giving would - be candidates less than 24 hours to get on the ballot .

Republicans have four candidates who made the deadline and a fifth whose signatures are being validated .
Democrats had no serious successor in position , given that Bayh had already his filed his nominating petitions and had $ 13 million in bank .
Because no Democrat was able to gather the 4,500 nominating signatures — 500 from each congressional district — the party ’s executive committee will meet in the next six weeks to decide on a nominee .
Cafe owner Tamyra d'Ippolito ( D ) , who was preparing to challenge Bayh in the primary , scrambled Tuesday to submit the required signatures , but she failed to meet the benchmark , according to officials .
On the Republican side , Rep. Mike Pence ( Ind. ) and Indiana Secretary of State Todd Rokita toyed with the idea of running but passed on the race while Bayh was the expected nominee .
Former Sen. Dan Coats Daniel ( Dan ) Ray CoatsFBI chief says Russia is trying to interfere in election to undermine Biden The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by The Air Line Pilots Association - Trump , Biden renew push for Latino support Former Intel chief had ' deep suspicions ' that Putin ' had something on Trump ' : book MORE ( R - Ind. ) , who made Tuesday ’s deadline , is considered the GOP favorite , but he has become an early Democratic target and faced criticism for his lobbying - client list .
Republicans have called on Bayh to ask for an extension of the filing deadline .
“ The reality and ramifications of this timing cannot , and should not , be ignored , ” National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn ( Texas ) said in a statement .
“ Assuming there is no qualified candidate that files the appropriate documentation before the deadline , Sen .
Bayh should call on the state Democratic Party to ask an Indiana court to extend the candidate filing deadline — both for this Senate candidacy and for any House candidacy that is left open by a Democrat House member who runs for the Senate nomination , ” Cornyn said .
“ Doing so would remove any appearance of unfair gamesmanship by the Democrats while affirming their belief that voters , and not party bosses , should be the final arbiters of elections . ”
Bayh ’s office referred all comments about a possible filing extension to the Indiana Democratic Party , which did not comment by deadline .
Former Rep. Lee Hamilton ( D - Ind. ) insisted Bayh was n’t trying to “ tilt ” the nomination process .
“ I take Evan at his word that he was wrestling with this decision for a while , ” he said .
“ These are very tough decisions to make . ”
Democratic strategists said the lack of a primary , while Republicans have a five - way battle raging , could be a boon .
“ We wo n’t have a primary .
They ’ve got a primary , and they ’ve got Republicans already attacking Coats and Coats having to fire back , " said Robin Winston , a Democratic strategist and former state party chairman .
Observers agreed that the Republicans do n’t have a white knight .
“ Coats has a big name recognition problem , ” said John Roos , a professor at the University of Notre Dame .
“ The fact that he ran statewide so long ago , he ’s going to have to refresh that memory .
He ’s going to have to spend a ton of money . ”
John Livengood , former chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party , said the Democratic nominee will have ample time to build campaign infrastructure .
“ I do n’t think that whoever ’s picked will end up starting out at a disadvantage , ” he said .
Some early buzz for Bayh 's replacement centers around state Senate Minority Leader Vi Simpson ( D ) and Reps. Baron Hill ( D ) and Brad Ellsworth ( D ) .
Ellsworth , who got the news Monday while touring his district , is open to the idea , aides said .
He ’s expected to hold a “ family discussion ” in the next few days to decide how to proceed .
“ The next step will be taking a few days to talk to my wife and to folks in Indiana about where I can best serve our state , ” he said in a statement Monday .
Ellsworth does n’t have a serious opponent for his House seat , but Hill could once again face ex-Rep.
Mike Sodrel ( R ) , which may influence his decision to run .
Some Democrats have grumbled that Bayh ’s late decision could give GOPers a leg up in the race , but the senator dismissed that criticism Tuesday .
" Those critics must not know my state very well , ” Bayh said on the CBS “ Early Show . ”
“ Hoosiers are very independent .
There are five Republicans running ; they 're going to have a vigorous primary .
I do n't know who their nominee will be .
And I am highly confident that we will have a candidate for the United States Senate who will be very competitive and have an excellent chance of winning this seat in November . "

A rare Beal ’s four - eyed turtle recently hatched at the Tennessee Aquarium .
According to aquarium herpetologist Enrico
Walder this tiny turtle should be treated as big news .
“ According to records this species of turtle can only be seen at three North American zoos or aquariums , and is listed as an endangered species .
This little turtle in Chattanooga may represent the first successful reproduction of Sacalia bealei in a North American institution , ” says Walder .
With more than 500 turtles representing 70 species , the Tennessee Aquarium exhibits more turtles than any other public facility in the world .
A clutch of three eggs was deposited around April 14th of this year , but only one of those eggs turned out to be fertile .
Upon hatching , the baby turtle weighed just 6 grams and was only 38 millimeters long .
There are only 18 known Beal ’s four - eyed turtles in public zoos and aquariums throughout the United States and Europe .
There are only seven males , five females and six of unknown sex including the one at the Tennessee Aquarium .
The Beal ’s four - eyed turtle gets its name from the ocelli or false eye markings on the back of the turtle ’s head .
These animals were once common throughout southern China but have seen significant declines in their population in recent years .
“ As with many Asian species the Beal ’s four - eyed turtle has been over collected for use in the Chinese food and traditional medicine trade , ” reports Walder .
Because this species has such a low reproductive rate it is doubtful they will ever return to the large numbers of Beal ’s turtles seen in the wild just a few decades ago .
An animal like the Beal ’s four - eyed turtle is considered endangered when the population of an organism is at risk of becoming extinct .
The World Conservation Union has calculated the percentage of endangered species as 40 percent of all organisms based on the sample of species that have been evaluated through 2006 .
A male Beal ’s four - eyed turtle can be seen in the Aquarium ’s “ Rivers of the World ” gallery located on the second level of the River Journey building .
The Tennessee Aquarium ’s newest turtle will be housed off exhibit to minimize stress and encourage feeding until it is hearty enough for public viewing .
The Dallas Zoo and the Charles Paddock Zoo in Atascadero , California are the only other public institutions with Beal ’s four - eyed turtles in their collections in the United States .
The Charles Paddock Zoo received their turtle from the Tennessee Aquarium .

Abstinence - only - until - marriage proponents hope that by misrepresenting the recent study on abstinence education they can continue getting funding for programs that have nothing in common with the single one that ’s been proven effective .
Big news last week for the “ sex is evil and should be
avoided ” crowd — big media organizations all over the country trumpeted
that abstinence - only education " works " .
Naturally , I was skeptical that the sex - phobes had actually
produced a curriculum that convinced young people to put off sex for the 15
years between the onset of puberty and getting married , and indeed , a quick
perusal of the story demonstrated that the program in question only delayed the
onset of sexual activity for 2 years for a percentage of the students .
As usual , by their own measurement ,
abstinence - only proponents were a miserable failure , and the 95 percent number
( that ’s the percent of Americans that have had premarital sex ) remains
unchanged .
But knowing as I do how much the religious right loves a bad
faith argument , I was also not surprised to see abstinence - only supporters
pretend that an utter failure to convince kids to wait until marriage was a
win for them .
Apparently , the
war on sex is a war of attrition and any reduction in orgasmic activity is a
plus in their book .
But upon
investigating the claims that the abstinence - until - marriage crew was “ right ” , I
found that their declarations of victory were even more dishonest than
usual .
Because the program
trumpeted by the anti-sex crew had no
relationship to the abstinence - until - marriage programs promoted by the
religious right and funded
under the Bush administration .
This successful program very narrowly taught a bunch of 6th
and 7th graders to wait until they were ready , accepting that for
the vast majority of them , “ ready ” is going to come before marriage .
“ Wait
until prom ” is a much different message than “ wait until marriage ” .
There was
no denouncing of contraception you get in the standard abstinence - only
curriculum , and in fact the teachers were told that if a student expressed
misinformation about condoms , that they were to correct them .
As
Jill Filipovic noted in the Guardian , “ In other words , the programme was
exactly what the abstinence portion of a good comprehensive sex-ed class would
look like . ”
Very few people in the comprehensive sex education camp
think that 12 - year - olds having sex is usually a good idea .
Most kids that age want the ability to
say no more than they want the right to say yes , and so crafting programs to
their needs is exactly the sort of thing a good sex educator should do .
But as Hanna
Rosin noted , it ’s silly to think that this approach will do much for 15 -
and 16 - year - olds whose sexual activity is far more likely to be exactly what
they want .
At best , what we’ve
learned is that teaching negotiation skills to say no is good for younger kids ,
and then older kids are probably still going to need and want sex-positive ,
medically accurate information , so that they sex they instigate on their own is
safer .
Since this program that worked openly flouted the
abstinence - only curriculum promoted by people like the executive director of
the National Abstinence Education Association , you ’d think that Valerie Huber
would oppose it .
But instead ,
Huber told
the New York Times that this is great news .
And was shockingly honest about why she ’d think that :
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

“ The current recommendation before
Congress in the 2011 budget zeroes out abstinence education , and puts all the
money into broader comprehensive education , ” Ms. Huber said .
“ I hope that
either the White House amends their request or Congress acts upon this ,
reinstating abstinence education . ”
So , in other words , she hopes that by misrepresenting this
study , she can get funding reinstated for programs that have nothing in common
with this single one that ’s been proven effective .
This should n’t be surprising at all — abstinence - only is big
business .
Lisa
Lerner at Politico wrote an interesting article demonstrating how politicians
seeking political gains among conservative supporters have cynically exploited abstinence - only
earmarks , and it ’s interesting to see in just examining Arlen Specter ’s
earmarks that are the beneficiaries of the funding .
The
Urban Family Council , which received more than $ 310,000 in earmarks in the
past , collected an additional $ 24,000 last year .
The group was founded by a
Philadelphia evangelical activist and is known for its aggressive efforts to
block benefits for gay partners of city employees .
A+ for Abstinence , a Christian program
that runs a website called coolvirginity.com , received $ 24,000 .
The program ,
according to the website , “ shares sexual purity in an innovative and
spiritually sound way that speaks directly to the hearts of young people . ”
Abstinence - only
money goes to anti-choice organizations , evangelical groups , and other
religious groups that then express their gratitude by reinforcing the message
the Jesus was a Republican .
Cutting abstinence - only funds hit the bottom line of these groups pretty
hard .
No wonder they want the
money back , enough that they ’re apparently willing to promote a study they
ideologically oppose in order to reopen that funding stream .
Not
that there ’s anything wrong with building up non-profits that rely on
government funds to do your work , of course .
The problem arises when the work you do is harmful and opposed to taxpayer wishes , and you
therefore misrepresent what you do in order to get your hands on the money .
Valerie
Huber has employed this strategy for a long time ,
characterizing abstinence - only in such a way that it sounds just like
good comprehensive sex education , while actually
supporting scare - ‘ em - lie - to - ‘ em - moralize - at -‘em ineffective , unethical
abstinence - until - marriage programs .
Call it the sex ed bait and
switch — the voters want comprehensive sex education that teaches kids skills
so they can delay sex if they want to , and Huber is happy to pretend that ’s what
she ’s selling if it keeps the funding flowing for the programs she wants .
If she ca n’t be honest , it ’s supposed
to be the media ’s job to call her out on the carpet , not give her a platform
from which she claim credit for effective programs she ’s seeking to demolish so
she can replace them her own ineffective , moralizing ones .

Cassava is a tropical root vegetable and staple crop for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa .
However , it ’s tricky to handle :
Once the root is removed from the ground , it spoils within one to three days , so farmers must get it to processing centers as soon as possible after harvesting it .
If they do n’t , the crop goes to waste .
A simple way to prolong cassava ’s shelf life could help farmers avoid that waste and sell their crop beyond their local region .
Paula Hammond , MIT professor of chemical engineering , and other scientists are now working on an innovative way to help them do that , using nanotechnology — technology that controls material at a molecular or atomic scale .
Their idea is to design a plastic storage bag lined with nanoparticles that would react with oxygen , preventing the roots ’ oxygen - induced rotting .
“ That would enable farmers to harvest and store and process at times convenient to them , ” says Hammond , who traveled to Kenya and Ghana last summer with an international group of scientists to meet with farmers and come up with new ways to improve agricultural efficiency .
It may seem odd to send Hammond , a chemical engineer who focuses on nanotechnology , into rural Africa to help farmers .
But that ’s exactly the point , says Todd Barker , a partner for the Meridian Institute , which organized the trip with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Organizers were looking for scientists who specialize in fields not traditionally involved in international development .
And they wanted people who knew little or nothing about agriculture , says Barker .
“ We wanted to get them to look at these particular problems in Africa with a fresh set of eyes . ” After the Meridian Institute identified three agricultural chains where farmers needed help — cassava , dairy and maize ( corn ) , Barker enlisted Jeffrey Carbeck PhD ’96 , a chemical engineer and entrepreneur , to identify scientists who would fit in with the mission .
“ I was looking for people who had a deep technical background but had shown they could apply it in multiple areas , ” says Carbeck , who knew Hammond from their graduate school days at MIT .
Carbeck thought that Hammond , an expert in designing polymers for drug delivery , sensors and energy , would fit perfectly .
Hammond , in turn , was intrigued by the idea .
“ It sounded like such an important problem , and I had never been to Africa .
This was a chance to see it from a very unique perspective , ” she says .
Equipped with Land Rovers and digital video cameras , the group of a dozen scientists from around the world traveled to farms throughout the two African nations , talking with farmers to find out the biggest obstacles they face .
For Hammond , the trip was enlightening .
“ These working families have very immediate problems and have neither the resources , nor perhaps the voice , to express them to groups of elite scientists , and that ’s what this allowed them to do , ” she says .
“ These are really exciting problems outside the realm of what we might normally encounter in academia .
” The team found that dairy farmers have a similar problem to cassava farmers — getting their milk to processing centers before it spoils .
Most farms do n’t have their own refrigeration facilities , so the farmers have to carry their milk in plastic jugs , usually on foot or bicycle , to the nearest cooling center .
If the cooling centers are far from the farm , the farmers might make only one trip a day , so any milk produced after that trip is in danger of spoiling before the next day ’s trip .
Milk that goes bad is rejected at the center and dumped out .
To avoid that waste , Hammond and other scientists in the group came up with the idea to design a milk container with a nanopatterned , antimicrobial coating that would preserve milk longer than a plain plastic jug .
The African dairy farmers are also interested in a way to easily test their cows to see if they ’re pregnant or in heat .
Cows must be bred and produce calves in order to produce milk , but if a cow runs dry , it ’s difficult to tell whether it ’s due to lack of pregnancy or a common udder infection known as mastitis .
There is no simple test for cow pregnancy as there is for humans , but scientists who went on the trip came up with the idea to adapt existing nanopatterned paper sensors to detect bovine pregnancy .
The Gates Foundation originally planned to allocate funding for two or three ideas that came out of the trip , but there were so many ( more than 200 , later consolidated into 22 concepts ) , that the foundation is encouraging the scientists to pursue as many as possible .
The Meridian Institute will initially focus on diagnostic tools for mastitis , the new milk container , tick - borne disease and other livestock diseases , safety tests for milk , a modified plastic tank for maize storage , and a new way to dry cassava .
The Meridian Institute is now working on starting up a foundation that would serve as an “ incubator ” to help develop , test and bring these ideas to commercialization , according to Barker .
“ The major challenge now is to make sure the ideas that came out of the trip reach the farmers in Africa , ” he says .
Dick Dekker , left , his daughter Laura Dekker , centre , and her lawyer , Peter de Lange , hold a news conference Aug. 24 in a courtroom in Utrecht , Netherlands .
(( Bart Muhl / Associated Press ) ) A Dutch teenaged sailor , who relatives reported had gone missing , has been found on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten , police said Sunday .
St. Maarten police spokesman Ricardo Henson confirmed that Laura Dekker was on the island Sunday evening , and said efforts are under way to get her back to the Netherlands .
He declined to provide further details .
The Child Protection Agency in the Netherlands could not immediately be reached for comment late Sunday .
Utrecht police spokesman Bernhard Jens said , " We do not believe this is a crime . "
A family spokeswoman said Dekker left a letter for her father before disappearing on Friday .
She did not say what was in the letter .
Dutch police issued an international alert after Dekker was reported missing Friday .
Earlier , Jens said the boat belonging to the 14 - year - old girl , who made headlines when she went to court to fight for the right to sail solo around the world , was still moored at its usual berth and she appeared to have left her father 's home on her own .
The Utrecht district court refused to let Dekker set sail and placed her under the supervision of child - care authorities in late August .
The grid widget in wxPython is one of the most complex GUI elements that you ’ll work with in this toolkit .
In this article you will learn the basics of grid creation and usage .
One of the major uses for a grid is to display tabular data .
Another use is to create some kind of spreadsheet .
If you need something where you need a lot of cells that can be edited easily , then the grid widget is probably what you want .
The ListCtrl in Report Mode is similar in appearance to the grid and can be used as a replacement for the grid depending on your needs .
Creating a Simple Grid
Let ’s take a look at how to actually create a grid :
import wx import wx.grid as gridlib ######################################################################## class MyForm ( wx. Frame ) : " " " " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , parent=None , title= " A Simple Grid " ) panel = wx . Panel( self ) my Grid = gridlib .
Grid( panel ) myGrid.CreateGrid( 12 , 8 ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(myGrid , 1 , wx.EXPAND ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
This is one of the easiest ways to create a grid widget .
All we did here was instantiate a grid object and then call its Create Grid method to tell it how many rows and columns we wanted .
We put it in a sizer mainly because that ’s just the proper way to contain widgets and makes adding additional widgets easier .
Now you should have a functional grid !
Introducing Some Grid Methods
There is a problem with the previous example : this grid does n’t really do anything useful !
We need a way to put data into the grid and get the data out .
Let ’s find out how to do that and a whole lot more .
import wx import wx.grid as gridlib ######################################################################## class MyForm ( wx. Frame ) : " " " " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , parent=None , title= " Grid Tutorial Two " , size = ( 650,320 ) ) panel = wx . Panel( self ) my Grid = gridlib .
Grid( panel ) myGrid.CreateGrid( 15 , 6 ) my Grid.SetCellValue( 0,0 , " Hello " ) myGrid.SetCellFont(0 , 0 , wx .
Font ( 12 , wx.ROMAN , wx. ITALIC , wx. NORMAL ) ) print myGrid.GetCellValue( 0,0 ) my Grid.SetCellValue( 1,1 , " I 'm in red ! " ) myGrid.SetCellTextColour(1 , 1 , wx.RED ) myGrid.SetCellBackgroundColour( 2 , 2 , wx .
CYAN ) myGrid.SetCellValue(3 , 3 , " This cell is read - only " ) myGrid.SetReadOnly( 3 , 3 , True ) myGrid.SetCellEditor( 5 , 0 , gridlib. GridCellNumberEditor( 1,1000 ) ) myGrid.SetCellValue( 5 , 0 , " 123 " ) myGrid.SetCellEditor( 6 , 0 , gridlib. GridCellFloatEditor ( ) ) myGrid.SetCellValue(6 , 0 , " 123.34 " ) myGrid.SetCellEditor( 7 , 0 , gridlib. GridCellNumberEditor ( ) ) myGrid.SetCellSize( 11 , 1 , 3 , 3 ) myGrid.SetCellAlignment( 11 , 1 , wx .
ALIGN_CENTRE , wx.ALIGN_CENTRE ) myGrid.SetCellValue( 11 , 1 , " This cell is set to span 3 rows and 3 columns " ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(myGrid ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = MyForm ( ) frame .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ( )
The code above starts out much the same as the code in the first example .
However , you ’ll quickly see that here we have many grid specific methods that we use to set various attributes of the grid widget .
For example , we use SetCellValue ( 0,0 , “ Hello ” ) to set the value of the top right cell to the string , “ Hello ” .
Next , we set the font size and style for that same cell by calling the following :
SetCellFont ( 0 , 0 , wx .
Font ( 12 , wx.ROMAN , wx. ITALIC , wx. NORMAL ) )
You can create wx .
Font objects that use the fonts on your system as well .
To set the font color , we use SetCellTextColour and to set the cell ’s background color we use SetCellBackgroundColour .
As you can see , the grid ’s methods are pretty straightforward and have intuitive names .
Of course , if you ’re American , then you ’ll notice that the naming is tends to be the British spelling ( i.e. Colour instead of Color ) , so you need to watch out for that .
If you need to make a cell read only , you can do the following : SetReadOnly ( row , col , isReadOnly = True ) .
If you need to make the entire grid read - only , then use EnableEditing ( False ) .
Finally , if you need to set entire rows or columns to read only , then you ’ll want to use cell attribute function .
Something like this should get you started :
GetCellAttr( row , col ) .
SetReadOnly( isReadOnly )
Then use SetRowAttr ( ) and SetColAttr ( ) to set the respective row or column to read - only .
I got this information from Robin Dunn ’s wonderfully helpful book : wxPython in Action .
Be sure to also take note of SetCellAlignment which will set the cell ’s content ’s alignment .
UPDATE ( 2013-09 - 12 ) : I was trying to figure out how to actually use the above information to make an entire row or column read - only , but I do n’t think it works or it does n’t work that way any longer .
Instead , you should do something like this :
attr = gridlib .
GridCellAttr( ) attr.SetReadOnly( True ) myGrid.SetRowAttr( 0 , attr )
This code will make the first row ( i.e. row zero ) read - only .
The last section of importance in this example is how to set up custom cell editors .
It ’s pretty simple in that all you need to do is call SetCellEditor and pass in the ( row , col ) tuple along with your editor of choice .
In our example , we use GridCellNumberEditor , GridCellFloatEditor and GridCellNumberEditor .
See the official documentation for other choices .
Grid Events
For our last example in our whirlwind Grid tour , we ’ll look at the grid ’s special events .
Here ’s some code to get us started :
# gridEvents.py import wx import wx.grid as gridlib ######################################################################## class MyGrid( gridlib . Grid ) : " " " " " "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , parent ) : " " " Constructor " " " gridlib .

#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self ) : " " " Constructor " " " wx.Frame.__init__(self , parent=None , title= " An Eventful Grid " ) panel = wx. Panel( self ) myGrid = MyGrid( panel ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(myGrid , 1 , wx.EXPAND ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
That ’s a lot of code , but it ’s mostly just event handlers .
We ’ll only go over a couple of them .
You ’re intelligent , so I ’m sure you ’ll be able to figure out the rest !
Notice that all the events in this sample are prepended with “ gridlib ” .
That means that these events only apply to Grid instances and will have no effect on any other widget .
For our first event example , we ’ll look at EVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_CLICK .
When you bind to this event , it allows you to catch the event that is fired when the user left clicks their mouse pointer on a cell in your grid .
As far as I can tell , this event gets fired before the select event ( i.e. EVT_GRID_SELECT_CELL ) , so you could use it to veto a cell selection if you wanted to .
Note that there is a right click and corresponding double - click events for both mouse buttons as well .
The EVT_GRID_LABEL_LEFT_CLICK
event allows us to know when a user clicks on a grid column or row label .
As with the previous event example , you can also catch double - clicking and right clicking .
Note that there is no middle click event though .
You would probably need to use the normal middle - click mouse events for this .
EVT_GRID_EDITOR_SHOWN
is fired when you start editing a cell .
You could use this event to create a custom editor to be displayed or veto the editing .
See if you can figure out what the other events do on your own .
Now let ’s look at some of the handlers .
A lot of them have the following code in them :
( evt.GetRow ( ) , evt.GetCol( ) , evt.GetPosition ( ) )
This can be quite handy for troubleshooting as it tells us if we ’re in the cell we expect to be in and it also gives us pixel coordinates of where we clicked .
The latter can be handy for contextual pop-up menus or tooltip positioning .
The other interesting handler is OnRangeSelect which shows us how to tell what our selected range is .
Notice that all we needed to do was call GetTopLeftCoords and GetBottomRightCoords to figure it out .
Is n’t this fun ?
Now you know the basics for grid event handling .
Go out there and build some cool applications with your new - found knowledge !
Keep your eyes peeled for the next couple grid tutorials where you ’ll learn how to use virtual tables , change grid and row labels , add tooltips to columns and other fun stuff !
Note :
The code in this post was tested on the following :
Windows XP Professional , wxPython 2.8.10.1 ( unicode ) , Python 2.5
Windows 7 Professional , wxPython 2.8.10.1 ( unicode ) , Python 2.6.4

And if she had a way to warn her young before they were born , surely she would .
Human mothers cannot do this , to the best of our knowledge .
But pregnant crickets , it appears , do have the ability to forewarn .
This is especially useful since crickets abandon their young after birth .
Researchers from the University of South Carolina Upstate and Indiana State University placed pregnant crickets in an enclosure where they were stalked , but not eaten , by a wolf spider , whose fangs had been coated with wax to protect the crickets .

DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( AP ) —
An analyst at credit rating firm Standard & Poor 's says Dubai has " insufficient " funds to pay back billions of dollars worth of debt coming due , putting added pressure on the city - state to raise additional cash .
Farouk Soussa , S&P 's head of Middle East government ratings , said Sunday that the sheikdom has about $ 4 billion left from a February bond issue , but must find a way to cover as much as $ 50 billion over the next three years .
He says " the notion that the government will be able and / or willing to stand 100 percent by all that debt on an equal basis is wrong . "
Soussa 's comments come two days after a top Dubai official told CNN the government could seek to raise another $ 10 billion through government bonds as early as this month .

Licensed to Blog
For rather obvious reasons , this strikes rather close to home :
The American blogosphere is going increasingly “ viral ” about a proposal advanced at the recent meeting of the Davos Economic Forum by Craig Mundie , chief research and strategy officer for Microsoft , that an equivalent of a “ driver ’s licence ” should be introduced for access to the web .
This totalitarian call has been backed by articles and blogs in Time magazine and the New York Times .
As bloggers have not been slow to point out , the system being proposed is very similar to one that the government of Red China reluctantly abandoned as too repressive .
It was inevitable that , sooner or later , the usual unholy alliance of government totalitarians and big business would attempt to end the democratic free - for - all that is the blogosphere .
The United Nations is showing similar interest in moving to eliminate free speech .
From the horse 's mouth .
The HRC inquisitors must be salivating at the thought .
The nearest historical parallel to blogging is pamphleteering , which were often signed as nom de plumes .
Two of the most famous were Junius , who is quoted in The Globe and Mail 's motto , and of course Publius , the collective pen names of John Jay , James Madison and Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers .
The blogsphere is a revival of a very old free speech tradition .
People being able to speak freely because they can enjoy anonymity .
That anonymity is not absolute .
Bloggers have been sued for libel , so the bloggers ' veil can be pierced when necessary .
A license to blog is nothing more than a tool in the hands of authoritarians of all parties .

I agree with you .
These people have no God given right to do this .
If they take this right as theirs , they would be declaring war on human kind - virtually speaking .
It would hasten a return to the darkest of ages .

Correct .
They certainly do seem intent on ending the freedom of speech , expression , assembly and every other right a human should enjoy .
Posted by : Floyd Looney | 2010-02-18 7:59:55 PM
But it seems to be a logical progression .
Politicians and beauracrats who lie constantly , the lame stream media slanting the news to the left and now , free speech cops , regulating the internet .
The next step - forcible chip implantation in the forehead .

If this became reality it would be the end of free speech as we know it .
The control freaks would love it .
HRC would love it and government would have us right where they want us .
I 'm not too worried though because hackers would always be able to provide the codes that would be able to bypass the system and scramble the IP address .
It would probably wind up like the gun registry .
Useless .
If they try to implement this , I think the public outcry would be too loud to ignore .
Any politician that backs a proposal like this will be toast .

peterj : Agreed .

This politician also would be an enemy .

Jason Court
Kyle Katarn ( Dark Forces II : Jedi Knight )
Interview : March 2010
In the Dark Forces videogames the character Kyle Katarn was introduced and quickly became a fan favorite .
For the second installment they filmed several cutscenes with real actors , including Jason Court as the Jedi himself .
How did you get started in the movie business ?
As a really small kid I was immersed into the world of modelling baby clothes as my mom was also a model .
From that beginning , I moved into the world of auditioning and acting in commercials , which then had me working and studying on stage and eventually , at the age of 16 , my first film .
You played the lead character in the Star Wars game : Dark Forces II : Jedi Knight .
How did you get this part ?
In getting the lead roll of Kyle Katarn in Jedi Knight , it was a process of auditioning for the roll .
Not unlike all rolls in film or TV , it took meeting with writers and producers of the game .
Reading and auditioning with several other actors to see how we related to each other .
I actually read and auditioned with several different actresses auditioning for the roll of Jan , before they cast Angela Harry .
So , the answer is : I got the role by auditioning for it !
Dark Forces II was an ambitious project .
In fact , the scenes that were filmed were some of the first Star Wars scenes shot in , well , over a decade .
Can you recall how these scenes were filmed ?
I will tell you this !
Shooting the scenes for Dark Forces was a real challenge as an actor .
The one thing that people may not realize is that most of what is viewable on screen is completely rendered on a computer .
Meaning , that other than the actors , everything else did n’t exist yet , when we shot the scenes .
So , most of the time , when Kyle was talking to a robotic character or was running through a mystical field on a far away planet , I was on a set , completely painted blue ( Blue Screen ) , and relating or talking to a box or a light stand , pretending to relate to something that was n’t even there with me , or even created yet .
Often , the director would be reading the lines to me off camera .
How long did it take to shoot all the scenes ?
In my memory , it took a couple of weeks to shoot all the cut scenes , and then there were several recording sessions to capture all the voice actions for the game .
Not just dialogue , but also the sounds the character made during the gameplay .
How was the atmosphere on the set ?
The atmosphere on this set was awesome .
I do n’t think any person who is involved in the industry of creating games is a boring non-creative person .
All the writers and programmers were around having fun watching what they wrote , come to life .
I mean come on , the whole thing was strange .
Look at the costumes and characters that were running around that film set .
Did George Lucas have some influence on how the scenes were filmed or how the game was created ?
Unfortunately , George Lucas was not really a part of the creation of this game .
At least , not with any of us .
I did have to fly up to San Francisco to record voice stuff for a couple of days , and that was when they were first setting up the new location of Lucas in the Presidio .
I was invited to check out the operations , but because of time constraints , I did n’t take advantage of that offer .
What is your own view on the game ?
Did you enjoy playing it ?
My view of the game at the time was … it was amazing !
I ’m not much of a gamer myself , but it was n’t long before that I was amazed at playing a game called MYST , then Dark Forces II followed that , and it was beyond cool !
The additional dimension was a great advance in gaming for the time .
I played it and easily forgot I had anything to do with creating it , and got totally lost in the gameplay .
Your character , Kyle Katarn , got a huge background story over the years as he was also featured in books .
Did you keep up with these ?
I have to admit that I did not keep up with the continuation of the Kyle Katarn story .
It was not long after working on this game , that I decided to move out of acting and get involved in another passion of mine .
Winemaking .
Were you a Star Wars fan before you did Dark Forces II ?
If so , it must have felt like a great honor to get cast ?
OK !
Let me say that it was always an extreme honor to get cast as Kyle Katarn .
Although I was not a huge Sci-Fi follower , I always had an attachment to Star Wars .
When I was a kid , and it came out in the theaters , it was totally on its own as a unique , amazing story , and an amazing film for it ’s time .
So , to get chosen to be Kyle was a little bit of a dream come true .
Still is .
Many fans regard the scenes filmed for Dark Forces II to be the best scenes ever in a Star Wars video game .
It is still played and the scenes can be viewed on sites like Youtube .
How do you look back at your ‘ Star Wars legacy ’ ?
As far as looking back at “ My Star Wars Legacy ” , I ’m not sure there really is one .
It was really great to be a part of something so great and cutting edge , but the fact is , it was the only one game I was in .
I am still so honored that so many people enjoyed my portrayal of Kyle Katarn .
It really was a challenge , and from time to time , I still get a note from someone telling me they enjoyed my work , or that I was a good influence / role model to them as a kid … that in itself makes it all so worth it .
What are you currently doing ?
Do you have new projects ?
Since leaving the film industry and acting all together ( I will return to performing someday ) , I have moved into another passion of mine .
Wine .
I moved up north to Napa California , and got involved in the world of learning to make wine .
I worked my first harvest in 2002 and started my own label in 2008 called Evidence .
Now my only other passion is travelling the world and seeing as much of it as possible .
My business partner and I went to Antarctica at the end of the year , and worked with a non -profit program for inner city kids on the east coast , doing video blogs from remote locations around the Antarctic Peninsula , showing them it ’s important to dream about exploration of new things .
The Amazon is next .
The Dongria Kondh say plot of James Cameron 's blockbuster reflects their plight as they struggle to stop company from opening bauxite mine on sacred mountain
The Dongria Kondh tribe from eastern India today appealed to film director James Cameron to help them stop controversial mining company Vedanta from opening a bauxite mine on their sacred land as they believe that he will understand their plight better than most .
Like the Na'vi tribe in Cameron 's blockbuster Avatar , who are desperately trying to stop humans from mining under their sacred ' home tree ' in Pandora , the Dongria Kondh are trying to stop Vedanta from opening its mine on the mountain they worship .
Vedanta plans to construct an open - cast mine on Niyamgiri mountain in Orissa state which activists believe will destroy the area 's ecosystem and threaten the future of the 8,000 - strong Dongria Kondh tribe , who depend on the hills for their crops and water and who believe the mountain and surrounding forest to be a sacred place .
Stephen Corry , director of the charity Survival , which campaigns on behalf of indigenous people , said : " Just as the Na'vi describe the forest of Pandora as ' their everything ' , for the Dongria Kondh , life and land have always been deeply connected .
The fundamental story of Avatar – if you take away the multi-coloured lemurs , the long - trunked horses and warring androids – is being played out today in the hills of Niyamgiri .
" Like the Na'vi , the Dongria Kondh are also at risk , as their lands are set to be mined by Vedanta Resources who will stop at nothing to achieve their aims .
The mine will destroy the forests on which the Dongria Kondh depend and wreck the lives of thousands of other Kondh tribal people living in the area . "
In an advert in Hollywood entertainment magazine Variety , the Dongria Kondh said : " Appeal to James Cameron .
Avatar is fantasy … and real .
The Dongria Kondh tribe in India are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell - bent on destroying their sacred mountain .
Please help the Dongria . "
Ricci translated Euclid into Chinese , demonstrated Western clocks to the Chinese and created a method for representing Chinese using the Western alphabet .
As Jonathan Spence points out in his classic book , “ The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci ” ( Penguin , 1984 ) , he even gave the Chinese lessons in special techniques of memorization .
This map is an extension of his Jesuitical project , so while paying homage to the Chinese , Ricci was also well aware that the map was partly a demonstration , an argument .
It is not decorated with an ornate compass rose or mythological sea creatures , nor does it display terrifying terra incognita .
It is devoutly rational , even scientific : it contains descriptions of the world ’s peoples that may seem wildly fanciful , but are based on the authoritative sources of Ricci ’s time .
It also incorporates an explanation of parallels and meridians , a proof that the sun is larger than the moon , a table showing the distances of planets from the earth , an explanation of the varying lengths of days and nights , and polar projections of the earth that are unusually consistent with its main map .
Ricci declares that it offers testimony “ to the supreme goodness , greatness and unity of Him who controls heaven and earth . ”
The map , then , portrays the crossroads of two great civilizations .
Even as Ricci shifted the geographic center of Western global maps , filling in detailed outlines of China and other regions from Chinese cartographers and annotating the whole in Chinese , he also added a frame that was both rationalist and religious , celebrated Western science and faith and created a culturally hybrid vision of the earthly cosmos .
The result may even be a portrait of the earth as a Jesuit would like the Chinese to think a Jesuit would see it .
The offering is meant to be both humble and full of pride , deferential and assertive , combining sincere homage and earnest self - affirmation .
On the one hand , Ricci stripped away much detail from his portrayal of Europe , making its “ 24 countries ” seem far less central than they were becoming on the world stage .
On the other hand , Ricci ’s annotations offer grandiose declarations that all Europeans were “ reverent adherents of the holy Christian religion , ” that “ all are versed in the elements of astronomy and philosophy , ” and that its princes and subjects were all wealthy .
( CNN ) -- Terry Chiplin did n't need a Harvard study to tell him what he 's known for years .
" Barefoot running , for me , is a lot less painful than wearing running shoes , " said the 55 - year - old Brit , who competed in high school in thin - soled leather shoes and would run shoeless whenever he could .
After taking a break in early adulthood from the sport , Chiplin returned to it by buying a fancy pair of running shoes .
" I 'd come home with blisters , my feet killing me , " he said .
" So one day , I just said to myself , ' Who cares what anybody thinks ?
I 'm putting sole to earth . ' "
Chiplin now teaches running and outdoor fitness in Estes Park , Colorado , and does it shoeless as often as possible .
He 's among many runners on blogs and list - servs who 've been debating new studies about the most efficient running form .
Should you go barefoot ?
Land heel - first or on the balls of your feet ?
Are those fancy shoes hurting more than helping you ?
The study stirring the most buzz was led by Harvard evolutionary biologist Dr. Daniel Lieberman .
It 's the first to compare how much impact the body takes when a runner is wearing shoes or is barefoot .
Using high - speed video , the study revealed barefoot runners strike with their forefoot and suffer less jarring to their bodies .
When you 're barefoot , you 're going to land with the portion of your foot that is most springy .
And think of the barefoot run as a game of hot potato -- if you know you have rocks and glass on that surface , you 're going to move more carefully and pick your feet up quicker .
Shoe wearers strike with their heel and deliver a shock to their overall body that is two to three times their body weight .
Lieberman 's test subjects were Kenyan runners who had spent their lives running barefoot and the Harvard track team , which runs in shoes .
Watch the difference between barefoot and shoe running
" Runners are responding because they are always interested in the latest science of their sport , and they have a personal reaction to being told that their shoes are going to be taken away , " said D. Leif Rustvold , a Portland , Oregon , runner with a masters in anthropological biology who works for a health care provider .
Though he switched to barefooting a few years ago and saw an improvement in his efficiency , he predicts barefooting will remain a practice of a minority .
" Runners are concerned first about injuries , and barefoot running can seem , at first , like it 's going to lead to injury , " he said .
" Besides , we 've been wearing shoes for years .
No one is going to roll that back . "
The other study , focusing on walking form , comes from University of Utah biology professor David Carrier .
Carrier is well - known among distance runners for trying to run down a herd of antelope a few years ago to prove that humans were built to run great distances , their survival dependent on their ability to persistence hunt .
He found that while humans have evolved to run great distances , we 've also evolved to become more efficient walkers than our ape ancestors by doing the very thing Lieberman 's study warns against -- landing heel first .
His test subjects were volunteers who were triathletes , runners and soccer players .
Most mammals -- dogs , cats , raccoons -- walk and run around on the balls of their feet , the study says .
Few species land on their heel : bears , humans and great apes -- chimps , gorillas , orangutans .
" Our study shows that the heel - down posture increases the economy of walking but not the economy of running , " says Carrier .
" You consume more energy when you walk on the balls of your feet or your toes than when you walk heels first . "
So , run on your forefeet and walk on your heels ?
" It can be complicated , but I do n't think what Lieberman concluded and what our study found conflicts at all with each other , " Carrier told CNN .
" If anything it shows how complex our feet are , and how much we 're learning about the mechanics of movement . "
Lieberman said his study is not meant to be an argument for barefoot running .
" I 'm afraid people have misunderstood me , " he said .
" I 'm not in the business of telling people what to do , what shoes to wear or whether to wear shoes at all . "
Amanda Musacchio , 35 , of Wheaton , Illinois , is a member of one of the biggest running list - servs in the country .
She and many other runners have interpreted the story as a round - about way to cheer barefoot running .
Musacchio wore thin - soled shoes when she was a sprinter in high school without injury .
But when she started running longer distances in adulthood , she thought wearing a heavy - cushioned shoe would help .
Instead , she racked up injuries .
So she went bare again .
" I started barefoot running five minutes at a time , " she said .
" I feel almost as good now as when I did 20 years ago when I was a sprinter .
My feet seem to remember how to land properly , on my forefoot , and that improved form has changed my running tremendously . "
Among the skeptics is self - described " proud shoe wearer " runner Spurgeon Hendrick , who regularly hits the trails outside Atlanta , Georgia , for long runs .
He points out that Lieberman 's study was partly sponsored by Vibram USA , information that is clearly disclosed on every page .
The company makes Vibram 5 Fingers , a thin latex shoe with individual toes that mimics barefoot running .
The shoe has sold like hot cakes this past year after they and Lieberman 's work were featured in the 2009 best - selling book " Born to Run . "
" I could n't run barefooted , or in Vibrams , even if I wanted to , " Hendrick said .
" I stub my toes on roots and rocks too much , and at my age , I do n't have time to wait on a broken toe to heal . "
Lieberman is adamant that Vibram sponsorship had nothing to do with the outcome of the study , which was also funded by the American School of Prehistoric Research , the Goelet Fund and Harvard University .
But many runners are saying that apart from the nitpicking about whether the studies are on the money is one basic lesson :
Be more aware of your unique movement .
" I think it 's very hard , if not impossible , to change body mechanics , " said Dr. Perry Julien , a podiatrist who has treated Olympic runners and serves as the co-medical director of the world 's biggest 10 K , the Atlanta Peachtree Road Race .
" And people who try , or try too quickly and without care , are going to wind up in my office . "
If you 're a walker , being more conscious of how your feet hit the ground may make you more efficient .
If you 're a 200 - pound guy who hits the treadmill a couple times a week , barefoot running might not be worth the work necessary to build up the calf and Achilles strength to prevent injury , he said .
Stress fractures , tendonitis or plantar fasciitis , a hard - to - heal tissue inflammation that feels like needles driven into your foot , are likely to result for runners who dash out the gate barefoot without gradually working up to it .
The podiatrist pointed out that there are many examples of people who heel strike without problems , most famously Joan Benoit .
Benoit won the first women 's Olympics marathon in 1984 , the same era of the record - breaking South African Zola Budd , who ran barefoot .
Le médiateur de TF1 conteste le fait d’avoir « manqué à l’honn êteté de l’information » en montrant un hémicycle plein à craquer lors de la présentation , par Brice Hortefeux , de la Loppsi ( la vingt - quatrième loi sécuritaire adoptée depuis 2002 ) , et voudrait jeter l’opprobe sur moi : « soit l’auteur de ce blog est de mauvaise foi , soit il s’est trompé .
Tout ceci demande à être vérifié , ce que nous sommes en train de faire « .
En attendant les résultats de leur enquête interne , Arrêts sur image a démontré , vidéos à l’appui , que « l’auteur de ce blog » ( je suis aussi « journaliste » , faut - il le préciser ) ne s’était pas trompé .
Le CSA , lui , vient de confirmer que , pour la première fois dans l’histoire de la télévision française , il allait imposer la lecture d’un communiqué sur TF1 qui , entre autres « manquements à l’honn êteté de l’information « , avait présenté un hémicyle plein à craquer , l’an passé , lors du vote de l’Hadopi , alors qu’il était là aussi quasiment vide .
Accessoirement , TF1 a commis un autre lapsus …
Mon article sur la Loppsi : TF1 manque à l’honn êteté de l’information a fait un peu de bruit , sur Twitter mais pas seulement .
A défaut de réagir officiellement , le médiateur de TF1 à répondu à un internaute qui l’avait interrogé à ce sujet que « soit l’auteur de ce blog est de mauvaise foi , soit il s’est trompé « , comme le rapporte Arrêts sur images dans un article sobrement intitulé « Loppsi et « bourrage d’Assemblée » : TF1 s’entête , et s’enfonce » :
« Il apparait , contrairement aux affirmations peremptoires de ce blog , qu’il n’y a eu aucune erreur sinon d’interprétation de la part de l’animateur de ce blog .
Cette séance de l’Assemblée sur la loi LOPPSI s’est déroulée en deux temps , un premier durant lequel le Ministre a exposé son projet de loi devant un hémicycle très deserté et un second lors des questions au gouvernement devant un hémicycle qui s’était entretemps rempli , les députés ayant boudé « l’exposé » et étant massivement revenus pour les questions au gouvernement .
Donc , soit l’auteur de ce blog est de mauvaise foi , soit il s’est trompé .
Tout ceci demande à être vérifié , ce que nous sommes en train de faire . »
Je ne sais si les journalistes de TF1 sont de mauvaise foi , mais ils se sont clairement trompés , ce que démontrent clairement les vidéos comparées par Arrêts sur images : Brice Hortefeux ne présentait pas la Loppsi , il répondait , lors de la séance de questions parlementaires , à un député qui l’interrogeait sur… la profanation d’une mosquée :
Un « arsenal de communautés musulmanes » ?
Il suffit d’ailleurs d’écouter attentivement la présentation que fait Laurence Ferrari de la Loppsi : on entend , en fond sonore , Brice Hortefeux répondre au député .
Et leurs deux propos mêlés sont … étonnants , notamment au regard du reportage que venait tout juste de diffuser TF1 , au sujet des violences scolaires , sujet qui constitua le fil rouge de cette semaine du 8 février :
Laurence Ferrari :
Et c’est dans ce contexte que le ministre de l ’Intérieur Brice Hortefeux a présenté son projet de loi sur la sécurité intérieure qui prévoit un arsenal …
Brice Hortefeux : … communautés musulmanes … Laurence Ferrari : … contre les nouvelles formes de délinquance .
Parmi les mesures qui seront discutées il y a la vidéosurveillance , un couvre - feu pour les moins de 13 ans , avec des sanctions possibles pour les parents des enfants délinquants .
La gauche et les magistrats jugent ce projet “ liberticide ” .
Brice Hortefeux : …et les valeurs républic …
Dans les faits , Brice Hortefeux déclarait : «
Dès que j’en ai pris connaissance , j’ai demandé au préfet de la Loire de se rendre immédiatement sur place afin de témoigner de la solidarité de l’État à l’égard de l’ensemble de la communauté musulmane .
Parallèlement , j’ai fait part très directement au président du Conseil français du culte musulman , M. Mohammed Moussaoui , de notre totale détermination à faire respecter à la fois la légalité et les valeurs républicaines . »
Les paranos crieront au complot , dénonçant un message subliminal destiné à laver le cerveau des téléspectateurs de TF1 .
J’abhorre les théories du complot .
Tout juste pourrait - on parler ( et sourire ) de ce lapsus révélateur de la politique médiatique de TF1 qui a , de fait , consacré bien plus de temps d’antenne aux violences scolaires qu’à la Loppsi :
Pour le coup , on pourrait même suspecter TF1 de militer aux côtés de tous ces professeurs qui réclament des postes de surveillants , quand leur ministère se contente de leur proposer des caméras de surveillance …
Un « manquement à l’honn êteté de l’information » ?
Entendons - nous bien : je n’ai nullement écrit que TF1 avait sciemment bidonné l’illustration de sa présentation de la Loppsi , et pencherais plutôt pour la thèse de la facilité , de l’erreur d’inattention :
– Tu peux me trouver une image de Brice Hortefeux à l’Assemblée , s’il te plaît ?
– Oui , chef !
Au sens strict , Brice Hortefeux a bel et bien « présenté » la Loppsi devant un hémicycle bondé , aux alentours de 15h30 , pendant 2 minutes .
Juste après la réponse qu’a fait Brice Hortefeux au sujet de la profanation de la mosquée de Saint Etienne , il fut en effet complaisamment interrogé par Eric Ciotti , rapporteur de la Loppsi , qui lui a demandé de bien vouloir présenter aux honorables députés ce « texte majeur pour la sécurité des Français , la première de leur liberté » :
Ce texte a été accueilli par la gauche comme une loi d’affichage et par le syndicat de la magistrature comme une loi liberticide .
Ces critiques contradictoires , idéologiques et caricaturales valent pour nous encouragement et témoignent du parfait équilibre auquel vous êtes parvenu , monsieur le ministre , avec un texte complet , efficace et pragmatique .
Quels objectifs précis poursuivez - vous avec ce texte ?
La brève réponse de Brice Hortefeux - systématiquement interrompu par des députés de l’opposition - ne semble guère avoir intéressé ni convaincu les députés , qui avaient déserté les travées de l’Assemblée lorsque , plus tard dans l’après - midi , vers 17h40 ( et non plus tôt dans la journée , comme l’écrit le médiateur de TF1 ) , le débat parlementaire au sujet de la Loppsi a bel et bien été entamé , et que Brice Hortefeux , pour le coup , se donna le temps de la présenter en long , en large et en travers .
Le métier de journaliste est d’informer , de rapporter des faits , pas de les enjoliver , ou de faire croire que le Parlement n’est qu’une chambre d’enregistrement qui se limite au fait d’écouter la présentation que peut faire un ministre d’une loi qui fut âprement débattue trois jours durant .
Je ne sais s’il s’agit d’un nouveau « manquement à l’honn êteté de l’information « , pour reprendre les termes du CSA , qui n’a pas été en mesure de me dire s’il s’était saisi de cette « couverture » biaisée de la Loppsi , mais qui confirme l’info publiée par Renaud Revel sur son blog :
C’est une première dans l’histoire de la télévision en France .
Le Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel a adressé à TF1 et Canal + deux mises en demeure , suite à des infractions relevées ces dernières semaines .
Mais pour la première fois , le CSA va obliger les deux chaînes en question à diffuser sur leurs antennes , en « lieu et place » , c’est à dire à l’endroit même où ces manquements ont été relevés , le contenu de la réprimande de l’instance présidée par Michel Boyon .
La teneur et les modalités de diffusion de ce communiqué ne sont pas arrêtées , précise la haute autorité audiovisuelle .
Mais cela ne saurait tarder .

Les pédophiles n’ont rien à craindre de la Lopssi .
Les internautes , si .
Pour Hortefeux , la vidéo d’un mariage relève de la vidéosurveillance
sans oublier , non plus , la chronique qu’en a tiré Didier Porte dans le Fou du Roi sur France Inter , « TF1 nous bourre le mou ( et l’Assemblée ) » , où il me qualifie au passage ( avec humour , faut - il le préciser ) , et mes confrères de PCInpact avec , de « branquignols affabulateurs diffuseurs de fausses nouvelles » ( merci Didier !-) , au motif que nous nous sommes permis de mettre en doute la « couverture » ( ou « politique ») journalistique de TF1 :
MaJ en réponse à ceux qui pensent que j’aurais pris les propos de Didier Porte au premier degré : merci de votre soutien , mais inutile de préciser qu’il faut prendre ses propos au second degré , j’avais compris , merci ;-)

Supernova Remnant video showing specific remnants and their appearance at different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation .
New images from the Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope show where supernova remnants emit radiation a billion times more energetic than visible light .
The images bring astronomers a step closer to understanding the source of some of the universe ’s most energetic particles -- cosmic rays .
Cosmic rays consist mainly of protons that move through space at nearly the speed of light .
In their journey across the galaxy , the particles are deflected by magnetic fields .
This scrambles their paths and masks their origins .
“ Understanding the sources of cosmic rays is one of Fermi ’s key goals , ” said Stefan Funk , an astrophysicist at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology ( KIPAC ) , jointly located at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University , Calif .
When cosmic rays collide with interstellar gas , they produce gamma rays .
“ Fermi now allows us to compare emission from remnants of different ages and in different environments , ” Funk added .
He presented the findings Monday at the American Physical Society meeting in Washington , D.C .
Fermi’s Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) mapped billion - electronvolt ( GeV ) gamma rays from three middle - aged supernova remnants -- known as W51C , W44 , and IC 443 - - that were never before resolved at these energies .
( The energy of visible light is between 2 and 3 electronvolts . )
Each remnant is the expanding debris of a massive star that blew up between 4000 and 30,000 years ago .
In addition , Fermi ’s LAT also spied GeV gamma rays from Cassiopeia A ( Cas A ) , a supernova remnant only 330 years old .
Ground - based observatories , which detect gamma rays thousands of times more energetic than the LAT was designed to see , have previously detected Cas A .
“ Older remnants are extremely bright in GeV gamma rays , but relatively faint at higher energies .
Younger remnants show a different behavior , ” explained Yasunobu Uchiyama , a Panofsky Fellow at SLAC .
“ Perhaps the highest - energy cosmic rays have left older remnants , and Fermi sees emission from trapped particles at lower energies . ”
In 1949 , the Fermi telescope ’s namesake , physicist Enrico Fermi , suggested that the highest - energy cosmic rays were accelerated in the magnetic fields of gas clouds .
In the decades that followed , astronomers showed that supernova remnants are the galaxy ’s best candidate sites for this process .
Young supernova remnants seem to possess both stronger magnetic fields and the highest - energy cosmic rays .
Stronger fields can keep the highest - energy particles in the remnant ’s shock wave long enough to speed them to the energies observed .
The Fermi observations show GeV gamma rays coming from places where the remnants are known to be interacting with cold , dense gas clouds .
“ We think that protons accelerated in the remnant are colliding with gas atoms , causing the gamma- ray emission , ” Funk said .
An alternative explanation is that fast - moving electrons emit gamma rays as they fly past the nuclei of gas atoms .
“ For now , we ca n’t distinguish between these possibilities , but we expect that further observations with Fermi will help us to do so , ” he added .
Either way , these observations validate the notion that supernova remnants act as enormous accelerators for cosmic particles .
“ How fitting it is that Fermi seems to be confirming the bold idea advanced over 60 years ago by the scientist after whom it was named , ” noted Roger Blandford , director of KIPAC .
I want a porch .
I want a friggin ’ porch so bad .
If I had my way I would move out of my Hollywood apartment away from my homeless neighbors who live on the stoop and the drunk assholes ready to kill someone over a double double from In and Out real fast .
I want a porch .
I want to sit on it and I want to listen to music and relax and drink a lot of beer without a care in the world .
I would have massive speakers and a rocking chair .
That to me at the moment is “ the life ” .
With Blitzen Trapper as my band of choice and their newest record “ American Goldwing ” as the soundtrack to my laid back afternoon I think I ’m on to something here .
Might Find It Cheap – Blitzen Trapper
Indie rock , folk rock , southern rock , call it what you will Blitzen Trapper is a rock band .
They call Portland , Oregon home and have been touring heavily for the last few years .
They just released “ American Goldwing . ”
It ’s one part rock and roll guitar laden , drum heavy grooves and one part distinct cool vocals with a southern twist .
Blitzen Trapper have created a sound all their own and I ’m sold 100 % on what they are selling .
Next track is called “ Fletcher ” which is one of my favortie tracks on the record .
Fletcher – Blitzen Trapper
After releasing Furr in 2008 Blitzen Trapper fell onto my radar .
After seeing them at Coachella Music and Arts Fest later that year ( or in 09 , I ca n’t remember ) I could n’t get them out of my head .
I have been following them on and off since then .
They released an awesome record called “ Destroyer of The Void ” in 2010 and now American Goldwing is just solidifying what I saw years ago .
These guys are tight and have honed this music and are perfecting it .
Your Crying Eyes – Blitzen Trapper
Despite being from Portland Blitzen Trapper has a little bit of a southern twang to them and then they just kick you right in the junk with a tune like Your Crying Eyes .
I think thats what I like most about these guys .
They have that southern influence that eases you into the music with familiarity and then they turn up the volume .
The band currently has six members with Eric Early on guitar and vocals with Brian Adrian Koch and Marty Marquis on drums and vocals and guitar and keyboards respectively .
The vocal duties are supported Erik Menteer on Guitar and Keyboards , Michael VanPelt on bass .
Girl In A Coat – Blitzen Trapper
Blitzen Trapper is currently on tour .
Lucky for me they are wrapping up their tour on November 17th at the Music Box in Hollywood .
Tour dates page is HERE .
Their new album “ American Goldwing ” is available anywhere where people care about good music , so basically the internet and Amoeba Music on Sunset Blvd .
Here are a couple final tracks from “ American Goldwing . ”
One rockin’ and the last track which is not so rockin’ but a great way to end the record .
Check these guys out when they are in your town .
In fact go out of your way by hours and hundreds of miles to see these dudes .
It ’s worth it .

Those of you who keep an eye on real estate in the United States might have been surprised to see that the US F1 factory at 990 Twin Lakes Parkway in Charlotte has been put up for sale for $ 3.15 m .
The lease on the property lasts until June 2014 and the US F1 factory for sale brochure says that the 33,690 Sq. Ft. facility is in immaculate condition , having had $ 620,000 spent on it in recent months .
The factory was listed for sale on February 12 .
I did not have time to talk to the team before I posted the original story and I see that it has caused a lot of comment .
The team says that it is the tenant and that the owner of the building is fully entitled to sell the property with the tenant in situ .
The team will remain where it is and this will have no effect on the 2010 F1 programme .
All that is now needed is a second driver … and some cars .
Hey all ,
As most of you know , a Trojan was recently discovered in the software for Energizer 's USB battery charger .
Following its release , I wrote an Nmap probe to detect the Trojan and HDMoore wrote a Metasploit module to exploit it .
I mentioned in my last post that it was a nice sample to study and learn from .
The author made absolutely no attempt to conceal its purpose , once installed , besides a weak XOR encoding for communication .
Some conspiracy theorists even think this may have been legitimate management software gone wrong -- and who knows , really ?
In any case , I offered to write a tutorial on how I wrote the Nmap probe , and had a lot of positive feedback , so here it is !
Just be sure to take this for what it is .
This is * not* intended to show any new methods or techniques or anything like that .
It 's a reverse engineering guide targeted , as much as I could , for people who 've never opened IDA or Windbg in their lives .
I 'd love to hear your comments !
Sections
This tutorial was getting far too long for a single page , so I broke it into four sections :
Step 0 : You will need ...
To follow along , you 'll need the following ( all free , except for Windows itself ) :
A disposable Windows computer to infect ( probably on VMWare )
Debugging Tools for Windows ( I used 6.11.1.404 )
IDA ( free )
Nmap
A basic understanding of C and x86 assembly would be an asset .
< shamelessplug >
Check out the reverse engineering guide I wrote < / shamelessplug >
A basic understanding of the Linux commandline ( gcc , pipes , etc )
Infect a test machine
The goal of this step is , obviously , to infect a test system with the Energizer Trojan .
Strictly speaking , this is n't necessary .
You can do a fine job understanding this sample without actually infecting yourself .
That being said , this Trojan appears to be fairly safe , as far as malware goes , so it 's a good one to play with .
I strongly recommend against installing this on anything other than a throwaway computer ( I used VMWare ) .
Do not install this on anything real .
Ever. Seriously !
If you 're good and sure this is what you really want to do , grab the file here :
Then extract the installation file , UsbCharger_setup_v1_1_1.exe ( arucer.dll is n't necessary yet ) .
The password for the zip archive is " infected " , and by typing it in you promise to understand the risks of dealing with malware :
Naturally , make sure you turn off antivirus software before extracting it .
In fact you should n't even be running antivirus because your system should n't even be connected to the network !
Perform a typical install ( ie , hit ' next ' till it stops asking you questions ) .
Once you 've finished the installation , verify that the backdoor is listening on port 7777 by running " cmd.exe " and running " netstat - an " :
Congratulations !
Your system is now backdoored .

Hospitals Report Some Patients Cleaning
Them Out Ethics aside , experts explain why hospital theft is a bad idea .
Feb. 19 , 2010  --
Stuck in the hospital and not sure what you will pick up for your kid's birthday or how you will get it ?
If you were one of the less ethical patients , you might grab the heart monitor you 're hooked up to .
Hospital consultant Jack Parker said he ran into a situation with a patient who took that tact while working with a hospital several years ago .
With a $ 1,000 heart monitor missing , the physician actually called the patient , who was adamant that she did not know where it had gone .
The physician drove to the house .
" When he rapped on the door , the son came to the door , and guess what he had in his hand ?
The monitor , " said Parker .
At a time when hospital expenditures are coming under increasing scrutiny , some hospitals are taking steps to halt a problem of patients treating hospital room amenities like an all - you - can - eat buffet .
" Not only do the towels , sheets , and linens walk out the door , but also the clock , the oxygen meters , and anything else that is n't tied down , " one hospital executive recently wrote VHA , Inc. , a network that helps hospitals improve efficiency and clinical care , and which Parker works for .
" We have had televisions that went out the door , " Parker said , adding that now his clients bolt them down .
" We have had IV pumps and wheelchairs out the door as well .
We did have all the television controls missing until we finally purchased the type that is programmed to work with the only the TV set in the room .
What an expense ! "
Parker said the only real solution is for hospitals not to leave a lot of excess items in patients ' rooms , such as not putting eight towels in a room that needs two .
Taking a credit card as a deposit like a hotel does is likely not an option , he added , and asking nursing staff to be on the lookout is n't likely to work either .
While Parker said he has spoken with nurses who caught patients ' relatives walking out with bags full of hospital linens , " I think , unfortunately , the nursing staff at the hospital is busy doing patient care ... so we 're always asking them to keep an eye out , but it 's not fair to put that onus on them . "
For some expensive items , such as wheelchairs and medical equipment , extra security measures should be taken , such as tagging them with chips with alarms , Parker said , a step that likely will become more useful once such tags drop in price .
What 's on Those Linens ?
Like many other industries , hospital theft goes beyond customers .
Among the most commonly stolen items are hospital scrubs , which may be taken by employees , physicians and residents .
An important counter is systems many hospitals are adopting in which employees need to swipe a card to get a fresh pair of scrubs , and the hospital can then track how many pairs an employee has .
While hospitals may not be able to adopt the policy hotels use to prevent theft , they may be able to benefit from better education about hospital theft .
" Do you want to take linen out of the hospital ?
I think the perception would be germs , disease , " said Roger Graziano , director of materials management at Indiana Regional Medical Center .
In addition to not knowing what may be living on items they purloin from a hospital , petty thieves also may be unaware of some other features of items they might steal .
" I have seen them take the telephone -- which does n't work at home , " said Parker .
Of course , not all hospital theft is for home use .
A few incidents over the past several years have highlighted professional gangs stealing hospital equipment .
" What we were able to learn is these products can be easily sold in [ other countries ] , " said Joseph Bellino , president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety .
Bellino was affected in the late 1990s when thieves were taking the scopes for colonoscopies in the Dallas - Ft .
Worth area , where his hospital is located .
A similar incident , he said , took place in the Pittsburgh area in 2007 .
Hospitals may be seen as safe places , but just as recent stories about hospital - acquired infections showcase how unclean they can be -- even when run properly -- some of these incidents showcase they are , in some ways , ideal places for theft .
" When you think about it , a hospital is one of the few buildings open 24 hours a day to serve the public , " said Bellino .
" Even criminals need medical care , so you never know who 's coming into the hospital . "
For that reason , he said , patients also need to be aware of security risks for themselves .
" When you 're in the hospital , you do n't need a lot of money , " Bellino said , adding that patients should give valuables to someone who is not staying there -- even items with mostly sentimental value .
" If it 's a cross that my grandmother gave me as a child , how do you replace that ? " he asked .
However , hospitals can reduce theft by having staff be more alert and locking cabinets and supply rooms , he said .
Such measures can make even an inner-city hospital safer .
Bellino was able to help one such hospital bring down its losses from theft to $ 12,500 .
For comparison , VHA said its members average around $ 15,000 in theft losses .
Accidental Waste
While walking out of a hospital with a shopping cart full of items from a room might sound dramatic , it likely is n't the largest source of waste in hospitals .
Graziano said a larger contributor is waste .
For example , he said , a nurse might bring a box of gauze into a patient 's room when he only needs two rolls .
However , that box needs to be thrown away once the patient leaves because of potential infection .
As with the threat of theft if too many towels are left in a room , hospitals need to make sure patients are n't given items that can not be used once they leave .
" We have to manage what we give to customers , " Graziano said .
Tom Campbell : Demon Sheep
Created : February 03 , 2010 17:16 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Carly Fiorina ’s campaign for U.S. Senate has been trying to make a pretty strong factual argument against challengers Tom Campbell and Chuck DeVore — namely , that both supported a tax - hiking 2005 budget in California .
But the reception of a video making the case that Campbell is a “ fiscal conservative in name only ” around Washington seems to be universal laughter .
Mexican drug gangs are increasingly operating through Guatemala
Guatemala 's chief of national police and the country 's top anti-drugs official have been arrested over alleged links to drug trafficking .
Attorney General Amilcar Velasquez said police chief Baltazar Gomez and Nelly Bonilla were being held in connection with a cocaine theft in March 2009 .
Mr Velasquez said five police agents were killed as a result of the theft .
Mexican drug gangs have been moving operations into Guatemala as they come under pressure in their own country .
The two most senior officials in Guatemala 's fight against drug trafficking were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime , illegal possession of weapons and obstruction of justice .
" The captures were the result of tracking the investigation into the drug robbery that took place in Amatitlan , which those detained today are believed to have participated in , " Mr Velasquez said .
The arrests come two days after President Alvaro Colom removed Interior Minister Raul Velasquez from office over alleged corruption .
With the US secretary of state about to visit Guatemala , the state department has published a report expressing serious concerns about corruption and inadequate law enforcement in Guatemala .
With Mexico making strong efforts against drug traffickers , Washington fears the cartels are moving south to take advantage of lax policing and limited surveillance in Guatemala , says the BBC 's Julian Miglierini in Mexico City .
Ontario electricity customers will soon be slapped with an additional tax to cover $ 53 million of the Liberal government 's new conservation and green energy programs , the Star has learned .
The levy will appear on hydro bills just as the 13 per cent harmonized sales tax is about to be charged and as smart meters are being phased in , which one industry insider described as " a perfect storm " for consumers already rattled by rising energy costs .
A government document – innocuously entitled " Ontario Regulation Made Under The Ontario Energy Board Act , 1998 , Assessments For Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure Conservation and Renewable Energy Program Costs " – outlines the fee in great detail .
" The total amount to be assessed by the ( Ontario Energy ) Board ... is $ 53,695,310 , " the five - page regulation states .
It stipulates the assessment be issued by April 15 and the money paid by July 30 , but utilities can spread the $ 4 annual increase to customers in bills over the course of a year .
Industrial and commercial ratepayers will also pay the fee .
Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak warned Friday it is " nothing but a sneaky tax grab " by the Liberals .
" This is just the latest in a long series of tax and fee grabs hitting Ontario families through their hydro bill alone , " said Hudak , charging the proceeds " will be used to create another Liberal slush fund " for pet initiatives .
Energy and Infrastructure Minister Brad Duguid said the government was aware of the potential for backlash , but that 's a small price to pay for cleaner air since conservation makes it easier to phase out coal - fired power plants by 2014 .
" When costs go up there 's always the concern about consumer reaction , " Duguid said in an interview .
" I do n't think we ever sneeze at the amount of money because every little bit adds up .
But at the same time , it 's about $ 4 for this year for consumers and it's a one - year program .
It gets reassessed every year , " the minister said .
" The alternative is either to keep polluting the lungs of our kids through coal , or not have a reliable supply of energy , which would be disastrous to our economy and to our quality of life , " said Duguid .
" This ... gets us out of dirty coal , which is harming our health and the health of our kids and grandkids in the future , and it ensures that we have a reliable and sustainable supply of energy ... for future generations , " he said .
" When consumers think it through , this is something consumers should be embracing as something that we all have to do together to create this `green revolution ' in Ontario . "
Duguid said the money would pay for home energy audits and a program that helps industrial and commercial firms switch to solar power .
Promoting conservation is part of Premier Dalton McGuinty 's push to transform Ontario into a leading jurisdiction for green energy , such as solar and wind power .
" Conservation is the most economical way for us to ensure that we have enough energy supply going forward into the future .
So it 's more economical than producing more green energy , more economical than modernizing our nuclear fleet , " said Duguid .
" So it is the best bang for the buck for the consumer .
But there 's a cost to it .
It 's modest , but there 's a cost to it .
Frankly , there 's no better alternative for consumers than improving our conservation efforts . "

Critics say the timing is lousy for ratepayers because as of July 1 , when the provincial sales tax is harmonized with the federal goods and services tax , consumption levies on utility bills will be 13 per cent instead of 5 per cent .
( Currently only the 5 per cent GST is charged on such bills , not the 8 per cent PST . )
" When you combine this new charge with HST and soaring costs due in part to smart meters , it 's the perfect storm for consumers , " said one industry official .
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the pain never seems to subside for electricity ratepayers .
Ideologically , it believes governments must provide for the greatest good for the greatest number of people .
It opposes concentrated wealth , demagogy , and despotism , and supports democracy , human and civil rights , and social justice - an ideology the 19th century People 's Party and 20th century Progressive Party endorsed without majorities .
Until recently , faint echoes remained , sadly silenced after Senator Bernie Sanders and sole House populist capitulated .
Former Kucinich for president consultant , David Swanson , said " he gave in to the power of a false narrative , and that he ought to have said so .... I think the corporate media has instilled in people the idea that presidents should make laws and the current president is trying to make a law that can reasonably be called ' healthcare reform ' or at least ' health insurance reform . ' " I do n't excuse Kucinich flipping .... I just want to find the right explanation for it . "
The web site singlepayeraction.org , ( " everybody in. nobody out . " ) called the Democrats ( like Republicans ) " a corporate party , rotting from the core . "
SPA called Kucinich's " flameout ....spectacular " in support of a bill he and progressive Democrats strongly opposed until they flipped , including Congressman Danny Davis , representing this writer 's 7th Illinois District .
Kucinich said " I 've taken a detour supporting this bill . "
For SPA , it 's one " that will condemn millions of Americans to ongoing suffering and death " because insurers make money by denying care , why real reform requires their removal and assuring everyone of universal single - payer coverage .
Everyone in .
Nobody out .
What your senator and House representative get , you get .
What congressional Democrats wo n't enact .
On March 17 , Rep. Dennis Kucinich announced the following : " I have carried the banner of national health care in two presidential campaigns , in party platform meeting , and as co-author of HR 676 , Medicare for All .
I have worked to expand the health care debate beyond the current for - profit system , to include a public option and an amendment to free the states to pursue single payer . "
On November 7 , 2009 , despite enormous pressure , he voted against HR 3962 : Affordable Health Care for America Act , " asking " Is this the best we can do " in a prepared text titled , " Why I Voted No , " saying : " We have been led to believe that we must make our health care choices only within the current structure of a predatory , for - profit insurance system which makes money not providing health care . "
Passing " legislation in which the government incentivizes the perpetuation , indeed the strengthening , of the for - profit health insurance industry ( exacerbates ) the very source of the problem .... Clearly , the insurance companies are the problem , not the solution . "
On March 17 , he reversed himself , saying : " .... after careful discussions with President Obama , Speaker Pelosi , Elizabeth my wife and close friends , I have decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation .
As this bill passes , I will renew my effort to help those state organizations which are aimed at stirring a single payer movement .... I have taken a detour through supporting this bill , but I know the destination I will continue to lead , for as long as it takes , whatever it takes to an America where health care will be firmly established as a civil right . "
He later said that not supporting the bill " would destroy Obama 's presidency , " a nonsensical view given Bill Clinton 's success despite his health care program failure and efforts to impeach him .
He survived , served two terms , and left office with a 68 % approval rating , matching Franklin Roosevelt at the end of his presidency .
On Democracy Now ( March 18 ) , Ralph Nader referred to " the latest chapter of corporate Democrats crushing progressive forces both inside their party and against third parties . "
It 's nothing new .
It happens every time reform is proposed .
Current legislation does n't " provide universal , comprehensive or affordable care to the American people .
It shovels hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money ( to predators that ) created the problem : the Aetnas , CIGNAs " and other insurers .
It requires no contractual accountability or other benefits for people denied coverage under a " pay - or - die system that is the disgrace of the Western world . "
For the drug cartel , " it 's a bonanza " heading right to their bottom line , including no government negotiated discounts , lengthy new drug patent protection periods to impede cheaper generic competition , and no reimportation of lower - priced foreign drugs to keep prices high and affordability low .
Further , there 's no public option , and the legislation mostly does n't kick in until 2014 .
It means " 180,000 Americans .... will die between now and ( then ) and hundreds of thousands of injuries and illnesses " will go untreated .
" There 's ( also ) no free choice of doctor and hospital under this .
There 's all kinds of exploit ( ive provisions to let ) health insurance ( and drug ) companies continue their ravenous ways over people who are ( the ) most vulnerable .... when they 're sick or injured . "
Who in Washington represents them when the few progressives side with the others .
It 's a sad moment when liberal Democrats caved .
" They 've all caved .
They 've all been put into line by the ( House ) majority rulers . "
It 's a shameless , but predictable climb - down .
They want to perpetuate a system that costs double per capita ( about $ 7,600 ) of other Western states and provides worse coverage .
In America , about 800 people die weekly because they can't afford insurance , enough of it , or insurers deny or delay their claims .
Will new legislation fix this ?
Not at all because providers , especially insurers , are notorious for gaming the system , and 2,500 pages of legislation contain loopholes , ambiguities , and legal interpretations that experts can easily manipulate to their advantage or create a process so onerous to contest that it amounts to the same thing .
Former CIGNA vice president , Wendell Potter , explained , saying Obamacare lets insurers shift costs to consumers , offer inadequate or unaffordable access , force Americans to pay higher deductibles for less coverage , and even scam subsidized consumers .
" What worries me , " he said , " is that people who are forced to buy coverage and all they can afford to buy is a high deductible .
( So ) if they get really sick , they have to pay so much out of their own pockets that they 're going to be filing for bankruptcy or ( lose ) their homes . "
Potter especially dislikes the Senate bill that will force many people to buy insurance only covering about 60 % of costs if they 're sick .
Many people have no insurance because it 's unaffordable .
" They certainly could n't afford premiums plus the out - of - pocket expenses in today 's market " that keeps hiking costs higher .
At best , Potter believes Obamacare will move millions of uninsured to underinsured , making them vulnerable to serious illness costs , the main cause of personal bankruptcies .
When it happens , no Obamacare provision protects them from losing their homes .
As for prohibiting pre-existing conditions , the Senate bill especially gives insurers " all the flexibility they need " to prevent people from accessing coverage .
Health history and age will determine premiums , so the chronically ill and aged will pay far more than the already unaffordable high rates .
The so - called medical - loss ratio is another problem .
It determines what percent of premiums cover medical costs .
The less restricted , the more profits ( in the billions of dollars ) , and less care for policyholders .
Nader points out that even with more people covered , prices are n't regulated , " junk insurance policies " will be offered , and there 's nothing to stop insurers " from taking this papier - mache bill and lighting a fire to it and making a mockery of it . "
They 're unhindered by controls , and no facility will " create a national consumer health organization " to give people " their own non-profit consumer lobby ( in ) Washington .
This is really a disaster . "
Obamacare forces coverage on consumers , assesses penalties for noncompliance , empowers the IRS to collect them , protects corporate profits , rations care , and dumps millions of Americans ( insured and millions left uninsured ) in the scrap heap to fend for themselves .
It 's not a step forward .
It 's a full - scale retreat .
Obama is like Bush .
He froze out dissenters , single - payer advocates , and surrounded himself with corporate hacks and warmongers .
It 's the same old , same old , the people getting scammed and harmed because no one in Washington represents them .
Unless they act on their own , they 'll get no help from politicians delivering the best reform money can buy , with no restrictions on spending amounts for it .
In June 2009 on a visit to Gaza , Jimmy Carter said " the citizens of Palestine are treated more like animals than like human beings . "
So will millions of Americans under Obamacare , a sellout scheme to provide less than they now have and charge more for it .
Kucinich said his constituents urged him to do something , rather than nothing even if it meant passing a bad bill .
Unfortunately , most people do n't know the tawdry fine print , that insurance giant Wellpoint wrote the Baucus bill , that corporations write virtually all legislation , that Obamacare gives America 's healthcare system to predatory insurers and Big PhRMA , something Kucinich , Bernie Sanders , other progressive Democrats understand , but capitulated anyway .
Why so ?
Despite his stated reasons , only Kucinich knows for sure , but here 's a guess .
Washington is notorious for pressuring , intimidating , and / or bribing members of Congress for support .
Kucinich may have been told , either vote yes or face a well - funded fall primary challenge that could succeed given the power of deep pockets and deceptive ads .
It 's a prospect no member of Congress relishes .
They could also take away his Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security , Emerging Threats and International Relations .
Whatever the reason , he may have tipped the balance with House , then Senate votes , imminent , perhaps as early as Sunday , March 21 .
Going first , it 's believed the House will use a controversial " self - executing rule " for a package of Senate bill fixes to " deem and pass " the entire bill that would otherwise fail .
The Senate will then consider the revised bill through " reconciliation , " requiring a simple majority to pass .
Self - executing has been used many times before , but never for a bill impacting health care for everyone , amounting to one - sixth of the economy .
It also bypasses the 1985 Byrd Rule that restricts reconciliation to budget revisions according to provisions under Section 313 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act .
What 's at stake ?
Plenty !
House and Senate bills will ration care , enrich providers , and make a dysfunctional system worse .
Hundreds of billions of Medicare cuts will harm seniors .
Most others will pay more , get less , and millions will remain uninsured .
According to an earlier AMA estimate , those covered " will face higher premiums , deductibles , copayments and coinsurance , effectively reducing the scope of their coverage , " what Wendell Potter explained above .
Business
Week magazine acknowledged it last August saying , " No matter what specifics emerge in the voluminous bill Congress may send to President Obama this fall ( or now ) , the insurance industry ( and drug cartel ) will emerge more profitable . "
Quoting an unnamed Senate Finance Committee staffer , " The bottom line is that health reform ( will ) lead to increased revenues and profits , " and for doubters , check current insurance and drug company stock prices for confirmation .
Relevant International Law Adequate health care is a human right , not a commodity for those who can afford it .
Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) states : " Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family , including food , clothing , housing and medical care .... "
Article 12 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic , Social & Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) states : " The State Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health ( including universally ensuring ) medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness .... government (s ) must ensure all citizens have ( affordable ) access to basic health services . "
Under international law , UDHR and ICESCR form the backbone of the right to health for everyone .
The UN Committee on Economic , Social , and Cultural Rights ( CESCR ) developed guidelines to implement it , including a " minimum floor " below which no country may fall , that for health ensures it , in terms of availability , accessibility , acceptability , quality , and universality without discrimination .
America 's Low Healthcare Delivery Ranking among Industrialized Nations
Of all industrialized countries , America is the only one that does n't recognize the right to health and a way to provide it .
In fact , in Maher v. Roe ( 1977 ) , the Supreme Court declared it unnecessary for Congress to require minimum health care standards .
The closest to it are Medicare and Medicaid .
Removing middleman insurers would save over $ 400 billion annually , enough to cover all the uninsured and provide quality care at lower overall cost .
Letting corporate predators game the system ensures the opposite , a problem Obamacare exacerbates .
In 1943 , Franklin Roosevelt proposed a Second Bill of Rights , declaring " freedom from want " an essential liberty necessary for security , including " the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve good health . "
Predatory insurers deny it .
Focusing on outcomes consistent with internationally - recognized standards is vital , not the right of business to commodify a human right , charge what they want , and deny access for those who can't afford it .
Obamacare will worsen the current system .
It 's about profits , not people , especially the nation 's poor , most vulnerable , and disadvantaged on society 's fringes , most hurt by all congressional measures , including one this vital .
What the 1913 Federal Reserve Act did for bankers , Obamacare may do for the insurance and drug cartels .

When it comes to his shadow run for Senate , Harold Ford is a New Yorker through and through .
When it comes to paying taxes , though , he 's still a Tennessean — he 's never filed a New York return .
Ford claims to have moved to New York three years ago , and says paying " New York taxes " makes him a New Yorker .
But his spokeswoman confirms to Gawker that he 's never filed a New York tax return — meaning that he 's never paid New York 's income tax , despite keeping an office and a residence in New York City as a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch since 2007 : " He pays New York taxes and will file a New York tax return in April for the first time , " Ford 's spokeswoman Tammy Sun told Gawker .
" He will file all necessary personal disclosure and tax forms that candidates are required to file if he chooses to run . "
( According to Sun , Ford admitted to the tax dodge yesterday at a press availability in Albany , but we can't find any news accounts mentioning the remarks . )
Ford presumably decided that his real home was Tennessee , which conveniently has no income tax .
Which means that , despite the fact that New York law requires part - time and nonresidents to pay income tax on money they earn in the state , Ford has shielded his entire Merrill Lynch salary from New York 's tax collectors for the past three years .
In fact , it seems like Tennessee 's lack of an income tax may be the best explanation for Ford 's rather complicated two - state life since 2007 — he clearly wanted to live in New York , and married a woman in 2008 who did live in New York .
But he made sure to keep a foot in a state whose tax code is friendly to rich guys like himself .
When Merrill Lynch announced Ford 's hiring in 2007 , it said he would be keeping offices in Nashville and New York City .
Ford has said that he 's basically lived in New York since then , though he never technically lived here until last year since he did n't " spend the requisite number of days " staying at his wife Emily Ford 's breathtakingly yellow apartment in the Flatiron district .
( " Moved is such a legal term , " he told the New York Times ) .
Ford was clearly thinking of New York 's 184 - day rule , which requires that part - time residents who spend 184 or more days living in the state pay New York taxes on all their income .
What he seems to have forgotten is that New York has gone to great pains to prevent wealthy people like him from spending time and earning money in the state and then jetting off to a tax haven come April 15 :
It also requires nonresidents and people who live there fewer than 184 days to pay New York income taxes on whatever portion of their income they earned in the state .
If Ford did enough business in New York to keep an office there , its reasonable to presume that he earned a good deal of money in New York .
Now , we 're sure that there are all sorts of accountants ' arguments and narrow dodges at Ford 's disposal to claim that he did n't owe New York income tax until he moved here last year :
He could have been paid out of Merrill Lynch 's Nashville office , for instance , and he could have received the majority of his income in a bonus that he could claim he earned in Tennessee , not New York .
But while those sorts of arguments may be useful to someone trying to get as close as possible to living in New York without suffering the tax consequences of doing so , they 're not as effective when you 're loudly thinking about running for Senate in New York by claiming you 've lived there for three years and pay taxes there .
So what taxes is Ford talking about , if he 's never paid income tax in New York ?
We 've asked Sun , and have n't heard back .
The most pathetic ( and , by our lights , likely ) answer is New York City 's 8.875 % sales tax , though Ford could also be talking about sharing in property taxes on Ford 's apartment , or paying quarterly estimated tax payments on his freelance income as an MSNBC talking head , which he might have started paying last year once he decided to break that 184 - day barrier and commit to New York .
Or perhaps he instructed Merrill Lynch to start withholding New York taxes from his salary when he established residency in 2009 .
And when precisely , did that happen , by the way ?
According to this Federal Election Committee filing recording a donation Ford made to Colorado Sen .
Mike Bennet , he was still using his Memphis address as recently as September 29 of last year — 98 days before he announced his interest in Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand 's seat .
CLARIFICATION :
This post originally said that " Ford has presumably chosen to instead file in his other home Tennessee , which conveniently has no income tax . "
That was changed to reflect the fact that , since Tennessee has no income tax , there 's actually no return to file there .
SECOND CLARIFICATION : A reader points out that Tennessee does have an income tax on dividends and interest , just not wages , so Ford actually almost certainly did file there .

As the baby boomer generation matures , we are going to start hearing more about syndrome X. Syndrome X is also called the metabolic syndrome and it is something we need to be aware of .
What is Syndrome X ( Metabolic Syndrome )
Syndrome X is actually a group of medical conditions that can lead to more serious medical conditions and heart disease .
Syndrome X has been known about for many years , more recently it is being mentioned more , since it is becoming more common and more of a concern .
The medical conditions in a person that are associated with syndrome X includes insulin resistance , high cholesterol , high blood pressure and usually overweight or obese .
The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , American Heart Association and other institutes agree that if a person has three or more of the following symptoms they have syndrome X or metabolic syndrome .
High blood pressure : A reading of 135/80 or higher .
Or the person is already taking blood pressure medicine .
Belly fat defined as a waist size of 40 ” ( 102 cm ) or larger for men and 35 ” ( 89 cm ) or greater for women .
Cholesterol : A low HDL ( the good cholesterol ) reading .
For men , less than 40 mg / dl and for women , less than 50 mg / dl is low , or is already using cholesterol lowering medicine .
Cholesterol : A high triglyceride reading of 150 mg / dl or higher .
Or you are already using cholesterol lowering medicine .
Blood sugar : A high fasting glucose level of 100 mg /dl .
The Causes of Syndrome X ( Metabolic Syndrome )
Syndrome X is not a single disease but a collection of symptom or risk factors .
Some experts say they do n’t know why certain people get metabolic syndrome .
Other experts say that it can be genetic ; if your family history includes type II diabetes or heart disease you could be at a higher risk for syndrome X .
And still another group of doctors believe that metabolic syndrome is a direct result of the rise in junk foods , processed foods and the over consumption of sugar and high fructose corn syrup .
The increase of metabolic syndrome corresponds with the rise in obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) .
Symptoms of Syndrome X ( Metabolic Syndrome )
High blood pressure is a sign that a person could be in the beginning stages of metabolic syndrome .
High blood pressure can be present in people without the other signs , like overweight or diabetes .
So that could be a wake up call .
High blood pressure is certainly a sign that should be taken seriously and start watching for the other symptoms .
If you find you have high blood pressure , there are natural ways you can lower your blood pressure without medicine before it becomes serious .
Insulin Resistance .
Insulin is a hormone that controls the metabolism of carbohydrates .
When we eat carbohydrates , our digestive system turns this food into glucose .
Glucose is a simple sugar that gives us energy and is important for muscles and brain functions .
This glucose then travels through our blood and is called blood glucose or blood sugar .
When the pancreas sees this blood glucose , it then makes insulin .
Insulin meets the glucose and this combination is what allows the glucose to enter the cells of muscles and the brain to do its job .
Insulin resistance occurs when the cells of the body do not respond properly to the insulin .
Then the pancreas continues to make more and more insulin so that the glucose can enter the cells of the brain , muscles and other parts of the body .
Many times a person with insulin resistance will have high levels of insulin and glucose in their blood at the same time .
Insulin resistance is basically where the proper amount of insulin cannot do its job getting the glucose into the needed areas of the body .
So the pancreas continues to make more insulin until at some point the pancreas cannot keep up with the need to continue producing insulin .
This increases the risk of a person getting type II diabetes .
Cholesterol levels .
HDL is the good cholesterol and LDL is the bad .
I remember this by thinking the H in HDL means happy .
HDL is easy to measure , but LDL is n’t as easy to measure .
There are actually two types of LDL .
A small amount of cholesterol is needed by our body for various functions and is made in the liver .
You also get cholesterol from animal foods like dairy , meat , poultry and fish .
Too much cholesterol from foods can raise your cholesterol levels .
You can raise your HDL and lower your LDL levels by quitting smoking , exercise , losing weight and eating healthier fats from olive and peanut oils , nuts , fish , flax seed and other omega - 3 containing foods .
Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood and they come from too much sugar , alcohol , untreated or poorly managed diabetes and too many calories .
This excess is then converted and stored in the body as fat .
A high triglyceride level combined with a low HDL level is a sign you could have heart disease or are at an increased risk .
Belly fat is dangerous to our health more than having fat around the thighs or hips .
There are two types of belly fat , outside of the abdominal muscles and inside the abdominal muscles .
Inside is worse because fat does n’t belong there and it is too close to the internal organs .
Weighing yourself can also fool you .
Weight takes into account water , muscle and fat .
By measuring your waist and your hips , you come up with the waist to hip ratio .
Divide the waist in inches by the hips in inches .
A ratio of more than .95 for men and more than .80 for women is considered too high .
Conclusion
Syndrome X or metabolic syndrome will be something we start hearing more about .
Whether you have or do n’t have genetic reasons for these symptoms , you should be aware of them and take measures to keep them from becoming worse .
Syndrome X starts with a bad diet , which leads to belly fat .
Being overweight then leads to high blood pressure and bad cholesterol readings .
Belly fat creeps up on us until it just seems like it ’s there .
Just because you are into middle age does n’t mean you have to have the middle age belly or any of the symptoms of Syndrome X or metabolic syndrome .

They ’re Here , They ’re Queer , It ’s No Big Deal
Viewed from Israel , the continuing witch hunt against gays and lesbians in the U.S. military makes little sense .
I have studied and written about the experience of gay soldiers in elite combat units of the Israel Defense Forces , where restrictions on gay enlistment were lifted in 1993 , the same year the United States introduced the " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " policy requiring gay and lesbian servicemembers to say in the closet or risk being discharged .
There has never been any suggestion that the participation of these men has hindered the performance of Israeli combat units .
The United States and Turkey are now the only NATO military powers that do not allow gays to serve openly , but Israel and other countries have shown that the participation of gay soldiers in combat units presents no risk for military effectiveness .
What ’s more , acknowledging their presence might even improve unite cohesion .
It is important to understand that even without restrictions , most gay soldiers do not " come out " in combat settings .
Only a few of the soldiers I have interviewed confided their sexuality in friends from the unit , and they often did so shortly before leaving their position .
Most of them developed strategies to separate between their various personal and social identities .
One soldier , a gay activist prior to his enlistment , explained to me : " I do n’t really see that the army and my identity have anything to do with each other .
Just like there is a separation of religion and state , I draw a line between the army and my ‘ religion . ’"
This ability to balance conflicting identities is hardly unusual in the army .
Soldiers of various ethnic and religious backgrounds similarly adjust to the melting pot of military culture .
This is why the policy of " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " has little relevance to the reality of military life .
Despite what military officials want to ask or insist on not asking , and despite what gay activists want soldiers to tell about their sexuality , most straight soldiers are not interested in hearing it , and many gay soldiers are not interested in telling it .
They simply are what they are and find ways to function together .
Policies restricting the participation of gay soldiers paradoxically make sexuality a more salient issue .
Opponents of allowing gays to serve openly often point to the aggressive macho culture that dominates military units .
But it is also hardly news that the military is a male - dominated homo - social institution based on intimate emotions between fellow soldiers .
From the ancient Greeks , Romans , and Vikings to modern Israelis and Americans , close male bonding is a widely acknowledged component of military acumen .
Regardless of sexual orientation , soldiers ’ erotic tensions are managed , controlled , and then channeled and used as an aggressive driving force to strike the enemy .
" Do n’t ask , do n’t tell " has made things more complicated not only for gays but also for straights in the military .
In the Israeli military , the lack of a legal penalty for disclosing one ’s sexual identity means that " over- affectionate " pals can choose to confirm or deny homosexual preferences to their fellow soldiers .
But when " telling " is not an option , suspicion and paranoia of prevail .
The paradox is that when gays are allowed in the military , but not allowed to identify as such , everyone becomes suspected of being gay .
It is no wonder that a rise in sexual harassment and homophobic crimes have been reported in the U.S. military ever since the " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " policy was introduced .
When intimacy and sexuality — which are , like it or not , key features of masculine military culture — cannot be negotiated , cannot be told and discussed , they may be turned inwards , transformed into an urge to hunt fellow soldiers .
Israel ’s experience is a valuable starting point for the Pentagon as it begins to study what overturning " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " would mean .
First , it is by now well - acknowledged that the mere participation of gays in combat units of the Israel Defense Forces has had no bearing on military performance and unit cohesion , whether or not soldiers come out .
Second , Israel ’s experience shows that the presentation of the debate as a problem of accepting " open gays " is misleading .
The dilemma of " exposure " is merely a distortion produced by the current U.S. policy .
Israel has prevented sexual orientation to become a source of cause disruption by treating it as a fact of life rather than a problem to be addressed .
In Israel , military authorities have kept gay enlistment a minor concern by sticking to a minimal strategy : officially acknowledge the full participation of gays and at the same time ignore them as a group that may require special needs .
Gay soldiers do not receive , and do not expect to receive , any special treatment in combat settings .
It is simply a non-issue .
If the U.S. government will adopt a similar course , it could enjoy not only a more liberal military , but also , perhaps , a more combat - effective one where the focus is on defeating the enemy rather than questioning fellow soldiers .
At a time when Americans are attempting to lead a campaign against terror and foreign dictatorships in the name of democracy , they should be more apprehensive of what is happening in their own military backyard .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday threw cold water on efforts to push a major new fiscal stimulus package .
At his confirmation hearing for a second term as chairman , Bernanke emphasized that the government has spent less than half of the money in the $ 787 - billion package passed earlier this year and that analysts are still determining its impact .
" Only about 30 percent of the funds have been disbursed , " Bernanke said .
" It 's a little bit early to make a strong judgment , a little bit early to decide whether or not to do additional fiscal actions . "
President Barack Obama is holding a " jobs summit " to explore additional ways to bolster the economy .
The 10.2 percent unemployment rate is the highest in a generation and many analysts expect the unemployment rate to average above 10 percent throughout next year .
House and Senate Democrats are exploring additional fiscal options , including infrastructure and transportation spending , extended unemployment benefits and more money for small bank loans .
Convicted high - ranking officials include a circuit court judge , county clerk and school superintendent
Each face up to 20 years in broad conspiracy that included manipulation of electronic voting machines ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/25/2010 , 3:24 pm PT
All eight defendants in Clay County , Kentucky 's election fraud trial have been found guilty today by a federal jury .
Six of those eight were high - ranking election officials , including the county clerk , a circuit judge and the school superintendent .
The conspirators were charged with having manipulated federal elections in 2002 , 2004 and 2006 by buying and selling votes and manipulating electronic voting machines .
According to AP , each of the now - convicted felons could face up to 20 years in prison for what prosecutors had described as a conspiracy to manipulate elections for decades in the rural , heavily Republican county .
In additional to federal racketeering , several of the defendants were also convicted of charges that included mail fraud , extortion and laundering money used to buy votes .
The BRAD BLOG has been following this story since the conspirators were originally arrested in March of last year , and as details of the election officials ' manipulation of ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting machines has emerged ...
Supporters of unverifiable electronic voting , such as election officials and voting machines companies , had long argued that , though manipulation of such systems was possible , nobody had actually ever done so .
While that dubious argument was difficult to independently verify one way or another --- since the private vendors make public oversight of such systems virtually impossible by blocking citizen inspection and oversight of such systems due to claims of " trade secrecy " --- the denialists arguments are no longer valid .
Furthermore , the verdict underscores what many critics of e-voting have long argued : the greatest security threat to such systems come from election insiders , not from the voting public and dubious claims of " voter fraud " .
We recently detailed the testimony of one of the witnesses in the case who described how she was trained by the county 's chief election official , Clerk Freddy Thompson ( one of those convicted today ) , to change votes cast by voters on the county 's ES&S touch - screen voting systems after they 'd left the voting booth .
The witness , Wanda
White also detailed how she was instructed to change her own voter registration from Republican to Democratic so that she could serve as a Democratic precinct official .
The ES&S iVotronic touch - screen systems secretly manipulated by the cabal of election officials in Kentucky to change voter 's votes , are used in a total of 18 states , including Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Indiana , Kansas , Missouri , Mississippi , North Carolina , New Jersey , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Wisconsin and West Virginia .
And , just for good measure , we 'll take this opportunity to remind readers , yet again , that the community organization ACORN --- who has long been used as a red-herring by the Republican Party to suggest the existence of massive Democratic " voter fraud " --- has never been charged with , or found guilty of aiding in the illegal casting of a single vote .
Ever .
Anywhere .
No actual evidence has ever been presented in support of such a charge either .
Nonetheless , a recent survey by the the non-partisan polling outfit , Research 2000 found that one in five ( 21 % ) self - identified Republicans believe that ACORN stole the 2008 election for Barack Obama .
Another 55 % are " not sure " if they did or not .

UPDATE 3/26/10 : Lexington Herald - Leader 's Bill Estep , the local reporter who has owned this story for the past year , offering top - notch coverage every step of the way , offers some excellent details on the convictions today along with background on the entire sprawling conspiracy , including the $ 3.2 million the conspirators have been found liable for " based on the salaries and contracts they were able to get as a result of illegal acts . "
Yes , it was a huge money - making proposition for the folks involved , and this federal prosecution only covered the elections from 2002 to 2006 .
At one point during the trial , defendant R. Cletus Maricle , formerly the Circuit Court Judge , admitted to having bought votes in 1983 ( but claimed he had n't done so since ) .
Estep also notes there could be more related indictments in the future .
" The verdict raised the possibility that more people could be charged with vote fraud in the county , " he writes .
" Prosecutors and witnesses at the trial identified a number of others , including former and current public officials , who allegedly took part in buying votes . "
We 'll recommend Estep 's coverage in full , but here are a few items of note worth flagging here from his report :
A bit about how the vote - machine rigging worked ( since the AP report we linked to above had n't offered details ) ...
In 2006 , with the FBI a persistent presence in town , Maricle and others tried a new vote - fraud tactic that involved fewer people than buying votes — stealing votes , the indictment said .
The county had new voting machines that year that required people to push two buttons after making their choices — one to review choices and the second to record them .
That created opportunity for a scam in which corrupt precinct officers duped people into thinking they had voted after pressing the first button , then switched the votes , according to trial testimony .
Thompson , Jones and Stivers helped " school " her in how to do that when she worked as a precinct officer in May 2006 , Wanda White testified .
On how widespread the election fraud had become in Clay County ...
Testimony at the trial indicated that vote - buying has been chronic and widespread in the county , to the point many people saw nothing wrong with it .
After Eugene " Mutton " Lewis , a convicted drug dealer who said he'd bought votes for decades , described a candidate giving him $ 1,000 and asking for help , a defense attorney asked whether there were n't ways to help a candidate besides buying votes .
" Not that I know of , " Lewis responded .
And finally , Estep 's report ends on a hopeful note for democracy in the county which has been racked by years - long federal investigations and multiple prosecutions of high - ranking officials for narcotics trafficking , witness intimidation and election rigging in what had become an entirely political machine - owned - and - run corner of the state ...
Manchester Mayor Carmen Webb Lewis said there are a lot of good people in Clay County .
Election corruption had caused many to become disillusioned with politics , and even to stop voting , but federal agents ' work to root out corruption is changing that , she said .
One sign is that there are people running for office this year who would n't have before , she said .
" That is kind of uplifting .
I think it 's wonderful , " she said of the investigation , " and so many people do . "

Jonathan Blow gave a talk recently at Champlain College .
The subject of the talk was a game design philosophy in which you ask questions of the universe and then are open and attentive to the answers .
In Jon ’s view , game systems are like scientific instruments that can reveal complex and fascinating truths about the world .
It ’s a terrific talk , and you can download the whole thing here .
Jon ’s talk made me think of what a couple of brilliant game designers said at GDC .
In two separate talks Sid Meier and Rob Pardo talked about how players consistently misunderstood , and were frustrated by , randomness .
For example players , like most people , tend to subscribe to the “ gambler ’s fallacy ” , the mistaken intuition that random events are spread evenly over time instead of clumping , well , randomly as they actually do .
This is the fallacy that leads people to expect a flipped coin to be less likely to land heads after a run of heads .
Pardo and Meier both described the same solution to this problem , which was to alter the behavior of the game to correspond more closely to the player ’s intuition about how randomness should behave .
For example , if you have an event that is 50 % likely to occur , and it does n’t occur , then you make it 60 % likely on the next attempt , 70 % likely after that , and so on until it is certain .
Voilà !
A coin that is less likely to come up heads twice in a row , and never has a run of more than 6 heads .
Now , Rob Pardo and Sid Meier are amazing game designers and it ’s a privilege to hear them speak .
Both talks were full of invaluable insights from practitioners at the top of their profession .
But this particular detail really stuck in my head , and rolled around there with Margaret Robertson ’s microtalk about behavioral economics and Chris Hecker ’s talk about external reward systems , and the numerous discussions of Zynga ’s quantitative , behaviorist , social - game design methodology that loomed over the whole conference like Chernabog glaring down from Bald Mountain .
Eventually this tiny detail , this thoughtful little adjustment of the pillow beneath the player ’s head , became emblematic of something big and important at the heart of game design :
Should n’t games be an opportunity for players to wrap their heads around counter - intuitive truths ?
Should n’t games make us smarter about how randomness works instead of reinforcing our fallacious beliefs ?
Should n’t games increase our literacy about interactive systems and non-linear possibility spaces ?
Is n’t contemplating the elusive truth about these things one of the most powerful cognitive benefits of a life spent gaming ?
And is n’t it therefore our job and our responsibility to guide players along that rocky path , no matter how uncomfortable it might seem , and at least give them a chance to glimpse the truth and begin to approach it and acquire something far more valuable than comfort , rather than making them a bed on the near side of that stony ground ?
Ok , so maybe not all games have to confront players with difficult universal truths , some games should indulge our superstitions and muffle us in comfort .
But we ’re talking about SID MEIER and ROB PARDO here !
We ’re talking about Civilization and Starcraft !
We ’re talking pinnacle of computer games , games whose legacies will reverberate for generations .
And if we have used computers to build intentional flaws into the numerical heart of our deepest and most cerebral games instead of using them to elevate our understanding of the computational heart of the universe , then we ’re doing something wrong .
One of the greatest gaming experiences of my life was the way that Poker forced me to re-program my own kludgy understanding of probability .
It took me a few years of dedicated play and study , years that included as much suffering as they did joy , and moreover in which the joys were somehow uniquely bound up in the suffering .
But eventually I got to a place where sometimes I get a little glimpse of the world - as - probability , of the Bayseian logic that boils beneath the solid cause - and - effect surfaces of my everyday , results - oriented consciousness .
And let ’s not forget that Poker , which refuses to bend to our cognitive biases , which takes our naive misconceptions about the world and beats us mercilessly with them and mocks our numerical ignorance and offers only the most dedicated , hardworking players an opportunity to slowly and painfully approach the truth , also happens to be more popular than Farmville .
I HAVE been an archaeologist or a museum manager for 40 years .
I know that throughout most of history , people have been reluctant to identify the phenomenon of overpopulation .
Instead they usually choose to see ethnic conflict , genocide , migration , invasion , famine , drought , civil war , religious war , plague , pestilence , overcrowding or the failure of governments .
So , like many others , I sat almost speechless in the audience of The Courier - Mail 's first Our Future , Your Say forum on growth issues on February 22 as Premier Anna Bligh and Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman trotted out the myths of growth , one by one .
They congratulated each other on both being victims of unavoidable growth , and on their success in supplying more infrastructure to meet growing demand .
Conspicuously missing from the debate was the O word – " over- population " .
Where Newman sees not enough buses , tunnels or bridges , I see too many cars and their drivers .
Where Bligh sees a dry period and calls it a water crisis , I see too many people for a land of variable rainfall .
Where the mining industry sees a skills shortage , I see excessive corporate greed .
When Bligh mentions the housing affordability problem and suggests a key solution is the release of new greenfield sites , I see a Government ignoring one of the most obvious prices that the community pays for the resources boom .
When Bligh says you cannot impose population caps , I am deeply puzzled .
Is that not exactly what regional and neighbourhood plans do all the time ?
When Bligh and Newman become fellow victims , shrug their shoulders and say " of course we need a national population policy " ( to deal with the awkward issues they do n't want to mention ) , I am amazed .
We do have a national population policy – it is to reward people for having more children , to maintain high immigration levels , and to ignore water shortage , biodiversity loss , loss of agricultural land , etc .
When Bligh says you cannot tell Australians to limit the number of children they have , she ignores the reality that every night and day , millions of Australian women and men actively take steps to prevent conception ; what is unusual in world history is a government policy ( and the culture that comes with it ) encouraging people to conceive .
I want to hear something new that will break us out of the growth trap .
We need government - funded studies of real alternatives to growth .
How about doing real , triple bottom - line accounting of the economic , social and environmental costs and benefits of closing the Galilee Basin coal fields for three decades ?
Or how about creating a larger community of car - free people by a planning requirement that in all new inner-city developments , car parking spaces be limited to one park per two dwellings , supported by legislation requiring banks to lend to buyers of homes without parking spaces ?
Will we Australians ever elect a no - growth or low - growth politician ?
As a history teacher said to me the other day , Australian history is working - class history .
We like to dig and dam things , burn and build .
Bligh might get re-elected by wearing a hard hat , but not by quoting philosophers .
Growth is a mindset we must always challenge .
And let us not avoid the O word – at least for the sake of rational and balanced debate , if not for the sake of our health and humanity .
Richard Cassels is director of Climate Leadership .
The final of The Courier - Mail 's Our Future Your Say series on growth issues is tonight , 6 pm , State Library of Queensland 's main auditorium , South Bank .

Here 's a factoid : I was up to my neck in Final Fantasy XII when Dragon Age : Origins came out . *
The culture shock of traveling from Ivalice to Ferelden was like jumping into a frozen lake .
It 's not surprising then , that Drs. Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk , CEO and vie-president of BioWare , do n't seem particularly stoked about Square Enix ' most recent behemoth .
" I 've been reading some reviews [ of Final Fantasy XIII ] , " Muzyka said .
" That may be on the bottom of my list right now .
It 's kind of a question mark .
It would have been right up there before I read about it , but some of this other stuff is probably more pressing . "
And Zeschuk chimed in with his own reservations about the game 's development time : " It 's really interesting .
They 're trying to do something different , which is admirable , but it 's hard .
They also had a very long development cycle .
They may have been aiming at a real interesting spot at one point , but then too much time goes by .
Not only are there a lot of games , but they are coming out fast . "
I do n't want to suggest that the Good Doctors are being malicious or dishonest ; but , in terms of how role - playing fans will spend their time and money this month , I doubt Dragon Age : Awakenings really appreciates the stiff competition from Final Fantasy XIII .
For what it 's worth , what I 've been reading about Final Fantasy XIII makes me want to play it ( Jim 's rather scathing review notwithstanding ) .
But Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk make some of the most popular and acclaimed videogames of all time , and I 'm probably going to eat a ham sandwich for dinner , so you pick whose advice to take .
And I have n't even trashed any of my competitors in , like , the past half hour .
BioWare Head : FF XIII " On the Bottom Of My List " [ GameInformer ]
DETROIT ( AP ) — General Motors Co. said Wednesday it will shut down Hummer after its bid to sell the brand to a Chinese company collapsed .
Heavy equipment maker Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines Co. pulled out of the deal for Hummer , known for its hulking , military - like SUVs , because it was unable to get clearance from Chinese regulators within the proposed deal timeframe , the manufacturer said in a separate statement .
GM said it will continue to honor existing Hummer warranties .
" We are disappointed that the deal with Tengzhong could not be completed , " said John Smith , GM vice president of corporate planning and alliances .
" GM will now work closely with Hummer employees , dealers and suppliers to wind down the business in an orderly and responsible manner . "
GM has been trying to sell the loss - making brand for the last year and found a suitor in Tengzhong , but resistance from Chinese regulators created difficulties from the start .
As recently as Tuesday private investors were trying to set up an offshore entity in a last - minute effort to complete the acquisition head of a Feb. 28 deadline .
Hummer is the second brand after Saturn that GM has failed to sell as part of its restructuring .
GM sold Swedish brand Saab to Dutch carmaker Spyker Cars NV earlier this year .
Pontiac is being discontinued .
GM is focusing its efforts on its four remaining brands : Chevrolet , GMC , Cadillac and Buick .
It seems that ugly crowd of protestors harassing members of Congress in the Capitol complex this afternoon got even uglier than we thought .
As noted earlier , in addition to menacing behavior toward multiple members of Congress , one protestor called Rep. Barney Frank a “ faggot ” , a taunt greeted by laughter from fellow protestors .
We ’re now getting reports that other protestors yelled “ nigger ” at Rep. John Lewis ( D - GA ) .
More shortly .
Late Update : Our account of the ugliness , from our two reporters on the Hill .
If you 've been following the development of South at all , you 'll know that 0.7 has been quite a while in the making .
I 've been busy working away at a big code refactor , along with Simon Law , who has gained the title of " Knowing Too Much About Migrations " .
However , there are some user - facing changes as well , some quite significant .
While my release notes go into some detail on what 's new , the major changes include :
New command names .
The old startmigration was getting a little overloaded and was n't too well - named , so it 's been split into schemamigration and datamigration commands .
No more issues with missing defaults .
South realises you need a default for NOT NULL columns now , and prompts you if you forget to specify one as you 're making the migration , instead of dying when you try to apply it .
Django 1.2 and MultiDB support .
As well as supporting the latest and greatest incarnation of the universe 's best web framework , 0.7 also has some limited MultiDB support , in the form of a - - database option ( that works like the option of the same name on the new syncdb command in Django ) .
Custom fields are no longer magically used .
Instead , you now have to actually tell South about them .
We 're working on docs to make this a bit easier - it's an ease - of - use regression , which I 'm not too keen on - but it 's needed to stop things mysteriously failing in your migrations a few weeks down the line .
As I said above , read the new long - form release notes for much more on the release .
If the release candidate proves to have sufficiently few bugs that I can fix them in time , 0.7 will be released next Thursday , the 25th March .
So , please , install the release candidate and try it out !
Gordon Brown 's treatment of his staff has come under further scrutiny after an anti-bullying charity said several Downing Street employees had called its helpline seeking advice and counselling .
Christine Pratt , the chief executive of the National Bullying Helpline , said that the charity had been called three or four times in recent months by members of Brown 's office over his behaviour .
" I have personally taken a call from staff in the Prime Minister 's office , staff who believe they are working in a bullying culture and that it has caused them some stress , " she said .
" We would have hoped Gordon Brown would lead by example .
If an employer receives complaints , they should investigate . "
She added that she spoke out in anger at No 10's " outright denial " of claims that the prime minister bullied and abused staff .
It was reported on Sunday that Sir Gus O'Donnell , the head of the civil service , had warned Brown about his treatment of personnel .
The allegation is contained in a new book by the Observer 's chief political commentator Andrew Rawnsley .
The End of the Party reports that O'Donnell intervened informally to " calm down frightened duty clerks , badly - treated phone operators and other bruised staff by telling them : ' Do n't take it personally ' . "
Labour MP
Anne Snelgrove , who is Brown 's parliamentary private secretary , said the charity " needs to demonstrate that these questions really have come from staff at Number 10 " .
" Why is she [ Ms Pratt ] going public with this rather than taking it up privately if these phone calls were genuine ? "
Downing Street said it had never been contacted by the charity about the allegations , a No 10 spokesman adding that it had " rigorous , well established procedures " for " staff to address any concerns over inappropriate treatment or behaviour " .

The marchers and supporters all got red carnations as a symbol :
Cliff Frasier , who played an important role in planning the march , explains the symbolism of these carnations and what we are hoping those of who can join us on this march will do as part of this action .
" Every 12 minutes , on average , a person dies in our country for lack of health insurance , according to a recent study released by Harvard Science .
This results in approximately 1,000 deaths every 8 - days .
March to the Finish Line for Melanie is an 8 - day march from Philadelphia to Washington D.C.
As our elected leaders continue debating reform , we are losing the voices of those most in need of affordable and accessible healthcare .
Marchers will carry 1,000 carnations into Washington and lay them on the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building , memorializing the mounting human cost of doing nothing .
These flowers will also represent community support for March to the Finish Line for Melanie , as volunteers from advocacy and religious organizations will donate bouquets of carnations along the route .
Please donate a bouquet – or several ( preferred color : red , but any color will be appreciated ) .
We need to gather 1,000 stems of carnations over the course of the 8 day march .
Meet the marchers at one of the rallies or meet - up locations along the route , and add your donation of carnations to March to the Finish Line for Melanie .
For more information on how to donate carnations , call : 917-359-9281 . "
From Philadelphia , the marchers headed out of town and held a candlelight vigil at Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park , PA last night :
Today , the march continues with rallies in Delaware .
Stay tuned for more pictures !
Meanwhile , around the country , thousands more were taking it to the streets to send this message .
Folks were out with pitchforks and torches in Connecticut :
And hundreds rallied outside of Aetna 's headquarters in Chicago :
In Los Angeles , hundreds rallied outside of Anthem Blue Cross 's offices , which just increased rates in California by as much as 39 % :
In Missouri , a memorial and rally was held in memory of Melanie Shouse :
In New Mexico , hundreds came out to ask Senator Udall to support reconciliaton as a way to finish health reform right :
Out west in Oregon , hundreds rallied :
And up north in Washington , almost ten thousand people rallied on the steps of the state capitol to send a clear message - we want health care done now , and done right :
In West Virginia , hundreds gathered to hear Senator Rockefeller and urge him to get health reform done and get it done right :
I 'll have more photos from Melanie 's March and other events around the country as they come in .
Click here to find an event in your area and attend - we need you to raise your voice with us to win real health care reform !

Mancher kennt das ja : Noch ein Vergehen , und der Lappen ist erst mal weg .
Ähnliches muss nun auch Lewis Hamilton im Hinterkopf haben - und sozusagen um seinen Formel - 1 - Führerschein bangen .
Der WM - Führende war nach dem Riesenwirbel beim Großen Preis von Russland um Startübungen und eine Zeitstrafe zwar milde davongekommen , nachdem die Rennkommissare die zunächst verhängte Sanktion von zwei Punkten auf Hamiltons Superlizenz wieder zurücknahmen .
Allerdings trennt Hamilton nur noch wenig von einer Rennsperre , was Toto Wolff ebenso Sorgen bereitet .
Der Mercedes - Teamchef hatte bereits im Sotschi vor der Rücknahme der zwei Punkte beunruhigt erklärt : " Wir wissen , dass wir ganz knapp dran sind an einer Rennsperre .

Surer lässt denn auch kein gutes Haar an dem 35 - Jährigen , der nach seiner Zeitstrafe gewütet hatte ( " Mann , das ist so lächerlich " ) : " Hamilton geht ans Ende der Boxenausfahrt und übt da , wo die Autos schon mit hoher Geschwindigkeit aus der Box rauskommen , dann ist das einerseits gefährlich und zweitens habe ich nicht verstanden , warum er überhaupt auf die Idee kommt , da hinzugehen " , sagte der ehemalige Formel - 1 - Pilot und BMW - Rennleiter im AvD Motorsport Magazin auf SPORT1 .
Auch der frühere Formel - 1 - Fahrer Karl Wendlinger zeigte sich fassungslos : " Er ist schon lange genug in der Formel 1 dabei .
Es gibt Regeln , auch in den anderen Motorsport - Klassen .
Das sollte man schon wissen , wo man seinen Start machen darf . "
Mit Blick auf das nächste Rennen bleibt die Situation brisant für Mercedes und Hamilton , der immer wieder mal für einen Rüpel - Anfall gut ist .
Hamilton gelobt Besserung " Ich muss halt sicherstellen , künftig eine weiße Weste zu wahren " , gelobte der F1 - Dominator , auf den im Strafpunkte - Ranking erst mit weitem Abstand Alexander Albon ( Red Bull / 5 Punkte ) folgt , nun immerhin Besserung .
" Ich muss sicherstellen , dass ich keinen keinen Grund liefere , nicht mal eine Andeutung , dass die Rennkommissare aktiv werden .
" Zumal sich Hamilton noch viel größerem Spott der Konkurrenz ausgesetzt sehen dürfte , sollte er nun tatsächlich eine Sperre beziehen .
" Ich weiß gar nicht , wer die Ersatzfahrer bei Mercedes sind , aber ich würde denken , dass man sie ins Fitnessstudio schickt , nur für den Fall der Fälle " , stichelte Red-Bull - Teamchef Christian Horner zuletzt .
Ein
Thema , mit dem sich Sebastian Vettel und Ferrari im Übrigen nicht auseinander setzen müssten : Der Ferrari - Pilot steht angesichts von 0 Strafpunkten gänzlich unbefleckt da .
Aber vielleicht ist der Heppenheimer wegen des deutschen Zentralverkehrsregisters auch schlichtweg mehr sensibilisiert als Hamilton ...

One of the founding fathers of the personal computing era , Microsoft Research technical fellow Chuck Thacker , has won the Association for Computing Machinery ’s A.M. Turing Award , which is often called the “ Nobel Prize of computer science . ”
The award , which was announced today , comes with a $ 250,000 prize , sponsored by Intel and Google .
Thacker , 67 , was awarded the prize for his design of the Alto , the first modern personal computer with networking capabilities , which he built while at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s .
It had a TV - like display , which enabled the development of the modern graphical user interface , as well as connections to outside devices like servers and printers .
Although the Alto was never commercialized , it influenced generations of PCs in the decades that followed .
Thacker was also cited for his contributions to the Ethernet local - area network , the first multiprocessor workstation , and a tablet PC prototype .
I spoke with Thacker by phone this morning — he ’s based at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley .
“ I was actually flabbergasted when I was told ” about the award , he says .
“ Never in my wildest dreams did I think I ’d win . ”
That ’s because the Turing Award traditionally has been given to theoreticians or software experts , not hardware people .
The previous Microsoft winners of the Turing Award are the late Jim Gray , Butler Lampson of Microsoft Research New England , and Tony Hoare of Microsoft Research Cambridge in the U.K .
( Thacker is also a recipient of the Charles Stark Draper Prize and the John von Neumann Medal from the IEEE . )
Thacker says the most interesting thing about the Alto computer was that “ it was a complete system . ”
It connected to servers that stored information remotely and to printers that produced documents .
Although the hardware looked “ quaint ” by today ’s standards , he says , the software behind it persisted .
In particular , the user interface — keyboard , mouse , how you interact with programs — looked a lot like what we still use today .
So I asked him how he thinks computing interfaces might evolve in the future , given how little they ’ve changed in 30 years .
Thacker says he thinks about it from the point of view of what computers have not been able to do so far .
“ One thing I ca n’t do yet is talk to my computer , ” he says .
“ I ca n’t carry on a conversation , and I ’d like to see that . ”
A second area of intrigue is computer - controlled cars and transportation .
“ I ’m not that great a driver .
The dents in my door demonstrate that , ” Thacker says .
“ Computers should drive . ”
( He says he has followed the DARPA Grand Challenge competitions for driverless vehicles for the past few years . )
Given his work at Microsoft Research in tablet computing in the late 1990s — which helped lead to Microsoft ’s first Tablet PC — I asked Thacker where he sees the field … Next Page »

A new single .
A new hairdo .
And what sounds suspiciously like a new sound , as Laura Marling expands her fey folk vision
LONDON 
In the face of mounting concern about abuse of student visa rules by migrant jobseekers and potential terrorists , Britain said Sunday that it was planning an immediate tightening of its border controls that could reduce the flow of people entering the country as students by tens of thousands a year .
The new rules will apply to all applicants from outside the European Union , including the United States .
But the primary focus appeared likely to be the Indian subcontinent and countries in the Arab and Muslim world , both because of the large numbers of allegedly fake applicants who originate there and because of concerns about combating terrorism by Islamic extremists .
The controls appeared to have been drawn up , in part , to meet American pressure for a tougher British approach to combating terrorist threats .
While officials from both countries say counterterrorism cooperation has been close , United States officials have warned that Britain , with its large Muslim population and its relatively open borders , is among the countries that are central to American concerns as potential planning grounds for terrorist attacks against the United States .
Announcement of the new controls came six weeks after the failed attempt on Christmas Day to bomb an American airliner approaching Detroit on a trans -Atlantic flight .
The 23 - year - old Nigerian charged in that attack , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , spent three years in Britain as an engineering student and while in London associated with radical Muslim groups , though British and American intelligence officials have said he was prepared for the bombing attempt by associates of Al Qaeda in Yemen .

We 've all seen semi trucks turned turtle on the freeway before , but as it turns out , the cleanup aftermath of a rollover can be as action - packed as the initial calamity .
Said another way ,
If we ever run into an overturned hauler on a dangerous stretch of mountain road in Chile , we now at least know what not to do .
Hit the jump to watch video of a semi that was flipped back over with a front - end loader in what is decidedly the wrong way .
We do n't want to spill all the beans here , but the post - jump video contains quite a bit of excitement – even if the camerawork is n't quite ready for Michael Bay .

COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo .
—A Colorado family and an Arizona nonprofit are fighting in court over who gets the head of a woman who died this month , along with a $ 50,000 annuity she left behind .
At issue is whether 71 - year - old Mary Robbins ’ head and brain will be preserved by cryonics — extremely cold temperatures — in the expectation that future technology may be able to bring her back to life and restore her health .
Lawyers for both sides appeared in probate court Friday but the case has n’t been resolved .
Robbins , of Colorado Springs , died Feb .
9 . Her family said she was suffering from cancer .
In 2006 , she signed documents giving the Alcor Life Extension Foundation of Scottsdale , Ariz. , the right to cryogenically preserve her head and brain .
She also agreed to give the nonprofit foundation a $ 50,000 annuity to cover preservation costs .
Her daughter , Darlene Robbins , said her mother changed her mind in her last days because of the procedures that preservation would have required before she died , including tubes in her throat and nose , intravenous lines and medications .
Mary Robbins signed new paperwork that would give her family the annuity , the daughter said .
Darlene Robbins said she opposes a suggestion by Alcor to take her mother ’s head and that the family get custody of the body .
“ I want to have closure .
I want to be able to grieve for my mom in a normal way without fighting a legal battle give me back my mother , ” she said .
Eric Bentley , an attorney for Alcor , said Mary Robbins did n’t sign a written notice rescinding the 2006 agreement .
He said Alcor wants to honor the wishes she expressed in that document .
“ Alcor is not a cult and it ’s not a fly - by - night operation .
It ’s a science - based medical organization , ” Bentley said .
Alcor ’s Web site said the foundation was formed in 1972 .
Robbins ’ body is stored on dry ice at a Colorado Springs mortuary until custody is settled , but it ’s not clear when that might be .
“ I ’ve never tried a case where we ’re talking about the dismemberment of a body and fighting over pieces of a body , ” said Robert Scranton , an attorney for the family .

À Toronto , des militants pro-vélo font un pied de nez aux institutions en sortant la nuit , avec bombes aérosol et pochoirs , pour créer des bandes cyclables sur les principales artères du centre - ville ou même peindre des passages pour les piétons ou des avertissements au sol pour prévenir piétons et vélos que la chaussée est endommagée .
Le credo de ce mouvement clandestin : agissons , ici , maintenant .
Bref , réalisons en une nuit ce que la Ville échoue à faire depuis 10 ans .
« Quand on a une idée , aussi bien la réaliser .
C’est plus rapide et ça fait bouger les choses .
Aujourd ’hui , les gens pensent même que c’est la Ville qui a créé ces pistes .
Certaines sont restées là et sont devenues partie intégrante de l’environnement » , soutient Chloé , une membre de l ’Urban Repair Squad de Toronto , qui a participé à plusieurs de ces raids clandestins .
Depuis 2005 , les membres de l ’Urban Repair Squad , déguisés en employés de la Ville , ont peint plus de six kilomètres de pistes cyclables sur des grandes artères et des rues secondaires de la métropole canadienne , sans compter les multiples informations peintes sur les chaussées ou les trottoirs ..
Les vrais employés de la Ville de Toronto tentent de retirer les marques dès leur apparition , mais beaucoup restent en place .
Les membres du groupe ont eu la bonne idée de réaliser un guide au format pdf , intitulé « Réalisez vous - même vos infrastructures , un manuel pratique » , téléchargeable ici . ( en anglais )
Consécration suprême , le collectif a fait l’objet début 2009 d’une exposition au Canadian Centre for Architecture ( CCA ) de Montréal , intitulée « Gestes furtifs Guerilla : des citoyens bricoleurs aménagent la ville « .
Et en France ?

More than half of the biodiversity across the archipelago remains unrecorded due to lack of knowledge coupled with poor awareness by local authorities to halt unprecedented destruction of biodiversity .
As of 2010 , only 20 of the more than 400 regencies have begun to catalog the species in their area .
" Indonesia is one of the 17 largest biodiversity hotspots on the planet , but we have not recorded most of it , " the deputy assistant of biodiversity conservation at the State Environment Ministry , Utami Andayani , told The Jakarta Post .
She said Indonesia was still vulnerable to biodiversity loss , brought about mainly by human population growth , deforestation , illegal trade in plants and animals and human - induced climate change .
" It is difficult for us to complain if other countries exploit our biodiversity for commercial purposes such as medicine because of the lack of dat ...
There are some 175,000 pieces in MoMA ’s entire collection , and roughly 28,000 in the architecture and design section , which includes everything from some of the 20th century ’s most famous cars and chairs to the archive of the modernist grandee Mies van der Rohe .
New pieces can only be added after winning the approval of an acquisitions committee composed of 25 architecture and design specialists , who meet every three or four months .
The committee must be convinced that each addition meets the entry criteria .
Does it excel in terms of form and function ?
Does it embody the values of clarity , honesty and simplicity that MoMA considers essential to good design ?
Has it has made an impact on our lives ?
Is it innovative ?
Then there ’s the clincher .
“ If this object had never been designed or manufactured , would the world miss out ? ” said Paola Antonelli , senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA .
“ Even just a bit ? ”
How did the @ fare ?
Brilliantly , according to Ms. Antonelli .
By giving that once obscure accountancy symbol a new application without distorting its original meaning , Mr. Tomlinson was deemed to have checked all of MoMA ’s boxes in terms of form , function , values , cultural impact and innovation .
She sees “ snail , ” “ pig ’s tail ” and its other nicknames as proof of its importance , because we care so much about the @ that we ’ve started to mythologize it .
Fair enough , you might say , but what does its transformation have to do with design ?
After all , the new @ looks exactly the same as the old symbol , and is n’t a physical object like the chairs , cars or architectural drawings that you ’d expect to find in a design museum .
That ’s exactly why MoMA admires it .
First , both the old and new @ fulfill the same function of simplifying and clarifying something that ’s fiendishly complicated to make and interpret : handwritten script and computer code respectively .
Ms. Antonelli describes that as “ an act of design of extraordinary elegance and economy . ”
Both qualities are prized by MoMA , especially “ economy ” in a time of recession and environmental crisis , when reinventing something that ’s under - used seems much smarter than designing something new .
Timeliness matters to MoMA too , and the new @ is timely not only in its economy but also precisely because it is not physical ( just like equally dynamic areas of contemporary design such as software and social design ) .
“ MoMA ’s collection has always been in touch with its time , ” Ms. Antonelli said , “ and design these days is often an act with aesthetic and ethical consequences , not necessarily a physical object . ”
That ’s why MoMA decided against adding a specific version of the @ to the collection in favor of using it in different typographic styles and sizes .
Ms. Antonelli likens it to the museum ’s acquisition of “ The Kiss , ” a performance art piece by Tino Sehgal , in which a couple embrace for several hours .
Just like the @ , each performance can take a different form with new protagonists — though there is a difference .
MoMA reportedly paid $ 70,000 for “ The Kiss , ” while the @ is joining the collection free .
Arctic Sea Ice : Heat Shield
Audio Commentary
Three decades of satellite records show ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice .
The images here contrast 1979 , the first year of this record , with 2007 , the year the ice reached its minimum extent so far .
This melting appears to be a symptom of climate change : over the same period , the Arctic warmed more than any other region on the planet as large .
But is there any reason to be concerned about a smaller crust of ice floating on top of the far - away Arctic Ocean ?
After all , melting sea ice does not directly affect sea level , just as melting ice cubes do n’t affect the water level in a glass .
( In both cases , the floating ice displaces water – exactly the same amount released by melting . )
However , melting Arctic sea ice does embody a so - called feedback mechanism , which accelerates overall warming .
Like a giant planetary heat shield , Arctic ice reflects most of the sunlight that falls on it back into space .
When the ice melts to reveal darker ocean , less of the light is reflected , and more of the sun ’s energy is absorbed .
This heats the ocean , which melts the ice more from underneath , and also eventually releases some of the heat back to the air .
This further warms the atmosphere and ultimately leads to even more melting .
Scientists now project that the Arctic Ocean may become completely ice - free for part of the summer , possibly before the middle of this century , triggering changes in weather patterns and ocean currents that could affect other parts of the world .
Both images here show the annual minimum ice extent reached one day in September .
Every year , the Arctic Ocean ’s ice crust melts partly back in summer , exposing open water , and then refreezes in the dark and frigid winter .
The images are based on data from NASA ’s Nimbus 7 satellite ( 1979 ) , and the DoD ’s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ( 2007 ) .
The most striking feature of Barack Obama ’s campaign for the presidency was the amazing , young , Internet - enabled , grass - roots movement he mobilized to get elected .
The most striking feature of Obama ’s presidency a year later is how thoroughly that movement has disappeared .
In part , it disappeared because the Obama team let it disappear , as Obama moved to pass what was necessary  the economic stimulus  and what he aspired to  health care  by exclusively playing inside baseball with Congress .
The president seems to have thought that his majorities in the Senate and the House were so big that he never really had to mobilize “ the people ” to drive his agenda .
Obama turned all his supporters into spectators of The Harry and Nancy Show .
And , at the same time , that grass - roots movement went dormant on its own , apparently thinking that just getting the first African - American elected as president was the moon shot of this generation , and nothing more was necessary .
Well , here ’s my free advice to Obama , post - Massachusetts .
If you think that the right response is to unleash a populist backlash against bankers , you ’re wrong .
Please , please re-regulate the banks in a smart way .
But remember : in the long run , Americans do n’t rally to angry politicians .
They do not bring out the best in us .
We rally to inspirational , hopeful ones .
They bring out the best in us .
And right now we need to be at our best .
Obama should launch his own moon shot .
What the country needs most now is not more government stimulus , but more stimulation .
We need to get millions of American kids , not just the geniuses , excited about innovation and entrepreneurship again .
We need to make 2010 what Obama should have made 2009 : the year of innovation , the year of making our pie bigger , the year of “ Start - Up America . ”
In a support document , Apple tells us that when you eventually send your iPad in to have its battery replaced , Apple will just send you a new iPad instead .
The Battery Replacement Service will cost $ 100 .
Ever since Apple ditched the floppy - drive with the original iMac , people have kicked up a fuss about each new hardware " omission " , calling it a " deal - breaker " ( as in " No built - in dial - up modem ?
Sorry Apple .
That 's a deal - breaker . " )
The latest has been the steady euthanization of user - removable batteries , which started in the iPhone and ended in the MacBook Pro ( although nobody moaned about the iPod ) .
Those complainers have now shut up , realizing that the slew of third - party external batteries are both more powerful and less messy to use than actually swapping batteries , but Apple , it seems , is still a little gun-shy .
You wo n't be able to use the Battery Replacement Service to replace a broken machine .
The support page includes " accident , liquid contact , disassembly , unauthorized service or unauthorized modifications " among the things that will prevent eligibility .
And if you are sending the machine in to Apple , the turnaround is a week ( make sure you backup first ) .
The replacements will , we assume , be refurbished models , and its likely that Apple will just hand you one if you take your juice - impaired iPad to a Genius bar .
I 'd prefer to keep my actual machine , though .
I recently swapped an iPod Touch with a dodgy home button for a new unit in the San Francisco Apple Store .
The transaction was fast and easy , but the new unit has an even worse problem : a dodgy accelerometer .

A leading British historian has called for a Jamie Oliver - style campaign to purge schools of what he calls " junk history " .
Niall Ferguson , who teaches at Harvard and presented a Channel 4 series on the world 's financial history , has launched a polemical attack on the subject 's " decline in British schools " , arguing that the discipline is badly taught and undervalued .
He says standards are at an all - time low in the classroom and the subject should be compulsory at GCSE .
Ferguson makes the comments in an essay to be released this week .
It begins : " History matters .
Many schoolchildren doubt this .
But they are wrong , and they need to be persuaded they are wrong . "
He points to the popularity of TV series and books by celebrity historians such as Simon Schama , David Starkey , Peter Snow and Andrew Marr .
" History , it might be said , has never been more popular .
Yet there is a painful paradox .
At the very same time , it has never been less popular in British schools , " writes Ferguson .
History is compulsory up to the age of 14 but not to 16 in Britain , in contrast to most other European countries .
In 2009 , 220,000 candidates sat GCSE history in England and Wales – fewer than the number taking design and technology .
At A - level the subject lags behind psychology .
" Numbers , however , fail to tell the true story of history 's decline in British schools .
When you consider the content of what is taught to teenagers , you begin to realise that the really surprising thing is how many , not how few , volunteer for the experience of studying the subject , " says Ferguson .
He argues that there is far too much emphasis on teaching pupils about Nazi Germany ( studied by half of those at GCSE and eight out of 10 at A - level ) and complains that pupils are asked to choose " a smorgasbord of unrelated topics " .
The form of selection , he adds , " explains why , when I asked them recently , all three of my children had heard of the Reverend Martin Luther King , but none could tell me anything about Martin Luther . "
Instead , Ferguson says history should have a " mandatory chronological framework " throughout secondary school and on to A - level .
He also calls for more emphasis on western ascendancy , not in " an attempt to turn the clock back " but because understanding why the world became more Eurocentric after 1500 is the " modern historian 's biggest challenge " .
He suggests a focus on why the scientific revolution did not take place outside Europe and how democracy emerged first in the west .
" We have recently witnessed a successful campaign to improve the quality of food served for lunch in British schools .
It is time for an equivalent campaign against junk history , " concludes Ferguson , whose argument will be published next month in Liberating Learning : Widening Participation , a collection of essays in which teachers , historians , philosophers and businessmen argue education has been impoverished by a narrow curriculum .
It has been edited by Patrick Derham , the head of Rugby school , and Michael Worton , vice - provost at University College London .
Professor Colin Jones , president of the Royal Historical Society , said he applauded some of Ferguson 's ideas , such as teaching history in longer , chronological blocks .
But Ferguson 's language was condescending and the argument ideological , he added .
" To change things we should work with teachers and other bodies and not just dismiss what is going on as ' junk history ' .
It is demeaning , unpleasant and untrue , " said Jones , who warned against Ferguson 's emphasis on western ascendancy .
" It is more ideological than he claims and the danger is it will be taught in a way in which the answer is known in advance and it is ' west is best ' . "
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said that suggestions to cut the amount of teaching on the world wars had always been opposed .
" History is compulsory until 14 and remains one of the most popular subjects at GCSE and A - level , " he said .
" The new secondary curriculum , which started in September 2008 , is clear that teaching must give children a chronological understanding of history using precise dates .
Children must study a wide range of areas , including the development of British political power from the middle ages to the 20th century . "

In an effort to put the world 's largest scientific experiment back on track after delays and cost overruns , Europe is shaking up the agency overseeing its portion of the multinational ITER reactor .
On February 16 , Frank Briscoe , a British fusion scientist , will take the reins as interim director of Fusion for Energy ( F4E ) , the agency in Barcelona , Spain , that manages Europe 's ITER contribution -- the largest of any partner's .
Briscoe replaces Didier Gambier , a French physicist who joined the F4E as director when it formed in 2007 .
Gambier was originally appointed for a five - year term .
The European Union ( EU ) is also formulating a plan to complete construction on the multibillion - dollar machine in 2019 , a year after currently scheduled , Nature has learned .
ITER aims to prove the viability of fusion power by using superconducting magnets to squeeze a plasma of heavy hydrogen isotopes to temperatures above 150 milliondegrees Celsius .
When full - scale experiments begin in 2026 , the machine should produce ten times the power it consumes .
Europe will supply some 45 percent of the construction costs for the reactor , including the buildings that will house it in St - Paul - lès - Durance , France .
The F4E was created in part to hand out billions of euros in construction contracts .
In 2009 , it awarded 86 contracts , but major works such as building excavations slated for last autumn have yet to begin , and contracts for crucial elements such as the massive vacuum vessel are not yet signed .
Gambier told Nature in October that the delays occurred because ITER 's overall design has not been finalized .
But sources say that the European Commission was unhappy with the F4E 's performance and with Gambier 's leadership .
In a December meeting of the European Competitiveness Council , research commissioner Janez Potonik stressed the need for better costing , scheduling and management of ITER .
Catherine Ray , a spokeswoman for the European Commission in Brussels , declined to comment on the circumstances behind Gambier 's leaving .
So did Gambier , who will take up a new position with the commission .
Aris Apollonatos , a spokesperson for the F4E , called the departure a " personal choice . "
Briscoe is well known in the global fusion community .
From 1996 to 2008 he managed the Culham Science Centre in Abingdon , UK , home to the Joint European Torus , Europe 's main fusion experiment .
In 2008 , he led an independent review of the cost and design of ITER .
" He is a very practical , sensible , solid guy , " says Robert Goldston , a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in Princeton , New Jersey .
" We trust that the new team in the F4E will implement the necessary changes to allow the EU to respect its commitments , " says Ray .
Europe has faced increasing criticism from ITER 's six other international partners : Japan , South Korea , Russia , India , China and the United States .
A budget proposed last week by U.S. President Barack Obama would slash America 's funding for ITER in 2011 by 40 percent , to US $ 80 million ; it cited " the slow rate of progress by the [ ITER Organization ] and some Members ' Domestic Agencies . "
And on February 2 , Evgeny Velikhov , a Russian fusion researcher and head of ITER 's council , called Europe a " weak link . "
" Unfortunately , their organizational structure is very poor , " he told Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview that appeared on a Russian government Web site .
Finishing ITER in 2019 , a goal that the F4E is now working towards with industrial contractors , would involve risks such as producing components in parallel , but scientists think that those risks can be managed .
" There should be no doubt that Europe is trying hard to get ITER ready in the shortest time that is realistic , " says one senior European scientist .
The new schedule will be presented to other ITER partners at a meeting on February 23 - 24 in Paris .

The debate over HTML5 vs .
Flash is great for comments and page views , but all that chatter obscures the bigger issue : Should developers and designers invest in HTML5 ?
According to Eric A. Meyer , an author and HTML / CSS expert , the answer is a definitive yes .
In the following Q&A , Meyer explains why HTML5 , CSS and JavaScript are the “ classic three ” for developers and designers .
He also pushes past the HTML5 vs .
Flash bombast to offer a rational and much - needed comparison of the toolsets .
HTML5 ’s feature set
Mac Slocum : How is HTML5 different than HTML as we currently know it ?
Eric Meyer :
It ’s really the HTML we ’re all used to plus more elements .
But that ’s the 80/20 answer .
HTML5 adds new elements for things like sections of a document and articles , and figures and captions for figures .
So it covers things that a lot of us do all the time , like create < div class= ” figure ” > and then < p class= ” caption ” > inside of that to go along with an image .
Now there ’s just an element called “ figure ” and you insert an image and you have an element after that called “ caption . ”
There ’s been an attempt to look at what people are doing .
What class names are people using over and over again ?
What structures are they setting up over and over again ?
Because HTML does n’t have elements that directly address those .
The HTML5 spec also attempts to very precisely and exhaustively describe what browsers should do in pretty much any given circumstance .
Older HTML specifications would simply say : “ These are the elements .
These are the attributes .
Here are some basic parsing rules .
Here is what you ’re supposed to do if you encounter an error . ”
HTML5 has these really long algorithms that say : “ Do this , then this , then this , then this .
And if you hit a problem , here , do this other thing . ”
There ’s a lot of debate as to whether that ’s even a good idea .
But if the vision that ’s encoded in those algorithms is brought out —
I ’m not saying it will be , but if it is , then browsers will be a lot more interoperable .
But that ’s the base level answer .
As you push further into the more obscure corners , then the answer to “ how is HTML5 different ? ” becomes much more complicated .
MS : Is HTML5 becoming a full - fledged development environment ?
EM : I do n’t see it stepping forward into full - fledged programming .
But I do see it pushing HTML forward so that it ’s a better foundation for web apps .
That ’s one of HTML5 ’s primary goals .
There are sections of it that are devoted solely to how to deal with web application environments .
The thing that ’s most directly applicable to making HTML more web - application friendly is the attempt to include what ’s known as microdata .
That ’s semantic information and little snippets of data that can be embedded directly into what we think of as pages right now .
But these can become the views a web application presents .
It ’s the kind of stuff that we put in cookies now .
But HTML is not getting for loops or switch statements .
That ’s going to stay with JavaScript .
In that sense , no , HTML is not becoming a programming language .
What developers and designers need to know about HTML5
MS : What skills do developers need to take full advantage of HTML5 ?
EM : Developers need to know HTML5 .
They need to know JavaScript and they need to know CSS .
That ’s the classic three .
MS : How about designers ?
EM : Designers need to know mark - up .
They need to know HTML5 .
They need to be able to write CSS and understand web layout .
And they need to have at least a decent grasp of what JavaScript does .
I do n’t necessarily insist that everyone who ever touches the web be able to write their own web app by hand , but designers should understand how JavaScript works .
There are a lot of people who call themselves web designers who are really just designers who put their designs on the web .
And there ’s nothing wrong with being just a designer .
But they ’re not necessarily web designers .
They ’re visual designers .
There ’s a difference .
MS : Would you recommend starting with web development skills and then adding Flash and others later ?
Yeah .
Make that your grounding and then add things to it if you like .
You ’re making a very dangerous bet to not have web tools at your disposal .
The developer should be able to do web work .
And it ’s not a bad idea to add Flash to the tool belt .
HTML5 vs. Flash : A rational comparison
MS : Without getting into the “ Flash killer ” stuff , how does HTML5 compare to Flash ?
EM : HTML5 itself and Flash are vastly different .
They have different things that they ’re trying to do .
But the HTML5 plus CSS plus JavaScript package is more .
I think that ’s an easier comparison to make to Flash because Flash is supposed to be this total environment .
You can put things on the screen and you can script it and you can define interaction .
And HTML5 - CSS - JavaScript lets you do that as well .
We got to the point a couple of years ago where the HTML - CSS - JavaScript stack can technically do just about anything that the Flash environment makes possible .
It ’s just a lot harder at the moment to do that in HTML5 - CSS - JavaScript because Flash has about a decade ’s head start on authoring environments .
There are a number of people , myself included , who have been observing for a while now that the current web stack feels like Flash did in 1996 .
Look at the canvas demos , for example .
The canvas demos we ’re seeing now are totally reminiscent of the Flash demos we used to see in the ’ 96 era , where it was like : “ Hey , look !
I have three circles and you can grab one with a mouse and flick it .
And then it bounces around the box and there ’s physics and collision and animation and they ’re blobby and woo hoo . ”
MS : What ’s your take on plugins ?
Are they inherently inelegant ?
EM : That ’s been my feeling for a long time .
That any plug - in is kind of inelegant and the wrong way to be going about this .
And I do n’t reserve that just for Flash .
I really mean any plug - in .
The fact that we need plug-ins to play movies has never felt right .
MS : If , for a given application , HTML5 and Flash can provide the same result , why would a developer go with HTML5 ?
What ’s the motivation ?
EM : HTML5 is native to the medium .
It ’s the feeling that if we ’re going to do web stuff , let ’s do web stuff .
Let ’s not do Flash stuff that happens to be represented in a web page .
So I think that ’s the philosophical drive .
The technical drive , to a large degree , is that companies do n’t want to be beholden to somebody else .
And doing everything in Flash means that they ’re effectively beholden to Adobe .
With web technologies , the only entity that can reasonably be said to hold the keys to the kingdom is the W3C .
And even if the W3C for some reason turned into “ evil goatee Spock ” tomorrow and said “ we want licensing fees , ” everyone would go , “ yeah , no . ”
HTML5 and mobile applications
MS : Does HTML5 give mobile developers more latitude ?
Is there benefit in developing applications outside Apple ’s approval process ?
EM : Absolutely .
No question .
There are some people who have argued that the whole App Store phase is a fad .
Granted , a very popular and lucrative and probably long - lived fad , but that it ’s still a fad .
The argument is that 10 years from now we ’re going to look back at rebuilding apps for every mobile device and go “ What the hell were we thinking ? ”
It ’s the same way kids who graduate from decent web development programs today do n’t understand why anyone ever tried to layout a page with tables .
I ’ve had conversations with people who literally just ca n’t understand .
Even when you explain , “ Well , there was no CSS . ”
They ’re like , “ But surely there was something better because that ’s just awful . ”
Betting against the web is the sure losing bet of technology .
Over the long - term , that ’s where I see things going .

Room with a ( helluva ) view : Space Station gets Earth observation deck
It may not be a five - star space hotel , but life has never been so good off planet .
Just two weeks after the arrival of the Internet , the International Space Station is getting an Italian - made observation deck that will offer panoramic views of Earth .
Space shuttle Endeavour will deliver the seven - windowed dome to the International Space Station next week , along with more living space in an chamber called Tranquility .
How the new Cupola will look like on the International Space Station .
It comes just weeks after astronauts got internet access on board
Endeavour is due to launch with six astronauts on board at 0939 GMT .
It comes just days after President Barack Obama 's big space station plug in his proposed budget for the coming fiscal year .
While the White House scrapped NASA 's moonward - ho Constellation program , the space station got an extension until at least 2020 , with the promise of more relevant research .
Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden said the goal is to make full use of the space station as ' the national lab it was envisioned to be . '
' There 's so much we need to know before we can venture safely out of low - earth orbit for the long term , ' Mr Bolden , a former shuttle commander , said .
The dome going up on Endeavour - like a big bay window - should greatly improve the quality of life aboard the space station .
The Cupola module was built in Italy for the United States segment of the International Space Station .
It will offer panoramic views
When astronauts exercise in the Tranquility , for instance , they will be able to gaze out the nearby dome windows whenever the shutters are open .
And when the day 's work is done , they will be able to pop their heads and shoulders into the 5 - foot tall cupola , beholding the universe .
The lookout also will provide 360 - degree views of the space station , allowing the crew to see directly outside during robotic work .
Until now , they 've had to rely on TV cameras when they use the robot arm to move or install big - ticket items .
' Looking out on the Earth is just inspiring , ' said space station resident Timothy " TJ " Creamer .
In fact , it 's the crew 's No. 1 pastime in the off hours - at least it was before the Internet came aboard .
Now , 'we can actually surf the Internet and find diversions , ' Mr Creamer told schoolchildren in a TV hookup this week .
Awaiting lift - off : A brown pelican flies past Space Shuttle Endeavour at Cape Canaveral .
It is due to launch early on Sunday morning
The five space station residents - two Americans , two Russians and one Japanese - finally got internet access late last month , nearly a decade after the first bunch of guys moved in .
' First thing I did on internet ?
Order my wife some flowers , ' commander Jeffrey Williams wrote in his online Twitter account .
' It was a hit .
Commerce from space !'
The dome - nearly 10 feet ( 3 meters ) in diameter - will ride up in the shuttle attached to Tranquility , but in the wrong place .
It will be moved to its proper location once Tranquility is connected to the space station .
During the third and final spacewalk of the mission , two of the astronauts will be outside looking in , while the nine others will be crowded inside , gazing out .
They will pop their heads and shoulders into the dome , with their legs floating down into Tranquility .
With weightlessness , shuttle commander George Zamka said , it should be much easier and comfortable than the old how - many - can - fit - into - a - phone booth gag .
The main circular window - 31 - inches across - is the biggest window ever bound for space .
The six windows on the perimeter are trapezoid - shaped .
For now , Nasa wants to keep them shuttered most of the time to protect the fused silica glass from orbital debris .
The glass is 1 inch ( 2.5 centimeter ) to 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimeters ) thick and has four panes .
The name for Tranquility - a 23 - foot ( 7 - meter ) long chamber - pays homage to the Apollo 11 moon landing .
The dusty Sea of Tranquility is where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20 , 1969 .
Actually , the new space station room should have been named Colbert .
TV comedian Stephen Colbert campaigned and won an online vote to have the chamber named after him , but NASA much preferred the historic moniker .
Colbert made due with his name on a treadmill that flew up last summer .
Astronauts on the International Space Station have spectacular views of both Earth , the Moon and outer space
The Colbert treadmill will wind up in Tranquility , along with some extraordinary rocks mounted on a plaque aboard Endeavour .
The chips of moon rock were collected by the Apollo 11 crew and carried to the top of Mount Everest last spring by a former shuttle astronaut , Scott Parazynski .
Also on the plaque : a big rock gathered on the summit of Everest during that same expedition .
After Endeavour 's 13 - day mission , the space station will be 98 per cent complete , with only four shuttle trips remaining .
Shuttle flights are supposed to conclude by the end of September , but the White House said they can slip into 2011 if Nasa needs to take more time and care .
Those on board the ISS can expect dramatic views such as this one of Hurricane Isabel in 2003
New Left Review at 50 : no balloons , of course , and definitely no party games .
The very idea of " celebration " smacks of consumerist pseudo - optimism .
Mere chronology is , after all , an untheorised concept .
We should see it as not so much an ­anniversary , more an over - determined conjuncture .
It is hard not to be intimidated by New Left Review .
At times , the journal can seem like an elaborate contrivance for making us feel inadequate .
One 's relation to it conjugates as an irregular verb : I wish I knew more about industrialisation in China ; you ought to have a better grasp of Brenner 's analysis of global turbulence ; he , she , or it needs to understand the significance of community - based activism in Latin America .
For many Guardian readers ( and others ) , the journal functions like a kind of older brother whom we look up to – more serious , better informed , better travelled , stronger , irreplaceable .
Well , maybe a tiny bit solemn at times ( we could draw lots for who gets the job of telling Perry Anderson to lighten up ) , and perhaps when we were out of touch for longish stretches , life seemed a bit easier .
But then we meet up and it's a case of respect at first sight , all over again .
It has n't always been like this : even older brothers had rocky periods in their youth – misguided enthusiasms , failed relationships , moody withdrawals .
Some readers may remember times when NLR seemed hell - bent on sectarian purism , theoretical slavishness and a wilful opacity .
It has been through several changes of identity in the past 50 years , and memories of some of these earlier phases may hamper the efforts that it has made recently to reach out to a more diverse readership .
But there is a lot in that history to be proud of .
The journal has , in its own unbending fashion , registered and responded to huge changes in the world during this half - century , and in doing so has made a stock of ideas available well beyond the ranks of those who may at any point have shared its particular form , or forms , of Marxism ( an allegiance that has itself modulated , perhaps even attenuated somewhat , over the decades ) .
Some things about the journal , however , do n't change .
What other publication would take out a full - page advertisement in a national newspaper announcing its " quinquagenary issue " ?
NLR has been accused of many things , but never of populist dumbing - down .
The biography of the review cannot be reduced to a formula : its experience so far has been too rich and too contradictory .
But it would be fair to say that a journal that began life hoping to animate and express organised popular movements on the left soon became a more emphatically theoretical enterprise , albeit with certain Leninist or Trotskyist longings held in reserve .
Then , in the 1980s , it began to interpret its intellectual task in more expansive terms , and since 2000 it has been self - consciously a " journal of ideas " – on the left , to be sure , but distant from radical movements in the present or any worked - out political blueprint for the future .
As a severely intellectual journal committed , in principle , to the radical transformation of society , NLR had few models to draw on in British history – and the journal grew out of and was for a long time rooted in British culture , however internationalist it has since become .
There had been a lot of small , usually transient , journals of the left , such as William Morris 's Commonweal ( 1885-90 ) or the original Left Review ( 1934 -38 ) ; there were political periodicals closer to the parliamentary fray , such as the New Statesman ( 1913 - ) or Tribune ( 1937 - ) ; and there had been more eclectic , radical - leaning reviews of art , culture and politics , such as the New Age ( 1907 - 22 ) .
But to find another successful journal of ideas conducted at the highest intellectual level by a self - consciously radical group we may have to go back to the Westminster Review , the journal of the Philosophic Radicals of the early 19th century .
In the present , the publication closest in spirit , despite all the obvious differences of form , may be the London ­Review of Books ( there is some overlap in contributors ) , but NLR is less literary , even more political , and committed to more systematic economic analysis and theoretical construction .
It also concerns itself very little with British politics and culture these days .
In so far as there was a conscious model in the early years , it was Sartre 's Les Temps Modernes , and an idealised version of Parisian intellectual life in the 1950s seems to have retained something of a hold over several of the review 's leading spirits .
It takes quintessential black - polo - neck subjects such as philosophy and film very seriously indeed ; other art forms , and more or less all of popular culture , come a long , long way behind .
Although there have been periodic shake - ups of the editorial board , complete with affirmations of the need to bring in new blood , the core group are now all around 70 and so date their formation to those heady days of bringing the news from Paris in the decade from 1958 to 1968 .
The 50th - anniversary issue includes articles by several of the NLR 's long - serving stalwarts – Tariq Ali , Perry Anderson , Robin Blackburn , Mike Davis – as well as interviews or reprinted pieces by noted figures of the intellectual left such as Eric Hobsbawm and Stuart Hall .
These names signify a quite striking element of continuity .
Anderson and Blackburn were at the head of the younger group who took over direction of the journal in 1962 , after two years of Hall 's editorship , and they , together with Ali , Davis and a handful of others , have been constant or recurrent members of the editorial board since the 1960s .
Anderson was nominally the editor from 1962 - 83 ( the journal has always emphasised its collective ethos , and from the outside it has not been clear how responsibility has been divided between editor and editorial board ) ;
Blackburn then took over until the end of 1999 , at which point a new series of the journal was relaunched , initially under Anderson 's editorship once more ; Susan Watkins has been the editor since 2003 .
Exact circulation figures have always been hard to come by , as has any reliable information about its inner workings , but its bi-monthly issues are said currently to sell around 10,000 each .
Although Anderson family money is rumoured to have bailed out the journal in the early 1960s , it has long been self - financing , without grants or subsidies , and over the past five years has even made a modest profit .
But these continuities of personnel mask some dramatic shifts of direction and changes in character .
The review was founded in 1960 out of a merger of two existing journals , Universities and Left Review and the New Reasoner , the former representing an upsurge of political and cultural radicalism in the late 1950s , especially strong in universities , that repudiated the reformism of the Labour party , while the latter provided a rallying ground for those communists and ex-communists who , post - 1956 , disowned orthodox Stalinism .
New Left clubs were formed around the country , and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament provided a mobilising and unifying focus .
For a brief period , the review was part of a wider movement .
But after the 1962 changeover , it focused more exclusively on preparing the theoretical ground for " revolution " ( it can be hard now to remember what an everyday term " revolution " was in the 1960s and 1970s ) .
One of the NLR 's most notable services was in importing and disseminating European ideas , especially the rich tradition of Hegelianised Marxisms , but also other styles of work in , for example , sociology and psychoanalysis .
In 1970 a publishing house was set up – New Left Books , which mutated into Verso – and this helped to make many classic works of European social thought available in English at a time when the expanding system of higher education was hungry for such texts .
Established socialist thinkers such as Isaac Deutscher and Raymond Williams were important to the review in its early years ; for a while the example of the Belgian Trotskyist economist Ernest Mandel was influential ; at various points there was particularly sustained engagement with the ideas of Antonio Gramsci and Louis Althusser .
In the course of the 1980s , the political imagination of the left had to be re-fashioned to acknowledge the dramatic transformations of that decade , including the end of " actually existing socialism " .
This and the following decade saw ructions and resignations at the review itself , as well as attempts to remedy its comparative neglect of now prominent issues such as feminism and the environment .
Its denunciation of " the American empire " , especially through the so - called humanitarian wars of the 1990s , was one constant ; its attempts to uncover the global operation of the new forms of capitalism were another .
But questions about what it now meant to be committed to " a socialist future " became more insistent and invited a more fundamental rethinking of the function of the journal itself .
NLR 238 , published at the end of 1999 , was to be the last of the original series .
The first issue of the new series appeared at the beginning of 2000 , with a dramatically improved layout and appearance ( high - minded left asceticism had tended to favour journals that looked like cyclostyled parish magazines ) , a regular book review section and signed editorials .
The first of these consisted of a stern , unsparing assessment by Anderson of the challenges facing the left at the start of the new century .
Some readers were shocked by its Olympian bleakness .
" The only starting point for a realistic left today is a lucid registration of historical defeat . "
( I can't help admiring the sentence as well as the sentiment here , especially that last phrase with its indomitable commitment to lucidity about the wreck of one 's dreams . )
Anderson found " neoliberalism " triumphant across the globe : no effective countervailing radical force existed .
But that , it was implied , is all the more reason to seek a properly explanatory understanding of the forces at work in the world today .
Only on that basis – a systematic , deeply informed , international analysis – could even the most tentative steps be taken towards formulating a viable alternative .
The message may have been bleak , but the tone was resolute : the guiding principle for the review should be " the refusal of any accommodation with the ruling system , as of any understatement of its power " .
Over the years , NLR had shown a proper regard for Gramsci 's celebrated motto " pessimism of the intellect , optimism of the will " , but many readers thought Anderson 's 2000 editorial overdid the pessimism and gave precious little nourishment to the optimism .
A French critic , in a reproach that must have stung the famously nonparochial and francophile Anderson , accused him of viewing things too narrowly from one side of la Manche : various forms of resistance , it was suggested , were much more visible in France , while others felt that forms of protest elsewhere in the world were similarly being undervalued .
But , a decade on , Anderson 's pessimism on this score scarcely seems exaggerated : in so far as the imperium of neoliberalism is being curbed , which is not far , it does not appear to be primarily the outcome of organised and politically effective opposition .
Anderson also announced another kind of change in the character of the journal , which was henceforth to be open to a greater variety of voices .
Again , there were murmurs about betrayal and elitism – NLR as a virtual club for global intellectuals rather than a getting - its - hands - dirty helper in local struggles – but perhaps such objections mistake what a progressive journal of ideas can and should do .
Personally , as a relative outsider to this milieu , I much prefer the hospitable pessimism of the current NLR to the excluding optimism of its more sectarian days .
But there 's no doubt that its present character raises again the question of what a journal of " the left " should be aiming at when it is not in constructive relations with any organised radical or progressive movements beyond its pages .
Now , in this anniversary issue , the editorial by Susan Watkins takes stock once more .
Attention focuses on the financial crash of 2008 and on the banks ' subsequent recovery .
The former might have seemed to offer the left some hope : the " system " was imploding , as in Marxist or post - Marxist theory it was meant to do .
Those famous " contradictions of capitalism " were coming home to roost .
Except , as Watkins coolly insists , they have n't ; so far there has been adjustment rather than apocalypse .
Moreover , this convulsion of the world 's financial system seems to have generated precious little political turmoil or popular insurgency .
In one of those steely sentences that the modern NLR is so good at , she writes : " That neoliberalism 's crisis should be so eerily non-agonistic , in contrast to the bitter battles over its installation , is a sobering measure of its triumph . "
So what is there left to do – and what is there to do that is left ?
Plenty , it turns out .
There may be no " immediate practical project " , so the concern has to be with the longue durée .
" To attend to the development of actually existing capitalism remains a first duty for a journal like NLR . "
Or again : " A priority for the Review in the coming years should be a new typology of development outcomes in the age of global finance .
Another is a map of the global proletariat – locations , sectors , differentials – alive to contemporary makings and unmakings of class . "
To some , this may seem like little more than keeping that " registration of defeat " up to date , but the commitment to information and understanding seems admirable to me .
In the final paragraph of her editorial , Watkins appears momentarily tempted by a form of optimism : " But perhaps the very rarity of a serious left forum in these times makes a journal like NLR more valued . "
I think that 's true , but a forum is , precisely , a space in which to meet and talk , an agreed place in which to disagree .
The metaphor signifies a distance from political action , as well as the distance the journal has travelled from the hopes of the 60s .
" Can a left intellectual project hope to thrive in the absence of a political movement ? " , she asks .
" That remains to be seen . "
Even " thriving " may be a lot to ask for .
" Fail better " may be as high as the mark should be set for now , with an unblinking awareness of the piquancy that attends the conjunction of political allegiance and Beckettian motto .
Perhaps a sense of having been chastened by world history is becoming to a journal in middle age .
Just occasionally , I still feel queasy when confronted by the familiar abstractions , confidently used in the singular .
When I 'm told , for example , that " the thought - world of the west " is increasingly determined by " Atlantic - centred structures of wealth and power " , dragging academic disciplines in tow , I find myself feeling that the search for pattern and causation is starting to lose sight of something no less important – the uneven , awkward diversity that is apparent when viewed from a little closer .
All intellectual inquiry is a see- sawing between abstraction and particularity , and NLR 's inheritance can still make it seem more indulgent of the former than the latter .
Interestingly , the language of " determinants " and " system " falls away when it comes to self - description .
" NLR stands outside this world , " Watkins writes , " defines its own agenda . "
Excellent , but might not some other elements in " the thought - world of the west " be doing the same , in their own way ?
Still , the audacity is admirable : I like the thought that a specially unillusioned , independent , global perspective on what 's happening is to be had from a side street in Soho .
When so much of even the so - called " serious " media is given over to celebrity - fuelled ephemera and the recycling of press releases and in - house gossip ; and when the academic world is struggling to mitigate the worst effects of funding - driven overproduction and careerist modishness ; and when national and international politics seem to consist of bowing to the imperatives of " the market " while avoiding public relations gaffes ; then we need more than ever a " forum " like NLR .
It is up to date without being merely journalistic ; it is scholarly but unscarred by citation - compulsion ; and it is analytical about the long - term forces at work in politics rather than obsessed by the spume of the latest wavelet of manoeuvring and posturing .
Despite its self - description in its guidelines for contributors , the journal is not in any obvious sense " lively " .
It is downright difficult ( but none the worse for that ) , because what it tries to analyse is complex and its preferred intellectual tools are often conceptually sophisticated .
It is difficult where being easy would be no virtue , difficult where aiming to be " accessible " would mean patronising its readers , difficult where ideas need to be chewed rather than simply swallowed .
That 's what I admire above all about NLR : its intellectual seriousness – its magnificently strenuous attempt to understand , to analyse , to theorise .
So , no balloons , and definitely no party lines .
No cheap consolation , ­either .
But hey , respect : no question .

Say , Charles -- it 's been awhile !
But we 're pleased as punch to see that you 're back to your old ways , poking around within OS X's mainframe just looking for ways to remotely control the system , snag credit card data and download a few interoffice love letters that are carefully stashed 15 folders down within ' Documents . '
The famed Apple security expert is planning yet another slam on OS X at CanSecWest , where he 'll reveal no fewer than 20 zero day security holes within OS X. According to Miller , " OS X has a large attack surface consisting of open source components , closed source third - party components and closed source Apple components ; bugs in any of these types of components can lead to remote compromise . "
He also goes on to reemphasize something he 's been screaming for years : " Mac OS X is like living in a farmhouse in the country with no locks , and Windows is living in a house with bars on the windows in the bad part of town . "
In other words , Apple users are " safer " ( due to the lack of work that goes into hacking them ) , " but less secure . "
So , is this a weird way of applying for a security job in Cupertino , or what ?
Prussia 's Emergence as a Military Power
After the decline of the Holy Roman Empire , the Kingdom of Prussia eventually emerged as the dominant power in central Europe .
Prussia had been colonized and Germanized during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the Knights of the Teutonic Order , a military order of German monks that pushed back or overran the Slavs in the area .
The knights were crushed by the Poles and Lithuanians in 1410 at the Battle of Tannenberg , but in the next century the Hohenzollern Dynasty that ruled Brandenburg and made Berlin its residence was able to win control over West Prussia , Silesia , Pomerania , and eventually much of the Rhineland and Westphalia .
The German military heritage was epitomized by a succession of Prussian rulers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
The first of these was the Great Elector , Frederick William ( r. 1640 - 88 ) , who recognized that a standing army with an elite officer corps was the key to the development of a powerful state in his remote part of the empire .
His grandson , Frederick William I ( r. 1713 - 40 ) , more than doubled the size of his professional army to 90,000 and added a trained reserve of conscripted peasants , forming one of the most modern and efficient fighting units in eighteenth - century Europe .
Heavy taxes supported the army , which consumed 80 percent of state revenues even in peacetime .
The next Prussian king , Frederick II ( r. 1740 - 86 ) , known to posterity as Frederick the Great , raised the strength of the army to 150,000 and launched a series of wars between 1740 and 1763 , wresting control of the province of Silesia from Habsburg Austria .
Prussia had become one of the most powerful continental states and a contender with the Habsburgs for domination over the myriad German political entities .
The aristocratic character of the officer corps was established early in the eighteenth century as Prussian kings tried to gain the support of wealthy landed aristocrats , known as Junkers , by granting them a virtual monopoly over the selection of officers .
In 1733 a cadet school was established in Berlin to train sons of Junkers to be officers .
The officer corps was well on the way to becoming the most privileged social class in Prussia .
The chauvinistic militarism of Prussia inspired fear and hatred among other European states and peoples .
Under the strong leadership of a self - perpetuating general staff , the army brooked little interference in its affairs by the civil government .
Nevertheless , the failure to reform and the lack of preparedness after the death of Frederick the Great in 1786 led to the army 's decisive defeat by Napoleon 's forces at Jena in October 1806 .
Over the next few years , General Gerhard von Scharnhorst guided the revitalization of the army .
Reforms included the introduction of universal military service and an end to dependence on mercenaries .
The officer corps was expanded to include commoners , and officers were encouraged to take greater initiative in battle .
The new Prussian army distinguished itself at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and again at Waterloo in 1815 , where , under the command of Field Marshal Gebhard von Bluecher , the army was instrumental in the ultimate defeat of Napoleon .
Prussia 's reputation for military efficiency was reestablished by the army 's final victories over Napoleon .
The Prussian War College ( Kriegsakademie ) became a model for military staff colleges around the world in the early nineteenth century .
A book of that era--On War -- written by Karl ( Carl ) von Clausewitz , a Prussian general , became a classic , its theories of land warfare still studied by officers of many armies more than 160 years after the author 's death .
The unification of the many German states into the German Empire ( 1871 - 1918 ) followed Prussian - led victories over Denmark in 1864 , Austria in 1866 , and France in 1870 - 71 .
Prussia 's aggressive policies were masterminded by Otto von Bismarck , who became united Germany 's first chancellor .
Following unification , the legendary Prussian General Staff became the German General Staff .
Clausewitz 's dictum that civilians should control the military was ignored , and the General Staff became a power center in the highly militaristic regimes of Kaiser Wilhelm I ( 1858 - 88 ) and Kaiser Wilhelm II ( 1888 -1918 ) .

In the aftermath of the PLANETWORK Global Ecology and Information Technology conference , I went to the Cascades , Eastern side , for ten days to listen to some rivers .
No laptop , no email ( except in spurts when I touched down in my home - town of Yakima , Washington ) , no radio , no television , no phone .
I did have electricity , running water , and reading material : a newly - published edition of Paul Shepard 's essays , Encounters with Nature .
1 I wanted to let the intellectual technology , the ideas , philosophies , and theories of PLANETWORK , sink into a deeper place in me : I needed a sifting and sorting process .
And I wanted to see if the natural world was where I left it .
The Naches River and its tributaries , the Little Naches and the Bumping , are in full spring flood now , overrunning their banks and washing over the gravel plains and islands they have laid down over the years .
Since I stayed close to the rivers , I saw mostly water birds : Canadian Geese , Kingfisher , Mallards , Water Ouzels , Eagles ; but also those omnipresent tricksters the Ravens , Stellers Jays , and Crows ; and an occasional Goldfinch , even a Vulture .
But I found myself missing the Chipmunks , Ground Squirrels and Pine Squirrels that used to dominate the Ponderosa Pine landscape with their chatter and warnings .
There were no late - night rambling families of Raccoons .
No Skunk ( except dead on the highway . )
And fewer Mule Deer .
I did n't get far enough afield to see any Bear .
I started a long poem entitled " Speaking to the Dead " and , in retrospect , I realize I am not only talking to the human friends who have passed since I last sat beside the Naches .
The animals are disappearing too .
But this is n't a debate about whether we need animals .
( My answer , like E. O. Wilsons 's , is unequivocally " YES ! " )
This is a small exploration into the question of how animals continue to support us in the midst of our stunning incapacity to care for them .
And , specifically , how they continue to be in the service of our latest technologies .
Paul Shepard 's lead essay " The Origin of Metaphor : The Animal Connection "
lays out his basic premise about the evolution of homo sapiens .
Shepard
believes that it was our interaction with the great beasts - hunting them and
eating their flesh - that created the environment for the intelligence and the
consciousness that ultimately raised us to a level of self - awareness unseen
in the animal kingdom :
As our ancestors became hunters , they plunged , late arrivals , into the old , savanna game of brain - making by means of clues .
. .
The scenario is one of reciprocal , strategic pursuit and escape in which the amount of brain beyond that necessary for routine body functions is the measure of intelligence , which slowly increased in both predator and prey as they reckoned each other over the millennia .
2 Ecopsychology posits that it is the experience of the natural world , which one ventures into from a mother 's knee , that gives the developing human an expanded sense of self and identity ; that , in a world right with itself , Mother Earth becomes the second mother for all of us .
Shepard goes on to talk about the Bear and its relevance for the early humans both as a worthy opponent and as " the giver of life in bone , fat , glands , skin , [ and ] meat . "
Why else would we have named the largest and most visible constellations the Big and Little Bear ( Ursa Major and Minor ) ?
Think of how often and in what essential ways the Bear is represented in our language in the dozen meanings of the verb " bear : " to give birth or to produce , to carry or transmit , to support or to hold to a course .
Bear up , bear in mind , bear out , bear fruit , bear down on , bear witness to , bear left .
Our psyches , our language , our very consciousness we owe to the animals .
They have been our sacred partners in this grand experiment called ' life on earth , ' and in some realms , with some individuals , they continue to lead and assist with their essential animal powers .
Mike Vincenty is a practical , down to earth guy .
A techie who wandered from electrical engineering into computer networks , he was educated at the Coast Guard Academy and , despite his gray ponytail , looks like Mr. Straight - shooter .
Mike is the Network Administrator for the California Institute of Integral Studies ( CIIS ) and is Technical Director on the PLANETWORK core team , of which I am also a member .
The PLANETWORK team got together a couple nights ago to compare notes on the conference , and Mike got to talking about the network ritual that he and the co-executive directors performed after having some scarey server crashes and network snafus .
In effect , he came out of the closet to us as a techno - shaman .
I was intrigued enough to stop by his office the other day to find out more .
Mike uses animal powers in ritual network cleansing because , as he puts it , " When I find something that works , I use it . "
He has made his own ceremonial tools for the job , because as he points out , " You ca n't just go out and buy this stuff at Radio Shack . "
Mike 's leather ' doktor ' bag includes a ' bit vacuum ; ' a ' spirit knife or scraper ; ' a set of Medicine Cards ( created by Jamie Sams and David Carson ) representing the animal powers ; and a selection of raptor feathers that Mike has collected from his annual treks into the Sierra backcountry .
In the opening of a typical network cleansing , Mike likes rattles and sound because that lets the animal or spirit powers " know we 're here . "
Then medicine cards are selected for each of the compass points , usually in this order : East - for beginnings , birth , dawn , the spirit path ; South - for experience gathering ( childhood ) ;
West - for introspection and sorting of experience ( maturity ) ; North - for the result of the experiences , wisdom ( the elders ) .
If , as Peter Russell believes , consciousness is the root of matter and , therefore , in essense , ' creates ' matter , then all matter , including computers and networks , have a kind of consciousness .
So , where do those bits and bytes go when your computer crashes ?
Mike believes that they pile up in the invisible spirit realm and that they need to be cleaned up from time to time .
Hence , the bit vacuum , which is a stick with ram chips and floppy drives ( to attract the bits ) ; he has also attached a bar - code reader wand to one end of the stick , again to soak up those bits junking up the works .
In the actual cleansing part of the ceremony , the user of the bit vacuum sucks up the bits from around all the computers or network connection points ; these move into a coil of wire that is grounded in an electrical outlet .
( After the vacuuming , this wire with its load of idle bits , is thrown away - it has become a kind of psychic toxic waste . )
Then the spirit knife is used to scrape the network wires and connections clean .
Lastly , the feathers are used to smooth the connections and ' polish ' up the network .
Sometimes these feathers are left in key places to become on - going organic antennae for the network .
When Mike and the PLANETWORK founders performed the ritual cleansing for PLANETWORK 's T - 1 connection at the San Francisco Presidio , they invoked a quartet of animal powers to shepherd the event .
In the East , Beaver , the structural engineer of nature , was called forth to help establish the foundation for the network .
In the South was the Mountain Lion , for non-authoritarian leadership to assist in overcoming adversity .
In the West , Fox provided a camouflage to gain intelligence in order to promote cooperation .
And , finally , for the result in the North , Turkey , represented potlatch , the sacred gift , and community sharing .
Anyone present at PLANETWORK felt these powers at work .
I think Shepard would approve of techno - shamanism .
He might see it as a reintegration of ritual and animal spirit - power into a world that we have stripped bare of ceremonial meaning .
Zuni's believe that Black Bear is the guardian of the West .
The Bear clan is believed to be in charge of the seasonal changes .
Bears are healers that preside over basic emotions such as fear , anger , jealousy , avarice , and vengeance .
We need the tremendous strength and wisdom of the Bear in these troubled times .
Please Great Bear , help us to remember that is it through the power of introspection and solitude that we can integrate the experience of change .
Help us to find you in our lives and to keep you alive .
Give us your courage and your powers of transformation .
You who have fed us and guided us in the darkest night , please help us again .
We have lost our way .

Why dolphins do n't like to swim with humans
Many of us would love to swim with dolphins but it seems the aquatic mammals do n't return the sentiment .
British experts have found that wild dolphins are suffering at the hands of well - meaning tourists eager to dive in alongside them .
A study of the bottlenose species living off the coast of Zanzibar found the animals were experiencing ' incredible ' stress from packed pleasure boats .
A holidaymaker goes swimming with a dolphin .
Crowds of tourists are traumatising wild dolphins in Zanzibar according to scientists
Lead researcher Per Berggren , from the University of Newcastle , said : ' The current situation in Zanzibar is unsustainable .
The local community is dependent on tourism - and therefore the dolphins - but unless the activity is regulated , the animals will leave .
' Our study found that whenever the tourist boats were present the dolphins were very unsettled and spent less time feeding , socialising or resting .
' This has a negative impact , not only on individual animals , but on the population as a whole and long term it could be devastating .
' The problem is that any change needs to be tourist - driven .
Many visitors will pay drivers extra in tips to steer their boats in close , herding the dolphins so they can dive right in amongst them .
Our message is , keep your distance and put the dolphins first . '
Around 150 bottlenose dolphins live along the south coast of Zanzibar , where dolphin - watching was introduced in 1992 .
Tourism replaced traditional hunting practices which were previously endangering the sea mammals .
' Abolishing the hunts was a major breakthrough and dolphin watching offered a humane , sustainable alternative , ' said Dr Berggren .
' Unfortunately , without regulation , dolphin tourism brings with it its own challenges . '
The scientists watched the dolphins over a period of 40 days .
They found that when tourist boats were present , the amount of their time dolphins spent resting dropped from 38 per cent to just 10 per cent .
The time they devoted to foraging and socialising also halved .
Meanwhile , time spent on swimming activity more than doubled from 33 per cent to 77 per cent and dominated dolphin behaviour during interactions with tourist boats .
' Overall , the dolphins are using more energy than they are taking in because they are n't resting or feeding as much but are swimming more as they try to avoid the tourist boats , ' said Dr Berggren , based at Newcastle University 's School of Marine Science and Technology .
' Zanzibar is a wonderful place , the dolphins are incredibly interesting and between July and October there are also breeding humpbacks in the area .
' I would recommend that anyone go there for a holiday and support the local community but act responsibly and ask operators to follow existing guidelines . '
The findings are published today in the journal Endangered Species Research .
Well , it ’s finished .
And oddly enough , that ’s the strongest thing I can say about the conclusion of the Geoff Johns / Ethan Van Sciver miniseries .
The main story wraps up rather abruptly , taking up about half of the issue ( 13 pages out of 22 ) , with the rest devoted to character bits and foreshadowing .
There ’s certainly nothing wrong with character bits — they ’re actually some of my favorite parts of this issue — but instead of a tour de force , Flash : Rebirth # 6 wraps up with a resounding … well … it wraps up .
I do n’t know if I ’d feel differently about this if I ’d read it before Blackest Night : The Flash , or before DC canceled their plans for the Kid Flash comic book and the backup stories featuring Wally West .
I ’m sure it did n’t help .
The best thing about the issue is that I can actually recognize Barry Allen as Barry Allen , not as some guy who has the same name and haircut .
That ’s one of the problems I had with the series up to this point : why go to the effort to bring back Barry Allen if you ’re going to give him a personality transplant ?
SPOILERS AHEAD !
.
.
.
Moments
The things I liked most about this issue were mostly small : Barry and Iris together again .
Abra Kadabra still alive and planning revenge .
Showing each speedster in costume , waving from the parade float … and a powerless Jai West ignoring them while he plays a video game .
Green Arrow grabbing a slice of cake before Barry shows up with his characteristic , “ Sorry I ’m late . ”
An entire battle taking place so quickly that Thawne ’s dropped baton does n’t even seem to fall until after it ’s over .
Barry and Wally arriving in the past to stop Zoom at the exact moment that lightning strikes a younger Barry Allen .
Okay , that last one is a double - sized splash page .
It was interesting to see an explicit reference to Blackest Night : The Flash , which would have appeared two months later if this book had wrapped up in September as originally planned .
Something odd : the plan to deal with Eobard Thawne feels like it comes out of nowhere .
It does n’t , though .
It ’s exactly what the Justice League was going to do to Barry in issue # 3 when he was being turned into the Black Flash .
It ’s not even adapted from what they were doing — they just finished the machine and shoved a different speedster into it .
So What Was Accomplished ?
Flash : Rebirth was less about the story than it was about setting things up for the ongoing series .
Barry Allen and Bart Allen had already come back during Final Crisis and Legion of Three Worlds , so what did this book do ?
Max Mercury and Professor Zoom are back .
The West twins are younger again .
Iris is promoted to a full speedster and takes on the name Impulse .
Jai is depowered .
Jesse Quick is calling herself that again , and has a new costume inspired by her father’s .
The Speed Force is re-imagined not as an impersonal energy field from which speedsters draw power , but as an energy field that Barry Allen generates … from which other speedsters draw power .
Meaning that ultimately every other speedster on the planet owes his or her power to Barry Allen , even the ones who predated him .
“ Barry Allen made me the Flash , ” indeed .
There ’s also a “ Negative Speed Force ” powered by Professor Zoom .
We ’re clearly going to be seeing a Zoom Corps in the future .
This might sound more exciting if the same author had n’t introduced the Sinestro Corps a few years ago , then expanded it to an entire rainbow of fill - in - the - blank Lantern Corps .
Barry Allen rejoins the Central City Police Department with a simple cover story for his death and rebirth : he was in the Witness Protection Program .
( I do have to wonder : with all the crazy stuff that happens in reality - bending Crises , how often do ordinary people get caught up in history alterations ?
I remember some tongue - in - cheek references in the website that went along with 52 , but I doubt that ’s really canon . )
, but I doubt that ’s really canon . )
Barry Allen ’s past has been massively retconned to give him a tragic backstory , also providing a convenient excuse for anything that DC wants to revise about Flash history from the Silver Age onward .
( As if half a dozen line - wide universe - altering events are n’t enough . )
Sadly , what it did n’t do was convince me that I want to read the ongoing series — which , frankly , should have been its main goal .
Next month : Flash : Secret Files .
Then The Flash # 1 launches in April .
Maybe we ’ll finally get a Flash story that ’s actually about a story , rather than about supporting some editorial decision .
It ’s been too long .

The lover who betrayed Peaches Geldof by revealing lewd pictures of her after a one - night stand was once arrested for allegedly holding a woman at knifepoint .
Wealthy student Ben Bluett - Mills , 23 , bragged about Peaches , 21 , saying she took heroin with him , and posted her nude photos online .
Three years earlier , he allegedly threatened to kill a fellow student with a knife in Madison , New Jersey , say police reports .
He was freed on £ 6,000 bail .
Later , Mills is said to have been charged for trying to bribe witnesses to drop evidence - and again freed on bail of £ 12,000 .
Peaches - whose dad Sir Bob masterminded Live Aid and mum Paula Yates died of a heroin overdose - denies taking drugs during the night with Mills .
Her lawyers said in a statement : " The allegations that our client was carrying and injecting heroin are denied , our client having consumed alcohol with the other individual leading to the ' highs ' described and portrayed in the photographs . "

NEW YORK ; March 9 , 2010 – Three out of four consumers are concerned by energy and climate change issues , but nearly two thirds say that using less energy is not the answer to reducing reliance on fossil fuels or foreign energy supply , according to global research by Accenture ( NYSE : ACN ) .
The survey of 9,000 individuals in 22 countries also shows that almost nine out of ten consumers want more government intervention in the energy market .
The Accenture New Energy World Survey reveals that :
90 percent of consumers are concerned or extremely concerned by rising energy costs and 76 percent by the prospect of energy shortages .
83 percent are concerned by climate change and 80 percent by the level of local air pollution .
77 percent are concerned or very concerned about their country ’s reliance on other countries providing oil and gas .
89 percent think it important or very important to reduce their country ’s reliance on fossil fuels .
However , only a third of respondents say cutting energy should be the top priority in addressing energy issues :
37 percent say using less energy is the answer to limit their country ’s reliance on fossil fuels , and 36 percent say that using less energy is the answer to reducing reliance on foreign countries providing oil and gas .
Two thirds ( 63 percent and 64 percent , respectively ) believe the solution to these challenges lies in developing low carbon sources of energy .
.
“ But our survey shows that consumers do not think lower energy use is a priority .
It will take many years before renewable alternatives come fully on stream .
Until they do , governments and energy companies will have to find creative ways to transform consumer habits and improve energy efficiency . ”
Sander van ’t Noordende summarizes the findings of the New Energy World survey in a video .
Consumers do not trust energy companies
Only 22 percent of consumers surveyed unreservedly trust energy companies to take actions to address energy challenges .
Almost a third ( 32 percent ) do not trust them to do so and 46 percent trust them only if they have direction from governments .
The highest levels of distrust are in the deregulated or partly deregulated markets of the UK ( 53 percent ) , US ( 51 percent ) and Australia ( 46 percent ) .
The lowest levels of distrust are found in the regulated energy markets of Japan ( 3 percent ) , India ( 8 percent ) , China ( 12 percent ) .
Consumers demand more government intervention
When asked who should lead on taking actions to address energy challenges , only 21 percent of the survey respondents said energy companies should .
Almost half ( 45 percent ) think governments and political leaders should take the lead , and 24 percent say consumers themselves should lead .
Almost all consumers ( 85 percent ) think that more government control and intervention is required to address energy challenges .
Asked to choose the most important government actions required :
54 percent pointed to controlling energy prices 51 percent to providing incentives for new technologies 41 percent to making investment decisions regarding the development of sources of low - carbon energy .
“ A return to command and control policies would not be good for consumers or energy companies , ” said van ’t Noordende .
“ But unless policy makers can improve the performance of local energy markets , they may come under pressure to intervene in ways that limit consumer choice and restrict industry flexibility . ”
Dislike of foreign energy companies
The Accenture survey also found that consumers prefer energy to be provided from domestically owned companies .
Nearly three quarters ( 72 percent ) are not comfortable with energy companies being owned by foreign owned companies .
Sentiment against foreign ownership is strongest in the Netherlands ( 88 percent ) , followed by the United States and Italy ( 81 percent ) .
Consumers in Spain ( 60 percent ) , the Middle East ( 53 percent ) and India ( 33 percent ) are least worried by foreign ownership .
Methodology
Accenture ’s study , The New Energy World , A Consumer Perspective , is based on an online survey conducted in native languages with 9,005 consumers in 22 countries worldwide , during November 2009 .
The sample included 1,500 people in North America , 3,502 in Western Europe , and at least 500 in each of Australia , Japan , China , India , South Korea , the Middle East , Brazil and Mexico .
The sample was representative of the general population as a whole in terms of age , gender , and socio- economic except for emerging economies with low internet penetration where the sample is representative of the urban population .
The data collection was undertaken by Gfk NOP .

If you were to name which Star Wars characters you like to see in a burlesque show , Slave Leia might be at the top .
Heck , a Stormtropper - getting - naked might make the list , too .
Boba Fett ?
Sure , why not .
How about Chewbacca ?
Or C - 3PO ?
Or Jabba the Hut ? Eh ...
These characters most certainly would not .
Too late !
Over the weekend , burlesque troupe Devil 's Playground once again got down to its skivvies for its Star Wars strip spectacular — but this time , with new Star Wars characters .
The show features standards like the aforementioned Slave Leia and Stormtropper , but also Star Wars characters we never want to see get down to their g- strings ever ever again .
Performers include Lucy Fur as C - 3PO , Sin Fisted as R2 - D2 , Scarlet O'Gasm as Jabba the Hutt , Daisy Meadows as Chewbacca and Miss Mia Vixen as the Death Star .
Something tells me that is n't their real names .
Call it a hunch .

Governor Gutshot to Impoverished ER Patients : Get the Hell out !:
Dog bites man .
Sun rises in east .
Tim Pawlenty plays " kick the starving poor person ( who ’s probably black anyway ) to win the CPAC vote " . [...]
As usual , my absentee governor , in his bid to win the votes of the evil heartless racist yahoos known as " Republican base voters " , goes the extra mile in terms in venality , stupidity , ignorance and inhumanity .
Read on ...
From The Hill -- Pawlenty : Let ER 's turn away patients to cut costs :
Emergency rooms should be able to turn patients away to cut costs , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - Minn . ) said last night Appearing on Fox News 's " On the Record with Greta Van Sustren " last night , Pawlenty said the federal law that mandates ER treatment should be repealed .
As they noted even Van Susteren was skeptical of Pawlenty 's proposal :
VAN SUSTEREN : OK .
OK .
But you come in with chest pains , and like , you get horrible chest pains .
Now , it could be indigestion , which is minor , or it could be heart , which is n't minor .

Alan Grayson was right about the Republicans ' health care plan .
Do n't get sick and if you get sick , die quickly .
A poll from OnMessage Inc. released by the RNC shows 51 percent of likely voters are less inclined to support a candidate who backs President Barack Obama ’s health care bill .
Dems roll eyes at GOP polls
Republican groups have flooded the inboxes of reporters and politicos this week with partisan polls spelling doom for Democrats if they pass health care , to the surprise of very few that get sent the surveys .
Republicans tout the polls as proof that House Democrats are casting career deciding votes , and that Barack Obama has bet his presidency on health care reform .
But Democrats are less than impressed by the polls showing devastating consequences for the moderates who fall in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .

“ The bottom line in looking at these Republican polls is that they are skewed in one direction , ” Jennifer Crider , spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told POLITICO .
“ They are not interested in reality .
They are interested in creating a false narrative to scare people . ”
The Republican National Committee on Wednesday released a poll from OnMessage Inc. – RNC Chairman Michael Steele ’s preferred firm – showing that 51 percent of the 1,200 likely voters surveyed nationwide would be less likely to vote for “ a candidate who votes for President Obama ’s health care bill . ”
Only 36 percent in the poll said they would be more likely to back a candidate who voted for the bill .
The RNC ’s results were similar to the ones found by the Chamber of Commerce and the conservative groups Americans for Limited Government and Susan B. Anthony List .
Susan B. Anthony List – a group backing pro-life candidates – polled Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak ’s Michigan district to find that 50 percent would be less likely to vote for Stupak if he dropped his opposition to the bill over federal funding for abortion .
Americans for Limited Government on Thursday released poll results on the congressional districts of 14 Democrats from competitive districts showing more than 50 percent of voters said they would vote against their congressman if they supported health care in 13 of the 14 districts .
And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce picked out ten congressional districts of their own to poll , “ all of which showed voters oppose current health care legislation being discussed in Congress , with substantial majorities saying it will raise the cost of their health care , ” a press release from the business group touted .
Democrats who spoke to POLITICO said that none of the polls are reflective of anything more than the sponsor ’s agenda .
“ The numbers that are most telling of what ’s going on here are the millions that the insurance industry , as a Chamber spokesman admitted , is pouring in to fund the Chamber ’s anti-health insurance reform efforts , ” said DNC national press secretary Hari Sevugan .
Democratic strategist Donna Brazile added : “ Numbers do n't lie , but this is what you get when your polls are paid for by self interested parties like the insurance industry which is working to preserve the status quo . ”
The partisan polls have been ignored by most – but not all – national media outlets , which instead usually lean on nonpartisan public polls .
“ It is perfectly appropriate for a journalist or a news organization to be skeptical of a survey sponsored by an interest group or campaign , ” said Mark Blumenthal , the editor and publisher of Pollster.com .
“ On average , they have a 3 or 4 [ percentage ] point lean to whoever is paying the bill , ” said Blumenthal .
Referring to issue polling , he said , “ if you look at the wording in the questions on partisan polls it always favors the results they want . ”
While most national reporters have kept their distance , the polls do pop up in regional papers – many of which have laid off their most experienced political reporters .
The Chamber of Commerce poll was picked up by the The Las Vegas Review - Journal , The Arizona Daily Star and The Fort Collins Coloradoan – the home town papers of some of Democrats ’ most vulnerable congressional members .
Additionally , a survey of physicians sponsored by an industry lobbying group has gotten prominent play in various conservative media outlets during the health care debate , including on some of Fox News ’ best rated shows .
But just because the polls commissioned by Republicans may not be completely on the mark , that does not mean they are totally inaccurate .
Democrats have offered little response to the partisan GOP polls , not releasing the district - by - district surveys they frequently conduct – likely a sign that the numbers do n’t look good .
And most of the highly reputable nonpartisan firms show that the health care bill is unpopular .
In a Pew Research Center poll released Thursday , only 38 percent said they favor the health care bill , compared to 48 percent who oppose it .
Rasmussen Reports also put out a survey on Thursday showing that 50 percent of those polled nationwide would be less likely to vote for their member of Congress if they voted for the bill .
Meanwhile , 48 percent of those surveyed in an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday said the health care bill is a “ bad idea . ”

Three olim expressed astonishment on Tuesday after discovering theirnames on a list of suspected hit squad members who killed Hamasoperative Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room last month .
Of the 11 people named by Dubai police as being members of the allegedassassination team , six have the same names as British - Israeli citizensliving in Israel , and one is a German - Israeli woman , Channel 10 said .
Analysts have argued that intelligence agents traveling with falsedocuments are more likely to get past border controls if they use thenames of “ real ” people .
Paul Keeley , a British oleh who lives at Kibbutz Nahsholim , told Channel 2 that he had been inundated with calls from British mediaoutlets since the list of names was publicized .
“ I ’m in shock and I do n’t even understand what I ’m seeing , ” he said .
Referring to the photograph of alleged hit - squad member “ Paul Keeley ” disseminated by Dubai police along with pictures of other allegedassassins , the Nahsholim resident added , “ It does n’t even look likeme .
” Keeley moved to Israel 15 years ago , and said his passport had not been lost or stolen .
“ I am just a father , a husband , and a kibbutz resident , ” he said .
Another British oleh whose name appears on the list , Steven DanielHodes , said , “ I am in complete shock and I do n’t understand what isgoing on .
I do n’t know how they got to me .
That ’s not my picture , ofcourse .
I have n’t left the country in two years , and I certainly havenot been in Dubai .
I do n’t know who is behind this .
I ’m scared . ” Michael Lawrence Barney , a third oleh who found his name on the list , told Channel 10 on Tuesday , “ This is a mistake or a case of identitytheft , but it is n’t me .
That ’s for sure .
” Hamas has blamed Israel ’s Mossad for the assassination and vowedrevenge .
Dubai police have said they do not rule out Mossadinvolvement , but have yet to formally accuse the organization of thekilling .
At least three additional names on the hit squad list – JonathanGraham , James Clarke and Michael Bodenheimer – bear similarities to thenames of Israeli citizens , though Graham and Clarke have told Ynet thatthey have different middle names .
Bodenheimer ’s daughter said her father is an Orthodox man living inBnei Brak , and that he had immigrated to Israel from the US 30 yearsago .
The Londonreported onTuesday that British authorities had launched an investigation todetermine “ how six British nationals apparently had their identitiesstolen by suspected Mossad agents to cover their tracks on a mission toassassinate a top Hamas leader in Dubai .
” The newspaper said that Britain ’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office “ confirmed that the identities in the British passports used by sixmembers of the 11 - strong hit squad were those of real British passportholders , ” adding that the passports used by the hit squad were forged .
One possibility being investigated is that “ British passport detailswere copied from the originals by immigration staff while the holderswere traveling , ” according to theA number of Mossad operations , including those involving the use offoreign passports , have caused diplomatic strains with Westerncountries in the recent past .
In 1997 , Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal was targeted for assassination bytwo Mossad agents in Jordan .
The agents entered Jordan with forgedCanadian passports and injected Mashaal with poison .
They were arrestedby Jordanian security forces soon after the attack .
Jordan ’s KingHussein demanded that Israel save Mashaal by providing him with thepoison ’s antidote , and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu acquiesced .
Israel was also forced to release Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin in exchangefor Jordan ’s release of the two agents .
The episode strained diplomaticrelations with Jordan and Canada .
In 1998 , five Mossad agents were apprehended in Switzerland attemptingto bug the phone of Abdallah el - Zein , a Swiss - Lebanese man suspected ofbeing part of a Hizbullah network that was plotting terrorist attacksagainst Israel .
One agent , code - named Isaac Bental , was caught inpossession of surveillance equipment , and was charged in a Swiss court .
He was released after Israel paid a $ 2 million bail .
In 2004 , two suspected Mossad agents were jailed for six months in 2004in New Zealand after being convicted of attempting to fraudulentlyreceive a New Zealand passport .
One of the men entered New Zealand on aCanadian passport , drawing criticisms from the Canadian government .
NewZealand strongly condemned the incident .

Some one will sneer if you pause to hear ,

There are those who will never admit it .

You play to your own soul .

Fame may smile upon you , or it may not .
The world may cheer your name , or you may be the unknown warrior
who rescued comrades in battle ,
or taught a young girl how to shed tears of joy .

If you had , you would not be a Hero .
You are a Hero for your bold courageous inspired action .

When I consider how my light is spent
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide ,
And that one Talent which is death to hide
Lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker , and present
My true account , lest
He returning chide ,

Either man 's work or his own gifts .

Quotes from my huge collection
Like many people these days , I use facebook to track what ’s going on with friends and family I do n’t get to see as often as I would have done in years past .
Long work days , large numbers of balls in the air and general “ stuff ” prevents actual face time far too often , but while it ’s not the same as a night spent laughing over a beer , it ’s better to note that a friend has a new job or that there ’s a new baby en route or whatever over facebook than not at all .
And of course , facebook has games .
Which is handy sometimes , for those moments when you have literally six or seven minutes to fill – too much time to sit still and be bored , too little to get anything real started .
Personally , I play bejewelled on facebook for those moments .
It ’s been set up rather nicely there – blitz games of one minute , with scores being tracked so that friends compete in weekly rankings and little medals at various scores and scores being classed as being in the top X % globally and so on .
The thing about this is that now you have a large community of people ( over five million within six months of its launch according to Popcap , who wrote the game ) , all competing against one another – so now it ’s important that it be fair or it feels like it ’s not worth playing .
Unfortunately tonight I noticed that someone ’s been too clever .
The game ’s written in actionscript .
I obviously do n’t know the source code , but I have a pretty good guess as to what mistake ’s been made here .
I ’m guessing that to set up the initial game board , they used the noise ( ) function to generate a bitmap with the six pieces represented by the values in one channel of the bitmap like so ( adopted from the Adobe documentation ) :
[ cc escaped =” true ” lang= ” actionscript ” ] var myBitmap : BitmapData = new BitmapData ( 8 , 8 , false , 0xff000000 ) ;
myBitmap.noise(< RANDOM
NUMBER HERE > , 0 , 5 , BitmapDataChannel.BLUE,true ) ;
var image : Bitmap = new Bitmap ( myBitmap ) ;[/ cc ]
So now you just read the bitmap , and for each of the 8×8 pixels , if the value is 0 display a blue diamond , if it ’s 1 display a red square , etc , etc .
It ’s a clean enough way to do it , but it has a flaw , highlighted in light blue there .
If the < RANDOM NUMBER HERE > number is n’t actually random , the noise looks the same every single time .
And if they ’ve used another method that calls Math.random ( ) , I ’m guessing they ’re not seeding it correctly there either because what I ’m seeing in the game is a fairly classic case of a random ( ) function being repeatedly called without reseeding and giving the same sequence each time .
In my case , I played three games before noticing that they all opened up like so :
If I drag a yellow piece up to create a three - in - a - row in the top left corner there , it disappears and three blue pieces fall down from the top to replace them , creating a five - in - a - row ( a hypercube in the game ’s parlance ) like so :
If I use that hypercube to delete all the blue pieces on the board , a multiplier bonus falls in attached to a red piece in the upper left quadrant of the board like so :
( You ’ll note the timer at the bottom of the game is running out fast here , this is because I ’m taking screenshots at leisure ) .
If I now move the white piece in the top left quadrant to create a vertical three - in - a - row , it disappears , the multiplier ( X2 ) piece falls down and a red piece falls behind it , creating a three - in - a - row of red pieces which vanish leaving this :
And the game progresses on from there .
But the point is that this is the same sequence , every time I ’ve played .
So far I ’ve repeated the same board in something like fifteen games ( mostly while grabbing screenshots and mucking about ) .
So it ’d be perfectly possible for me to spend hours exploring this board ’s possible permutations to find the optimum set of moves , or in simpler words , to cheat .
And suddenly the game is n’t fun anymore .
Did person X beat my high score because they spent time playing the same game over and over honing their procedure ?
Is my own high score really valid anymore as a result of this ?
And yes , there are indeed cheating methods already available to those who are willing to install software to their browser to crack the game , but this is somehow different from that , there ’s less effort required to cheat using this bug and less malicious intent as well .
So it ’s a nice game ruined by someone missing one single step in the setup of the game board – namely , they forgot to seed the random function with an appropriate seed value which changes between sessions .

This past week I ’ve been getting all of my tax information together to make my final estimated tax payment for the one that ’s due on January 15th .
One thing I ’ve realized during that time is that sometimes the tax information is n’t all that easy to find when you ’re searching the IRS site .
For example , if you ’re looking to find what your marginal tax rate is , often you ’ll end up in being referred to some obscure IRS .pdf document , that supposedly has the information you ’re looking for , but when you open it , does n’t .
I thought I ’d put out a quick post referencing the 2009 official IRS marginal tax rates for others out there looking for the information .
Official IRS Tax Rate Schedule Updates For Tax Year 2009
Here are the official IRS tax rate tables for the 2009 taxpaying season .
Tax Bracket Single Married Filing Jointly 10 % Bracket $ 0 – $ 8,350 $ 0 – $ 16,700 15 % Bracket $ 8,350 – $ 33,950 $ 16,700 – $ 67,900 25 % Bracket $ 33,950 – $ 82,250 $ 67,900 – $ 137,050 28 % Bracket $ 82,250 – $ 171,550 $ 137,050 – $ 208,850 33 % Bracket $ 171,550 – $ 372,950 $ 208,850 – $ 372,950 35 % Bracket $ 372,950 + $ 372,950 +
Things that have changed from last year .
From IRS.gov :
New standard deduction :
The new standard deduction is $ 11,400 for married couples filing a joint return ( up $ 500 ) , $ 5,700 for singles and married individuals filing separately ( up $ 250 ) and $ 8,350 for heads of household ( up $ 350 ) .
Nearly two out of three taxpayers take the standard deduction , rather than itemizing deductions , such as mortgage interest , charitable contributions and state and local taxes .

Personal exemption has increased :
The value of each personal and dependency exemption , available to most taxpayers , is $ 3,650 , up $ 150 from 2008 .
Thresholds for the tax brackets have increased for each filing status :
Tax - bracket thresholds increase for each filing status .
For a married couple filing a joint return , for example , the taxable - income threshold separating the 15 - percent bracket from the 25 - percent bracket is $ 67,900 , up from $ 65,100 in 2008 .
This will help us as we ’re just able to come in under the neew $ 67,900 threshold .
Phew .

Gift exclusion increases :
The annual gift exclusion rises to $ 13,000 , up from $ 12,000 in 2008 .
IRA contribution limits remain the same : IRA contribution limits have remained the same , with a limit of $ 5000 across account types .
( Roth , Traditional , etc )
Closing Thoughts
No matter what happens every year , one thing is for sure .
As long as you ’re making income , you will be paying taxes .
So if you ’re going to be paying taxes , be sure to make the best of it .
Be organized for tax season , take the income tax deductions that are available to you .
Do n’t forget about often forgotten tax credits like the home improvement tax credit , or deductions like the new car sales tax deduction .
If you do , you ’ll be leaving hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the table .
Are there tax credits or deductions that you think people should remember this year ?
Are there tips you can give to be more organized about your taxes ?
What do you think of the 2009 tax brackets ?
Do you come out better because of them ?

Humans are terrible with big numbers .
The financial meltdown has reminded us that even highly numerate people can't really feel , in their bones , the vast difference between a million , a billion and a trillion : it 's still shocking to be reminded that 1 m seconds pass in less than 12 days , whereas 1tn seconds is equivalent to around 32,000 years .
( To put it another way : if you 'd spent £ 1 m a day since Jesus was born , you still would not have spent £ 1tn . )
Trying to be helpful , commentators will explain that , say , the £ 850 bn spent to bail out Britain 's banks would , in the form of £ 1 coins , stretch several times " to the moon and back " .
But this is worse than useless , because the distance from Earth to the moon is exactly the kind of big number we struggle to visualise .
All I know is that it 's a very long way , like Ullapool , except probably even farther .
As any charity fundraising expert will tell you , one consequence of this is the phenomenon known as " scope insensitivity " : we 're troubled by the thought of a starving child , but we 're definitely not 1,000 times more troubled by the thought of 1,000 starving children .
One famous study asked people how much they'd be willing to pay to save 2,000 birds from dying in oil ponds ; the average answer was about £ 49 .
And 20,000 or 200,000 ?
The answers were £ 48 and £ 53 , respectively .
What 's going on here , some psycho­ logists argue , is the " purchase of moral satisfaction " : instead of trying to picture the scale of the problem and donate accordingly , people just name the price required to achieve the fuzzy feeling of having done their bit .
" The level of spending needed to purchase a warm glow depends on personality and financial situation , " writes Eliezer Yudkowsky , at the blog Less Wrong .
" But it certainly has nothing to do with the number of birds . "
In a different kind of example , people were willing to pay much more to save the lives of 4,500 Rwandan refugees in a camp of 11,000 than in a camp of 250,000 : what counted , apparently , was n't the number of lives saved , but the sense of having " made a big difference " by saving almost half the camp .
I wonder if all this points to a more pervasive eccentricity – the way we habitually confuse how some effortful act feels with the effect it actually has .
Climate change is a case in point : scrupulously recycling household waste takes enough effort that it feels like a major contribution , perhaps big enough to justify a yearly long - haul flight , when in reality this is absurdly faulty reasoning .
But the effect reaches beyond altruism .
Personal finance gurus love to champion what one of them calls " the Latte Factor " , the notion that by forgoing some small daily luxury , you can stash away a small fortune .
Yet , of course , the best way to save money is to forgo big purchases ; and if the effort of denying yourself a latte every day makes a new plasma - screen TV seem a reasonable reward , you 'll eliminate your savings at a stroke .
Come to think of it , is n't the whole world of work designed to encourage us in the mistaken idea that a 12 - hour day is more effective than a three - hour day ?
Yet all we can really say for sure is that it 's more effortful – rewarding us with the sense , whether smug or self - pitying , of having put in a good day 's work .
There are probably millions more examples .
Or billions .
Or thousands – you know , some really big number like that .

Complaints of Sex Abuse by Nuns Begin to Emerge
The Pain Is Strong for Accusers Just Coming to Terms
with What They Say Happened to Them

Even now , decades later , the victims ' voices falter as they describe the encounters that damaged them in ways they cannot fully cast off .
Mary Dunford tells of a molester visiting her dormitory bed when she was 15 .
Susan Pavlak speaks of the teacher who talked to her of love , then seduced her at 16 .
Siblings Christine Bertrand and Karen Britten and their childhood friend Patricia Schwartz describe how their piano teacher touched them in ways no adult should touch a child .
In each case , the perpetrator was , or recently had been , a Roman Catholic nun .

The five women , who said they were abused in the 1950s , '60s and ' 70s , are among about a dozen Minnesotans and an estimated 400 women and men nationwide who have recently come forward to talk about being sexually abused by nuns .
Last month , Britten , 48 , of Highland Park , Ill. , and Schwartz , 51 , of Eden Prairie , sued the Sisters of St. Francis in Rochester over alleged abuse by a nun in the 1960s .
Bertrand , 51 , of Sierra Madre , Calif. , filed suit against the same nun last year .
Most reports of sexual abuse by nuns have emerged well after the surge of news about abuse by Catholic priests and brothers , and there is little evidence that abuse by nuns has continued .
But survivors are increasingly coming forward to seek apologies and reparations .
St. Paul attorney Jeff Anderson , who specializes in clergy sex - abuse cases , said he has received about a dozen plausible reports of abuse by nuns with Minnesota ties .
The issue , Anderson said , " has only been on my radar for a few years .
We 're likely to see more cases in the years to come . "
Accusers interviewed for this story say they 've come forward only recently because it took them years to fully remember or process the abuse and decide how to deal with it .
Sexual abuse by nuns has gone largely unaddressed and unreported until now in part because of cultural biases about gender roles and sex , say those knowledgeable about the cases .
Women often abuse in seductive ways that silence and confuse victims , Anderson said .
And when abuse is alleged , it can be difficult for victims to assign accountability in the maze of 450 women 's religious orders .
The Catholic Church says it has no jurisdiction over the orders .
But slowly , more victims are telling their stories .
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) says it has received as many as 400 reports nationwide of sex abuse by nuns , " which probably just scratches the surface , " said executive director David Clohessy .

Dunford , now 67 and living in Eagan , was molested by a nun at the Villa Maria boarding school in Old Frontenac , Minn. , in the early 1950s .
" It happened after lights - out , " she said .
" She 'd kiss me on the mouth , then take her clothes off down to the waist and have me kiss and suck her nipples .
She told me she loved me . "
The experience " has profoundly affected my life , " said Dunford , who graduated in 1956 , married Dan Dunford in 1959 and raised three children .
She could n't talk about it , she said , until age 50 , when she realized that the abuse lay at the root of her depression and other problems .
Pain and grief remain strong for Mary Dunford , 67 , of Eagan , who says she was sexually abused in the 1950s by a nun at the Villa Maria boarding school in Old Frontenac , Minn .
Dunford and her husband , Dan , have appealed to women 's religious orders and Catholic leaders to be more forthcoming and accountable .

In 1990 , she wrote a letter to the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis , which forwarded it to the Ursuline order in Missouri .
She was told that the alleged perpetrator was no longer in Minnesota and no longer worked around children , and that an investigation would take place .
When the sister admitted to abusing Dunford , the Ursuline order paid for counseling for both Dunfords -- it later also returned her tuition -- and in 1997 arranged for the nun to apologize in person , Dunford and the Ursulines say .
" We talked about how what she had done had damaged us , " Mary Dunford said .
" When we were done , she said , ' You were n't the only one hurt , ' and her provincial [ supervisor ] turned to her and said , ' I love you and support you . '
There I was , the victim , and the sympathy was for the perpetrator . "
The sister who molested Dunford continued teaching college students after the order " determined that it was a one - time offense and that there was no threat to others , " said Ursuline Provincial Sister Peggy Moore .
The nun died in 1999 .
Since she began telling her story , Dunford said , she has been contacted by more than 200 alleged victims of nun abuse .
A trio of young students
Bertrand and Britten claim to have been molested by Sister Benen Kent during piano lessons in the early 1960s at St. Juliana School in Chicago .
In 1965 , Kent was transferred to Rochester , where , Bertrand and Schwartz say , she molested them in 1967 during family visits .
Kent , who died in 2003 , " insinuated herself entirely into our families , and was a trusted friend and confidante to our parents , " Bertrand said .
Britten was the first to reveal the abuse .
In 1991 , she called Sister Dolore Rockers , president of the Rochester Franciscans , to tell her what had happened when she was 6 : Kent " would rub my back , then sexually assault me with her fingers " at piano lessons .
Next to reveal her story was Schwartz , who says she did n't recognize what had happened to her as sexual abuse until late 2001 , when she heard Britten 's story .
Kent " was considered a saint in our family , " Schwartz said .
" I thought it was just another uncomfortable thing I had to take . "
Bertrand 's memory of being molested did not fully emerge until 2002 .
" One morning ... my husband came up behind me and startled me , and the memory burst back , " she said .
" I ran to the bathroom , retching . "
The women then went to the Franciscans as a trio .
Despite a flurry of calls , registered letters and meetings assuring the women that the case would be investigated , their lawsuits claim , little happened .
" Then I got a letter saying she had died , " Bertrand said .
" That was the turning point .
I said , ' Sue them . ' "
Bertrand said she 's convinced that Kent , who worked at many schools over her career , victimized more children .
She said she has received several calls from others saying they were also victimized by Kent .
Bertrand , Britten and Schwartz are seeking at least $ 50,000 apiece from the Franciscans , but say their main goal is to protect others .
The Rochester Franciscans have not responded to repeated calls and e-mails .
Culture and circumstance
Cases involving nuns feature complex sociological and psychological factors , said Minneapolis psychologist Gary Schoener , a national expert on clergy sexual abuse .
Women are less likely to sexually abuse children , but nuns have access to children in schools , orphanages and at music lessons , he said .
In the past , he said , " arrested social development " among some nuns , who often went directly from high school to the convent , fostered a climate where sexual touching of children and novices " occurred without anyone involved even fully understanding it was abuse . "
Cases that Anderson has seen , most involving girls , occur " not because perpetrators are lesbian , but because they have access to and power over children , " he said .
Author Ashley Hill , who lives in New England , told of being molested at age 7 in a New Hampshire school in her book " Habits of Sin , " which also chronicles other women 's stories .
Since it was published in 2000 , she said , she has heard from scores of alleged victims .
Hill said she found " a lot of mental illness , which made for a very destructive environment . "
Susan Pavlak , 51 , of West St. Paul , says that when she was in high school , she was seduced and sexually abused by a teacher who had just left her religious order .

As a 16 - year - old at a St. Paul Catholic high school , Pavlak , now 51 , of West St. Paul , said she was drawn into a sexual relationship with a teacher who had been released from her vows at her own request .
She said that her abuser was sexually involved with another nun and that nuns " colluded within this closed , highly sexualized system to hide relationships . "
The Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet , the former order of the alleged perpetrator , said via spokeswoman Ann Thompson that the woman was not part of their order when the alleged abuse occurred .
However , the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis arranged for Pavlak to have her tuition returned , Pavlak said .
The legal issues
Many cases alleging abuse by nuns will never go through the legal system .
Attorneys are less likely to take nun cases than cases involving male clergy , said Clohessy of SNAP , because " lawyers know that the deference shown to priests is even more intense with nuns . "
And most cases cannot clear Minnesota 's six - year statute of limitations on lawsuits , Anderson said .
So far , six cases with Minnesota connections have led to suits -- those of Bertrand , Britten and Schwartz ; a Winona case settled in 1992 involving a woman who does not wish to go public , and two cases involving abuse at a school in Washington state run by Mankato 's School Sisters of Notre Dame that were settled in 2003 and 2004 .
The lawsuits against the Rochester Franciscans seek to circumvent the statute by focusing on recent recognition of the abuse and on the order 's response , Anderson said .
The Rev. Kevin McDonough , vicar general of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis , said statutes of limitations serve " the important social purpose " of preventing lawsuits that can't be adequately defended .
" One claim was 75 years old -- how can you find people and evidence to defend a case like that ? " he asked .
But Bob Schwiderski , a Minnesota priest - abuse victim , said : " Extending the limit would affirm that post - traumatic stress often causes a child victim to delay reporting .
Why does n't the church work with former victims ?
Why is it that the victims , grown up , have to do the most important work toward accountability and prevention ? "
Response and reaction
Many victims look first to their dioceses for help .
In the Twin Cities , McDonough said , the church offers them counseling and help in communicating with those responsible .
" But we do not have the right to tell the nuns how to respond , " he said .
" Frankly , we have our own housecleaning to do on the priest abuse situation .
We do n't want to make it look like we 're putting the spotlight on nuns to get it off of us . "
Some victims have turned to the national Leadership Conference of Women Religious .
But that group angered victims when it declined to adopt the U.S. Catholic bishops ' Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People , drafted in 2002 .
It has refused victims ' requests to speak at its gatherings , they say .
Annmarie Sanders , communications director for the Maryland - based conference , said it has no control over how orders have handled cases , but began in the 1990s to push member orders to punish misconduct , help victims and prevent further abuse .
Spokeswomen for the orders to which alleged perpetrators belong say they have provided counseling and financial compensation to victims and have improved anti-abuse policies and education .
But those who have reported abuse say little has been done to restore trust .
Bertrand , Britten , Schwartz and Dunford have asked the orders involved in their cases to look for possible other victims at the locations where the perpetrators lived and worked .
The orders , citing confidentiality concerns and logistical difficulty , have refused to do so .
Is it still going on ?
There have been few modern - day cases alleging abuse by nuns .
The reason may simply be that there are far fewer nuns .
In 1965 , the number of U.S. nuns peaked at 180,000 .
Now there are about 75,000 , many of them elderly .
Representatives of female religious orders say better education and policies have squelched the problem .
But victims ' groups , attorneys and psychologists point out that clergy - abuse victims often do n't come forward until middle age .
" There will always be new perpetrators , " Clohessy said .
" We owe it to our kids to err on the side of caution . "
Meanwhile , victims find some comfort in pressing for accountability -- and in the faith almost all of them say survived the trauma .
Said Bertrand : " For the first couple of months after I remembered my abuse , I went to church with my husband .
But I could not worship .
A nun would walk in and I would begin shaking .
... I remain faithful , but there 's a lot of rebuilding that needs to take place . "

Correction Printed on June 27 , 2006 :
This article about sexual abuse by nuns misstated which of Sister Benen Kent 's victims first contacted the Franciscan nuns in Rochester , Minn .
It was Christine Bertrand who contacted the order in 2002 .

“ We ’re not at war with people in this country , ” [ US Drug Czar Gil ] Kerlikowske told The Wall Street Journal in May .
However , if the Office of National Drug Control Policy ’s ( ONDCP ) budget for fiscal year 2011 is to be believed , Kerlikowske was full of hot air .
According to 2011 funding “ highlights ” released by the ONDCP ( PDF link ) , the Obama administration is growing the drug war and tilting its funds heavily toward law enforcement over treatment .
The president ’s National Drug Control Budget also continues the Bush administration ’s public relations tactic of obscuring the costs of prosecuting and imprisoning drug offenders .
“ Enron style accounting , ” is how drug policy reform advocate Kevin Zeese described it , writing for Alternet in 2002 .
The budget places America ’s drug war spending at $ 15.5 billion for fiscal year 2011 ; an increase of 3.5 percent over FY 2010 .
That figure reflects a 5.2 percent increase in overall enforcement funding , growing from $ 9.7 billion in FY 2010 to $ 9.9 billion in FY 2011 .
Addiction treatment and preventative measures , however , are budgeted at $ 5.6 billion for FY 2011 , an increase from $ 5.2 billion in FY 2010 .
In short , the Obama administration ’s appropriations for treating drug addiction are just short of half that dedicated to prosecuting the war .
The problem , of course , is that when you have declared drugs to be illegal , you must expend resources to arrest , try , and convict the people who manufacture , transport , sell , buy , and use drugs .
It ’s really less about the the people who use drugs than it is about the people whose jobs depend on arresting the people who use drugs .
We ’re in the middle of a recession .
Jobless numbers are through the roof .
If marijuana were regulated like alcohol or tobacco , you suddenly add a whole bunch of DEA , police , prosecutors , wardens , guards , and more to the unemployment line .
Then add in the young people who have found marijuana growing and dealing to be the only living wage job they can find , now suddenly unemployed by marijuana re-legalization , and you ’ll see unemployment figures that would guarantee an Obama re-election defeat in 2012 .
Yes , a legal marijuana market would open up many jobs and industries and tax revenues heretofore unrealized , but transitioning to that market is going to take time .
In the meantime , what jobs are open for former drug cops and pot dealers ?
We bring this up to temper our disappointment in a man who in 2004 said our “ War on Drugs is an utter failure and we need to rethink and decriminalize our marijuana laws ” but in 2010 has turned into just another prohibitionist president .

It is irritating how many people today believe that racism will end as long as every American minority has a special day , week , month , club or organization dedicated to them .
One such example of a holiday that supposedly helps to eliminate racism is Black History Month , which takes place every February to celebrate the various accomplishments and contributions of African - Americans throughout American history .
Frankly , I do n’t even like the term African - American to begin with .
First of all , not all blacks are from Africa , and second , “ hyphenating ” everyone ’s racial category in a country that , today , accepts people from all nationalities and backgrounds is a modern - day form of segregation .
I wish we could all just be Americans .
This is not to say that I am ignorant of or naïve about racists within our society , but racism no longer characterizes society as a whole .
I would argue that focusing on everyone ’s ethnic background — American - born or not — in the form of club organizations and holidays is racist because all it seeks to do is give preferential treatment to self - segregating groups whose main purpose is to cry eternal victimhood .
A recent article on this issue , published by Newsweek and written by Raina Kelley , reminds people such as myself of the importance of Black History Month : “ [ It ] is a measure of how fully or accurately our story is being told and a reminder of the work yet to be done . ”
Kelley argues that “ bemoaning ” the existence of the month is wasted time that could be spent “ [ proselytizing ] ” for issues that need more national attention , such as “ failing inner-city public schools , institutionalized poverty , health - care disparities , and job discrimination . ”
Kelley does not give concrete modern examples of these ills , nor does she offer a proposal herself on how to fix them .
I , for one , do not chalk these issues up to being the fault of the elusive “ white man . ”
I think much of the problem today in the way of racial relations , is with America ’s obsession with political correctness .
Perhaps these issues are not being addressed because no one feels comfortable enough to say that they are not necessarily the fault of the “ white man , ” but are also partially the result of personal responsibility — or in this case , a lack thereof .
As it is , you probably think I am a racist for delving into this issue to begin with .
To make my point , we have an “ African - American ” president ; other African - Americans in the spotlight are former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice , Colin Powell , GOP Chairman Michael Steele , Oprah Winfrey , nationally syndicated talk radio show host Larry Elder and many more .
This list does n’t even begin to encompass the slew of African - American actors , actresses , and singers .
What was that about job discrimination ?
Furthermore , it is a known fact that things like affirmative action give preferential treatment to American minorities .
I would go so far to say that universities and companies seek minority candidates for the sake of calling themselves “ diverse . ”
I agree with Kelley in that there are many issues since slavery still extant in the African - American community , but I do not agree that in today ’s world it should all be attributed to the “ white man . ”
While slavery is a scar on American history , its legacy has also opened so many opportunities with an equally powerful political force : The Civil Rights Movement .
The statement that we live in a “ culture over - reliant on stereotype and slow to explore the complexity of racial issues ” just does n’t hold true anymore in post - Civil Rights America .
Still , when that movement radicalizes , it undermines itself and creates a familiar divisive rhetoric .
We are all Americans , and we should all be held to an equal standard and judged based on our merit , as opposed to our skin color or ethnic background .
While remnants of institutionalized racism have led to our current obsession with diversity and political correctness , Americans must have the freedom to take personal responsibility and to critique others without having the threat of racism hanging over their heads .
It is only when this is a real possibility that people of all ethnic backgrounds can engage in a dialogue about solving issues affecting the totality of the American citizenry .

Manchester City Ready £ 100 Million Offer For Liverpool Star Fernando Torres - Report
Manchester City are weighing up a bank - busting £ 100 million bid for Liverpool striker Fernando Torres , according to a report from The People .
The tabloid claims that City chiefs are prepared to exploit the current financial difficulties at Anfield in order to tempt the Spaniard to Eastlands .
If the deal went ahead , 25 - year - old would also become the first Premier League star to net £ 200,000 a week in wages should he join City .
The club 's owners are reportedly so impressed with new manager Roberto Mancini , that they are willing to back him with a massive marquee signing should he steer City to a top four finish and Champions League football next season .
Should Liverpool fail to reach the much coveted Champions League places this season , then City could well try to tempt Torres with the attraction of playing in Europe 's top club competition .
Torres has been in scintillating form at Anfield ever since he arrived in July 2007 from Athletico Madrid .
Liverpool 's number nine has scored 12 goals this season and 50 in just 63 Premier League starts .

This is a blog about gaming , and I know that a lot of my visitors have more and different knowledge than I do , so I thought I would put up a quick post to help you create your own blog about gaming ( or anything else ) if you are so inclined .
Video games are more popular today than ever before , and thanks to the internet it ’s possible to build your own little gaming community ( and make some pretty decent money along the way ) with a blog centered around the gaming world today .
Twitch streamers and video gamers on YouTube have been making thousands ( sometimes even hundreds of thousands ) of dollars with their very own video blogs and content , and if you want to try and get your own piece of this pie you ’ll have to make sure that you are set up right as soon as you hit the ground running .
Take advantage of the tips and tricks below and you will be able to build your own video gaming blog with no difficulty whatsoever .
On top of that , you ’ll be a lot more deliberate and a lot more strategic in how you build this blog , giving you a competitive advantage over all of the other video gamers out there trying to get in on the action , too .
Let ’s dive right in !
Plan your moves before you dive right in
It can be very tempting to want to simply fire up a brand - new blog on some inexpensive web hosting , throwing up different pieces of content you have already produced or are pumping out right now , and then cross your fingers hoping for the best – but this Field of Dreams approach to building a videogame blog just is n’t going to work these days .
No , you ca n’t just build something and expect folks to show up .
Instead , you have to be very focused , very deliberate , and very strategic about the kind of videogame blog you produce .
For instance , if you ’re interested in building a videogame review blog , you have to recognize that there are already giants in the space with budgets way bigger than anything you could throw at your own blog right now – and you ’ll have to find a way to compete with these kinds of titans while carving your own corner of this niche out for yourself .
The same goes if you ’re looking to post videogame play throughs , walk - throughs , report on industry information , or any other aspect of the videogame community .
Because this is already a somewhat mature industry you have to be craftier and more deliberate about how you set up your blog right from day one or you ’ll never get the kind of initial push you need to succeed .
Really think about exactly what kind of videogame blog you want your site to be known for , the one thing that you want your visitors to tell all of their friends and fellow gamers about what your blog brings to the table .
This has a lot more power than trying to be everything to every gamer out there today .
What kinds of games are you going to focus on ?
A great way to get really strategic about how you build your videogame blog is to think about the kinds of games you want to focus on .
Some of the best videogame blogs out there right now not only focus on a very small subset of videogames ( RPG games or first - person shooter games , for example ) , but even go so far as focusing entirely on a single title and building their blog around that game entirely .
Now , that may not be the kind of approach you want to take , just because the popularity of games that are hot right now can always fall off and then your blog traffic goes into a tailspin .
But you do want to build your videogame blog around a specific type of videogame so that you can become recognized as an industry expert or a leading voice for these kinds of titles .
Again , it ’s all about niching down and controlling your own corner of the video game industry rather than trying to cover anything and everything the videogame community has to offer .
What kinds of content is your ideal audience after ?
You should also start thinking about the kinds of content your perfect audience is looking for , rather than just the kind of content you already feel comfortable producing for the kind of content that you specifically might be interested in putting out there .
A lot of really passionate gamers dive headfirst into the world of building a new videogame blog , looking to ignite the same kind of passion they have for specific games or specific content in fellow gamers .
This can work quite well , to a point , but a much more effective strategy for building a brand - new videogame blog is think about who your perfect visitor is right now and to produce the kind of content that they are dying to see or dying to read .
When you switch of the focus from what you are looking to do or what you want most and instead focus on what your audience is most interested in what they are desperate for , building traffic streams , capturing attention , and creating a successful videogame blog almost becomes effortless .
This is a game changing paradigm shift you ’ll want to make just as soon as humanly possible !
Who ’s going to handle producing all of the content you post to your videogame blog ?
In the early days of running your videogame blog , the odds are pretty good that you ’re going to be running the show across the board .
You ’ll be the one producing or curating content , you ’ll be the one adding and modifying elements of your blog and website , you ’ll be the one handling marketing and advertising on social media , and you ’ll be the one tackling customer service and support issues .
Eventually , however , your blog is going to become so successful that you simply cannot wear all of these different hats at the same time .
You ’re going to want to have a plan for finding voices that can add content to your site in a congruent way , helping you to expand without your visitors even knowing that you are n’t still the hand behind all of the content getting pumped out .
On the flipside , if you are the face of your video game blog , you might want to outsource ALL of the other “ heavy lifting ” that goes on behind the scenes of running a popular blog to other people and organizations so that you can put out top - flight content that brings people to the platform .
Get set up with social media and video streaming right away
Social media and video streaming services are major factors for growth in the videogame blogging world today , and you ’d have to be at least a little bit crazy not to have your own accounts and your own channels set up just as soon as your blog launches .
Video games , by their very nature , are incredibly visual mediums .
Video streaming gives you the opportunity to post game reviews , gameplay highlights , live video game sessions , and so much more .
Social media helps you grab attention , bring traffic to your videos and your blogs , and also builds a sense of community for those that are looking to support your videogame blog right from day one .
Focus on monetization right out of the gate , but build your blog for growth initially
One of the biggest mistakes people make when they want to monetize blogging is focusing first on generating as much content and as much traffic as possible and only later thinking about monetization .
This inevitably results in clunky monetization approaches that turn off a lot of visitors and alienate a lot of fans .
What you want to do instead is focus on finding ways to monetize your traffic and your videogame blog right out of the gate , even if you do n’t put these monetization plans into action right from day one .
You ’ll at least have a strategy for how you want to monetize your site and your traffic in the future , even while you build your blog for immense growth to get it up off the ground right out of the gate .
Take these tips and tricks and you ’ll have no trouble whatsoever rocking and rolling with a powerfully effective strategy for building a successful videogame blog from scratch !
Oh , those crazy kids at Cambridge University -- when not doing keg stands or playing Hacky Sack in the quad they 're hard at work proving the vulnerability of the EMV verification used in credit and debit cards ( or as it 's called across the pond , Chip and PIN ) .
We wo n't go into too much detail ( because we do n't have much detail ) but a flaw has been discovered that allows one to convince the terminal that a card 's PIN has been entered -- and you know what that means : free money !
All you really need to pull it off is a fake smart card connected to a card reader containing the stolen card and some fancy software .
( Place the contraption inside a hat box or bowling ball bag if you want to be slick . )
What could be simpler than that ?
" We think this is one of the biggest flaws that we 've uncovered - that has ever been uncovered - against payment systems , and I 've been in this business for 25 years , " said Professor Ross Anderson from the school 's Computer Laboratory .

Maybe we were n't crazy to bury all that gold in the backyard after all !
British TV news ( with the appropriate dramatic music ) after the break .
The Windup Girl , Paolo Bacigalupi 's debut novel , is causing quite a stir in science fiction circles , with whispers of a Hugo nomination and critical praise from all sides ( including me : I just nominated it for the Locus prize for best first novel ) .
Bacigalupi is already well known for his amazing short stories , such as the Hugo - nominated " The Calorie Man , " which is set in the same world that The Windup Girl takes place in .
He has a deserved reputation as a prose - stylist whose facility with language borders on the poetic , and as someone whose visionary ideas benefit from this poetic presentation .
In The Windup Girl , we are plunged into a fraught and difficult world : energy collapse and environmental disasters have changed the shape of the planet , swamping its coastal cities and destroying our capacity to travel or move freight at high speeds .
Add to this a series of genetic - engineering screwups that lay waste to the world 's crops and trigger wave after wave of punishing plagues , and the rise of midwestern American genetic engineering cartels that control the world 's supply of plague - resistant GM crops .
Anderson Lake is one such Calorie Man , working undercover in Thailand , a rogue state where generippers reverse - engineer the food cartels ' sterile crops and combine them with carefully hoarded genetic material from the Thai seedbank .
Anderson lives in Bangkok , undercover , running a factory nominally involved in the manufacture of experimental windup springs that can compactly and efficiently store the energy pushed into them by GM elephants .
He is the hub around which many stories spin : that of Hock Seng , a former wealthy Malay Chinese who has fled an ethnic purge and now runs Anderson 's factory ; that of Jaidee , the Tiger of Bangkok , a hard - fighting , uncorruptable shock - trooper in the Thai environment ministry ; and Emiko , a " new person " manufactured in a Japanese vat to be a perfect servile helper , abandoned by her owner to the brothels of Thailand , where she is cruelly mistreated .
The Windup Girl is a story about colonialism , independence , mysticism and ethics , sex and loyalty , and the opposing forces of greed and empathy .
Filled with complex and flawed characters who must struggle to overcome their failings , The Windup Girl has no easy or pat answers , but rather charges the reader to summon empathy for imperfect humans who fail as often as they succeed .
But The Windup Girl is also an exciting story about industrial espionage , civil war , and political struggle , filled with heart - thudding action sequences , sordid sex , and enough technical speculation for two lesser novels .
Bacigalupi shows every sign of becoming one of sf's major talents , if he is n't already .
In addition to being a magnificent and passionate writer , he is a smart and genuinely nice guy , a truly winning combination .
Kudos to him for this wonderful debut , and to the independent publisher Night Shade Books for bringing it to us .

A British soldier who became a hero to anti-war activists after refusing to return to Afghanistan was jailed for nine months today , despite claims that he is suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
" There are many soldiers in the army who have extremely unpleasant experiences , who watch friends die or suffer appalling injuries , but they have to return and do their duty , " Judge Advocate Emma Peters told Lance Corporal Joe Glenton .
Glenton , 27 , fled to Asia in mid-2007 , before he was due to start a second tour in Afghanistan , staying abroad for two years before returning to speak at Stop the War rallies .
He wrote to Gordon Brown to denounce the conflict and urge the return of all British troops .
The court martial in Colchester , Essex , sentenced him to nine months in a military jail for going absent without leave , after he pleaded guilty .
He was also demoted to private .
His family and supporters said Glenton , who served in Afghanistan for seven months with the Royal Logistics Corps in 2006 , had been singled out because of his activism and would appeal .
Peters and a three - man panel of officers rejected mitigation pleas that Glenton simply be discharged from the army , as his psychiatric state had impaired his judgment before his planned return to Afghanistan .
Peters said his decision meant either his unit returned short - handed or someone else was sent at the last minute .
Going awol , she said , " cannot be seen as a means to secure a swift exit from the services " .
Peters additionally cast doubt on Glenton 's anti-war credentials , saying he had not raised this as an issue when he first returned to the UK last year .
After the hearing , Glenton 's supporters and activists from the Stop the War group stood outside the court martial centre and said other soldiers should follow his example by deserting .
" This is an outrage , " said John Tipple , Glenton 's legal adviser .
" It is quite obvious that they are making him pay for the fact that he has spoken out . "
Glenton 's mother , Sue , said : " They have let Joe down and they have let his comrades down .
They should hang their heads in shame . "
Due to automatic sentence reduction and time spent in custody he is likely to serve about five months .
Glenton was at first charged with desertion , which carries a maximum 10 - year sentence , as well as five other offences connected to his anti-war activity .
But these were reduced to a single charge of awol .
His legal team believe this was done to avoid a potentially embarrassing full trial at which Glenton planned to defend himself on the grounds that the entire Afghan war was illegal under international law .
The hearing heard from a consultant psychiatrist that Glenton had been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
He had not served on the front line but Glenton 's base in Helmand province came under rocket and mortar attack , and his work preparing coffins for dead soldiers let him with feelings of " guilt and helplessness " , Dr Lars Davidsson said .
Earth Hour ?
We ’ve all heard of Earth Day as it ’s been around for about 40 years .
But now , there is Earth Hour .
This is brought to you by the WWF .
Before you go looking for a picture of Hulk Hogan carrying the earth on his shoulders like Atlas , it ’s not the World Wrestling Federation .
Remember a few years ago the wrestlers were sued and so they had to change their name to World Wrestling Entertainment aka WWE .
This would be the World Wildlife Fund and they are encouraging people from around the world to “ … come together to make a bold statement about their concern for climate change … ”
They claim that millions of people will participate and illustrate their concern by turning off the lights for one hour .
The time is to be March 27 , 2010 at 8:30 pm local time .
That means that if everyone did it , an observer from space would see the lights go off sequentially from east to west around the globe .
While it is a global effort , for some reason the United States is singled out and the Yanks are encouraged to show the way toward a “ cleaner , more secure nation and prosperous America . ”
This is not the first Earth Hour though as it was launched 3 years ago .
The WWF claims that last year over 1 billion people participated in 87 countries from 7 continents involving over 4100 cities including 80 million Americans in 318 cities .
This year , National Geographic is claiming 121 countries will participate .
On the one hand , it is called a “ simple ” gesture because all one has to do is to hit the light switch .
Yet , the WWF does direct you to a “ tool kit ” to elaborate on how to participate .
This reminds of an Aggie Joke : How many Aggies does it take to turn off a light ?
What would be an event that is supposed to bring global civic awareness without having a promotional edge ?
You can buy “ Earth Hour Gear ” if you want to express yourself by more than just turning off the lights .
I ’m not sure if profit is the main motive behind this global effort but , like all good intentions , there can be unintended consequences .
Think about cigarettes .
State governments across America are raising cigarette taxes under the notion that it will discourage smoking with higher prices .
But , state budgets have become so reliant on revenue from the cigarette tax , if they were successful in their official motivation and everyone stopped smoking , then state government deficits would be such that sovereign state bankruptcy might be a real issue .
In the case of Earth Hour , if everyone participates , there might be steep consequences .
An official Earth Hour event in Thailand was cancelled due to safety concerns .
A big crowd of people at night whom the bad guys know would be shrouded in darkness ?
Sounds pretty enticing or even inviting .
But it apparently was a concern about “ Red Shirt ” demonstrators .
Then there are technical issues .
When you have a power grid designed for certain power load and their is a sudden change , that can tax the capability of that system .
We normally think of power surges or excessive usage in a heat waver or something that disrupts the system .
In this case , Earth Hour can cause complications from a sudden power drop off such that utlities have to take precautions to prevent the dark hour from becoming a dark night .
But , in some parts of the states , it seems to me that the biggest obstacle may be the NCAA .
Those guys went and scheduled the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament during Earth Hour !
They should have checked the schedule .
I can promise that , in Kentucky , when the University of Kentucky is playing in prime time for a shot at the Final Four , no one will turn off their TV and I doubt if any UK fans will be watching the game in the dark …. after all … you need to make it safe for trips to the refrigerator or bathroom .
Weather Bottom Line : Snow White and I took advantage of the fact that the clouds were chased away ahead of my schedule and so we went and fed the ducks at Cave Hill Cemetery .
It was such a nice day , Lee Squires left early and who can blame him ?
Several geese and swans are sitting on their eggs which may be hatched for Easter , but we did n’t see any mallards on their nest .
I think that it ’s because the mallards are too smart to put their nests where just anyone can find them .
We did have a couple of errant snow reports early this morning but , as I had warned , it was not consequential .
One thing that I did fail to mention was the howling wind overnight .
At one point , I thought that it was raining hard but instead it was just a pressure equalization occuring in rapid fashion .
It will be cool overnight and Saturday still looks to be outstanding with highs back in the mid to upper 60’s .
With that kind of turn around , a cold front must be on the way … and it is .
Our timing will work out well again as during the heat of day , the storm system will be to our west .
And , like the last system , this one will pass South .
So , if there are stronger or frequent thunderstorms , they will be west and south of the area .
Since this guy is coming through in the evening and with no sun ( or lights for Earth Hour ) then it will be very difficult to get sufficient lift to either form storms or keep them going .
So , perhaps some rumbles of thunder Saturday night followed by clouds and rain on Sunday .
The sun returns with mild but not too terrible conditions for the first part of the new week .
Muammar al - Gaddafi has established himself as an enemy of the unification of the peoples of Africa for over 40 years .
Last week , Gaddafi exceeded his conservative instincts when he stated before a group of young students that Nigeria should be split in two .
Instead of motivating the students to work for the transformation and unification of the peoples of Nigeria as one prerequisite for the unification of Africa , Gaddafi called for the country to be divided on religious grounds .
He exposed his ignorance of African religious and spiritual traditions because there was no room for followers of African religious beliefs in his call for the division of this society .
This call for the division of Nigeria is one more effort to break up Nigerian society so that this society is weakened and its people subjected to more exploitation and manipulation .
For 40 years Gaddafi had supported the butchers and dictators in Africa .
Starting with his military support for Idi Amin of Uganda and other murderers such as Foday Sankoh and Charles Taylor , this militarist in Libya was an obstacle to African liberation .
For a short while after Nelson Mandela rescued him from obscurity , Gaddafi had sought to use his wealth to buy the leadership of the African Union ( AU ) .
He was made to understand that the unity of Africa was more profound than the meeting of leaders of states .
The statements of Gadafi on Nigeria must be condemned in the strongest terms and it is time to strip away the fallacy that Gaddafi stood in the ranks of African revolutionary leadership .
Gaddafi is energetically seeking to replace the legacy of Kwame Nkrumah .
Although he cannot point to a text as powerful as Nkrumah 's book , ' Africa Must Unite ' , Gaddafi has used his oil wealth to suborn a group of sycophantic African leaders who have heaped praise on his leadership .
For the past 10 years , the image of Gaddafi as the leader of the African Union has been promoted by a fawning group of leaders in Africa , and the international media was only too willing to oblige in order to obliterate the traditions of Marcus Garvey , W.E.B. DuBois , Kwame Nkrumah , Amílcar Cabral , Cheikh Anta Diop , Frantz Fanon , Patrice Lumumba and Samora Machel , who were strong advocates of African unity .
Gaddafi himself used the oil resources of Libya to harness the support of servile self - seekers who refused to pay their dues to the OAU ( Organisation of African Unity ) and AU while salting away billions in foreign banks .

Progressive Pan-Africanists supported the project of the unification of the peoples of Africa in order to transcend the Berlinist state in Africa .
By the ' Berlinist state ' , we mean those states that were carved out at the Berlin Conference in 1885 .
In reality , the progressive Pan-African project seeks to build on the ideas of Cheikh Anta Diop in relation to the psychological , linguistic and cultural unity of Africa .
The people have always been for unity because they do not respect the colonial borders .
One does not have to ask the Maasai whether they respect the borders between Kenya and Tanzania , or ask the Makonde whether they respect the false division of their communities .
Anthony Asiwaju has written on the full impact of partitioned Africa , and the task of Pan - Africanists at home and abroad is to now build on the work of those who will work to end the divisions of the peoples .
African women at the grassroots are opposed to the borders and the traders show that no colonial borders can restrain them .
It is the present leaders who are maintaining the borders in order to maintain themselves in power .
There are many questions in Africa that urgently require cooperation across the false borders .
Environmental degradation , tsetse fly infestation , HIV / AIDS and malaria know no border .
Confronting these challenges requires new thinking and new leadership .
The project of African unity is one which in the short run will require the replacement of most of the leaders in Africa , and the building of a new leadership from the grassroots .
It is time to draw a line between those so - called leaders and the people of Africa .
Gaddafi himself has drawn the line by exposing the fact that he is opposed to the unity of the peoples of Africa .
From the time he came to power in 1969 , Gaddafi has wittingly and unwittingly served the interest of the enemies of Africa .
He has also served as an enemy of the Palestinian people .
SUPPORTING BUTCHERS
When Gaddafi seized power in September 1969 , there were divisions among Western political circles about the meaning of his assumption of power .
After Gaddafi nationalised foreign oil companies , the US identified him as a dangerous radical , but the European imperial forces saw his assumption of power as a force to support anti-communism .
Gaddafi in the early 1970s presented himself as a follower of Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt .
Libya used the oil resources to increase the standard of living of the ordinary Libyan people and Gaddafi declared Libya to be the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya .
However , very soon the revolutionary rhetoric , when stripped away , revealed a megalomaniac person who interfered in the internal affairs of genuine liberation movements .
Gaddafi soon alienated the Egyptian people , as well as the Palestinian people , by seeking to meddle in the internal affairs of the resistance forces in Palestine .
On the African continent , Gaddafi became the friend of the worst dictators .
His relationship with Idi Amin , who regime murdered more than 300,000 , stands out in this regard .
The Libyan Arab Bank financed the ventures of Idi Amin ’s henchmen and the Libyan army fought alongside Idi Amin ’s army when Amin invaded Tanzania in 1978 .
This attack on Tanzania was an effort by Amin to divert attention from the struggle against apartheid and colonialism in Rhodesia and South Africa .
Tanzania had been the frontline state bearing the brunt of the fight against the white racist apartheid government .
In the midst of this war against apartheid , Amin attacked Tanzania .
Algeria supported Tanzania and Mozambique who were clear on the reasons for the Ugandan attack .
The Libyan and Ugandan army were roundly defeated by the Tanzanian forces .
When Libyan soldiers were captured , Gaddafi attempted to buy them back from Tanzania .
But Nyerere returned these prisoners of war , and said that there should not be a price on human beings .
DISAPPEARANCE OF MUSA AL - SADR
In the same period when Gaddafi was supporting Idi Amin , Sayyid Mūsá al - Ṣadr , a well - known Islamic cleric from Lebanon , disappeared when he was on a visit to Libya in 1978 .
Musa al - Sadr had acted as a unifier and reconciler within Lebanon .
His patient work among the Shia and Sunni communities had ensured that war did not break out between these two communities .
Musa al - Sadr was invited to Libya in 1978 and has since disappeared .
Since his absence from the Lebanese scene , the society has plunged into conflicts and wars for 30 years .
Once divided and weakened , the Israelis and the Falangists took advantage of the absence of Musa al - Sadr to perpetuate war .
The Israeli army has also been a direct beneficiary of the disappearance of Musa al - Sadr .
Gaddafi has a lot to answer for in the context of the wars in Lebanon .
It is with the knowledge of the disappearance of Musa al - Sadr that Africans have to denounce in the strongest terms the call by Gaddafi for the break - up of Nigeria .
GADDAFI ’S TEMPORARY REHABILITATION
During the anti-apartheid struggle , most leaders in Africa had to support liberation , and Gaddafi did give moral , material and military support to freedom fighters in southern Africa .
But this support for African freedom fighters did not end the mischief - making and interference of Gaddafi .
In the early 1980s , Gaddafi was supporting butchers in Sudan , Chad and other parts of Africa .
Despite this mischief , Gaddafi was able to get the support of freedom fighters because the US government under Ronald Reagan bombed Libya in 1986 .
This imperial bombing garnered more support for Gaddafi and gave him credibility as an ' anti- imperialist ' leader .
Because of the ambiguous nature of his leadership , Libya was caught in the middle of the Lockerbie disaster when the Pan Am 103 plane was blown over Scotland .
After the Lockerbie incident , Libya was placed on the list of states sponsoring terrorism .
MANDELA’S INTERVENTION IN 1997
Nelson Mandela had been branded a terrorist by the West , so he worked hard to clear the matter of the Lockerbie bombing .
He successfully negotiated with the G7 so that the impasse between the West and Libya was significantly watered down .
This intervention by Mandela to bring clarity to the question did not clear the cloud over exactly what happened in Lockerbie .
Although two Libyans were later tried in a neutral country where one of them was convicted , their lawyer continued to claim their innocence .
This issue remained murky because at the time of the bombing in 1988 , the Western media had blamed Syria and Iran , among others , as culprits .
GADDAFI AND THE AFRICAN UNION
As a result of Mandela ’s intervention , Gaddafi , who previously had been parading himself as a leader of the Arab world , now presented himself as a great leader of Africa , and convened an extraordinary summit of the OAU in Sirte in 1999 .
The fact that between 1999 and 2002 the Constitutive Act of the African Union was written and ratified is now history , and Gaddafi deserves credit for his leadership on this .
But at the same time , while he was working for the unity of Africa , Gaddafi was financing butchers such as Charles Taylor and Foday Sankoh .
Other dictators such as Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe were supported by Gaddafi .
In fact , when democratic forces in Uganda and Zimbabwe were involved in a prolonged struggle to end dictatorship , Gaddafi said a revolutionary should never retire .
The contradictory utterances of Gaddafi must be analysed against the real actions of the Libyan state in relation to African peoples .
Many Pan-Africanists cheered when Libya successfully pressured the Italians to consider the reparative claims of Libya and to return Libyan cultural artefacts .
Libya was also promised US $ 5 billion by Italy .
However , this reparative claim was overshadowed by the realisation that the Libyans had made an agreement with the Italians to act as the police for the Italians to control the movements of African immigrants .
These agreements between Libya and Italy reinforced in the minds of the African youth the fact that Libya was a hostile place for Africans who believed in Africa for the Africans .
Hostile relations between African immigrants and Libyans resulted in the deaths of hundreds of African immigrants in Libya .
As a leader who claimed the mantle of Pan - African leadership , Gaddafi needed to give clearer leadership to his people on the question of xenophobia .
Some of our Pan -African brothers and sisters condemned Gaddafi as an Arab , but one must see his actions as similar to the leadership of Thabo Mbeki .
Mbeki spoke and wrote on African renaissance but refused to give leadership when xenophobic violence broke out against African immigrants .
Gaddafi is like many African leaders who speak publicly about African unity but persecute Africans who seek to work and live in other parts of Africa .
While serving as chairman of the African Union , Gaddafi contravened the African Commission on Human and People ’s Rights .
There was the execution of African migrants in Libya , and putting many on death row in Libya .
Indeed , Gaddafi ’s tenure as chair of the AU represented a low period for African progressives .
His rambling and undisciplined presentation at the United Nations in 2009 was a poor reflection on Africa .
But his presence in the USA was a result of a new alliance between the oil barons in the USA and the Libyan government .
After the French government mooted the establishment of the Mediterranean Union to counter the United States in Africa , sections of the US ruling circles started to court Gaddafi .
Since the visit of Condoleezza Rice to Tripoli , Gaddafi has been silent in his opposition to AFRICOM .
In May 2006 Time Magazine said that George W. Bush and Gaddafi see ‘ eye to eye ' .
Last week , Gaddafi exposed himself very clearly when he called for the division of Nigeria along religious lines .
Progressive Pan-Africanists condemned this statement and joined with the Nigerian people who reject this call for division .
Nigerian youths and progressives will work to end religious , regional and ethnic manipulations .
Religion , ethnicity and regional ideologies are not in themselves political factors .
They become so in circumstances where the people ’s forces are weakened .
The call by Gaddafi is for the weakening of the people ’s forces in Nigeria at precisely a moment when Nigeria should be building unity , peace and reconstruction .
Gaddafi is an obstacle to the unification of African peoples .
African unity is not for sale .

The Sound Of Settled Science
Via Cjunk , a story I 've been planning to feature for some time .
" Disappeared " - The Case Of The Vanishing Thermometers
In Canada the number of stations dropped from 600 to 35 in 2009 .
The percentage of stations in the lower elevations ( below 300 feet ) tripled and those at higher elevations above 3000 feet were reduced in half .
Canada ’s semi-permanent depicted warmth comes from interpolating from more southerly locations to fill northerly vacant grid boxes , even as a pure average of the available stations shows a COOLING .
Just 1 thermometer remains for everything north of latitude 65N – that station is Eureka .
Eureka according to Wikipedia has been described as “ The Garden Spot of the Arctic ” due to the flora and fauna abundant around the Eureka area , more so than anywhere else in the High Arctic .
Winters are frigid but summers are slightly warmer than at other places in the Canadian Arctic .
In case you missed that : " Just 1 thermometer remains for everything north of latitude 65N – that station is Eureka . "
The Chiefio recounts how Canadian thermometers were " taken out and shot " .
Here we see the typical thermometers spreading out with modernity , until 2009 .
Something strange happens then .
When numbers in averages change by a lot , we must look at detail .
What does the detail of the last two decades look like ?
It 's a lengthy analysis , but if your name rhymes with " Lorrie Goldstein " or " Terence Corcoran " , I suspect you 'll find it a useful one .
Updates :
James Delingpole picks up the story .
And in the comments , another summary by cinyc ;
I 've been following computer programmer " Chefio " E.M. Smith 's analysis of the GHCN ( Global Historical Climate Network ) thermometer purge for a while .
GHCN is a global temperature database complied by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Peter O'Donnell is correct - Chefio is talking about how Canadian thermometers have been recently removed from that database , not any database maintained by the Canadian government .
The thermometers still exist - but for whatever reason , NOAA does n't include them .
The GHCN database is used in the GIStemp model of the supposed global temperature anomaly - one of three such models that , when run , show the earth is warming .
GIStemp is maintained by NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( which explains the name - short for GISS temperature ) .
Chefio has painstakingly reviewed the GIStemp source code to try to figure out exactly how it computes its global temperature anomaly .
Chefio's basic overview of the program is here and more technical overview of the program is here .
FORTRAN programming is WAY above my pay grade - but Chefio explains the GIStemp program in such a way that his explanation should be replicable by any programmer who understands it .
Chefio's main thesis is that - for whatever reason - the GHCN database has been purging thermometers within the past two decades .
The " missing " thermometers were supposedly used to construct the baseline against which global warming is measured , but are n't being used today .
Perhaps not so coincidentally , the " missing " thermometers are largely at higher elevations and higher latitudes .
If there 's systemic bias in the thermometer purge , it likely biases the ultimate result .
For example , all Bolivian thermometers have been dropped since the 1990s .
Bolivia is a land - locked , largely high - altitude country in the Andes of South America .
If Bolivian thermometers are missing from the data , GIStemp will extrapolate the supposed temperature at Bolivia 's latitude and longitude from nearby stations .
If the nearest stations are near sea level in the Amazon or at the beach ( cold , lonely Andean thermometers want to vacation in warmer climates , too ! )
GIStemp will think the temperature in Bolivia has risen dramatically .
And - surprise !
Bolivia often shows up as dark red ( warming ) on GIStemp 's anomaly maps .
Like in Canada , the " missing " Bolivian thermometers DO exist .
But , according to Chefio , NOAA does n't include them in the GHCN database because they are compiled after the monthly deadline to be included in it .
( So why not add last month 's data next month ?
any logical person would ask . )
Chefio thinks that because GIStemp is comparing apples to oranges in a systemically biased way , it is likely overstating the global temperature anomaly - i.e. the extent of global warming .
By how much ?
I do n't think he knows yet worldwide , but he 's done estimates in some areas .

War is the joint exercise of things we were trained not to do as children .
War is doing things overseas that we would go to prison for at home .
Anyone can start a war .
Starting a peace is really hard .
Therefore it is much harder to be a peace expert than a war expert .
The media treats war as just another professional sport .
War has rules , which means that we can change the rules .
Murder , rape and slavery still exist .
But that does n't mean we should n't have banned them .
The same is true of war .
Telling a country we wo n't negotiate with it until it does what you want is like saying you wo n't play a game unless you are allowed to win .
There is no evidence that supporting war , or telling presidents to do so , improves your testosterone level , so Ivy League professors are better advised to stick to tennis .
There is one way to deal with guerilla warfare and that is to resolve the problems that allow it to thrive .
The trick is to undermine the violence of the most bitter by dealing honestly with the problems and complaints of the most rational .
Of course , there can be peace with so - called terrorist organizations ; it 's just a matter of whether one waits the better part of a century , as the British did in Northern Ireland , or whether you start talking and negotiating now .
Three thousand people is , of course , far too many to die for any reason .
But it is also far too weak an argument for the end of democracy .
Peace is a state of reciprocity , of trust , of empirically based confidence that no one is about to do you in .
It exists not because of intrinsic goodness or rampant naivete but because of a common , implicit understanding that that it works for everyone .
Implicit in the " what about their violence ? " argument is the idea that what we do wrong is excusable because it has been matched by the other side .
Of course , the other side sees it the same way so you end up with a perfect stalemate of violence .
When I raised a similar argument as a kid , my mother 's response was , " If Johnny were to jump off a cliff , would you jump off a cliff , too ? "
I never could come up with good answer to that and so eventually had to concede that somebody else 's stupidity was not a good excuse for my own .
From the moment we commence a moral intervention we become a part of the story , and part of the good and evil .
We are no longer the innocent bystander but a full participant whose acts will either help or make things worse .
Our intentions become irrelevant ; they are overwhelmed by the character of our response to them .
The morality of the disease is supplanted by the morality of the cure .
In fact , every moral act in the face of mental or physical injury carries twin responsibilities : to mend the injury and to avoid replacing it with anotherOne of the reasons America is in so much trouble is because it happily makes all sorts of compromises in order to get along with large dictatorships such as Russia and China , but thinks it can handle smaller operations like Hamas , North Korea , and Iran by simple obstinacy and belligerence .
In other words , it is happy to talk with big terrorists , but not little ones .
In fact , most of these small entities - and those who lead them - suffer from extreme inferiority complexes .
By threatening war , imposing massive embargos and so forth , America merely feeds the sense of persecution and encourages the least rational reaction .
A more sensible approach would be to constantly negotiate with these leaders and edge them towards reasonable participation in world affairs .
Imagine if we had told Israel and Palestine a few years ago that if they would just make nice we would give them enough money to equal Israel 's GDP for one year and Palestine 's for three .
Take the time off , go to the Riviera or the Catskills , forget about productivity , and just party on thanks to the American taxpayer .
Or if Israel and Palestine wanted to be really sensible , they could have invested in their countries ' future instead .
Think how much safer we would be today .
. .
But where would such a large sum of money come from ?
Well , all we would have had to have done was to cancel the invasion of Iraq and used the money as a carrot rather than as a bludgeon .
For that is just what it has cost us so far .
( 2007 ) The people who built castles and walled cities and moats are all dead now and their efforts at security seem puny and ultimately futile as we visit their unintended monuments to the vanity of human presumption .
Like the castle - dwellers behind the moat , we are now spending huge sums to put ourselves inside a prison of our own making .
It is unlikely to provide either security for our bodies nor solace for our souls , for we are simply attacking ourselves before others get a chance .
Empires and cultures are not permanent and while thinking about the possibility that ours is collapsing may seem a dismal exercise it is far less so than enduring the dangerous frustrations and failures involved in having one 's contrary myth constantly butt up against reality - like a boozer who insists he is not drunk attempting to drive home .
Instead of defending the non-existent , we could turn our energies instead towards devising a new and saner reality .
Places like Harvard and Oxford - and their after - school programs such as the Washington think tanks - teach the few how to control the many and it is impossible to do this without various forms of abuse ranging from sophism to corporate control systems to napalm .
It is no accident that a large number of advocates of war - in government and the media - are the products of elite educations where they were taught both the inevitability of their hegemony and the tools with which to enforce it .
It will , therefore , be some time before places such as Harvard and the Council on Foreign Relations are seen for what they are : the White Citizens Councils of state violence .
Castro , in his early days , spoke at the UN .
But the hotels of New York refused him space .
The result : Malcolm
X found him a hotel in Harlem and a key early step was taken in the alienation of a man who , with just a little respect and effort , might not have tormented every American president since by refusing to die or fade away .
Respect is important because it is a door wide enough for peace to enter .
We need to try it more often .
It is the golden rule of Washington politics : do n't engage with your critics .
But Barack Obama 's political staff could not resist the chance to hit back at Sarah Palin after she wrote crib notes on the palm of her hand at a gathering of conservative activists .
Talk to the hand ?
Sarah Palin 's palm print close up .
Photograph : AP
Speaking at a question and answer ­session on Saturday , the former US vice - presidential candidate and ex-Alaska governor inadvertently revealed that she had written the words " energy " , " budget cuts " , and " lift American spirit " on her palm .
The word " budget " had been crossed out and replaced with " tax " .
At yesterday 's daily briefing , the White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said he also had written some things down on his hand .
Breaking off from a question on healthcare reform , he said he planned to make pancakes for his son if the snow in Washington continued .
" I wrote ' eggs ' , ' milk ' , ' bread ' , but I crossed out ' bread . '
Then I wrote down ' hope ' and ' change ' , in case I forgot . "
Without missing a beat , Gibbs continued with his comments on the tax treatment of health insurance benefits under a Republican proposal .
Palin , who derided Obama as " a professor of law behind a lectern " and " a charismatic guy with a ­teleprompter " during her appearance at the first national Tea Party conference , has in turn been widely mocked for her own low - tech aid – dubbed a " Hillbilly Palm Pilot " .
" You really need to remind yourself to lift American spirits ? " joked Jon Stewart on the Daily Show .
Palin , who earned millions from the sale of her book " Going Rogue " and has a speaking slot on Fox News , is said to be considering a run for president in 2012 .
So one of the things I was working on as part of DeviceAtlas ( but which ultimately did n’t get used ) was a cache - conscious hash table in Java .
It ’s not unique in design – in fact it comes right out of a research paper written for the SPIRE 2005 conference by Nikolas Askitis and Justin Zobel – but the implementation was interesting to me as I ’d not done optimisation work in Java in a while , and some things had changed quite a bit since I last wrote Java code .
And it was a bit of an ego boost that I got it to outperform java.util .
HashMap :
SUN HashMap fill : 57797 us SUN HashMap query : 165701 us , 0 errors CCHashTable fill ( fair ) : 23205 us CCHashTable query ( fair ) : 35513 us , 0 errors CCHashTable fill : 41723 us CCHashTable query : 43055 us , 0 errors
Of course , there are the minor criticisms that it ’s nowhere near as general - purpose as the HashMap class and that HashMap is arguably exhibiting an intelligent design choice rather than cheating per se , but I like my ego so I ’m going to ignore those arguments !
Looking at the more interesting bits , there ’s the hash function .
This came from more work by Zobel , this time with Ramakrishna for a database conference in Melbourne in 1997 , and it ’s a fairly simple design : for each character in the input string , left shift the interim hashcode , add the character , then right shift the interim hashcode and add that to the mix , then xor the whole lot with the interim hashcode and that ’s your interim hashcode for the next iteration .
Which , as a description intended to convey simplicity , probably fails .
Oh well , the code is clearer :
/** * getHashCode ( ) differs from the standard Java hashcode algorithm . *
It 's an shift - add - xor class algorithm , as tested in " Performance * in Practise of String Hashing Functions " , Jobel & Ramakrishna , 1997 ; * and is implemented as efficiently as possible .
*/ public static int getHashCode ( char inputString [ ] ) { int result = CCHashTable.seed ; int length = inputString.length ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++ ) { result ^= ( ( result << 5 ) + inputString [ i ] + ( result >>> 2 ) ) ; } return ( ( result&0x7fffffff ) &0x1 ff ) ; }
There were initial performance problems with the code , because I started off just using a modulo to match the hashcode to the size of the hash table in the last line , and modulo ’s performance took a significant kick in the pants when Java went from JDK 1.2 to 1.4 – I said it had been a while since I wrote Java code , right ?
So we go from modulo to a simple masking with 0x1 FF which requires that the tablesize for the hash function stay fixed at 512 , but that was the optimal level found by Asktis & Sinha anyway , so no real harm there ( As far as I can tell by the way , that ’s why hash table sizes for Java are now all 2n - 1 in size ) .
Anyway , with the hashcode done , the rest of the code was reasonably simple .
Thing about the CCHashTable is that it is n’t so much conscious of the cache as it is dependant upon it .
It ’s an interesting lesson – the data structures learnt in college are not obselete , but the almost obscene speed of even today ’s entry - level desktop processor led to the necessity of caching main memory and the strategies used to pre-fill those caches have a heavy impact on performance which simply did n’t exist ten or twenty years ago .
So , for example , linked lists incur a performance hit when you search along them because the cache has no idea where the current item in the list will point to in memory for the next item .
However , you can get significant cache - induced performance gains by storing all the data in the structure in a simple contiguous array in memory .
The cache sees you walk along the array as you search it , and prefetches the entire thing for you – so your memory access times improve enormously .
It ’s cheating of a sort I suppose , and eventually this is going to bite us in the ass when we wind up needing gigabyte caches , but for now it ’s faster .
And if all you ’re storing is a string ( and that ’s what this application called for ) , then the coding is even easier – you just use a 2 - D char array ( we do n’t use String objects for obvious performance reasons ) :
public class CCHashTable {
/** Number of slots in CCHashTable . 512 from Asktis& Sinha 2007 . */ public static int tableSize = 512 ; /**
The CCHashTable 's contents are stored in a 2D char array */ private char contents [ ] [ ] ; /** Basic constructor . */ public CCHashTable ( ) { this .contents = new char [ CCHashTable.tableSize ] [ 0 ] ; } }
About the only interesting thing left is the storage of strings in the char array – ca n’t just drop them in obviously ( you ’d have no way of seperating them ) .
An EOL character would work , but length - encoded strings are a better idea as that way , when searching for a specific string later , you can call off the search early if you know that the string you ’re looking at is n’t a match – by jumping ahead to the next string .
Also , you can encode multiple data items this way , by putting them in the character stream between the end of one string and the start of the next .
In the specific application , every string had an ID number tagged to it , so the Integer class got encoded into chars , stored at the end of the string and the length of the string was also encoded and stored at the start :
public boolean addString ( char inputString [ ] , int id ) { // Sanity check if (( inputString==null ) ||( inputString.length==0 ) ) { return false ; } int i = CCHashTable.getHashCode( inputString ) ; int j = 0 ; int k = 0 ; int length = 0 ; int slotlength = this .contents [ i]. length ; int inputlength = inputString.length ; boolean match = false ; //
First of all , is this string in the hash table allready ?
while ( j < slotlength ) { // if there 's nothing left in the slot , jump out if ( this.contents [ i ] [ j ] == '') { break ; } match = true ; //
We store the strings as length - encoded , null - terminated // strings in the char array hence first we swipe the // length and reconvert it to an int length = ( int ) ( this.contents [ i ] [ j++ ] | ( this.contents [ i ] [ j++ ]
< < 16 ) ) ; //
If the string length does n't match , the strings do n't match , so jump out early . if ( inputlength ! =length ) { match = false ; } else { //
Now check the array for a character match .
Because this // shows a stride pattern in memory accesses , it 's // cache - friendly .
for ( k = j ; this .contents [ i ] [ k ] != '' ; k++ ) { if ( this.contents [ i ] [ k ] != inputString [ k-j ] ) { match = false ; break ; } } } //
If we found the string , we do n't bother to add it , we // just return back .
if ( match ) return false ; j += length +3 ; } //
Do we need to grow this slot in the array ?
If so , do so // now ... while ( ( slotlength - inputlength ) < ( j+5 ) ) { // char tmp [ ] = new char [ slotlength + CCHashTable.slotPageSize ] ; //System.arraycopy(this.contents[i ] , 0 , tmp , 0 , slotlength ) ; //this.contents[i ] = tmp this.contents [i ] = Arrays.copyOf(this.contents[i ] , slotlength + CCHashTable.slotPageSize ) ; slotlength = this.contents [i] .length ; } // Add String to end of contents array .
//
First encode the length of the string ( this allows us to // skip forward rapidly in the array when string matching if we // get an early negative ) this .contents [ i ] [ j++] = ( char ) ( inputlength & 0xffff ) ; this .contents [i ] [ j++] = ( char ) ( ( inputlength > > 16 ) & 0xffff ) ; //
Now copy over the inputString characters //System.arraycopy( inputString , 0 , this.contents[i ] , j , inputlength ) ; //j += inputlength ; for ( k = 0 ; k < inputlength ; k++ ) { this .contents [i ] [ j++] = inputString[k ] ; } // null - terminate this.contents [i ] [ j++] = ''; //
Now encode the id int after the null termination .
this .contents [i ] [ j++] = ( char ) ( id & 0xffff ) ; this.contents [ i ] [ j ] = ( char ) ( ( id > > 16 ) & 0 xffff ) ; return true ; }
And so searching looked like this :
/** * getId( ) is the retrieval method .
It takes the inputString * to check for and if found , it returns the associated id .
*
If not found , it returns - 1 .
This method is used on the local * side of DeviceAtlas and has to run fast .
*/ public int getId ( char inputString [ ] ) { int i = CCHashTable.getHashCode( inputString ) ; int j = 0 ; int k = 0 ; int length = 0 ; int inputlength = inputString.
length ; int slotlength = this .contents [ i]. length ; boolean match = false ; while ( j < slotlength ) { // if there 's nothing left in the slot , jump out and return - 1 if ( this.contents [ i ] [ j ] == '') { break ; } match = true ; // first decode the length of the string length = ( int ) ( this.contents [ i ] [ j++ ] | ( this.contents [ i ] [ j++ ]
< < 16 ) ) ; // if the length does not match , then do n't bother checking the characters if ( inputlength != length ) { match = false ; } else { // then start checking , character by character until we hit // the null terminator to see if we have a match .
for ( k = j ; this .contents [ i ] [ k ] != '' ; k++ ) { if ( this.contents [ i ] [ k ] != inputString [ k- j ] ) { // if we find we do not have a match , it 'll happen // earlier than finding we do , so jump right out of // the loop .
match = false ; break ; } } k++ ; } //
If we did find a match , return the id int. if ( match ) { return ( int ) ( this.contents [ i ] [ k++] | ( this.contents [ i ] [ k ] < < 16 ) ) ; } // skip ahead to the next string in the array and do it again .
j += length + 3 ; } return - 1 ; }
The most interesting part of the Cache Conscious HashTable , however , is that it ’s a small part of a larger data structure , a HAT - Trie .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 18 ( UPI ) --
More than 35 percent of Egyptians and Saudis interviewed in a recent survey considered it their duty to back regional mujahedin financially , a scholar notes .
Private polling of Egyptian and Saudi citizens reveals trends regarding the public sentiment toward jihadi groups like al - Qaida .

David Pollock , a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said the polling shows more than 35 percent of those interviewed considered it " an Islamic duty " to support Islamic fighters around the world .
Pollock adds that while many of the respondents said they did not support al - Qaida , more than 40 percent said they assumed other Muslim communities did support the group 's militant message .
He notes that while public support for radical Islam is dwindling , the perception that financial assistance is an obligation is troubling .
This , he says , suggests U.S. policymakers should focus their efforts on Arab funding for jihad as a whole .
" Taken by itself , the analysis of these data is not sufficient ground for major policy changes , but it should be factored into current discussion of the relevant issues , " he writes .

As the ball dropped at Times Square , Jennifer Lopez and Daughtry performed at the ABC stage in the legendary Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve at Times Square .
New Year 2009 New Years Eve at Time Square 2008 was a very cold experience .
At 1 F ( - 17C ) degree and a strong wind , it was one of the coldest Times Square New Years Eve ever .
Still a million people was gathered to see the Ball drop .
Bill and Hillary Clinton joined the crow a couple of minutes before midnight .
New Year 2008 No Panorama New Year 2007
More than 700.000 people are gathered at Times Square when the ball drops .
This year Brian Seacrest and Christina Aguilera welcomes the New Year on the ABC Stage at Military Island .
New Year 2006
with Mariah Carey performing live in ABC's Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve New Year 2005 New Year at Times Square is probably the most well known New Year Celebration in the world .
The celebration has this year ( 2005 ) it 's 100 year anniversary
It started in 1904 when the new headquarters of The New York Times was inagurated .
The owner of NYT the German Jewish immigrant Alfred Och , wanted to celebrate this with a large party where nothing was spared .
It ended with a large fireworks at midnight with people cheering and wishing Happy New Year .
The night was a large success and it instantly became a yearly tradition
2 years later fireworks within the city was banned and this lead to the introduction of the BALL which was lowered from the top of the building .
The Ball has been dropped every year since 1907 except for the war time dimouts in 1942 and 1943 .
The Ball is actually a 400 pound iron ball with light bulbs mounted around i New Year 2004 The New Year Celebration at Times Square New YORK is famous .
People travel from far away for this event .
The panorama made last year by Jook Leung is also famous .
Ranked among the top 10 during all 2003 at Google in searches for Times Square or New Years Eve .
Now he has done it again .
New Year 2003
The first of Jook Leung 's Times Square New Years panorama was a large succees , which was featured among thousands of blogs and liksites around the world .
PHOTOGRAPHER : Jook Leung www.360vr.com is internationally recognized as an innovator in spherical panoramic photography .
He specializes in creating unique and exceptional 360 degree panoramas .
A mini portfolio of his artistry with spherical panoramas can be seen on the Adobe Photographers Web site .
If you ’re interested , all the back issues are archived on the union ’s website .
If you peruse them , you ’ll learn that the union really really hates Governor Patrick , almost exclusively as a result of two issues , the Quinn bill and police details .
You ’ll see a bunch of other odd stuff too ( examples : from page C12 of the Nov / Dec 2009 edition : the false claim that “ the ACLU has filed a suit to have all military cross - shaped headstones removed ” ; and from page A3 of the Sept / Oct 2009 edition , the newspaper editor ’s opinion that homeless people seeking handouts at intersections “ are lazy pigs seeking funds to buy booze , cigarettes and drugs from idiot suburban morons who are stupid enough to give them anything ” and are “ an army of mendicant sloths ” ) .
Your perusal will also reveal large , full - color advertisements from many of Boston ’s biggest businesses .
Now , the newspaper does have a disclaimer of sorts on its front page that reads
The advertisers of the Pax Centurion do not necessarily endorse the opinions of the Pax Centurion / Boston Police Patrolmen ’s Association .
The advertisers are in support of the BPPA Scholarship Fund and every patrolmen [ sic ] who risks his or her life to protect and serve the community .
Well , fair enough .
Still , one does wonder whether the advertisers are aware of quite how … unusual … some of the “ opinions ” expressed in Pax Centurion really are .
In the Globe piece , Pax ’s editor was quoted as follows :
James Carnell , managing editor of Pax Centurion , said the pieces were contributed by union members , whose politics trend to the right .
“ Our members do tend to be on the conservative end , and we allow editorial expression from our members , ” he said .
“ Trend to the right ” ?
“ On the conservative end ” ?
No .
Giant headlines questioning whether the Obamas are “ really Americans ???? ? ” plastered over obviously doctored photographs are not “ on the conservative end . ”
That ’s the stuff of the extreme fringe .
The birthers .
Those guys .
Oh , I also enjoyed the droll Christmas poem printed on page A1 of the Nov / Dec 2009 issue .
Here ’s how it starts :
Twas the night before Christmas , and throughout Schroeder Plaza
The cops were as angry as Palestinians in Gaza .
Their pay and their benefits were under the knife ,
And the media ’s attacks made a miserable life .
The Palestinians in Gaza .
Really .
Look , say what you want about the Governor ’s position on details and the Quinn bill , but the situation in Gaza is about a good deal more than controversial job perks .
Let ’s try to keep some semblance of perspective .
Plus , Vampire Weekend , LCD Soundsystem , The National , Band of Horses , and more !
Some things are just perfect .
If you ’re a fan of indie music , then the 2010 lineup for the Sasquatch !
Music Festival probably deserves this classification .
After all , basically everyone who ’s anyone from the genre will be appearing at the pristine Gorge Amphitheatre this Memorial Day Weekend ( May 29 - 31 ) .
For one , joining the previously announced Pavement as the 2010 headliners will be My Morning Jacket and Massive Attack , both of which will likely be making their 2010 summer festival debut at Sasquatch .
Other heavyweights confirmed to take part include Ween , Vampire Weekend , LCD Soundsystem , Band of Horses , The National , Public Enemy , Kid Cudi , and Passion Pit .
But wait … there ’s more !
Broken Social Scene , She & Him , The New Pornographers , The Hold Steady , Dirty Projectors , Drive - By Truckers , Minus the Bear , The Mountain Goats , Caribou , The xx , OK Go , The Long Winters , Quasi , and Camera Obscura will all also be taking part , as will Deadmau5 , Simian Mobile Disco , No Age , The Temper Trap , Miike Snow , Why ? , YACHT , and Neon Indian .
Still not done :
You can also expect to see Fruit Bats , Midlake , Brother Ali , City & Colour , Portuga .

STRANGE , BUT TRUE ……
Since “ Superman ” was created by a couple of Jewish kids from Cleveland , that makes him Jewish .
Raised in a small town by a “ Goyisha ” couple , he probably never knew .
Also , they did n’t have a Synagogue in town , so he probably was n’t Bar - Mitzvah’d .
It ’s doubtful that he was Circumscised .
The foreskin of the superbaby would ’ve been impossible to cut !
What a mess !
Knowing that “ Lois Lane ” was her professional name , I checked old records and discovered that her real name was Lois Farbotnik .
So a union between them would be “ kosher ” Let ’s hope we can all straighten out this mess soon .
yrs for Comic Fandom , I remain Sincerely ,

A fossil that was celebrated last year as a possible " missing link " between humans and early primates is actually a forebearer of modern - day lemurs and lorises , according to two papers by scientists at The University of Texas at Austin , Duke University and the University of Chicago .
In an article now available online in the Journal of Human Evolution , four scientists present evidence that the 47 - million - year - old Darwinius masillae is not a haplorhine primate like humans , apes and monkeys , as the 2009 research claimed .
They also note that the article on Darwinius published last year in the journal PLoS ONE ignores two decades of published research showing that similar fossils are actually strepsirrhines , the primate group that includes lemurs and lorises .
" Many lines of evidence indicate that Darwinius has nothing at all to do with human evolution , " says Chris Kirk , associate professor of anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin .
" Every year , scientists describe new fossils that contribute to our understanding of primate evolution .
What 's amazing about Darwinius is , despite the fact that it 's nearly complete , it tells us very little that we did n't already know from fossils of closely related species . "
His co-authors are anthropologists Blythe Williams and Richard Kay of Duke and evolutionary biologist Callum Ross of the University of Chicago .
Williams , Kay and Kirk also collaborated on a related article about to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that reviews the early fossil record and anatomical features of anthropoids -- the primate group that includes monkeys , apes , and humans .
Last spring 's much - publicized article on Darwinius was released in conjunction with a book , a History Channel documentary , and an exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History .
At a news conference attended by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , the authors unveiled the nearly complete fossil of a nine - month - old female primate that had been found at the site of Messel in Germany .

But other anthropologists were immediately skeptical of the conclusions and began writing the responses that are being published this month .
" Just because it 's a complete and well - preserved fossil does n't mean it 's going to overthrow all our ideas , " says Williams , the lead author .
" There 's this enormous body of literature that has built up over the years .
The Darwinius research completely ignored that body of literature . "
That literature centers on the evolution of primates , which include haplorhines ( apes , monkeys , humans , tarsiers ) and strepsirrhines ( lemurs , lorises ) .
The two groups split from each other nearly 70 million years ago .
The fossil group to which Darwinius belongs -- the adapiforms -- have been known since the early 1800s and includes dozens of primate species represented by thousands of fossils recovered in North America , Europe , Asia and Africa .
Some adapiforms , like North American Notharctus , are known from nearly complete skeletons like that of Darwinius .
Most analyses of primate evolution over the past two decades have concluded that adapiforms are strepsirrhines , and not direct ancestors of modern humans .
The most recent such analysis , published last year in the journal Nature , concluded that Darwinius is an early strepsirrhine and a close relative of the 39 - million - year - old primate Mahgarita stevensi from West Texas .
advertisement
Nevertheless , the scientists who last year formally described Darwinius concluded that it was an early haplorhine , and even suggested that Darwinius and other adapiform fossils " could represent a stem group from which later anthropoid primates evolved . "
For example , they note that Darwinius has a short snout and a deep jaw -- two features that are found in monkeys , apes , and humans .
However , Kirk , Williams and their colleagues point out that short snouts and deep jaws are known to have evolved multiple times among primates , including several times within the lemur / loris lineage .
They further argue that Darwinius lacks most of the key anatomical features that could demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship with living haplorhines ( apes , monkeys , humans , and tarsiers ) .
For instance , haplorhines have a middle ear with two chambers and a plate of bone that shields the eyes from the chewing muscles .
" There is no evidence that Darwinius shared these features with living haplorhines , " says Kirk .
" And if you can't even make that case , you can forget about Darwinius being a close relative of humans or other anthropoids . "
Lawmakers are proposing a national identification card – what they 're calling " high - tech , fraud - proof Social Security cards " – that would be required for all employees in the United States .
The proposal by Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - New York ) and Sen. Lindsay Graham ( R - South Carolina ) comes as the states are grappling to produce another national identification card at the behest of the Department of Homeland Security .
Virtually none of the states are in compliance with this Real ID program – adopted in 2005 – requiring state motor vehicle bureaus to obtain and internally scan and store personal information like Social Security cards and birth certificates for a national database .
Now comes a bid for a second card .
Homeland Security officials pointed to the Sept. 11 hijackers ' ability to get driver 's licenses in Virginia using false information as justification for the proposed $ 24 billion Real ID program .
Schumer and Graham point to illegal immigration as cause for their plan .
" We would require all U.S. citizens and legal immigrants who want jobs to obtain a high - tech , fraud - proof Social Security card .
Each card 's unique biometric identifier would be stored only on the card ; no government database would house everyone 's information , " they said .
" The cards would not contain any private information , medical information or tracking devices .
The card would be a high - tech version of the Social Security card that citizens already have . "
Jim Harper , director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute , suggests the plan would undoubtedly lead to a national database .
He added that " there is no practical way of making a national identity document fraud - proof . "
What 's more , Richard Esguerra , the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's in - house activist , notes that a national ID card likely would expand from its stated purpose .
" Because of the ID card 's proposed universality , it will likely be requested and required by airlines , insurance agencies , health care providers , mortgage lenders , credit card companies , and so forth , " he said .
And this so - called mission creep is no fantasy .
A recent and clear example of this is the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act .
The 2007 law requires states to have statutes demanding sex - offender registration for those convicted of the non-sex - related offenses .
Graham and Schumer said they have discussed the immigration plan with President Barack Obama , but that apparently is as far it has gone .
Regarding Real ID , beginning Jan. 1 the law was supposed to have blocked anybody from boarding a plane using their driver ’s license as ID if their resident state did not comport with the Real ID program .
But the Department of Homeland Security extended the deadline for another year .

UPDATED :
Recent statements by Chinese military officials are raising concerns among U.S. analysts that the communist government in Beijing is shifting its oft - stated “ peaceful rise ” policy toward an aggressive , anti-U.S. posture .
The most recent sign appeared with the publication of a government - approved book by Senior Col .
Liu Mingfu that urges China to “ sprint ” toward becoming the world ’s most powerful state .
“ Although this book is one of many by a senior colonel , it certainly challenges the thesis of many U.S. China - watchers that the People ’s Liberation Army ’s rapid military growth is not designed to challenge the United States as a global power or the U.S. military , ” said Larry M. Wortzel , a China affairs specialist who until recently was co-chairman of the congressional U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission .
A Reuters report on Col . Liu ’s book , “ The China Dream , ” appeared Tuesday in the Communist Party newspaper People ’s Daily .
It quoted the book as stating China and the United States are in “ competition to be the leading country , a conflict over who rises and falls to dominate the world . ”
Mr. Wortzel said the statements in the book contradict those of former President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders who said China ’s rise to prominence in the 21st century would be peaceful .
They also carry political weight because the book was published by the Chinese military .
The book was released after calls by other Chinese military officials to punish the United States for policies toward Taiwan , U.S. criticism of China ’s lack of Internet freedom and U.S. support for the exiled Tibetan leader Dalai Lama .
One official , Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan , called for using economic warfare against the U.S. over arms sales to Taiwan and urged selling off some of China ’s $ 750 billion in holdings of U.S. debt securities .
China ’s military also recently cut off military exchanges with the Pentagon after the announcement of a $ 6.4 billion sale of helicopters and missiles to Taiwan .
Asked about Col. Liu ’s book , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said it would be wrong for China to view itself as a U.S. competitor .
For the 21st century , U.S. - China relations are the most important ties in the world and “ it is a mistake to see the relationship in zero - sum terms , ” Mr. Crowley said .
Some U.S. officials in the past dismissed similar alarming statements from the Chinese military as not reflecting official views .
However , Chinese leaders have not disavowed Gen .
Luo ’s remarks or those of others , such as Maj .
Gen .
Zhu Chenghu , who in 2005 said China would use nuclear weapons against the United States in response to any firing of conventionally armed long - range cruise missiles against Chinese cities .
The statement contradicted Beijing ’s declared policy of not using nuclear weapons first in a conflict .
Gen .
Zhu reportedly was criticized and demoted but surfaced in print Feb. 10 , calling for increased defense spending and boosting military deployments in response to the Taiwan arms sale .
China on Thursday announced that it would increase defense spending this year by 7.5 percent , a smaller increase than in previous years , in an apparent effort to limit criticism of its double - digit annual spending increases for more than a decade .
The recent military statements also counter insistence by many U.S. officials that China ’s strategic intentions toward the United States are masked by the lack of “ transparency ” in the communist system .
U.S. intelligence analysts , in analyses and estimates , also have dismissed or played down evidence of Chinese military deception to hide its true goals .
They instead have said in classified reports that the use of strategic deception to hide China ’s military buildup is similar to masking efforts of Western powers .
Critics of those analysts ’ “ benign China ” outlook say such views resulted in missing major strategic and military developments by China for more than a decade , such as new missiles , submarines and other advanced military hardware , some that were built in complete secrecy .
The recent Chinese military statements have renewed the long - running debate in U.S. policy and intelligence circles about China ’s long - term military intentions and whether they pose threats to U.S. interests .
Mr. Crowley said the U.S. is a global power and “ will remain so for the indefinite future , ” while China is a rising global power moving to gradually integrate into the global system .
Both countries “ have a shared responsibility to cooperate where we can to solve critical international challenges , and manage areas where our national interests may collide , ” he said .
Michael Pillsbury , a Pentagon policy official in the Reagan administration , said Chinese military authors have reignited a “ nasty debate ” in Washington on China .
Mr. Pillsbury , author of two books on Chinese military views of the future , said some U.S. China hands tried to trivialize the nationalistic views because senior Chinese officials do not make such statements at official meetings with U.S. counterparts .
“ China ’s foreign minister once told the U.S. secretary of state that China has no intention of ever pushing the U.S. out of Asia , ” he said .
Yet , “ the Chinese military itself seems to function with considerable autonomy and no real civilian oversight , so it is plausible that these Chinese military hawks are not mere mavericks or fringe elements at all .
Rather , their publications may be indicators of future Chinese programs that are veiled today , ” he said .
For example , reports of China ’s development of a high - tech ballistic - missile design to attack aircraft carriers first surfaced 15 years ago but were dismissed by many analysts as implausible .
U.S. naval intelligence sources , however , expect China to conduct a flight test soon of the new missile that increases the threat to U.S. warships in the western Pacific .
Adm. Robert Willard , the new commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , added fuel to the debate last fall by highlighting intelligence shortfalls on Beijing ’s arms buildup .
He told reporters that for more than a decade China “ exceeded most of our intelligence estimates of their military capability . ”
Earlier this year , Adm .
Willard questioned Chinese assertions about a peaceful rise , saying they are “ difficult to reconcile with new military capabilities that appear designed to challenge U.S. freedom of action in the region and , if necessary , enforce China ’s influence over its neighbors . ”
He told the House Armed Services Committee Jan. 13 that the Chinese military buildup was “ aggressive . ”
For years , senior U.S. civilian and military officials , including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , have stated in public that they do not consider China a “ threat ” or an “ enemy . ”
Yet military statements like those of Col .
Liu are making it difficult to continue those claims .
“ I do n’t think anyone who reads Col .
Liu ’s work can honestly deny that it reflects a consensus mindset in the Chinese military and political leadership , ” said John Tkacik , a former State Department China hand .
“ There ’s no question that Col .
Liu and other very influential and like - minded strategists … are psychologically preparing the People ’s Liberation Army for confrontation with the United States . ”
Richard Fisher , a China military analyst with the International Assessment and Strategy Center , said Col .
Liu ’s book has helped the debate by “ piercing the Beijing - Washington propaganda continuum of China ’s ‘ benign intent . ’ ”
Chinese Embassy spokesman Wang Baodong did not address the Chinese military statements but said Chinese leaders have said repeatedly that China seeks peaceful development .
“ China pursues a national defense policy of [ a ] defensive nature , will not engage … in any arms race , and will never seek hegemony , ” he said .

Lesson # 589 - The Relationship Commandments
This one was a lot of fun to make .
I think the 5th is my favorite .
For those curious or questioning , I went with the Catholic version of the Commandments because I am Catholic .
Until checking in preparation for the comic , I had no idea that there were variations on the numbering of the Commandments , or number related to coveting and God and such .
Kind of had to go with my background - if it really bothers you , I 'm sure you can switch it around .
When I heard about Binyam Mohamed I felt a certain sense of relief that finally some of the truth was coming out into the public arena .
But it 's not a revelation to me as it's something I have ­maintained since my release : that the British intelligence services were present at every stage of my ­incarceration and knew what was happening to me and to many other British prisoners .
I am a British citizen and the British intelligence services were , as far as I 'm concerned , complicit in the torture of their own citizens – the ones they 're supposed to protect .
I think that although the government is caught between trying to justify it and trying to deny it , this revelation should cause things to change more than they ever have before .
But I do n't know if that will be the case .
There 's been a strong denial from the government and suggestions from them that it 's a slur .
That 's impossible .
It 's a statement of fact .
The government is trying to hide this under the interests of national security .
I remember very well when I was held – not just in Guantánamo , but also in Bagram and Kandahar – that British intelligence services were present at every leg of that journey .
I knew one of them from the UK because he 'd ­visited my house in Birmingham , so we already knew each other when I saw him again at Kandahar and Bagram .
It 's well - known , especially to all the Guantánamo prisoners , that the British intelligence services were present .
The evidence is well - corroborated .
I do n't want to see those involved going to prison or suffering the way we did , but I do want the truth to come out and I do n't want them to hide behind national security .
They need to be open so we can get some reconciliation .
It 's hard to describe the conditions in which I first met British intelligence officials when I was in US ­custody .
After running the gauntlet of US soldiers punching and kicking me and dogs barking at me , I was forced to my knees , hooded and in shackles , with a gun pointed towards me .
When the hood was lifted so , metaphorically , was the veil , and in front of me I saw British intelligence agents .
I felt shock and relief .
Relief that these people – among them was the man who'd been in my house and who I 'd offered a cup of tea to – were British and so must have my interests at heart .
And shock that they were British but did n't have my best interests at heart .

In the second half of the 18th century , prominent European intellectuals supported a theory claiming that “ due chiefly to atmospheric conditions , in particular excessive humidity , all living things in the Americas were not only inferior to those found in Europe , but also in a condition of decline . ”
This was known as the Degeneracy Thesis , and its supporters included Voltaire ( a leading French philosopher ) , Frederick II ( the king of Prussia ) , Comte de Buffon ( the highest - regarded French biologist ) and Cornelius de Pauw ( a Dutch author considered the foremost authority on the New World ) .
“ It is a great and terrible spectacle to see one half of the globe so disfavored by nature that everything found there is degenerate or monstrous , ” remarked de Pauw , who went on to compare the native Americans with “ beasts of prey , ” insult Creoles ( “ never produced a single book ” ) and deride Eskimos ( “ fat and corpulent , and much under - limbed ” ) .
Buffon turned to environmental variation to explain , in his words , why “ the reptiles and insects are so large , the quadrupeds so small , and the men so cold , in the New World . ”
With the help of his training in Naturalism , he identified several contributing factors :
“ Greatly inferior ” heat .
“ Stagnating waters ” and abundant humidity , which reigns because “ the transpiration of so many vegetables , pressed close together , [ produces ] immense quantities of moist and noxious exhalations . ”
The overloading of the air and the Earth with “ humid and noxious vapours ” blocks the Sun from bestowing “ his most elivening rays upon this frigid mass . ”
“ The scarcity of men , therefore , in America , and most of them living like brutes ” has prevented cultivation , and so Nature “ never opens her fruitful and beneficent womb . ”
Thus , the New World is home to “ the production of moist plants , reptiles , and insects , and can only afford nourishment to cold men and feeble animals , ” Buffon said .
Criticism was n’t limited to native life , either .
In 1770 , another renowned French scholar claimed that America had not “ produced one good poet , one able mathematician , one man of genius in a single art or a single science . ”
These writings infuriated Americans , notably Thomas Jefferson , who wrote vigorous defenses of American animals , natives and colonists .
He even convinced a general in New Hampshire to send twenty soldiers to kill a bull moose , which he could send to Buffon as “ proof of the stature and majesty of American quadrupeds . ”
Buffon later redeemed his legacy , somewhat , by revising his ideas about the biology of the Americas .
And perhaps it ’s also worth noting that he was n’t entirely off - base ; he predicted a unparalleled prosperity in the New World , so long as its lands were cultivated , its rivers redirected and its marshes drained .

Iowa Town Renames Good Friday to ' Spring Holiday '
Citing the separation of church and state , Davenport nixes holy day .
March 29 , 2010  --
One week before the most solemn day in the Christian year , the city of Davenport , Iowa removed Good Friday from its municipal calendar , setting off a storm of complaints from Christians and union members whose contracts give them that day off .
Taking a recommendation by the Davenport Civil Rights Commission to change the holiday 's name to something more ecumenical , City Administrator Craig Malin sent a memo to municipal employees announcing Good Friday would officially be known as " Spring Holiday . "
" My phone has been ringing off the hook since Saturday , " said city council alderman Bill Edmond .
" People are genuinely upset because this is nothing but political correctness run amok . "
Edmond said the city administrator made the change unilaterally and did not bring it to the council for a vote , a requirement for a change in policy .
" The city council did n't know anything about the change .
We were blind sided and now we 've got to clean this mess up .
How do you tell people the city renamed a 2,000 year old holiday ? " said Edmond .
It did n't take long for the city the resurrect the name Good Friday .
Malin was overruled today and the words " Spring Holiday " disappeared .
Good Friday commemorates the day Jesus was crucified and died .
Christians celebrate his resurrection the following Sunday , Easter .
The Civil Rights Commission said it recommended changing the name to better reflect the city 's diversity and maintain a separation of church and state when it came to official municipal holidays .
" We merely made a recommendation that the name be changed to something other than Good Friday , " said Tim Hart , the commission 's chairman .
" Our Constitution calls for separation of church and state .
Davenport touts itself as a diverse city and given all the different types of religious and ethnic backgrounds we represent , we suggested the change . "
News of the change could not have come at more significant time in the Christian calendar .
News of the name change spread through the town on Palm Sunday , the beginning of Holy Week , becoming a topic of conversation at church services throughout Davenport .
Davenport Dispute Over Good Friday
" If you deny the idea of Good Friday then you have to deny Easter , " Monsignor Robert Schmidt told ABC affiliate WQAD .
Hart said the commission had no plans to change the name of Easter Sunday , because it fell on a weekend and government offices were already closed .
The commission , he said , discussed changing Christmas , but decided enough other religions celebrate Christmas too .
Hart , however , could not name one .
The religious right has attacked town governments that have removed public Christmas displays , calling such practices a " war on Christmas . "
City employees , beginning with local police , feared the name change would violate their union contracts with the city , which specifies Good Friday as an official municipal holiday .
Employees that work city holidays are paid time and a half .
Davenport officials called the name change an " error . "
" The City of Davenport will be observing " Good Friday " as a City Holiday on April 2 , " read a statement released today .
" City Administrator Malin , in error , forwarded the recommendation to staff for further review and action , leading to release of a holiday notice with the holiday named ' Spring Holiday , ' rather than " Good Friday , " read the release .
Davenport 's mayor said people were right to be angry but that Good Friday would continue to be acknowledged .
" I understand why people were so upset , " said Mayor Bill Gluba .
" My position is we have a lot more important issues .
We 'll fix this and move on . "

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican said on Tuesday it was wrong to focus blame for child abuse on the Catholic Church and denied accusations it had sought to cover up pedophilia by its clergymen around Europe .

Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi acknowledged the “ gravity of the crisis the Church is undergoing ” after fresh allegations surfaced in recent weeks of widespread sexual abuse by clergymen in Germany , Austria and Holland .
But he denied allegations by a German government minister that the Vatican had colluded to cover up pedophilia .
Reports last month alleged that Catholic priests had sexually abused over 100 children at Jesuit schools there .
“ Errors committed by the institutions and members of the Church are particularly reprehensible given the Church ’s educational and moral responsibility , ” Lombardi told Vatican Radio .
“ But every objective and well - informed person knows that the issue is much broader , and concentrating accusations on the Church alone gets things out of perspective , ” he said .
Lombardi cited a recent report by Austrian authorities which detailed 17 cases of abuse in institutions linked to the Catholic Church , but 510 in other organizations .
“ It would be good to worry about these as well , ” he said .
The latest allegations follow years of damaging scandal in Ireland and the United States .
The U.S. Church has paid some $ 2 billion in settlements to victims since 1992 .
The Dutch Roman Catholic Church on Tuesday said it would ask an independent commission to look into more than 200 reports of alleged sexual abuses by priests , in response to an increasing number of victims coming forward .
Germans were outraged by reports of abuse by Jesuits and allegations of beating and pedophilia at three Catholic schools in Bavaria , including one linked to a prestigious choir run by Pope Benedict ’s brother from 1964 to 1994 .
Rev. Georg Ratzinger , 86 , has acknowledge he slapped pupils in the face to discipline them but has denied any knowledge of sexual abuse .
DENIES COVER-UP
German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger accused the Vatican of covering up severe sexual abuse in the Church .
She said a 2001 Catholic congregational directive made severe cases of abuse subject to papal secrecy .
Lombardy said the 2001 missive , “ De delictis gravioribus ” ( “ On more serious crimes ” ) -- written by Benedict before he became pope -- emphasized pedophilia was one of the worst crimes under Church law .
“ Anyone who understands it , knows it was a decisive step to remind the episcopacy of the gravity of the problem and to encourage concrete measures to prevent and tackle it , ” he said .
Lombardy defended the record of the Church in Germany , Austria and Holland in reacting decisively to the allegations , saying it had always placed the interests of victims first and had been quick to take measures to prevent any recurrence .
Lombardy welcomed a German government proposal for a round - table discussion on April 23 with victims , that would include talk of potential compensation -- a proposal previously rejected by the head of the German Bishops Conference , Robert Zollitsch .
Zollitsch has issued a public apology for the abuse and is due at the Vatican on Friday to discuss the scandal .
Pope Benedict , himself a German , summoned Irish bishops to the Vatican last month to reprimand them after a government report said Church leaders had covered up widespread abuse of children by priests for 30 years .
However , victims groups expressed dismay , saying the meeting did not conclude who should pay for the cover up and failed to mention any Vatican responsibility for looking the other way .

( Quotes are from memory , summarized )
Huckabee : Concerning Obama's and Clinton 's treatment of Netanyahu in response the the Jerusalem settlement announcement , was n't this a shabby way to treat America 's best ally in the Middle East ?
Baker : The U.S. and Israel are strong allies and will remain so due to common interests , cultural similarities and Israel 's democratic government .
But every American administration since the founding of Israel has objected to Israel 's building of settlements .
There have frequently been tensions between Washington and Israel over this issue .
In fact , I think the Obama administration 's reaction to the Jerusalem settlement expansion has been completely appropriate .
( Emphasis added )
Huckabee : But does n't Israel have the right to build settlements in its capitol , one it 's own land ?
Baker :
It 's not Israeli land ; it 's Arab land .
This is land that will eventually be transferred back to the Palistinian Authority for the creation of a Palistinian State .
The expansion of these settlements makes the eventual peace agreement more difficult to achieve .
Huckabee : But Israel has tried trading land for peace before , and peace never seems to come .
Baker : Israel traded land for peace with Egypt and Jordan .
Israel transferred back land that it had seized during wartime .
The peace treaties with those two countries have held up well over the years .
This is where Huckabee decided to wrap up the interview , thanking Baker for his time .
I could n't help imagine a Fox producer making a note never to book James Baker again .
Next week : John Bolton will discuss Obama 's abuse of recess appointments !
States Distancing Themselves From The Federal Government
Over 40 States Declare State Sovereignty
A Commentary by J. D. Longstreet
**********************************
NINTH AMENDMENT to the US Constitution :
The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .
TENTH AMENDMENT to the US Constitution :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
As I have observed over the past few months the “ State Sovereignty Movement ” continues to sweep the nation with well over three - quarters of the fifty states taking action , through their respective state legislatures , re-establishing their “ sovereignty ” .
It is being reported that there are over 40 states with state sovereignty declarations as of this writing .
If true , that is heartening .
There is no doubt the states have been relegated to second - class citizenship in the US .
That is just WRONG and must be corrected !
We found reports on the Internet stating that THERE ARE 12 NEW STATE SOVEREIGNTY DECLARATIONS IN PROGRESS , RIGHT NOW !!
THEY INCLUDE ALABAMA .
NEBRASKA , Rhode Island , WYOMING , WASHINGTON , INDIANA , KENTUCKY , GEORGIA , KANSAS , MISSOURI , MISSISSIPPI , AND MARYLAND !
WYOMING is the newest constitutionally sovereign state .
The bill was signed into law on March 8th , 2010 .
Utah did the same on the 25th of February 2010 .
The debate continues in my home state of South Carolina , but my guess is it will pass the state legislature and be signed into law by the “ Sandlappers ” very soon now .
Here in North Carolina , House Bill H849 “ supporting the state ’s right to claim sovereignty over certain powers under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ” has been filed .
Here ’s the full text :
Whereas , the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows : “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states , respectively , or to the people ; ” and
Whereas , the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States and no more ; and
Whereas , the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states ; and
Whereas , today , in 2009 , the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government ; and
Whereas , many federal mandates are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ; and
Whereas , Section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States says , “ The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government , ” and the Ninth Amendment states that “ The enumeration in the constitution of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people ; ” and
Whereas , the United States Supreme Court ruled in New York v. United States , 112 S. Ct. 2408 ( 1992 ) , that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory processes of the states ; and
Whereas , a number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United States ; Now , therefore ,
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives :
SECTION 1 . The North Carolina House of Representatives supports the State ’s right to claim sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government or reserved to the people by the Constitution of the United States .
SECTION 2 . The North Carolina House of Representatives urges the federal government , as the agent of the State , to cease and desist , effective immediately , mandates that are beyond the scope of any constitutionally delegated powers .
SECTION 3 . The North Carolina House of Representatives further urges that compulsory federal legislation which directs states to comply under threat of civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or requires states to pass legislation or lose federal funding be prohibited or repealed .
SECTION 4 . The Principal Clerk shall transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the President of the United States , the President of the United States Senate , the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , and each member of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation .
SECTION 5 . This resolution is effective upon adoption .
Read more on North Carolina ’s efforts to re-establish its sovereignty HERE .
I took a look in my crystal ball and , for the life of me ; I could see no indication of the effect the sovereignty movement will have on future relations between the states and their “ agent ” … the federal government .
Only time will tell .
However , I must tell you , it does this old southern boy ’s heart good to see “ State ’s Rights ” again brought to the fore in the United States .
James Madison , The Founder we refer to as “ The Father of the Constitution , ” wrote the following : “ To preserve the Republic , it is in the hands of the people .
We have staked the whole future of American civilization not upon the power of government , far from it .
We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self - government ; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves , to control ourselves , to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments ”
As with all Americans we “ Southerners ” get a lot of things wrong .
But we have been right on the issue of “ State ’s Rights ” all along .
See , southerners had a bit more than just a signature invested in the creation of the Constitution , itself .
There was never any doubt , in our minds , about who “ the greater ” and who “ the lesser ” was / is in this association of states and federal government .
I must tell you , I am more than a little pleased to find the names of several northern and western states , and even northeastern states , included in the list of the names of the states involved in the State Sovereignty Movement .
Washington would do well to take notice , serious notice , of this movement .
The Congress and the President may have forgotten , but it is “ the boss ” filing this complaint .
It is very easy to sit in Washington and spend North Carolina ’s money , or the money of the folks from Texas or Oklahoma .
But , believe me when I tell you that we have been paying attention and we do not like having our state ’s treasuries looted by a heavy - handed federal government .
The current Congress would also do well to read up on the “ Ordinance of Nullification ” passed by my home state of South Carolina in 1828 .
You can read it for yourself HERE .
Suffice it to say State Sovereignty is NOT a NEW issue in this country .
It appears we will have to visit it — yet again .

A misunderstanding that I sometimes run into when teaching programming is that the compiler can and should guess what the programmer means .
This is n’t usually quite what people say , but it ’s what they ’re thinking .
A great example appeared in a message sent to the avr - gcc mailing list .
The poster had upgraded his version of GCC , causing a delay loop that previously worked to be completely optimized away .
( Here ’s the original message in the thread and the message I ’m quoting from . )
The poster said :
… the delay loop is just an example , of how simple , intuitive code can throw the compiler into a tizzy .
I ’ve used SDCC ( for mcs51 ) where the compiler ‘ recognises ’ code patterns , and says “ Oh , I know what this is – it ’s a delay loop !
– Let it pass . ” ( for example ) .
Another example comes from the pre-ANSI history of C , before the volatile qualifier existed .
The compiler would attempt to guess whether the programmer was accessing a hardware register , in order to avoid optimizing away the critical accesses .
I ’m sure there are more examples out there ( if you know of a good one , please post a comment or mail me ) .
The problem with this kind of thinking is that the correctness of code now depends on the compiler correctly guessing what the programmer means .
Since the heuristics used to guess are n’t specified or documented , they are free to change across compilers and compiler versions .
In the short term , these hacks are attractive , but in the long run they ’re little disasters waiting to happen .
One of the great innovations of the past 50 years of programming language research was to separate the semantics of a language from its implementation .
This permits the correctness of an implementation to be judged solely by how closely it conforms to the standard , and it also permits programs to be reasoned about as mathematical objects .
C is not the most suited to mathematical reasoning , but there are some excellent research projects that do exactly this .
For example Michael Norrish ’s PhD thesis formalized C in the HOL theorem prover , and Xavier Leroy ’s CompCert compiler provably preserves the meaning of a C program as it is translated into PPC or ARM assembly .
Of course , the intent of the programmer does matter sometimes .
First , a well - designed programming language takes programmer intent into account and makes programs mean what they look like they mean .
Second , intent is important for readability and maintainability .
In other words , there are usually many ways to accomplish a given task , and good programmers choose one that permits subsequent readers of the code to easily grasp what is being done , and why .
But the compiler does not , and should not , care about intent .
We have ascertained the location of ' Big Ben ' Mills , who posted nude photos of an allegedly smack - addled Peaches Geldof .
He is with his band , recovering from a performance where he inserted meathooks through his skin and dangled from the ceiling .
According to a band mate , the man of the " Big Ben " penis tattoo no longer uses heroin .
For endorphin rushes , he sticks to flesh suspension , a terrifying hobby wherein people have meathooks stabbed through the skin on their backs or chests , get suspended from the ceiling , and swing around like some sadomasochistic version of Peter Pan on Broadway .
Big
Ben performs this feat as a stage act for Nassau Chainsaw , a metal band that features a nightmarish circus of torturous side acts , most of which include " intensity , shock value , and doing something that no sane person should ever do . "
Two nights ago in Detroit , Ben breathed fire .
And last night in Reading , PA he did swung from the skin on his back with the greatest of ease .
( Or pain , or full - body shock . )
Ben resolutely refused to speak on the phone or communicate in with us , but a member of Nassau Chainsaw who asked not to be identified ( not that you wo n't have a one - in - four shot at guessing which it was ) spoke by phone with Ben " sitting in the van with us right now . "
He explained that flesh suspension has a " long tribal history , " but that for their friends " it starts from the tattoo and piercing scene , " and requires " professional rigging . "
According to this flesh suspension Q&A , the effect is a " shock - induced state of disorientation spiked with moments of pain and euphoria . "
Anyway , back to our peculiar insta-celebrity , Big Ben .
He 's been showing off his superhuman pain tolerance with Nassau Chainsaw for three years .
Peaches Geldof is n't part of that crew and has never been to a show as far as the band mate we talked to knows .
They are based in New York .

The next day we went in search of the icon of PNG tourism , the bird of paradise .
We left just before 6 am , George , Johannes and me , interlopers in a monochrome world .
It was as still as a print .
A bleary moon peered through a skein of shifting cloud , silhouetting the canoe .
There was the smell of wood smoke .
The air , not quite chilled from yesterday , had that delicious coolness that augurs the heat of the tropical day .
The river lay in slabs , shiny as ice .
Our speeding canoe was the only thing moving on earth .
Around us , all was etched in high - resolution clarity .
Trees stood up to their knees in floodwater , nothing ruffling their reflections ; curds of mist lay motionless across the face of the Hunsteins .
It was a morning to live for and one I never expect to see again .
Revolution # 193 , February 21 , 2010
From A World To Win News Service :
Iran February 11 Protests : A Report
We received the following from A World to Win News Service :
February 15 , 2010 .
A World to Win News Service .
With the approach of February 11 , the anniversary of the Iranian people 's uprising in 1979 ( when the rule of the Shah and the monarchy as a political system was ended and the Islamists came to power ) , people were eager to wage another round of battle and show their hatred for the Islamic regime .
Expectations were heightened by the experience of the protests on Ashura ( December 26 ) , when the people were able to take the initiative through radical and inspiring struggle .
But any idea that the path of development would continue in the straight line and that the regime would be driven to the verge of collapse proved incorrect .
On February 11 , people determined to protest came out in different cities and regions .
Since there was no pre-agreed assembly point in Tehran , anti-regime protestors gathered at 10 main locations .
Despite the draconian military force they found there waiting for them , thousands of youth were not deterred and continued their protests , chanting slogans against the regime .
Most of the protestors were trying to get to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square , where the regime was holding its own reactionary celebration , but the security forces had blocked all the access streets except the one that the government - organized march was passing through .
The security forces were concentrated on that street .
Their advance preparations to keep it under control included installing loudspeakers along the route so as to be able to drown out unauthorized chanting .
Thousands of security officers had been stationed in the square since the day before .
This made it very difficult for protestors to reach the square in any organized fashion .
Those who did manage to get through the square were scattered and lost amid the crowd brought by the government .
However , foreign journalists spotted some brave enough to shout " Down with the dictator " under these circumstances .
( Los Angeles Times , February 12 ; The New York Times , February 14 ) .
In many other parts of Tehran , youths came out in small groups , but these groups were not able to hook up with one another .
They chanted anti-regime slogans and clashed with the Basiji ( militia members ) .
Their slogans differed from place to place .
In some locations people 's chants were in support of the Green leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi and followed the slogans they had suggested , such as the demand for a " referendum . "
In other places slogans warned the Green leaders against any compromise with the regime .
For instance , although it loses its rhythm in translation , one slogan was " We did not give our martyrs in order to compromise , and praise a murderer leader . "
This was a clear reference to Mousavi and Karoubi statements after the Ashura demonstration in which they recognized President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 's legitimacy as the Leader .
Although the Green leaders later tried to justify their statements and spin them as though they had n't meant what they said , people had taken a note .
People also chanted , " Free all political prisoners . "
Slogans such as " Death to the dictator " and others against Khamenei were common everywhere .
In some demonstrations , " Down with the Islamic Republic " and " Independence , Freedom , Iranian Republic " were also chanted , despite the fierce opposition to these slogans by the Green leaders .
Protestors tore down the big portraits of Khamenei and ripped them into pieces .
Many people deliberately walked on them .
According to other sources , protestors tore down portraits of Ahmadinejad and Khomeini ( BBC - Farsi website , February 12 ) .
Despite all the reinforcements the regime could muster , protestors were able to seize at least one Basiji 's motorcycle and set it on fire .
It was reported that there were clashes in dozens of locations in Tehran , including Vali Asr Square and Sadeghi Square where Karoubi started his own march .
Youth who could not get into Azadi Square turned the underground trains and the buses into moving demonstrations , continually chanting slogans like " Death to the dictator " with few objections from passengers , who often cooperated with the youth .
Many observers noted that the brutality of the uniformed and plainclothes security forces was worse than at any other time since the beginning of the current wave of protests in June .
The brutal beating of one man whom the security forces had stripped naked was caught by a protestor 's camera and posted on YouTube .
The regime said it had arrested dozens of protestors .
There are unconfirmed reports that a woman was killed .
Reports also indicate that despite the threats by Islamic Republic officials and security force commanders , people came out to protest and show their determination in other main cities such as Isfahan , Shiraz , Mashhad and Ahvaz .
Footage of what seems to have been serious fighting in Isfahan was posted on the Web .
Despite the fact that the regime is at its weakest point in the last 31 years , in terms of internal unity , popular support , the economy , corruption and many other aspects , it has not lost all its powers .
It has kept all of its firepower and intends to show that it is not in a mood to back down .
In fact , after the shock of the Ashura protests last December , the regime came to the conclusion that the existing level of threats and brutality — including murder , imprisonment , torture , and rape — was not enough to crush the people 's determination .
When people chanted , " Cannon , tanks and Basiji are no longer effective , " they really meant it .
So in desperation the regime decided to show off its remaining strengths leading up to and on February 11 .
It qualitatively increased the level of suppression and repression , and it showed that it still can mobilize people .
In this way it sought to demoralize the people or at least the Green leaders , and this time not lose the initiative .
Thousands of people were arrested and charged with involvement in the Ashura protests .
In addition , there have been arrests of hundreds if not thousands of student activists , women activists , worker activists , many journalists not in full agreement with the government and many lawyers and human rights people .
The regime put a lot of pressure on the Kurdistan region and arrested many activists there who were taken to an unknown location .
Two young prisoners were executed in Tehran in early February .
Arrested before the first June 2009 demonstrations , they were accused of membership in a monarchist organization that no one had heard of before , and whose existence was widely questioned .
Many of the arrested have been sentenced to long prison terms for doing nothing , or just for taking part in a demonstration — in one man 's case because he had honked his car horn in support of marchers .
Top officials of the reformist faction also were sentenced to long imprisonment .
Some of them are in their 70s and suffer from cancer or heart problems that have worsened in prison .
Among them are Ibrahim Yazdi ( the Islamic Republic 's first foreign minister ) , Mohammad Maleki ( the first head of Tehran University after the revolution ) and Behzad Nabavi , who previously held several high - level jobs in the Islamic regime , including a ministerial position .
The regime has refused to allow them visitors or even reveal where they are being held .
While stepping up the repression , the government forces also did all they could to mobilize people from all over the country , no easy job for a hated and isolated regime .
They used their country 's money and resources to incite and even bribe people to attend Ahmadinejad 's speech in Azadi Square .
The regime spent 300 billion Touman ( equivalent to 300 million dollars ) on this event , according to Mohsen Sazegara , a defected regime official speaking on Voice of America 's Persian TV on February 14 .
First of all there were the thousands of trusted men on the regime 's payroll whose job includes being present to cheer for top officials .
They usually travel with Khamenei and Ahmadinejad to other cities when they go to speak , and they participate in Friday Prayers .
In addition , the regime organized people in remote towns and villages and used hundreds or maybe thousands of buses to transfer them to Tehran in that day .
They were promised good food , and cameras showed cake and food parcels being distributed among the participants .
Apart from those who were doing their job and hardcore Islamic Republic supporters , many of the participants were in a far less combative mood than the protestors a few blocks away who were engaged in fierce fighting with security forces .
For them this was a picnic , a day off from work , a free ride to Tehran and free food and snacks .
They could spend the day with family , away from home and above all avoid the risk of losing their job .
An eight - minute amateur video on YouTube reflects the mood of the regime 's event .
Despite all its preparations , still the regime was apprehensive .
Scaffolding was used to divide the crowd into many different sections .
Yet with all this , during Ahmadinejad 's speech chants of " Down with the dictator ! " could be heard from among the crowd .
It was even said that the regime 's TV stopped broadcasting his speech earlier than expected , maybe because of this .
The regime invested a great deal financially and militarily to achieve the political results that it sought : the appearance of legitimacy .
They have already started a campaign to exaggerate the results , boasting that five million people took part in Tehran .
In contrast , some foreign media ( for instance , The New York Times , February 14 ) noted that the square was significantly less full than previous years , despite the combination of threats and bribes , and several informed Iranian sources gave estimates of hundreds of thousands .
These seem to be confirmed by broadcast photos .
The reality is that the regime 's count of supporters at Azadi Square was as fake as number of votes Ahmadinejad claimed were cast for him in the June presidential election .
But even so , the people and the revolutionary forces should look at reality and correctly assess the weaknesses and strength of the enemy as well as their own .
What the regime did was not from a position of strength but of weakness and fear of the people 's movement .
But given the offensive character of the people 's protests on Ashura , it was certainly not correct to think that the Islamic regime would remain passive and idly wait for another attack .
The Islamic regime not only carried out extensive militarily preparations , it also tried to outmaneuver the people and regain the initiative .
For example , when the people went to the usual gathering points they found out that those locations had already been occupied by thousands of Basiji and security forces .
It was also not correct to assume that the regime had reached its limits and was on the verge of collapse .
It is true that the Islamic regime has become more unpopular and isolated than ever .
But it still holds political power , and it has a huge army and the money of a nation to spend for its own interests .
The Islamic regime will resist until the last moment and it is not in a mood to back down .
Looking at the people 's side , it is true that a popular mass movement exists and the vast majority of the people hate the Islamic regime , its leaders and its principles .
That is an important strength of the people 's movement .
The protest of tens of thousands of Iranian people on February 11 is a great achievement in the face of such repression and considering that they had either no leadership or the leadership of the Green leaders who continuously worked to limit the people 's initiative .
The fact that the protests happened anyway shows the determination of a section of the people .
However , it was not possible under such circumstances for the people to gain the initiative .
It is true that the people 's movement has been growing in number and in quality in the last few months and has taken on dangerous dimensions for the ruling power .
But that does n't necessarily mean the movement will continue to grow and develop spontaneously , and that the reactionary ruling power will not be able to seize back the initiative .
The fighting people have to see the weaknesses of the movement and try their best to remedy them and develop the movement into a stronger movement .
One of the movement 's most important weaknesses is that so many people still go along with the Green leaders and their line .
Even among the people who have no faith in the Green leaders , many have various reasons to justify supporting them anyway .
Some say yes to the Greens just in order to say no to Ahmadinejad and Khamenei .
Some believe they should stay united under the leadership of the Greens because they are the only ones who can unite the people in this situation , or because they do not want to divide the movement .
Some people believe they should fight the ruling power step by step , isolating and getting rid of Khamenei and Ahmadinejad first .
While there are some points to be seriously considered in some of these reasons , none are enough to justify support for the Green leaders .
The Green leaders are part of the Islamic Republic ; they say they are " proud " of that .
They have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to the Islamic Republic and its principles .
Their past confirms that as well .
In one way or other they took part in stealing the people 's revolution and suppressing the people and their achievements , and the massacre of the political prisoners throughout the 1980s , including the 1987 mass executions .
This has to be kept in mind when they say they want to go back to the Islamic regime 's founding principles under Khomeini .
The Iranian people are engaging in a serious battle with a brutal regime armed to teeth .
The " silent " and " non-violent " movement propagated by reformist and pro-imperialist circles cannot topple it .
On the contrary it will buy time until it gets the opportunity to crush the movement .
Revolutionary tactics and strategy are needed to overthrow the Islamic Republic and replace it with a system that really relies on the people and works for the people .
A system that does not dictate religion and its grip on the people but keeps religion out of the state , a system where women are not discriminated against and humiliated , a system where national minorities are not oppressed and students are not suppressed , a system that opposes imperialism in reality and does not just pretend to be anti-imperialist while being highly dependent on the imperialist world market .
To overthrow the Islamic Republic and achieve freedom and independence , the people must be organized and seriously engage in an uncompromising revolutionary war with a brutal and armed enemy .
That is only possible under the leadership of conscious proletarian party armed with the scientific ideology of Marxism - Leninism - Maoism .
A World to Win News Service is put out by A World to Win magazine ( aworldtowin.org ) , a political and theoretical review inspired by the formation of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement , the embryonic center of the world ’s Marxist - Leninist - Maoist parties and organizations .

The 10th Amendment Movement is an effort to push back against unconstitutional federal laws and regulations on a state level .
The principle is known as nullification ,  and was advised by many prominent founders .
Current Nullification Efforts :
Potential Future Efforts :
Patriot Act
No Child Left Behind
State - Initiated Constitutional Amendments
History of Nullification :
While the media generally portrays nullification as being solely aligned with the efforts of the nullifiers of the South and the Civil War , this is certainly false , and reeks of misinformation .
Nullification has a long history in the American tradition and has been invoked in support of free speech , in opposition to war and fugitive slave laws , and more .
Read more on this history here .
10th Amendment Resolutions
These non-binding resolutions , often called state sovereignty resolutions  do no carry the force of law .
Instead , they are intended to be a statement of the legislature of the state .
They play an important role , however .
If you owned an apartment building and had a tenant not paying rent , you wouldnt show up with an empty truck to kick them out without first serving notice .
That s how we view these Resolutions  as serving notice and demand to the Federal Government to cease and desist any and all activities outside the scope of their constitutionally - delegated powers . 
Follow - up , of course , is a must .

10th Amendment Bills
Unlike the many 10th Amendment Resolutions that have been introduced around the country since 2008 , these  10th Amendment or  State Sovereignty  bills are proposals for binding legislation .
They include language to affirm the sovereignty of the people of the state and to create a commission or a committee to review the Constitutionality of acts emanating from the federal government .

Firearms Freedom Act Originally introduced and passed in Montana , the FFA declares that any firearms made and retained in - state are beyond the authority of Congress under its constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states .
The FFA is primarily a Tenth Amendment challenge to the powers of Congress under the commerce clause ,  with firearms as the object .

Medical Marijuana Laws
An honest reading of the Constitution with an original understanding of the Founders and Ratifiers makes it quite clear that the federal government has no constitutional authority to override state laws on marijuana .
All three branches of the federal government , however , have interpreted ( and re-interpreted ) the commerce clause of the Constitution to authorize them to engage in this activity , even though theres supposedly no legal commerce in the plant .
At best , these arguments are dubious ; at worst an intentional attack on the Constitution and your liberty .

Act Led by Maine in early 2007 , 25 states over the past 2 years have passed resolutions and binding laws denouncing and refusing the implement the Bush - era law which many expressed concerned about privacy , funding and more .
While the law is still on the books in D.C. , its implementation has been delayed  numerous times in response to this massive state resistance , and in practice , is virtually null and void .

Health Care Like Marijuana above , a reading of the Constitution through the original understanding of the Founders and Ratifiers makes it quite clear that any national health care plan , or national public option , is not something that was delegated by the People to the Federal Government in the Constitution .
However , the courts , politicians and many commentators have interpreted ( and re-interpreted ) the Commerce Clause , the general Welfare Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause in ways not intended by the Founders so as to justify such programs under the Constitution .
They are most certainly wrong .
A number of states are considering legislation to effectively nullify any future national health care plan .

Bring the Guard Home Under the Constitution , the militia ( now called the National Guard ) may only be called into duty by the federal government in three specific situations .
According to Article I , Section 8 ; Clause 15 , the Congress is given the power to pass laws for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions . 
The militia was intended by the Founders and Ratifiers to be defense force and nothing more .
Deployments outside the country were not considered , and neither were internal deployments in pursuance of powers that were not delegated to the federal government .
Congress has passed numerous laws in the past 100 years giving the federal government additional authority not mentioned in the Constitution .
But , without amendment , altering the enumerated powers by legislative fiat is , in and of itself , unconstitutional .
Campaigns in states around the country are working to reassert the authority of governors over guard troops .

Cap and Trade Cap and Trade is often claimed to be authorized under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution .

State Sovereignty and Federal Tax Funds Act Such laws would require that all federal taxes come first to the states Department of Revenue .
A panel of legislators would assay the Constitutional appropriateness of the Federal Budget , and then forward to the federal government a percentage of the federal tax dollars that are delineated as legal and Constitutionally - justified .
The remainder of those dollars would be assigned to budgetary items that are currently funded through federal allocations and grants or returned to the people of the state .

Federal Gun Laws Nullification
As codified in law with the 2nd Amendment , the People did not delegate the power to regulate or control the ownership of firearms to the federal government .
And , as the 10th Amendment makes clear , all powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the States or to the People themselves .

Nullification of Federal Intrastate Commerce Regulation
As understood at the time of the founding , the regulation of commerce was meant to empower Congress to regulate the buying and selling of products made by others ( and sometimes land ) , associated finance and financial instruments , and navigation and other carriage , across state jurisdictional lines .
These bills attempt to reassert this original meaning of the commerce clause over wide areas of policy and effectively nullify federal laws and regulations that violate such limitations by regulating commerce and other activities that are solely intrastate .

The Sinking Russian Economy
Last week it was revealed that Russia ’s rate of wage nonpayment among employers is on the rise , soaring a shocking 15.5 % in January .
Total unpaid wages exceeded $ 135 million , and a million dollars goes a very , very long way in a country where the average wage is $ 3/ hour .
The sum which the Kremlin admits is currently outstanding to Russian workers ( the actual sum could , of course , be far higher ) amounts to 45 million man-hours of unpaid wages , and it occurred even though Russia ’s unemployment rate is also soaring .
Why are Russian employers holding back wages ?
The reason is clear : Massive debt threatens to crush them .
Last week the Association of Russian banks reported that bad debt may increase by more than one third this year from its already horrifying , uncivilized 12 % rate last year .
Banks , of course , faced with this impending crisis are cutting employers off from new credit , meaning that they can’t obtain new loans to pay old wage obligations or to build their businesses and increase revenue .
Russian bankers believe the nation ’s banking system will need to set aside 3 trillion rubles , roughly $ 75 billion , to cover non-performing loans next year .
That is a truly stunning sum to be removed from the economic growth pipeline and used to pay for bad debt .
There is , of course , no guarantee that the banking system has such sums available , and if it does n’t there will be massive bank default .
As we reported last week , Russia ’s core economy , the oil and gas industry , is in deep trouble .
The combination of rising prices in world markets and rising dictatorship , arbitrary and thug - like conduct in Russia has seriously motivated the Western world to move away from Russian energy supplies , and the development of shale resources has made it possible for the West to do so .
Meanwhile , the total incompetence of Russia ’s top leadership to manage basic economic challenges is beginning to wear deeply on the nation ’s performance .
And the result is that more and more Russians are going unpaid , going without the wages that were already inadequate to being with .
More important than the financial deprivation is the loss of faith in the Russian economy these workers experience .
Why work hard if you ’re not sure you ’ll be paid at the end of the week ?
It is exactly this phenomenon ( “ we pretend to work and they pretend to pay us ” as the old Soviet joke went ) that brought down the USSR , and that leaves Russia ’s per capita economy outside the top 50 in the world .
There is simply no way that Russia can hope to survive this pernicious cycle of failure and despair .
Ice may be relatively plentiful at the poles of the Moon , as recent data indicates , but access to and control of it will be critical for spacefaring civilizations .

A spacefaring hydraulic civilization
Among the German scientists , scholars , and artists who fled Hitler ’s Germany in the 1930s and came to America , was an ex-Communist authority on Chinese history and society named Karl Wittfogel ( 1896–1988 ) .
A survivor of both World War I and a short stint in a Nazi concentration camp , his close — not to say obsessive — reading of Marx and of Max Weber led him to develop a set of ideas about what he termed “ Hydraulic Civilization ” .
He held that the societal mechanisms needed for the control of water , especially for irrigation and flood control purposes , leads to a complex bureaucratic state .
This centralized power leads to what he termed “ Oriental Despotism ” , which was the title of his 1957 monumental work subtitled “ A Comparative Study of Total Power ” .
On or off Earth , the way any society distributes and uses water determines its ultimate destiny .
Now that scientists have found huge deposits of water ice on the Moon , the question arises of who will control these “ hydraulic resources ” and under what authority ?
Wittfogel thought that in societies like China , ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , and Russia , there emerged a “ class in a society whose leaders are the holders of despotic state power and not private owners and entrepreneurs ” and that “ in hydraulic society there exists a bureaucratic landlordism , a bureaucratic capitalism , and a bureaucratic gentry . ”
His vocabulary may seem a bit archaic in 2010 , but the danger he described is all too real .
The size of the water find on the Moon , estimated at 600 million metric tons in the Moon ’s north polar region alone , may seem like a lot , but it is roughly the equivalent of the annual output of six mid-sized desalinization plants .
Because of its location it may end up being very valuable indeed .
It is also an indication that water may be common throughout the solar system .
On or off Earth , the way any society distributes and uses water determines its ultimate destiny .
This is obvious not only to any farmer or rancher , but to anyone living in or near a flood zone , or to any politician looking at what happened to George W. Bush ’s presidency after Hurricane Katarina .
Under normal circumstances people in the developed world expect to turn on the tap and have clean water come out .
They seldom think about the amazingly complex system responsible for that result .
In space , water is even more precious than on Earth .
Onboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) the efforts made to recycle every molecule of moisture are well known .
Yet water is still going to be one of the most important items to be delivered to the station by the various cargo carrying vehicles built by Russia , Europe , Japan , and by NASA ’s Commercial Orbital Transportation System .
Since the ISS partnership is well established and runs fairly smoothly , there have been no significant disagreements over the use of these water resources .
Once the water on the Moon or Mars or the asteroids becomes accessible to humanity , the ownership and control of it will determine which nations or peoples will truly be able to profit from space resources .
The unratified Moon Treaty may have its fans , but once the value of the Moon ’s water becomes evident , particularly the possibility of using it to produce liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen for rocket fuel , it will become just another irrelevant scrap of paper .
Peacefully or otherwise , the major spacefaring powers will come to an agreement giving “ squatters rights ” to whoever first occupies and claims a given bit of the icy Moon .
There are plenty of institutions , and people who run them , who would be all too happy to take control of the solar system ’s water resources .
One can be certain that they will claim to be doing so with the best of motives .
The challenges involved in mining the deep craters of the lunar poles are gigantic .
Yet on Earth we see that huge deep - sea oil drilling platforms are able to search for oil kilometers under the seabed .
As long as the prize is of sufficient value there is no reason to think that human ingenuity will be diminished any time soon .
Yet it the very size of this challenge that may lead to a kind of interplanetary hydraulic despotism .
If the organization and technology needed to extract water from the Moon and from other celestial bodies is even more complex and expensive ( on a relative basis ) than that used to irrigate and regulate the great river valleys of China , then the prospect for the future of liberal capitalism in the solar system may be pretty dim .
If , however , the technology is fairly compact and easy to use , then a whole new tribe of ice - seeking entrepreneurs and partnerships will spring up and go to work .
For this to happen , a safe legal environment will have to be in place to allow them secure property rights over what they find .
This means that the US , as the world ’s leading liberal democracy , will have to find a way to be present on the Moon or someplace else where there are large accessible supplies of water , and set a legal precedent .
There are plenty of institutions , and people who run them , who would be all too happy to take control of the solar system ’s water resources .
One can be certain that they will claim to be doing so with the best of motives .
Yet , as Wittfogel pointed out , “ the hydraulic state prevents the nongovernmental forces of society from crystallizing into independent bodies strong enough to counterbalance and control the political machine . ”
If , in the course of humanity ’s expansion into the solar system , such a controlling authority were to be installed , it would freeze any hope for a spacefaring civilization made up of free and independent men and women .
The control of water would lead to the control of other vital space - based resources .
In time the institution ’s power would grow until it would be able to have a stranglehold on the flow of off - Earth resources down to the surface of this planet .
For many , in America and elsewhere , this is not a happy thought .

American families were squeezed last year as their inflation - adjusted weekly wages fell 1.6 percent — the sharpest drop since 1990 — even as consumer prices rose only modestly .
Their spending power sank in the face of falling wages , job losses and higher prices for energy , medical care and education .
Slack pay and scarce job creation are slowing consumer spending , hindering the economy 's ability to mount a strong recovery .
Overall consumer prices rose 2.7 percent last year , the Labor Department 's Consumer Price Index showed Friday .
A surge in energy prices last year offset the biggest drop in food costs in nearly a half century .
Core inflation , which excludes the volatile food and energy categories , rose 1.8 percent for the 12 months ending in December .
It matched the 1.8 percent rise in core inflation in 2008 .
Both gains were the smallest since a 1.1 percent rise in 2003 .
For December , the CPI rose a modest 0.1 percent .
Excluding food and energy , prices were also up just 0.1 percent last month .
Also Friday , the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.6 percent in December as unusually cold weather helped energy utilities offset a small drop in manufacturing .
It was the sixth straight monthly gain in production .
But the mixed picture shows the economic recovery remains tepid , as consumers and businesses spent too little to spur the production of more factory goods .
The 2.7 percent rise in overall consumer prices for 2009 followed a 0.1 percent increase in 2008 , which had been the smallest gain in more than a half century .
Energy costs for the 12 months ending in December shot up 18.2 percent .
That was the biggest jump since 1979 , after they had dropped 21.3 percent in 2008 .
The energy surge was led by higher gasoline costs , which rose 53.5 percent after falling 43.1 percent in 2008 .
Food prices swung in the opposite direction .
After rising 5.9 percent in 2008 , they fell 0.5 percent for the 12 months ending in December , the biggest drop since 1961 .
Core inflation is expected to remain low in 2010 as the country struggles to emerge from the deepest recession since the 1930s .
Yet moderate price increases are small comfort for workers whose wages have lagged behind even slight inflation .
The 1.6 percent drop in average weekly earnings for nonsupervisory workers was the worst annual performance since a 2.5 percent decline in 1990 .
Weekly earnings have fallen in five of the past seven years , underscoring the pressures American households were facing even before the recession began .
The 1.8 percent rise in core inflation for 2009 and 2008 left prices increases within the comfort zone of the Federal Reserve .
The scant inflation allows the central bank to keep a key interest rate at a record low to try to invigorate the economy .
Those low rates and huge amounts of stimulus money pumped into the economy by the government would normally raise alarms about inflation .
But the sluggish recovery has kept a lid on price increases .
The Fed is n't expected to start raising interest rates until the unemployment rate , now at 10 percent , begins coming down .
That might not happen for several months .
The economy lost a net total of 85,000 jobs in December .
High unemployment and a lack of hiring have depressed wages and left consumers reluctant to spend .
One of the factors keeping core inflation under control is housing costs .
They dropped 0.3 percent for the 12 months ending in December , the biggest annual decline on records dating to 1968 .
A glut of single - family homes on the market and record apartment vacancy rates have put pressure on housing prices .
Some costs have continued to rise even during the hard times .
Medical costs rose 3.4 percent in 2009 , the largest increase since a 5.2 percent increase in 2007 .
Education costs rose 4.7 percent last year .
( Most of my serious writing about Lojban is on the main site .
This essay is not on the main site because I ’m basically attacking one of the founding principles of the language , so it seemed inappropriate . )
We ought to keep track of the various good ideas , mostly thought up by Jorge , for improving Lojban , that get rejected by Lojban Central because of the need to keep promises about getting a version of the language finished asap .
Once those promises are kept , we can then evolve a dialect incorporating all these improvements .
Or in fact we could start already , trying out these dialectal variants in usage .
“ Better lojban be better than it be finished ” - let that be a motto .
Or “ Lojban finished is Lojban finished ” .
- From an email from And Rosta from ( wait for it ) December 1995
I really get tired of conversations about what Lojban should or should n’t be .
Just tell me what it is .
- Matt Arnold , who is the first person I met who was a pure user of Lojban , with no interest in arguing about the finer details of the language at all .
Our inability to hand Matt a working language without a pile of caveats was a major impetus for this essay .
Abstract
This essay argues that Lojban is , and should be , a language defined by a central authority ( presumably the BPFK ) , with the power to change the language as it sees fit , to produce authoritative texts about the language , and to declare particular usages of the language ( past or present ) as correct or not .
Further , we ( the Lojban community as a whole ) should adopt a set of goals for the language ( we do n’t currently have those at all , just a set of design decisions from back in the day , which is n’t the same thing ) , with “ respecting how people happened to use the language ” and “ making sure the meaning of past usage does n’t change ” being much lower on the goal list than they are now , and get on with actually fixing the language based on those goals .
In other words : Lojban is great , but it ’s not awesome enough .
We need to stop letting the past hold us back absolutely and get on with making it awesome .
Letting the past stop us from being jerks to the current speakers is fine , but anything more than that is a mistake , and it needs to end .
Background
Some personal and historical context is required for this essay to make much sense .
First , the personal context .
I have participated in the Lojban project for more than 10 years now , and I am a major contributor , both in terms of “ fun ” things ( writing , jbonunsla , IRC ) and the jobs everybody hates ( book - keeping , BPFK ) .
Since I ’m about to propose what amounts to nearly a slap in the face to the old guard , I wish to first establish that by most standards I am among the old guard , and at this point there are maybe 5 people who have contributed more over their lifetimes to Lojban than me .
Now the historical context of this essay .
It is currently February 2010 .
The new baseline statement and the BPFK have done incalculable damage to the project , of which more later .
The new baseline statement came out in 2002 , and we ’re still not done baselining , and at the current rate we never will be .
Some history of Lojban is also needed here .
Lojban grew out of a conflict with James Cooke Brown in which , as I understand it ( this is before my time ) , he asserted that he owned everything written in Loglan .
This , perfectly reasonably , led to the creators of Lojban making the language as open as possible , including the concept of the baseline .
The baseline is the mythical future point where those involved in the language decide that the language is good enough , and that in future the language definition will be descriptive rather than proscriptive .
That is , instead of defining the language , we ’ll simply let people use it and see what happens .
This stance has a slogan , “ Let Usage Decide ! ” , and has been part of Lojban since the Loglan schism .
It was one of the founding principles of the language .
The baseline was considered to have started a long while back ( 1997 , see http://www.wiw.org/~jkominek/lojban/9703/msg00012.html).
Some years ago / later ( ~2002 ) , people realized that we had n’t actually done the things the baseline required , like make a dictionary , so it did n’t count .
This lead to the new baseline statement mentioned above and the formation of the BPFK to solve the problem ( i.e. , “ finish ” the language ) .
Stagnation And Destruction
If what you ’re doing is n’t working , stop doing it , and do anything else .
- Dennis Becker ( the father who raised me )
Since the new baseline statement , everything has kind of gone to hell .
The BPFK has only done one significant thing ( xorlo ) , and that alienated at least one serious , long - term Lojbanist .
Almost everyone who has gotten seriously involved in BPFK work has lost some or all of their interest in Lojban .
Every person who has tried to run the BPFK except me has completely left the Lojban project , and I myself spent at least a year almost totally ignoring the language .
I personally mourn the loss of Jay Kominek and Nick Nicholas , but they ’re far from the only ones .
On top of that , everything feels like it ’s on hold .
People ( especially me , perhaps ) are often talking about not working on projects until the BPFK is finished .
Newbies are routinely told that we can’t tell them how the language works until the BPFK is done .
Which would be fine if anyone was working on it , but no - one is .
Here ’s what I think leads to the BPFK being such a black hole of people :
It will accept as much time and effort as you give it , which is scary and daunting
Similarly , how do you know when the BPFK is done ?
The goal is basically perfection : to define every relevant part of the language well enough to call it done , all at once , forever .
Again , scary and daunting .
What happens if you get it wrong ?
People are going to be stuck with it forever ( usage decides after all ) .
Scary and daunting .
So , people stop working on it .
But everyone involved knows that this is the most important thing in Lojban , so not working on leads to guilt .
If thinking about Lojban makes you feel guilty , scared and overwhelmed , you ’re going to stop thinking about it .
As I said , I basically spent about a year not thinking about it because of this , and we ’ve lost a lot of great people to it too .
I ca n’t say for sure that it ’s all the BPFK , but with so many people that were heavily involved before the BPFK started now gone , it seems like a smoking gun to me .
Our Options
What we ’re doing is n’t working , at all .
I ’m tired of having to talk to earnest , smart ( but not in the geeky way of people who like to tinker with the language ) people like Matt Arnold and having to say “ actually , that part of the language is in flux , and has been for ... 5 years ? ” or “ we do n’t know what that means yet ” .
It makes me really sad .
As I see it , we have two options :
Throw out the BPFK , and let usage decide from where we stand today
Throw out the idea of usage deciding , and re-tool the BPFK to not have these problems
This essay is one big argument for option number two .
Option one will not be discussed further except to argue against it .
I contend that it is not possible to make the BPFK work if we ’re going to worry about usage , and even if it is , we should n’t try .
Note that if you have n’t been dealing with the BPFK directly , you might be wondering what I ’m talking about .
“ Let usage decide ” almost never comes up outside of formal discussions of the nature of Lojban .
Lojban Is , And Should Be , A Centralized , Formalized Language
In linguistics ( and other fields , I ’m sure ) , a distinction is made between being prescriptive ( telling people what to do ; a style guide or the CLL ) and descriptive ( recording what people actually do ; a natural language dictionary ) .
The goal of the “ let usage decide ” policy is to move Lojban from a prescriptive / authoritative language to a descriptive one .
The problem is , it ’s not going to work .
Lojban Is Too Well Specified
People are basically lazy if given the chance , and in the case of Lojban , they ’ve already decided to spend time on something with very little tangible benefits ; expecting them to seek shortcuts to reduce the amount of time Lojban takes for them is only reasonable .
Then we hand them the most thoroughly and precisely specified language of all time .
Naturally , they expect there to be an answer to just about every question they have about the language ( and I agree ! ) .
How are we to then turn around and say , “ Oh , but the very obscurest , hardest bits of the language ?
Yeah , you get to figure those out yourself .
Oh , but no - one can actually add them to the specification , even though that ’s how the entire rest of the specification was written .
You just have to use things the way you want and hope it catches on .
Have fun ! ” .
We ’re basically demanding that every newbie have a gigantic level of dedication just to use the language effectively .
We might as well put up a sign that says “ Warning : hard work within ” .
The other big issue is that newbies are looking for a logical language .
I know I was .
Part of what “ logical ” means is “ rigorous and well specified ” .
GÃ¶del aside , something ca n’t be logical if it has holes , and it certainly ca n’t be logical if it ’s subject to ordinary linguistic drift .
I do n’t want usage to decide , and I do n’t think any newbie looking for a logical language does either .
No - One Actually Wants Usage To Decide
Even if they think they do .
OK , probably not “ no - one ” , but in practice , and in decision making situations where it counts , I ’ve yet to see a non-trivial portion of the community show any signs of actually wanting to let usage decide .
The behaviour of newbies is telling in this regard : they spend basically all their time asking how to say things , and then asking for documentation pointers to back up whatever the oldbies say ( and why not ?
with a language so well specified , it must be out there somewhere , right ? ) .
During the whole xorlo process , to this day , almost no newbies ask about the relative merits of the two systems , nor do they want to make their own decision on which to support .
They want to be told how the language works , and anything else leads to annoyance , upset , or derision .
I do n’t like to think about how many newbies we might have lost that way .
If we let usage decide , if no - one can ever legitimately tell another Lojbanist that they ’re doing it wrong , we will end up with some very confused newbies ; expecting guidance , but either not getting it ( because their usage is as legitimate as anyone else ’s ) or getting contradictory advice from different people .
The formation of the BPFK itself is another example : when the community realized that the baseline was invalid , and that the language needed some polishing , what happened ?
Did people simply start changing the way they used the language ?
Did they let usage decide ?
No .
Overwhelmingly the community voted / agreed to form a body ( the BPFK ) from which to officiate the language .
I only recall one or two people even seriously suggesting letting usage decide .
When we developed xorlo , we suggested that people use it if they wanted , as it would probably be official when the BPFK was done .
This caused huge communication difficulties on IRC , because every conversation had to start with “ are you using xorlo ? ” , even though it almost never matters .
People did n’t want to just talk and see how it went , as letting usage decide would require ; they wanted a statement of position from everyone else in the conversation .
As if that was n’t clear enough of a desire for an authoritative language description , the community ’s eventual response to this problem as the BPFK dragged on was to essentially beg the LLG to declare xorlo part of the language early .
The community very clearly wants Lojban to be defined centrally and decisively .
People Who Say They Want Usage To Decide Do n’t Act That Way
As I mentioned earlier , the idea of usage deciding does n’t really come up outside of formal discissions of the nature of Lojban .
Which is kind of the opposite of how respecting usage should work : if people really wanted usage to decide , you ’d expect “ Oh , look at that new and interesting usage ! ” to be common , rather than people getting attacked for not conforming to the CLL , which is what actually happens .
To be fair , this is consistent with a stance of pure conservativism .
I disagree that such a stance serves the community , and I suppose we ’ll find out if I ’m right based on the community ’s reaction to this essay .
Lessons From The Free Software Movement
This is probably a statement of my age ( 34 , much younger than the founders ) , but “ Let Usage Decide ! ” sounds like something the free software movement would come up with .
In both cases , they were decent , good - hearted responses to people trying to exert unreasonable control over the creative output of large groups of people .
What we ’ve learned from the free software movement , though , is that groups that all equally contribute to a great project almost never actually happens : you get a very small number of people ( usually one ) with near - total executive power , or you get crap , or you get a dead project .
While I ’m not actually saying that a tiny number of people should take over and control Lojban de jure , believe me that I ’m tempted , since that ’s what seems to work best , and if my proposals are accepted , it will almost certainly happen de facto anyways .
The other thing we ’ve learned from the free software community is that it is possible to have strong authority without screwing the community .
I ’ve never heard anyone accuse Linus of despotism , for example ( although , humans being what they are , I ’m sure someone has ) .
Projects like Linux and Perl make it clear , though , that it is possible to give control over major , hard decisions ( like breaking backwards compatibility ) into the hands of a few people without anything horrible happening .
These groups still take lots of input from the larger community .
No -one would accuse either of offenses like those that led to Lojban ’s formation .
All it seems to require is both formal and informal recognition , throughout the community , that while certain people may be directing the process , they do n’t own the result .
This is an attitude that the Lojban community has in spades ; I ’m really not worried about despotism here .
Nothing I ’m proposing will make subverting the system any easier , regardless .
Fragmentation Is Bad
Usage deciding is going to lead to fragmentation .
I find it obvious that the Lojban community does n’t want that ( each word having a single meaning is fundamental to the language ) , so I ’ll just talk about why I think it ’s inevitable .
If you look at things like xorlo , what happens is that without a single official interpretation , only confusion results .
The idea behind usage deciding seems to be that people will be able to figure this out as they talk , and settle on one or the other .
In practice , though , how could you do that ?
Imagine the confusion that could result when speaking English if someone did n’t think that “ the car ” implied that there was actually a particular car .
You ’d be having totally different conversations , but how would you ever figure out where the problem lay ?
Once you figured it out , what would you do ?
You ’d grab a dictionary and show the other person to be wrong .
Formal officiation is part of how natural languages resolve these sorts of things .
The other way is body language and tone of voice ( which is how slang drift occurs successfully ) , which is something that Lojban cannot , and must not , use .
If we solve things that way , I ’m out ; I know where to find English already .
With disagreement on the meaning of actual content words , context can reveal the problem , but with cmavo ( which are where all such issues in Lojban have occurred ) , there ’s really no way to figure out what the other person is saying without meta- discussion .
This lead to a bunch of conversations that started with “ Are you using xorlo ? ” .
If we ever let usage decide , you can expect much more of that sort of crap , as people divide into camps behind their favorite proposals .
The vast majority of Lojbanists have no one else to speak the language with , unless they make use of IRC or similar options .
The formal definition of the language must be complete for their sake : otherwise you end up with many tiny islands of unique interpretations , and the continent of IRC users that hopefully are actually all speaking the same language ( but probably not ; that ’s certainly not what happened with xorlo ) .
If we let usage decide , if no - one can ever legitimately tell another Lojbanist that they ’re doing it wrong , we will end up with not just one or two languages , but dozens .
What If Lojban Stops Being Logical ?
This is the option that really scares me : that natural language constructs will be imported into Lojban that will turn it into something I do n’t want to be associated with .
If people start saying “ le prenu klama ” for “ the person goes ” , a standard newbie mistake , and it becomes popular , will we have to respect that as valid , simply because there is usage behind it , even though it destroys the language ( it would not longer be formally parseable ) ?
If the answer is “ no ” , then you ’ve already accepted the central tenet of this essay : that Lojban is centrally deifned by its very nature .
It ’s just a matter of how far you ’re willing to take it .
As the joke goes , we ’ve established what kind of person you are , we ’re just haggling over the price .
This really is something to be feared , because the average person , including the average wanna - be Lojbanist , defaults to produing non-machine - parseble utterances ( hang out on IRC for some weeks if you do n’t believe me ) .
People Will Do What They Want Regardless
If the history of Lojban teaches us anything , it ’s that people do n’t need our permission to use the language as they please .
They ’ll do it regardless if they wish to , and no - one is proposing to stop them .
Usage can still decide in practice without that being a formal policy , and as long as it makes sense and does n’t break the language , a formalizing body might as well make it official , too .
Hell , look at cniglic or lokadin’s “ caps and no spaces ” version of Lojban .
Basically everyone else hates that sort of thing , but people do it any way , and no - one has suggested actively preventing them ( besides social censure , anyways ) .
We do n’t need a “ usage wins ” rule , because at the end of the day , it does anyway .
The language is only defined by its usage .
But putting usage on a pedestal above the official language definition just is n’t appropriate for the Lojban that I came here for .
If I want natural , growing , living languages , I know where to find them .
Being Centralized And Formalized Is A Good Thing
It seems to me that one of the main problems with Lojban , and the BPFK especially , has been a lack of goals .
There have been lots of goals about the language ( finish the dictionary , make a game in Lojban , etc , etc ) , but no goals for the language ( “ make it as consistent as possible ” ) .
This goes hand in hand with letting usage decide : since everyone ’s usage is valid , it does n’t really make sense to set goals .
At one time , the language was open and fluid ; at that time there must have been goals , even if they existed only in JCB ’s head .
Certainly large - scale changes were enacted by the Lojban founders at various times .
But after the baseline , the only way to make such changes will be to make your own fragment of the language , and hope it catches on .
If someone finds a better way to do something ( if we knew what “ better ” was ; since we do n’t have goals for the language we do n’t , really ) why penalize them for being late to the party ?
Why say “ No , you would have had to be here 30 years ago , sorry ” ?
It completely disenfranchises participants based solely on the time of their birth .
I know that the actual issue here is to avoid having to re-learn the language all the time , but that ’s a straw man : people deal with drift in natural languages all the time .
All we need to do is make sure Lojban does n’t drift noticeably faster .
This is hardly a tall order , and I outline my ideas below .
As an aside , while I ’ve seen people complain about all aspects of xorlo , I have n’t yet seen anyone complain that it was too much to learn or that the language was changing too much for them to want to learn it .
Complaints of that type have always been about the lack of a single , absolute definition of the language to learn from , i.e. about fragmentation .
Being willfully authoritarian solves all these problems , and once we ’ve agreed on goals , we can pursue them , and make Lojban more of what we love .
The case of .ai nai really exemplifies the need for goals for the language itself .
It has been noted that “ . ai nai broda ” is exactly equal to “ .ai na broda ” , as .ai nai is currently defined , and that this is the only UI cmavo that works that way .
This lack of consistency ( essentially , an exception in our beautiful , supposed - to - be - exception - free language ) really bothers some people , and they think it needs to be fixed .
Others think past usage is more important .
And ... that ’s where we ’ve been for at least a year now .
With no criteria to weigh the options by except “ finish defining the language ” , who is to say who is right ?
We ca n’t go on like this .
My Actual Proposal
( Please do not take this as any kind of formal proposal !
The goal was as much to stir the pot as anything else ; I am fluid on almost all of the details herein . )
By comparison to the justifications above , my proposal is simplicity itself :
Clearly state to the community , on behalf of both the LLG and the BPFK , that the LLG exists only to deal with monetary matters , and the BPFK is for language definition issues .
The BPFK should be open to anyone who is seriously working on learning the language ( and , in fact , the BPFK should be in Lojban as much as possible : this is for formal decisions about the future of the language , by people who actually use it )
Clearly state to the community , on behalf of both the LLG and the BPFK , that the job of the BPFK is to formalize Lojban in perfect detail , with the understanding that this is to occur in response to the language uses and its users , and thus will never actually be finished .
This formalization should be directed by following an ordered set of goals for the language .
The goals themselves are certainly up for grabs , but here ’s my list :
Lojban should be as logical as possible ; by this I mean something like “ internally consistent ” , “ without exceptions ” and “ building meaning from small , interlocking , orthogonal and well - defined parts ” Lojban should be usable by humans to communicate as effectively as with other , natural languages Lojban should be unlike other languages Lojban should remain backwards compatible
This is an ordered list for tie - breaking purposes ; it is not intended to allow trashing the entire language ( # 4 ) to solve some tiny logic issue ( # 1 ) .
If a point of logic conflicts with an approximately equally important point of relearning , the point of logic should win ( were these goals to be adopted as - is )
For myself , I ’m not sure about the order of # 2 and # 3
The BPFK then finishes the dictionary , to whatever level of specificity can be acheived fairly quickly , which I expect to go relatively smoothly because of the goals themselves , and the lack of needing to worry about past usage very much .
Voting is as needed , as things feel finished Voting is 80 % of those voting , 90 % of those voting for changes to these rules themselves .
Every once in a while , a vote should occur to place a list of changes officially into the language .
This means documentation must be complete ( see below ) , and there should n’t be any feeling of all - or - nothing about it .
We can make some things official while other things are not completely finished , and we can make mistakes and fix them in a later round ( hopefully not many and no big ones ) .
The BPFK is also responsible for evaluating conformance to particular versions of Lojban , as requested .
The details of these certifications to be worked out later ( but they must be worked out in a timely fashion when someone actually requests such an evaluation ) .
It is understood that the BPFK is a volunteer organization with limited resources , and hence long texts may take an arbitrary length of time to be evaluated .
It is also the duty of the BPFK to answer questions about Lojban posed to it that cannot be answered via the extant documentation , and to record the answers publicly , and possibly roll the answers back into the official documentation .
As something of an aside , the BPFK does not rule on truth values .
“ Does “ le cribe cu vinji ” mean something like “ the bear is an airplane ” ? ” is a fine question , but “ Is “ le cribe cu vinji ” true ( or , equivalently , Does “ le cribe cu vinji ” make any sense ? ” ) is outside the scope of the BPFK ; perhaps the sentence came from a dream journal , for example .
How this applies to the veridicality of references to unicorns is up to the BPFK to decide should it come up .
Finicky Details
This is just some ideas I had for how to handle some of the complexities that I think might come up with the changed BPFK .
They ’re just first ideas off the top of my head ; I do not suggest that they are the best ideas , or even good ideas , for handling these issues .
Documentation
It is most definitely the BPFK ’s responsibility to make sure that “ The Complete Lojban Language ” , “ What Is Lojban ? ” , jbovlaste , and anything else official is updated as part of any actual update to the language .
This means a full description of the changes , and updated versions of all documentation .
This means having good , diffable soft copies of everything , which we do n’t yet have , but if this proposal is accepted I ’ll handle that part personally .
With the language being both formalized and a moving target , we need some way for people to make sure they ’re speaking the same language without a huge meta- linguistic discussion before every conversation .
Regardless of whether the rest of the proposal is accepted , we do need this .
I propose a cmavo for language version , that takes a single number for the version ; just a simple incrementing whole number .
I suggest 1 for Loglan , 2 for pre-rafsi reallocation Lojban , 3 for pre-xorlo Lojban , 4 for current Lojban .
Deprecation Cycles
This bit is extra iffy ; just me thinking out loud .
Also , I ’m not suggesting repurposing the experimental cmavo space here , just using bits of it , briefly , for slightly more official purposes than usual ( but still experiments ) .
Something that certain software projects do that we should take on if this proposal is accepted is having fixed , formal times required for the process of breaking backwards compatibility .
My proposal in this regard is this :
Whem a proposal is agreed on , a new word ( normally a cmavo ) in the experimental range is coined , if appropriate , and used with the new meaning for a year .
If no problems are found , the two words are swapped , the language version is incremented , and that continues for another year .
If no problems are found , the experimental word that was used is marked meaningless , to remain that way for at least a year ( although , of course , people can do whatever they want in the experimental range , but very much at the risk of confusion if you ignore the BPFK ’s experimental usage ) , and the version is incremented again .
Conclusion
Lojban is , and always will be , a centrally defined , ridgidly formalized language ; this is a fundamental part of its nature , and if we act against that we ’ll lose the language we love .
We need to stop resisting that , and embrace it for the good of the language .
We need to move on from our current stagnant state .
Lojban is a good language ; we can make it great , if we stop being so timid about it .
In this post I try to explain why gevent was started and how it is compares to eventlet .
Note : gevent has switched to libev .
History
Bob Ippolito wrote the first version of Eventlet in 2006 but ceased working on it fairly early .
Donovan Preston took over the maintenance , together with other folks at Linden Lab where he worked at the time .
I became interested in Eventlet in 2008 , when I was looking for simpler ways to write networking software than with state machines and callbacks .
Greenlet - based Eventlet was ahead of the other options that existed at the time ( Python ’s native generators , raw greenlet , Corotwine ) in terms of features and easiness of use .
The project I worked on already depended on Twisted , so I started integrating the two libraries together .
In the process of doing that I discovered a number of bugs in Eventlet and ended up rewriting most of its core .
My branch was accepted as the way forward and finally released in 2009 as Eventlet 0.8.11 .
By that time Donovan had already left Linden Lab and Ryan Williams became the primary maintainer .
In the summer of 2009 , I have started a new project where a networking library was going to be a major component .
However , Eventlet did not meet a couple of requirements :
I needed it to use libevent ’s event loop because I had another library ( written in C ) that used it and I wanted to integrate them together in a single process .
Eventlet at the time did not have a working libevent support .
I needed socket module to work perfectly as I planned to use Python libraries implemented on top of it through monkey - patching .
At the time Eventlet had a few bugs that could cause a socket operation to hang .
I have spent some time working on the pyevent - based hub .
The result was not very compatible with the rest of Eventlet due to the fact that its Hub API is geared towards pure Python event loops .
Making it work smoothly would require significant changes in the interface and implementation of every other hub .
The socket module bugs were also specific to event loop , so even though I fixed them for pyevent , they were still present in every other hub .
Not having time for a major rewrite of Eventlet I started a leaner project .
Gevent started as Eventlet with a few bugs fixed and a few features dropped .
The differences
1. gevent is built on top of libevent
Update : since 1.0 , gevent uses libev and c-ares .
Libevent is a popular portable event loop .
It runs your app using the fastest mechanism available on your system , such as epoll on Linux , and kqueue on FreeBSD .
Unlike Eventlet , which maintains its own event loops in pure Python and has only recently gained epoll support , all of gevent ’s event loops have been well - tested in real - world , high - scale environments .
The superior performance is one of the benefits of tight integration with libevent , but not the only one .
Other benefits are
Signal handling is integrated with the event loop .
Other libevent - based libraries can integrate with your app through single event loop .
DNS requests are resolved asynchronously rather than via a threadpool of blocking calls .
WSGI server is based on the libevent ’s built - in HTTP server , making it super fast .
2. gevent ’s interface follows the conventions set by the standard library
For example , gevent .event .
Event has the same interface and the same semantics as threading .
Event and multiprocessing .
Event but works across greenlets .
Eventlet has Event class too , but it uses its own way of doing things for no good reason .
I ’ve used the standard interfaces in gevent unless a brand new interface has an obvious advantage .
In some cases , where re-implementing the whole class was n’t necessary , the conventions on the method names set by the standard library were followed .
Here are some of those conventions :
wait ( ) does not raise an exception ;
get ( ) can raise an exception or return a value ;
join ( ) is like wait ( ) , but for units of execution .
Having consistent interface improves the speed at which we can read and reason about the code .
Learning the API becomes easier as well .
Not being constrained by backward compatibility , gevent fixed all the API quirks that Eventlet had .
The quality of the API is recognized by the users and Eventlet maintainers .
Portions of gevent that are not specific to libevent are being incorporated into Eventlet .
3. gevent is not eventlet
It does not have all the features that Eventlet has .
If you already use Eventlet these are the reasons why you might not be able to switch to gevent :
If you depend on eventlet .db_pool ; gevent does n’t have a module like that .
If you depend on eventlet .
processes ; there ’s no support for subprocesses in the library yet .
Here ’s an example how to build it yourself .
If you depend on Eventlet ’s threadpool ; gevent does have one currently .
Update : there ’s a new gevent .
threadpool module .
If you run Eventlet on Twisted reactor .
If you cannot depend on libevent .
Gevent aims to be a small and stable core everyone can depend upon .
It delegates the job to libevent whenever possible and provides convenient abstractions for coroutine - based programming .
It ’s inspired by Eventlet but it ’s not a fork and it features a new API .
The implementation is simpler and more stable .

Japanese Translation
The sun was tracking its low arc across the sky , illuminating the stone structures embedded in the earth .
At the top of the rise Mr. Hill and I ducked our heads to enter the L - shaped Oracle Chamber .
Dark and damp inside , the carefully constructed warren is half buried underground , and includes the sacrificial table , a four - and - a - half ton grooved slab of granite thought to be 4,000 years old .
What ancient rituals were performed here , and by whom , remains a subject of debate .
“ I ’ve never visited a site  anywhere  that combines standing stones with stone chambers , ” Mr. Hill said .
“ That ’s a certainly a large part of my fascination . ”
Two days later I returned to America ’s Stonehenge for a consultation with David Brody , a local lawyer and mystery novelist who shares Mr. Hill ’s belief that European visitors built this place .
Mr. Brody pointed out that the complex of cairns , walls , chambers and huts was encircled , at a distance of approximately 100 yards , by notched “ sighting stones ” that lined up with the sunrise and sunset on important dates like the summer and winter solstices .
“ There were no calendars or almanacs ” 4,000 years ago , said Mr. Brody , 47 , a hearty , goateed man in hiking boots and a flannel shirt .
By marking the rising and setting sun on certain days , the people who built the structures “ knew when to plant and harvest crops , when to launch their ships and when to pray , ” he said .
Ground mists are fuming up from the lowlands as we ascend the hill .
“ The colonial argument never made sense to me , ” Mr. Brody said , squatting beside one of the chambers to indicate how the rising sun would strike a certain stone on the inner wall .
Noting that colonial settlers would not have been dependent on astronomical events to track the days of the year , he said : “ There ’s too many of these to write off as coincidence .
Sure , there ’s evidence that the Native Americans used them as sweat lodges .
But when you have elaborate stone structures like these , there ’s a lot of reuse when a new civilization comes along . ”
Departing the raw New Hampshire woods , I encountered a honeymooning couple , Mike and Georgia Sasso , both 23 and history lovers from West Point , Miss .
“ It makes you feel what it must ’ve been like , living way back then , ” Mr. Sasso said .
With a giggle , Ms. Sasso said : “ It was a little scary .
What I saw was  it felt ancient . ”
Driving home in the rain , I recalled something that Mr. Hill told me .
“ So many things in the world today , we have to figure out exactly what it is .
Here ’s something that ’s three , four thousand years old , and we do n’t know who constructed it and how they used it .
More than that we ’re never going to know . ”
IF YOU GO
America ’s Stonehenge ( 105 Haverhill Road , Salem , N.H. ; 603-893-8300 , stonehengeusa.com ) is open year round .
Admission prices are $ 9.50 for adults , $ 8.50 for 65 and older , $ 6.50 for children ages 6 to 12 and free under 5 .
And the winner is … Ron Paul .
Mr. Paul , a Republican Congressman from Texas who inspired an intense following for president in 2008 , swept the 2012 presidential straw poll Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
He won with 31 percent of the nearly 2,400 votes at the conference , edging out Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , who won the straw poll last year and who captured 22 percent of the vote .
When Mr. Paul ’s name was announced in the packed ballroom of a Washington hotel , it elicited hoots and boos along with applause .
Although Mr. Romney won fewer votes , he seemed to draw stronger applause .
Sarah Palin , the former governor of Alaska , who did not attend the conference , was a distant third , with 7 percent of the vote .
About half of the 10,000 people attending the conference are students , according to the poll .
The straw poll in past years has rarely predicted the winner of the Republican nomination .
Despite the poll , David Keene , the chairman of the American Conservative Union , which runs the CPAC conference , said that there was little talk at the conference of the 2012 presidential race , largely because Republicans are focused on the 2010 midterms .
“ We all have our eyes on the closest target , ” he said .
Here are the full results of the straw poll .
CPAC says that 2,395 people voted , while estimating that 10,000 people attended some parts of the conference .
Over the past year , the Tea Party movement has grown to the point where it can get a great deal of press attention and exposure .
While that may be a good thing for the Tea Party , it is proving to be not necessarily so for the Republican party , which has jumped onto the Tea Party bandwagon .
Some Republicans may have become affiliated with the Tea Party movement in the hope of aligning themselves with an invigorated and energetic grassroots conservative movement .
Instead , Republicans are now finding themselves in alignment with a movement in which some members feel that it is OK to shout out racist and homophobic insults ( including the N - word ) and spit at Congressmen as happened this weekend when the Tea Party protested against healthcare reform on Capitol Hill .
Despite the weekend 's shocking behaviour – one Congressman and civil rights leader , John Lewis , said he had not experienced such attacks since the 1960s – Republicans , particularly GOP chairman Michael Steele , spent the weekend defending and rationalising those Tea Party goers ' actions .
This is dangerous ground for the Republican party .
There are some benefits of getting involved in a movement that is not clearly defined .
The Tea Party was originally framed in the media as an umbrella movement for a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives , whatever their discontent may be .
On that level , the Tea Party presented an opportunity for Republicans to gain some leverage .
The flip side is that a movement with no specific cause attracts all sorts of people with all sorts of agendas , which can put the GOP in a tricky position , and potentially turn important voters against them .
The idea of what a " conservative " or " Republican " is continues to be shaped and distorted by a minority of people on the fringes who get the most attention .
This does nothing to attract new supporters or independents and it may indeed turn off existing , more moderate Republican supporters .
This is not a good strategy for the 2010 elections – unless that is , the GOP is looking to portray itself as a very rightwing , almost extremist party .
The obstructionist attitude may have worked while healthcare reform was still going through Congress , but with its passing , it is likely that public sentiment may continue to warm in the president 's direction .
The fringe elements of the Tea Party will only start to look more and more repulsive which would only harm the Republicans , making them look even more narrow and one - dimensional .
" Appealing to the base " seems to be a key concern of Republicans , but if the base is the type of people who were at the rally this weekend and Republicans do not denounce that type of behaviour , the Tea Party may start to be of more harm to the Republicans than good .
Yet , this all leads back to the question that was raised after Barack Obama 's election , which is what the GOP actually stands for .
Right now , it looks like the Tea Party is getting to say who the Republicans are .
And that 's a type of tea that many people might not want to drink come election time .
This is the photo tutorial for making a zippered lining for the Lucky Wristlet .
The tutorial shows , step - by - step how to make a zippered lining for the Lucky Wristlet .
Let me know if something is n't clear .
I will be happy to help you !( text is above its corresponding photo ) 1 .
You 'll need a crocheted Lucky Wristlet using my free PDF crochet pattern , fabric for the lining , and a zipper that is about 3 inches longer ( or more ) than your wristlet .
2 .
To figure out the size of the fabric pieces you need to cut , you need to measure your wristlet .
Measure the width of the inside opening .
In this photo , my interior wristlet width is 7.5 " 3 .
Measure the inside height from the middle of the bottom of the wristlet to to row where you will sew in the lining .
In this photo , my interior wristlet height is 4 " . 4 .
NOTE : If you modified your wristlet to have depth by adding bottom rows , you will still measure your wristlet as described .
The change you will make to accommodate the depth is to square off the bottom corners to remove the extra fabric at each side .
I 'll remind you below .
5 . Cut fabric :- - 2 pieces that are [ width + 1 " ] by [ height + 1 " ] .
My pieces are 8.5 " by 5 " .- - 1 piece that is 5.25 " by 4.5 " to make a credit - card - sized pocket6 .
Place the pocket fabric face down on your ironing board .
The 5.25 " edges are the top and bottom .
The 4.5 " edges are the right and left sides .
Fold up 1/2 " from the bottom edge , right sides together .
Iron along the fold .
7 .
Fold the top edge down so that the folded bottom edge is about 1 / 4 " longer than the top edge .
Pin the sides .
8 . Sew a 1/2 " seam on the right and left sides starting from the fold and going toward the open edge .
9 .
Trim off the corners of the seam allowance .
This will reduce bulk when you turn this inside - out.10 .
Turn the pocket inside - out .
Use a crochet hook or knitting needle to push out the corners .
Iron flat .
This is the front side .
11 .
This is the back side .
The opening is the bottom edge of the pocket .
12 .
Sew across the top of the pocket 1/ 4 " below the top edge .13 .
Hide the thread ends on the inside of the pocket .
See steps 19 - 22 for details about hiding threads ..
Set aside the pocket for later .
14 .
Place one of the lining pieces face down on your ironing board .
The long edges are the top and bottom .
The short edges are the right and left sides .
Fold down 1/2 " from the top edge , wrong sides together .
Iron along the fold .
15 .
For edges this long which need ironing , I like to make the fold , pin the fold with long pins , then iron .
I let the fold cool before unpinning .
16 .
Repeat steps 13 and 14 with the other lining piece .
17 .
Pin the pocket to one of the lining pieces .
Be sure that the lining piece fold is at the top and the stitching line of the pocket is at the top .
The bottom of the pocket should be about 1 " above the bottom edge of the lining piece .
18 .
Sew a 1/4 " seam along the right , left , and bottom edges .
Hide the threads on the back of the lining piece .
See steps 19 - 22 for details about hiding threads .
19 .
These are two thread ends .20 .
Thread one onto a sewing needle .
Pull the thread to the back of the lining piece .
Do this for the other corner thread , too .
21 .
Tie the threads together on the back side to secure them .
22 .
Here is the neat front view once the threads are pulled to the back .
23 .
Lay the the lining pieces on top of each other right - sides - together .
Pin the sides together .
24 .
Be sure the two ironing lines at the tops of the pieces line up before you pin the sides .
25 .
Sew a 1/2 " seam on the right and left sides starting from the fold and going toward the open edge .
26 .
Iron the seam allowance open .
27 .
Trim the corners off the seam allowance at the top .
This will reduce bulk when we fold down the top edge .
28 .
Fold down the top edge along the ironing lines with the side seams still open ( to reduce bulk ) .
Iron the top edge again .
29 .
Here 's a peek inside the lining at this stage .30 .
Sew around the top of the lining 1/ 4 " from the top .
Start in a side seam , sew all the way around , ... 31 . ... and end at the same point in the side seam .
32 .
Hide your threads .
See steps 19 - 22 for details about hiding threads .
33 .
Look how neat that is !
34 .
Here 's another peek at the inside of the lining35 .
Turn the lining inside out .
36 .
Measure 1/2 " from the side seam ... 37 . ... and place one side of the open zipper so the teeth start right at the 1/2 " mark .
The zipper teeth should be right along your stitching line ( 1/4 " from the top ) .
38 .
Pin in one side of the open zipper .
39 .
Sew zipper in .
Start 1/ 2 " from one edge to 1/2 " before the next edge .
I use my regular zipper foot so that my stitching is n't too close to the zipper teeth .40 .
Measure 1/2 " from the side seam on the other side of the lining .
Pin in open zipper .
41 .
Be sure you have n't twisted up your open zipper before you sew in the second side .
When you unzip the zipper that the should teeth point upwards .
When you zip the zipper , they should come down and meet in the middle of the bag opening .
42 .
Sew zipper in .
Start 1/ 2 " from one edge to 1/2 " before the next edge .
43 .
The zipper is now sewn in .44 .
Turn the lining inside out .
45 .
Zip up the zipper .
46 .
Trim the end of your zipper so it 's 2.5 " longer than your bag .
47 .
Like this .48 .
Now , very carefully , unzip the zipper so the zipper head is in that last 2.5 inches , but do n't unzip completely because your zipper head will come right off the zipper and that would be bad .49 .
Tuck the 2.5 " end of the zipper into the inside of the lining .
50 .
Zip the zipper back up .
51 .
The zipper is done !
If you have a very loose zipper and you 're afraid the zipper head will slip down when you have the wristlet open , you can sew a zipper stop across the teeth at the edge of the bag .
See the section on " Adjusting Zipper Length " in this post at TECHknitting .
52 .
Flatten your lining and pin the bottom closed .
Sew a 1/2 " seam across the bottom of the lining .
The stitching you can see in this image is back side of the pocket .
53 .
Trim the right and left corners of the seam allowance at the bottom right and bottom left corners .
54 .
NOTE :
If you modified your wristlet to have depth by adding bottom rows , this is the point where you 'll want to square off the bottom edge of your lining .
You can see what that entails in my Starling Handbag LiningTutorial steps 7 , 8 and 9 .
Once you fold over the edge in step 8 , measure across the triangle perpendicular to the seam .
When you find the spot where the measurement matches the depth of your bag , that 's where you 'd stitch as shown in step 9 .
Then trim off the excess fabric .
55 .
Put your finished lining into the crocheted wristlet .
56 .
With the zipper open , the zipper head should be on the side with no spike crochet stitch .
57 .
See ?
There is no spike crochet stitch on the edge here .
I have a very detailed tutorial for sewing in a lining for a Starling Handbag .
Instead of making you go back and forth between these two tutorials , I 'm going to borrow images from that tutorial to illustrate a couple things below .
Do n't be confused by the different crochet colors and lining .
58 .
Find the crochet row where you will be sewing the lining into the wristlet .
Pin in the lining .
For the wristlet , it should be the very top row .
Be sure the right and left edges of your wristlet are aligned with the left and right edges of your lining .
59 .
I marked the rows with red Vs to show you the stitches you 'll be sewing the lining to .
You will only have rows that look like this if you crocheted back and forth ( which you should have done ) .
You 'll be using the one I 'm pointing at , which is the top row of single crochet .60 .
Cut a length of thread that is 3 times the width of your wristlet .
61 .
Thread your needle and knot the thread .
This knotting tutorial is awesome .
60 .
Come out of the top edge of your lining right at a spot that lines up with the right side of one of those Vs .
This will hide the knot between the lining and your wristlet .
61 .
Here it is from the front .
See that the thread is right between two of the Vs.62 .
Make a stitch behind the two vertical bars of the crochet stitch V.63 .
You are just catching the two vertical bars .
Do not go through the crochet to the outside of the bag .
This part is not an exact science .
You do n't have to get * all * of the yarn in the vertical bars ... just most of it .
64 .
Pull the needle and thread through .65 .
Pull tight .66 .
Put the needle into your lining so it 's inside the top fold and comes out right at the edge of the next set of vertical bars .
The needle is sandwiched inside the fold of the fabric .
I do not go through both pieces of folded fabric .
If you looked behind the needle , between the lining and the bag , you would n't see the back side of the needle because it 's inside the folded fabric .
I 've said the same thing four times here because I 'm trying to be clear , because it is a tricky thing to explain in words .
67 .
Pull the thread through .68 .
Make a stitch behind the next set of vertical bars .69 .
Pull the thread through .70 .
Pull your stitches tightly as you go .
When the stitches are pulled tightly , your lining will looked tucked into the crochet .
71 .
When you get back to where you started , go back through the first couple of stitches you made .
To make my final knot , I put my needle through some yarn between two Vs ... 72 .
... wrap the end of the thread around the needle three times ... 73 . ... and pull the thread through the wraps to create a knot .
74 .
I hide the knot by pulling my needle and thread behind the lining .
75 .
Take ahold of the thread end ... 76 . ... and pull it to hide the knot behind the lining .
Trim the thread end .77 .
Here is the wristlet lining after being sewn in .78 .
And you 're done !

Posting on his blog , Xbox Live 's Larry Hryb said that the company has been testing the feature for a few weeks and that he thinks it 's is " great . "
A system updating hitting April 6 will allow us all to see just how great it is .

The update will support flash drives that are 1 GB to to 16 GB in size .
While USB hard drives " may work " , he adds , you will still only be able to use 16 GB of the drives space , which kinda sucks .
The update will allow you to have two USB drives connected at the same time , meaning up to 32 GB of space .

One of Haskell ’s big selling points is its powerful type system which , among many other things , allows for easy type - parameterisation of functions .
For example , the identity function has type a -> a , meaning that it will take something of any type a and return a value of the same type .
Think about this function for a moment — it promises to return something of type a , no matter what type that is .
The only way it can do so is to return the value given to it — that ’s the only thing available that ’s guaranteed to be of the right type .
So in fact the only function that satisfies the type a -> a is the identity function .
( Consider everything in this blog post to have the disclaimer : … as long as no bottom values are involved . )
CHP Process Types
We can extend this type of reasoning to CHP processes .
Let ’s start with the process type : a -> Chanout a -> CHP ( ) .
A process of this type has an output channel carrying type a , and the only value it has available to it of that type is the one given as the first parameter .
So all values sent out on the channel must be the value passed as the first parameter .
That ’s useful to know .
Reasonable behaviours of the process might be to do nothing ( semi- reasonable , anyway : const ( const ( return ( ) ) ) ) , write the value once ( writeValue ) or write it repeatedly ( repeat ) .
We can also consider processes with types such as Chanout b -> CHP ( ) or Chanin a -> Chanout b -> CHP ( ) .
We can tell that a process with either of these types will never generate any output , because it cannot form any values of the right type .
This is a bit like the function with type a -> b in Haskell , which cannot be properly implemented .
Another process we can consider is one with type ( a -> b ) ->
Chanin a -> Chanout b -> CHP ( ) .
In this case , any values sent out on the output channel must be values that were read from the input channel that have been transformed by the given function .
The process may re-order , drop or delay values that are sent in — for example , it may send on only every third value .
Since the process also has access to the IO monad , it may also drop values randomly .
But we know that its behaviour cannot be affected by the values being passed through , because the process has no means by which to inspect values of type a or b .
Contrast this with a process that has type ( a -> Bool ) ->
Chanin a -> Chanout a -> CHP ( ) ; there the process has a function that it can use to make a decision about the given value .
There is another useful fact we can deduce about the process with type ( a -> b ) ->
Chanin a -> Chanout b -> CHP ( ) .
If we never send in any values , it wo n’t have any to output — so we know this process cannot produce any output before it has first read some input .
That ’s useful information , and we know it just by looking at the type of the process .
This reasoning extends to any process with a type like Chanin a -> Chanout a -> CHP () ; such processes must consume input before they can produce any output .
Similarly , the process with type Chanin a -> Chanin b ->
Chanout ( a , b ) -> CHP ( ) must input at least once from each of its input channels before it is able to output .
Free Theorems
One well - known bit of work along these lines is Wadler ’s Free Theorems paper ( bottom of the page ) .
The paper uses these ideas to automatically form theorems based on functions .
For example , you can deduce that for any two functions f :: [ a ] -> a and g :: a -> a , it must be the case that f . map g = g . f .
Intuitively , the result of f must be one item from the input list , so whether you apply g to that item afterwards , or apply g to all the list elements beforehand , you must get the same answer .
Other examples abound in the paper .
So can we apply similar reasoning to processes ?
With processes , we have two considerations : the values being passed through the processes , and the communication behaviour .
Given two processes p , q :: Chanin a ->
Chanout a -> CHP ( ) , what can we say about them ?
We might wonder if composing them in either order ( p < = > q vs q < => p ) gives the same results .
This is not true , for several reasons .
Let ’s start with values .
Imagine that p replicates each value three times , and q sends on every third value .
The composition p < = > q will act like the identity process ; of every three repeats that p sends on , q will drop all but one .
But the composition q < = > p will act differently ; q will send on every third value , and p will then repeat it three times .
So the same number of values will emerge ( perhaps this , at least , is always true ? ) , but they will be different .
The communication behaviour can also be different .
Consider if p drops all the values it receives without forwarding them , while q refuses to do anything .
The composition p < = > q will act as p does , silently dropping all values received — but it will at least accept all the values it is given .
The composition q < => p will refuse to read any values , so attempting to send a value to it will result in deadlock .
It seems that attempts to form theorems about the composition of processes does not work as well as it does for functions .
All this reasoning collapses as soon as the processes have more specific values .
The process with type Chanin Int -> Chanout Int -> CHP ( ) might do anything , because it can construct Int values itself .
It ’s generally good practice in Haskell to keep the types as general as possible , and this type - based reasoning is one reason why that ’s a good idea .
Canada is a big country with big issues .
If you ’re looking to volunteer while in Canada , here are a few national organizations that could use your help .
Parks Canada
Parks Canada controls Canada ’s many national parks ( including a number of UNESCO sites ) ; they also own and operate many other historic sites all over the country .
This means that not only will you be able to find volunteer opportunities all over the country , but you will be able to find positions from environmental preservation to tour guiding to clerical work .
As a bonus , non-Canadian residents can apply for volunteer positions via an online questionnaire so that they can secure volunteer positions before they land in the country .
Most volunteers need to be at least 18 years of age .
Different positions require different skills and commitments .
Accommodations are provided in some cases .
Parks Canada recommends that Canadian residents apply directly to the parks / historic sites where they wish to volunteer , but they are welcome to fill out the same questionnaire if they are looking for opportunities far from home .
More information and the questionnaire can be found on the Parks Canada website .
The Salvation Army
The Salvation Army is “ the largest non-governmental direct provider of social services in Canada . ”
It operates numerous facilities across the country , including emergency relief shelters , addiction services , nursing homes , and summer camps .
Volunteer positions are easy to come by in most Canadian cities .
The duration of your commitment depends on what project you will be working on .
The Salvation Army is the perfect place to volunteer if you want to test the waters of fields like addiction treatment or palliative care , and positions generally require little to no experience .
Volunteers are also welcome to apply at any age .
To fill out the online form and to see what ’s available near you , visit The Salvation Army ’s website .
Immigrant Settlement Services
Immigration is a large part of Canadian culture , and the YMCA offers immigrant settlement services in major cities across the country .
These programs include orientations , befriending programs , work support , and translation services .
Volunteers are matched to new immigrants for 4 - 6 months , with minimum weekly contact for conversations and general social interaction .
New volunteers are needed all the time , but volunteers for the befriending programs must commit to four months minimum .
Volunteers for the other programs have a significant advantage if they speak other languages , but there is no language requirement for most positions .
Unfortunately , there is no online application available for volunteers ; apply in person at your local YMCA .
Check out YMCA Canada ’s website for more details .
The World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) Canada
The WWF - Canada works mainly towards fighting climate change and preserving Canada ’s oceans and freshwater resources .
With multiple locations and opportunities all over Canada , it ’s easy to get involved .
Much of the WWF ’s administrative staff is made up of volunteers , who keep the organization running smoothly .
Other hands - on opportunities vary regionally and depend on which projects are currently prioritized .
Check out your nearest WWF office , which will usually have more opportunities than advertised on the website .
If you want to get involved or find out more information , check out the WWF - Canada ’s website .
The Portland Hotel Society
The Portland Hotel Society operates out of Vancouver ’s Downtown Eastside , otherwise known as “ Canada ’s poorest postal code . ”
This area is known for its high rates of homelessness , drug addiction and general poverty , as well as mental illness .
The PHS owns and operates numerous services in this neighborhood , including supportive housing , cafes , kitchens and even its own credit union .
The PHS is most famous for its tandem operation of Insite , North America ’s only ( and highly controversial ) safe injection site .
To get involved , physically visit one or all of the operations and talk to managers directly .
For more information on the Portland Hotel Society , check out the website .
And if you ’re interested in getting involved with homelessness and addiction but are n’t in Vancouver , just check around town to see what ’s available .
Many cities operate similar systems , such as Renascent in Toronto , which is always actively seeking volunteers .
And finally … do your research !
The options listed above are national programs to help you find out what is available and get your feet wet .
If you really want a close local community connection , get online or check out the bulletin boards in local city centers .
Remember , Canada is a large and diverse country , so opportunities will vary significantly based on your location .
Good luck !

Making our community safer ; that ’s the goal of a new partnership starting today with a local business and Colorado Springs police .
The drivers of Yellow Cabs will now be an extra set of roving eyes and ears to help police catch criminals .
One of those drivers is Andy Michopoulos .
A Yellow Cab has been his office for three years .
But now he will be doing double duty in an effort to help keep our city safe .
“ As a driver who ’s out at all times of night and all over the city , you see things going on and to have a direct way of reporting that to the police is definitely a plus , ” says Michopoulos .
“ Just like our squad cars they have 2 - way radios , they have cell phones and they have mobile data terminals , ” says Colorado Springs Police Chief Richard Myers .
He feels this is a win - win situation for our community .
“ So by just increasing their awareness a little bit on how to watch the unusual , how to identify things that could be criminal activity in progress , it ’s just a short stretch to get them to take the extra time to pick up the mic and call dispatch , ” says Chief Myers .

A Cal State East Bay professor arrested for allegedly possessing child pornography earlier this month was charged Wednesday in Missouri with statutory rape and sodomy after federal investigators say a 20 - year - old St. Louis woman allowed him to victimize her 13 - month - old daughter .
Kenneth Kyle , 47 , of San Francisco was originally arrested March 15 and charged in Superior Court with one count of possessing child pornography and one count of child exploitation , after authorities said they had found hundreds of images on his home computer in the South of Market area and on his laptop .
He was later charged in federal court with one count of transporting child pornography .
Information that federal authorities found on Kyle 's computers led them to the St. Louis area , where on Wednesday , St. Louis County police arrested college student Tessa Vanvlerah at her parents ' home in the affluent suburb of Ballwin .
According to St. Louis County police , Kyle met Vanvlerah online and visited her four times in the past five months .
The alleged molestations took place during those visits , police said .
" Ballwin is very nice , nice homes , nice schools , low crime , " said Officer Rick Eckhard of the St. Louis County Police .
" For something like this to happen around here , people are pretty shocked . "
Eckhard said the 13 - month - old girl was treated at a hospital and is now in custody of the state .
According to court records , the FBI first suspected Kyle of downloading child pornography in December 2009 .
An affidavit written by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents said his laptop contained more than 529 images of child porn and 33 child porn videos .
It was unclear if any of the images involved Vanvlerah 's daughter , Eckhard said .
Missouri state authorities charged Kyle with statutory rape , statutory sodomy and promoting child pornography .
He is being held in jail in San Francisco .
Vanvlerah is being held in St. Louis County on the same charges , as well as on one count of incest .
Kyle has been an assistant professor in public affairs and administration at Cal State East Bay for four years .
According to his profile , which has since been removed from the Hayward university 's Web site , his research interests include the application of feminist theories , " specific social problems ( e.g. , homelessness and sexual deviance ) , institutions ( e.g. , the family and the academy ) and policies ( e.g. , mandatory computer ownership for university students and chemical castration for sex offenders ) . "
A spokesman for the campus , Barry Zepel , said Kyle was still on active teaching status .
Anyone who has watched the Buffalo Sabres play this season realizes the offense is struggling to score goals .
Finding the back of the net has become more and more difficult as each season passes .
The Sabres had scored over or near three goals a game every season since the lockout and this season they are averaging just 2.67 goals per game .
Year Goals Per Game 2005 - 2006 3.37 2006 - 2007 3.63 2007 - 2008 3.06 2008 - 2009 2.95 2009 - 2010 2.67
The Sabres came out of the lockout as a team built with speed in offense .
There system worked well when the referees were calling every penalty they could find .
It opened up more ice for the skilled players and the Sabres had plenty of forwards that took advantage of the extra room they were given .
As we have moved further away from the lockout the standard for penalties has dropped considerably league wide .
After the loss of Danny Briere and Chris Drury , via free agency , the Sabres have adapted a much more defensive style of play .
As fans we are quick to blame the players for the lack of offense but almost every player on the team has seen a decline in their offensive statistics .
At some point we have to acknowledge " the system " .
We have heard so much about the system over the past three seasons that it is part of our vocabulary when talking about the Sabres .
The Sabres missed the playoffs for two consecutive seasons and the post game comments from Jason Pominville and Ryan Miller read like a broken record .
After every game we would hear " We did n't play the system " , or " We have to do a better job playing the system " or any other variation of not playing the system .
We do n't hear those quotes quite as often this season and the Sabres are in first place .
Coincidence ?
I do n't think so .
I think the Lindy Ruff system works to win hockey games but it is not always the most entertaining game for fans to watch .
We all want to see the Sabres win a Stanley Cup and the players do to , that is why they finally buying into what the coach is selling .
This system is not designed for individuals to break records , it is built for the team to win hockey games , and for most of the season they have .
After the jump I have listed the Sabres top forwards career stats to gie you a sense of the drop off in offensive production .
Tim Connoly is the only player on the team that is averaging near his potential this season .
Some players are worse than others but overall you get a sense of where this team is offensively .

The world 's tallest building opened Monday in Dubai – known as the Burj Khalifa , it 's an exuberant architectural triumph in the middle of a deep economic swamp .
It 's often that way .
The tallest skyscrapers always seem to pop up just as the economy is headed down .
The Singer and Metropolitan Life buildings were under construction in New York when the Panic of 1907 hit the United States .
Construction of the Chrysler and Empire State buildings heralded the start of the Great Depression .
A sour economy accompanied the opening of the Sears Tower ( the mid-1970s downturn ) and Malaysia 's Petronas Tower ( the Asian financial crisis ) .
The phenomenon happens so often it has a name : the skyscraper index ( click on chart above ) .
[ Editor 's note :
This paragraph was changed to show the correct location of the Petronas Tower . ]
So along comes the Burj Khalifa , until today known as the Burj Dubai , which could signal the reach of the " great recession " or point to Dubai 's more recent economic woes .
In the midst of a real estate crash , the last thing the emirate needs is a new skyscraper with 160 floors of commercial and residential space .
Things got so bad for the city - state 's indebted sovereign fund that it nearly went bankrupt a month ago and had to be bailed out by neighboring Abu Dhabi , an occurrence that some say led to the change in the building 's name , which now honors Abu Dhabi 's ruler Khalifa bin Zayed .
The skyscraper index works because developers tend to make ambitious gambles with huge new towers at the point of the business cycle when interest - rate and price signals can get distorted , wrote Mark Thornton , a senior fellow at the Mises Institute , in a 2005 research paper ( .pdf ) .
The institute is a research and education center espousing Austrian School economics and based in Auburn , Ala .
The skyscraper index has not predicted all major economic downturns ( like the depressions of 1920 – 21 or 1937 – 38 ) , he adds .
So what does it mean that in 2014 , China is expected to complete the Shanghai Tower , which at 2,073 feet will be its tallest building and the world 's tallest after the Burj Dubai ?
Second - tallest skyscrapers count , writes Mr. Thornton in an e-mail .
" Country records do have meaning for the local economy and groupings of new skyscrapers are part of the global crisis phenomenon . "
Viewed from the skyscrapers , world economies may be getting worse , not better , he writes .
When a 14 - year - old texts her 15 - year - old boyfriend a topless photo of herself , she could be sending him to prison for five years and labeling him a sex offender for life .
Under current Arizona law , " sexting " among juveniles could qualify as felony sexual exploitation of a minor .
It does n't matter that the recipient of the photo also is a juvenile , or that the juvenile in the photo sent it .
But a bill working its way through the state Legislature could make Arizona the seventh state in the nation to make sexting between juveniles a misdemeanor .
Senate Bill 1266 proposes to make it a misdemeanor for a juvenile to use a computer or cellphone to send or possess " explicit sexual material " of another juvenile in the form of a photo or video .
Explicit sexual material would include human genitalia , nudity , sexual activity or sadomasochistic abuse .
Lawmakers in Vermont , Utah and Ohio , among other states , have passed similar legislation .
Supporters say it would give law enforcement and the courts a more appropriate way to deal with juvenile sexters .
Opponents say it would criminalize children for stupid behavior that is better dealt with by parents .
The maximum sentence for conviction under the proposed Arizona legislation would be four months in jail , but lesser sentences could include probation , participation in diversion programs or fines .
Juveniles who did not solicit the photo or video , took reasonable steps to destroy it and did not forward it to another person would not be in violation of the proposed law .
The Senate Public Safety and Human Services Committee passed the bill with a vote of 5 - 0 on Wednesday .
It now moves to the Senate Rules Committee .
Paul Ahler , executive director of the Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys ' Advisory Council , said he did n't think any Arizona children have been charged with felonies for sexting under the current law .
However , children in other states have .
His organization , which includes representatives from the state 's county attorneys , the state attorney general and municipal prosecutors , supports the bill .
Ahler said judges and law enforcement now are stuck with labeling a child a sex offender or finding some lesser charge that may not precisely fit the circumstances .
In August , for example , Tucson police recommended a misdemeanor charge of using a telephone to offend , harass or intimidate for two 13 - year - old boys suspected of sexting .
" Arizona prosecutors do not want to deal with this issue using child - pornography laws , " Ahler said .
" These are not pedophiles , not sex offenders .
But they are doing something dangerous that needs to be stopped . "
Susan Crawford with the Pinal County Attorney 's Office said the current law has made officials reluctant to prosecute sexting at all .
She said the proposed legislation would show minors that sexting is serious , while at the same time allow for a more appropriate level of sentencing .
Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona , opposes the legislation .
" We 're jailing kids for exercising poor judgment , " she said .
" This bill , it 's so broad , would outlaw electronic mooning .
That 's one of the oldest pranks in the book . "
Soler Meetze said such a law could lead to more prosecution of juvenile sexting and has a high potential for selective enforcement based on the attitudes of different communities .
" The kids engaging in these kinds of behaviors need education , support from their teachers and parents , and treatment , " she said .
" They do n't need incarceration . "
Federal workers owe more than $ 3 billion in income taxes they failed to pay in 2008 .
According to Internal Revenue Service documents , 276,300 federal employees and retirees owe $ 3,042,200,000 .
The IRS tracks the voluntary compliance rate of federal employees and retirees each year , and each year feds come up short .
The one bright spot in this year ’s report is that after several years of a steady increase , the amount owed by feds is down from the previous year .
Federal employees and retirees owed $ 3,586,784,725 in unpaid income taxes in 2007 .

A couple called “ Boring ” ( yes , that ’s their surname ) sued Google in early 2008 for taking pictures of its suburban Pennsylvania home .
The claim was their house was on a clearly marked private road ( “ Private Road , No Trespassing ” ) and Google ’s Street View mobile trespassed by entering and taking the images of their home .
There was also an “ invasion of privacy ” claim , among several others including “ punitive damages . ”
The US District Court dismissed the entire case .
The US Court of Appeal for the Third District affirmed the lower court ’s ruling on all claims and causes of action except the trespass claim :
We will affirm the District Court ’s grant of Google ’s motion to dismiss the Borings ’ claims for invasion of privacy , unjust enrichment , injunctive relief , and punitive damages .
We reverse , however , with respect to the trespass claim , and remand with instructions that the District Court permit that claim to go forward .
Here ’s what the court said about the trespass claim and why it ’s likely to be successful against Google :
Trespass is a strict liability tort , “ both exceptionally simple and exceptionally rigorous . . .
“ Here , the Borings have alleged that Google entered upon their property without permission .
If proven , that is a trespass , pure and simple .
This will turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory ( albeit perhaps a “ moral ” vindication ) however because the damages that the couple will be able to collect from Google will be “ nominal . ”
The appeals court said this about potential damages :
Of course , it may well be that , when it comes to proving damages from the alleged trespass , the Borings are left to collect one dollar and whatever sense of vindication that may bring , but that is for another day .
Perhaps the couple can turn their story somehow into a reality TV show . . .

Google ’s Nexus
One phone is a winner , according to Linus Torvalds , founder of the operating system it ’s based on .
“ I generally hate phones , ” explained Torvalds , who is known as “ the father of Linux , ” in a blog post on Saturday .
“ At the same time I love the concept of having a phone that runs Linux , and I ’ve had a number of them over the years , ” he wrote .
Torvalds has rarely used the phones he has had , including Google ’s original G1 , he said .
However , he ’s been a happy camper since he bought the Nexus One last week .
Navigation the Clincher
For Torvalds , the phone ’s big selling point has been its turn - by - turn navigation capabilities .
“ I guess what made me decide on the Nexus One was that I was driving up to Tacoma for a local scuba diving trip two weeks ago , and I actually had my old G1 with me , ” Torvalds told LinuxInsider .
During the course of that trip , Torvalds used his G1 to find a restaurant using Google Maps .
‘ Local Is Relative ’
“ But without navigation , and without knowing the area — ‘ local ’ is relative , since scuba is still over two hours away — it only got me part of the way , ” he noted .
“ Then the guy I was car - pooling with used his portable nav - unit to actually get us there . ”
That , in turn , “ made it clear that a Nexus One would have been a good combination : the ability to look up things with Google — rather than the addresses or very limited points - of - interest that normal nav units have — _and_ then just navigate to them with turn - by - turn navigation is something I am willing to carry a piece of hardware around for . ”
Both the phone and browsing capabilities were “ very secondary ” to Torvalds .
Superphone Status
Google ’s Android - based Nexus
One , which was unveiled last month , is billed by its maker as one of an emerging class of “ superphones . ”
It competes with numerous other Android - based phones , including the high - profile Droid by Motorola .
Though given top billing by Google , the Nexus One has encountered its share of obstacles in the few weeks since its release , including connectivity issues and problems with customer service .
Also notable is that the phone can only be purchased online .
‘ What a Difference ! ’
“ I was n’t enthusiastic about buying a phone on the Internet sight unseen , but the day it was reported that it finally had the pinch - to - zoom thing enabled , I decided to take the plunge , ” Torvalds noted in his blog .
“ What a difference ! ” he enthused .
“ I no longer feel like I ’m dragging a phone with me ‘ just in case ’ I would need to get in touch with somebody — now I ’m having a useful ( and admittedly pretty good - looking ) gadget instead . ”
‘ A Superior Effort ’
Indeed , Google ’s heavy emphasis on location sets its device apart , agreed Chris Ambrosio , executive director of wireless with Strategy Analytics .
“ I think what they do with not just navigation but the larger effort around location is an attractive part of the offering , ” Ambrosio told LinuxInsider .
“ The search and recommendations part of the product is where they ’re spending a lot of time and effort , so it ’s clear they ’re making a superior effort there , ” he added .
‘ Gadget Porn ’
Torvalds and his wife are now considering replacing her iPhone with a second Nexus One , whose screen “ really is pretty gorgeous , ” he told LinuxInsider .
“ When browsing , you really can use the thing as a real Web browser , just because the pixel density is so high , and you can actually read some really tiny text , ” he explained .
“ So sure , there ’s the plain ‘ gadget porn ’ angle — the thing is a beautiful piece of hardware . ”
The Android Market is another nice feature , he added , “ for the couple of silly games that I can play when I ’m waiting around for the kids or whatever , and having music _without_ the insane Apple iTunes model . ”
Those , however , “ are details , ” he concluded .
“ So far the big thing is ‘ Google Maps + navigation — that to me is the killer app .
Maybe I ’ll find others , but it ’s been just literally a few days so far . ”

Cao : Abortion 'at a par with slavery '
Rep .
Anh " Joseph " Cao ( R - LA ) — the only Republican in either chamber to vote in favor of health care reform in 2009 — told the Times - Picayune Sunday that abortion is a " moral evil , at a par with slavery . "
" Modern society has become desensitized to the issue , " Cao said .
" When you speak of abortion many people push it aside without really thinking about it ....
For me abortion is such a moral evil , at a par with slavery , that I cannot in good conscience support a bill that seeks to expand it . "
Cao called himself a " tormented soul " because he wanted to vote in favor of health care reform again Sunday night but believed he could not without the more stringent abortion language of the House 's original Stupak - Pitts amendment .
In a bit of a bizarre move , Cao also is slated to give a press conference at the House Triangle Monday afternoon — a day after the House passed landmark health care legislation .

His bankruptcy also shows the theft of a saxophone , clothes and other items from a car in April of last year for which his insurance paid $ 7,400 .
There 's also an anonymous tip on the site Hobbub.com claiming items were mysterously lifted from his foreclosed home before the bank took control of the property :
We were trying to buy a foreclosed house in San Diego last year .
The previous owner ( Jim and Patti Sikes….local realtors BTW ) lost the house , but before giving posession back to the bank " someone " stole the ENTIRE kitchen out of the house ……….

STATES ’ RIGHTS VS .
AN OVERBEARING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
by Jim Delaney , blogging at http://opinerlog.blogspot.com/2009/10/nullification-movement-resists.html
Recently , a friend and I were lamenting the steady dissolution of our Constitution .
It seemed to us that the further our politicians have strayed from the spirit , meaning and intent of the Constitution , the more enervated , disunited and dispirited our nation and its people have become .
Discussing how best to remedy the nation ’s decline and to restore Constitutional governance , we briefly alluded to the discredited doctrine of nullification about which neither of us knew very much at all .
So , I decided to briefly revisit the subject to see what I could learn .
In a nutshell , this is it .
I hope it will be of some interest to you .
The Constitution ’s 10th Amendment unambiguously provides that “ the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
Over the years , the federal government ’s loose and expansive interpretation of the Constitution has steadily led to federal encroachment on state powers and individual rights at a pace and breadth not clearly foreseen by the Founders , leaving this country and its people more divided and polarized than since immediately prior to the Civil War .
Awakened to Obama ’s threat of “ fundamentally transforming America ” , and much to the consternation of the Progressives currently dominating the national political scene , many states and many grassroots Americans are now vigorously pushing back and asserting their Constitutional rights of sovereignty and individual liberty .
We can only hope it ’s not too late .
Since Obama ’s election , Congress has unleashed a transformational legislative blitzkrieg surpassing that of the New Deal which boldly challenges both state sovereignty and individual freedoms as never before .
The resulting uneasiness in the country manifestly belies the hollowness of Obama ’s hope - and - change and no - blue - or - red - states - but - American sloganeering .
To wit , with Obama ’s election and the Progressive takeover in DC , not only have gun sales skyrocketed , but , quite unexpectedly , state nullification laws intended to restrain further federal usurpations have ballooned .
Clearly , the folks and the states wherein they reside are justifiably wary .
Since 1865 and until now , nullification was viewed as a moribund curiosity which , while having often impacted our country in the past , had essentially become an eccentricity , a nullity in the post - Civil War era .
But , as I soon discovered , nullification has returned with a vengeance .
In the Fourth Edition of Black ’s Law Dictionary , nullification , aka interposition , is defined as “ the doctrine that a state , in the exercise of its sovereignty , may reject a mandate of the federal government deemed to be unconstitutional or to exceed the powers delegated to the federal government .
The doctrine denies constitutional obligations of states to respect Supreme Court decisions with which they do not agree . ”
Indeed , the American Revolution , grounded in Magna Carta principles , was a successful act of nullification coupled with forcible resistance .
On the other hand , the American Civil War , aka “ War of Northern Aggression ” or “ Lincoln ’s War ” , was a notable and costly failure for the nullification doctrine .
Essentially , the nullification doctrine is predicated on the theory that sovereign states comprise the union , and as architects of the compact which formed that union , hold final authority regarding the limits of federal power .
Conversely , the “ national sovereignty ” , aka “ nationalist ” , theory argues that the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution absolutely guarantees federal government supremacy over the states in every way .
However , the “ compact ” theory persuasively asserts that the Supremacy Clause expressly states that the Constitution “ and all laws made pursuant to it ” are supreme–NOT the federal government or any laws it may legislate .
Further and very importantly , “ compact ” adherents argue that federal powers are not inherent , but , as demonstrated by Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution , were delegated by the states to the federal government at the union ’s inception .
In effect , the compact between the states and the federal government provides that the states surrender specific powers to the federal government but maintain those powers not specifically delegated .
( In Federalists 32 & 33 , Alexander Hamilton espoused the compact theory , as did Thomas Jefferson .
On the other hand , I discovered that James Madison , though clearly wedded to the compact theory in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolution of 1798 , seems to have , over time , become conflicted and often inexplicably contradictory on this point . )
In any event , once again the “ compact theory ” is being advanced .
Intended to publicly challenge federal usurpation of state sovereignty , this year many state legislatures have passed state sovereignty resolutions .
These “ shots across the bow ” , so to speak , do not have the force of law , but do serve notice to the federal government to “ cease and desist any and all activities ” outside the scope of its Article 1 , Section 8 delegated powers .
In effect , these resolutions put the feds on notice that federal encroachment , aka “ acts of usurpation ” as expressed in Amendments 9 and 10 , will not be routinely submitted to as in the past .
Already this year , Tenth Amendment Resolutions have been passed and signed by the Governors in Alaska and Tennessee , and have passed one or both legislative chambers in Arizona , Georgia , Idaho , Louisiana , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , N. Carolina , N. Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , S. Carolina , S. Dakota , and Virginia .
So , it ’s not just a southern thing , not by a long shot .
In the following states , at least one legislative chamber has , so far , passed legislation asserting that federal regulation of firearms produced , sold and used within the state is beyond the “ commerce clause ” authority of Congress : Alaska , Montana , and Tennessee .
In several other states , similar legislation has been introduced .
( Note : to avoid a needless clash , Montana has also opted to test its sovereignty in this regard by submitting its jurisdictional contention to judicial review . )
If one can achieve one ’s goals peacefully , then why not ?
Asserting that the imposition of national health care plans is unconstitutional , Arizona , New Mexico , Wyoming , N. Dakota , Minnesota , Indiana , Michigan , Ohio , W. Virginia , Pennsylvania and Florida have introduced legislation to effectively nullify any such federal plan .
Of special interest too is that while the Montana State House also unanimously condemned the REAL ID
Act as an improper use of federal legislative power , what was particularly significant is that the bill condemning the Act stipulated that “ the legislature of the state of Montana hereby nullifies the REAL ID Act of 2005 , as it would apply in this state , ” thus underscoring the seriousness of its resistance .
To blunt the takeover of state sovereignty , these particular states are pushing back hard , openly and seriously .
The weighty question is whether or not this sudden and widespread state resistance can persuade the feds to back off , or whether this clash over the inviolability of the Constitution ’s separation of powers doctrine might eventually lead to conflict .
So , though some of us may have thought that Appomattox settled the question of nullification , it is now abundantly clear that it did not .
In fact , the principle of nullification , aka “ interposition ” , is deeply entrenched in the history of the United States .
In 1793 , Georgia successfully nullified the Supreme Court ’s ruling in Chisholm v Georgia that an individual could sue a state in federal court without the State ’s permission .
Most states agreed and the 11th Amendment was soon passed which prohibited such suits .
This demonstrated the fact that even if both houses of Congress refused to initiate an amendment process that two - thirds of the states could peacefully compel Congress to call a Constitutional Convention to remedy federal breaches of the Constitution .
Some may recall that in 1798 the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky , in protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts , resolved that if the federal government presumed to possess the sole authority to determine the extent of its powers , that its power would eventually be unbridled and could , therefore , lead to tyranny .
In effect , the Virginia and Kentucky Resolution ( co- authored by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson ) opined that states not only possessed the right , but were “ duty bound ” to nullify unconstitutional federal laws .
As Thomas Jefferson wrote , “ When all government , domestic and foreign , in little as in great things , shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another , and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated . ”
Hard hit by the Embargo of 1807 - 1809 , and in opposition to the finding in United States v The William in 1808 which ruled the embargo constitutional , the Massachusetts assembly effectively overruled that court by asserting that any state could refuse “ assistance , aid or cooperation ” when any federal act is unconstitutional .
The Connecticut assembly went further by directing that all state officials actively withhold “ any official aid or co-operation in the execution of the act . ”
The embargo quickly unraveled .
The Connecticut General Assembly declared : “ Resolved , that to preserve the Union , and support the Constitution of the United States , it becomes the duty of the …states , in such a crisis…vigilantly to watch over , and vigorously to maintain , the powers not delegated to the United States , but reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ; and that a due regard to this duty , will not permit this Assembly to assist , or concur in giving effect to the aforesaid unconstitutional act , passed , to enforce the embargo . ”
In effect , the Assembly was asserting a State ’s right to “ interpose ” their protection between the federal government and the rights and liberties of the people .
In 1812 , during America ’s war with England , the federal government called up the state militias “ to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel invasions . ”
Massachusetts , and then Connecticut , nullified the call - up on the grounds that “ as this power is not [ specifically ] delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , it is reserved to the states , respectively ; and from the nature of the power , it must be exercised by those with whom the states have respectively entrusted the chief command of the militia , [ that being the Governors of those respective states ] . ”
Convinced that the federal government ’s real ambition was to annex Canada and not merely to defend the union , the Assemblies asserted that unless those states were threatened “ by an actual invasion of any portion of [ their ] territory ” that the Commander - in - Chief had no right to call upon the state militias to carry out offensive wars . ”
In 1813 , a more debilitating embargo was imposed .
Flooded with grievances , eventually the Massachusetts General Court asserted that “ a power to regulate commerce is abused when employed to destroy it . ”
The assertion went on to reject the notion that “ the free , sovereign and independent State of Massachusetts [ should be ] reduced to a mere municipal corporation , without power to protect its people , and to defend them from oppression , from whatever quarter it comes . ”
Again the state affirmed its Constitutional right to “ interpose ” itself between the oppressor and the people .
Then there was the famous Nullification Crisis of 1832 when S. Carolina undertook to nullify a federal tariff law and a subsequent bill authorizing the use of force against a state .
Upshot : a compromise tariff was adopted to avert war .
Thus , nullification did have the intended effect .
In 1850 , several morally enraged northern states resisted federal attempts to enforce the capture and return of runaway slaves .
And although the Constitution at the time did contain a clause to justify enforcement , these states argued that since the Constitution did not specify a clearly defined enforcement mechanism that their compliance would be withheld in those states .
Though there are several other examples of successful nullification initiatives , the point is that the right to nullify and even peacefully secede appear to be valid constitutional remedies to overweening or intrusive federal authority .
And , of course , short of nullification , some states have simply ignored federal mandates , e.g. seatbelt and motorcycle helmet laws , Daylight Savings Time ( AZ and Hawaii ) , & participation in No Child Left Behind ( Utah ) .
Worth noting too are the following points which I dredged up :
Of the original 13 states , Virginia , Rhode Island and New York conditioned their ratification of the Constitution on the understanding that they explicitly retained the right to secede and the Constitutional Convention never challenged that right .
Also , following the Civil War , and only under duress , the state Constitutions of six of the former Confederate states expressly prohibited their right to secede , though one should bear in mind that there is nothing to prevent those states from amending their constitutions and incorporating secession rights .
Worthy of note too is the fact that the Constitution does not expressly forbid a state from leaving the union .
Thus , it would seem that , short of open rebellion , nullification ( interposition ) and peaceful secession still appear to be defensible ways of ensuring that federal power , both congressional and judicial , cannot supersede state sovereignty , the guaranteed rights of the people or the sanctity of the Constitution itself .
The Founders clearly understood and espoused the belief that political leaders are best held accountable to the people when government is local ; that decentralization leads to a healthier level of state competition and policy experimentation , thus limiting the scope of damages which can accrue when central planning and experimentation is uniformly imposed throughout the country , the rationale being that it is better that a policy experiment fail in one state than in the entire union –the “ laboratory of experimentation ” concept .
While some today believe that only the serious threat of secession can effectively roll back the suffocating federal usurpation which has already taken place , those state legislatures named above are hoping that a serious “ shot across the bow ” will check federal power and avert more serious confrontation .
Still others have advanced the idea that the nation has become too large to effectively accommodate the Constitutional plan of governance envisioned by the Founders and that , therefore , the nation needs to peacefully break up into smaller administrative units of states , each administrative region acting as an integral part of a confederated republic where the people - to - representative ratio in each region would be more manageable and credible .
Of special concern to many is the increasing power of the Supreme Court to not only re-interpret the Constitution , but to render what many view as unconstitutional and politicized decisions .
So how do the states and people restrain judicial overreaching as well ?
Robert Hawes in his “ Nullification Revisited ” explained that while the decisions of Chief Justice John Marshall served to implant the heretofore unshakeable notion that the Supreme Court is and ought to be the final arbiter in all Constitutional matters , Alexander Hamilton remarked in Federalist 81 that the Constitution does not empower “ the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution , or give them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every state . ”
He concluded by stating that “ the Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws , and that wherever there is an evident opposition , the laws ought to give place to the Constitution . ”
In effect , Hamilton envisioned the tyranny of a national judicial authority defining its own interpretive powers and “ giving it the ability to re-invent itself and evolve beyond its authorized scope . ”
And for me and many other Americans , the courts have , indeed , become dangerously politicized and , therefore , unreliable stewards of the Constitution .
Thus , “ compact ” adherents would suggest that nullification , secession or a Constitutional Convention are the only legal means of protecting the Constitution and all the rights which flow from it .
As the Tenth Amendment Center noted in a “ talking points ” post , “ We agree with historian Kevin Gutzman , who has said that those who would give us a ‘ living Constitution ’ are actually giving us a dead one , since such a thing is completely unable to protect us against the encroachments of government power . ”
Truer words ….
Finally , when torn between abiding by the Constitution and protecting one ’s rights under the Constitution or submissively accommodating federal overreaching and politicized interpretations of the Constitution , what reasonable remedies are left for a state and the people residing therein ?
Moral suasion , nullification , peaceful secession , violent secession , civil disobedience , convening a Constitutional Convention to redress Constitutional grievances , or simply ignoring unconstitutional federal mandates .
For me , whatever works best to preserve the Constitution and to safeguard life , liberty and property is the right solution .
Food for thought in these perilous times .
( “ Ultimately , whether or not a state is allowed to secede is neither a legal question nor a constitutional question , but rather a matter of political will .
How strong is the will of the people in the departing state to be free and independent of the control of the world ’s only superpower ?
How far will the US Government be prepared to go in imposing its will on a breakaway republic ?
Only time will tell . ”
Thomas Naylor , “ The Constitutionality of Secession ” )
( “ We have given you a Republic , if you can keep it . ” Benjamin Franklin . )
The European Commission hosted a fascinating consultation on ACTA today .
Luc Devigne , the lead European negotiator , opened with a brief presentation and proceeded to field questions for over an hour .
The full consultation video is available online .
The discussion touched on many issues including Devigne arguing that the WTO consistently blocked any attempt to address IP enforcement issues and stating that the treaty is limited to enforcement and not new substantive provisions ( this assumes that anti-circumvention rules are a matter of enforcement , not substance ) .
The two big issues of the day , however , were three strikes and the European Parliament ACTA resolution .
On three strikes , Devigne repeatedly stated that the EU was bound by EU law and that it was not supporting any inclusion of three strikes in ACTA .
In fact , Devigne went further in claiming that no one had even proposed the possibility of three strikes .
This despite the fact that a memo produced by his own department stated :
EU understands that footnote 6 provides for an example of a reasonable policy to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of protected materials .
However , the issue of termination of subscriptions and accounts has been subject to much debate in several Member States .
Furthermore , the issue of whether a subscription or an account may be terminated without prior court decision is still subject to negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of Telecoms Ministers regarding the Telecoms Package .
This refers to the footnote in the ACTA text proposed by the U.S. which states " an example of such a policy [ ISP policy ] is providing for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscriptions and / or accounts on the service provider 's system or network of repeat infringers . "
In this sentence , the U.S. has proposed using the word " and " while the Australians prefer " or . "
I would argue Mr. Devigne would be more credible if he would not base unequivocal statements on the fact the text appears in a footnote and not within the article itself .
The other contentious issues was the effect of the European Parliament resolution on ACTA ( see here and here for more ) .
The Resolution states that the Parliament :
Calls on the Commission to continue the negotiations on ACTA and limit them to the existing European IPR enforcement system against counterfeiting
Devigne was repeatedly asked whether the European Commission would respect this part of the resolution .
The response was to point to another part of the resolution stating the Parliament
Urges the Commission to ensure that the enforcement of ACTA provisions – especially those on copyright enforcement procedures in the digital environment – are fully in line with the acquis communautaire
to suggest that there was a conflict within the resolution ( or at least an opening to continue discussions beyond counterfeiting matters ) .
The discussion , which included actual Members of the European Parliament , suggests that a future court fight over respect for the resolution is a possibility .

JIT Support for Nexus One CyanogenMod 5.0.x / Kernel 2.6.33.1 ( Eclair ) By Ivan Dimkovic ( psyq321 )
--------------------------
NOTE : JIT is totally unsupported and known to be NOT stable !!!
There is no guarantee your system will boot at all !!!
ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM WITH NANDROID FIRST !!!
This package is provided for TESTING PURPOSES ONLY .
Author assumes NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER if you brick your phone !!!
1 . What is this ?
This package contains several Android system files that enable JIT ( " Just in Time " ) feature in the Dalvik VM .
JIT is very unstable and it is not built - in the AOSP or Cyanogen 's ROMs .
This package contains system files built with JIT feature ON and it could be useful for testing for people that do not wish to recompile the entire ROM extra_tuning directory contains Dalvik JIT library compiled with WITH_JIT_TUNING option .
This option presumably enables even more optimizations for the JIT , but it appears to be totally unstable ( I get endless reboot cycle ) 2 .
How to make JIT enabled ?
Follow these steps : - BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM WITH NANDROID ( IMPORTANT !!!)
-
Connect your phone to the PC - Copy the Dalvik files to the system directories : adb remount adb push libdvm .
so / system/lib/libdvm.so adb push libnativehelper .
so /system/lib/libnativehelper.so adb push dalvikvm / system / bin / dalvikvm -
Go to the shell ( e.g. via adb shell , or via ssh ) and change the permissions : chmod 755 / system / bin/ dalvikvm chmod 644 /system/lib/libdvm.so chmod 644 /system/lib/libnativehelper.so -
Add this line at the end of your system 's build .
prop dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:jit - Reboot into RECOVERY and wipe Dalvik cache !
- Reboot 3 . It does not work ?
My system keeps rebooting /
My system crashes randomly ?
Unfortunately , this can happen and this is known issue with JIT .
This is the reason why it is not enabled .
You are free to look in the AOSP code and try to fix it by yourself , but I suggest to wait until original developers make it stable Enjoy !
Thanks to Twitter , I discovered Andy Domin and this badass jungle mix .
After the first track I knew I liked what this guy was selling ..it ’s everything I love about drum and bass .
I did some resarch and discovered that Andy is one half of Your Infamous Harp ( the other half is a female vocalist named Sara ) .
Their website explains the Harp like so : “ With deep roots in glitch - hop , jungle and IDM , the ‘ Harp ’ blazes a trail through various electronic musical stylings to champion an underground genre of their own . ”
I really like their experimental sound and wanted to know more about them .
EC : What ’s the story behind Your Infamous Harp .. how and when did you guys start collaborating ?
Andy : Sara is my female companion of 4 years .
she heard some of my music on the best website ever invented , “ MYSPACE.COM ” .
we began to collaborate over the internet , using our computers , to make musics .
in time we grew fond of one another , but distance prevented us from making love , in the same way that the government prevents same - sex marriages .
your infamous harp was a means to musically reconstruct our physical selves in the same place .
EC : What can creamers expect to hear when they listen to YHI ?
Andy : Your Infamous Harp will cream into their ear .
EC : I saw on your website that you designed some kind of computer game called Geo -Duck .
What the duck is Geo -Duck ?
Andy : Geo-Duck is a 2d platform music adventure RPG on EXTLABS.com .
The premise : collect musical instruments , and use them to defeat the craziest of monsters , amongst the craziest of levels .
Find the true meaning of your existence by traveling North - East to Nirvana .
Gnarly stuff man , I dig it .
Thanks to Andy for sharing his cream !
You can listen to and buy tracks from Your Infamous Harp here and here .
The explosive device smuggled in the clothing of the Detroit bomb suspect would not have been detected by body - scanners set to be introduced in British airports , an expert on the technology warned last night .
The claim severely undermines Gordon Brown 's focus on hi-tech scanners for airline passengers as part of his review into airport security after the attempted attack on Flight 253 on Christmas Day .
The Independent on Sunday has also heard authoritative claims that officials at the Department for Transport ( DfT ) and the Home Office have already tested the scanners and were not persuaded that they would work comprehensively against terrorist threats to aviation .
The claims triggered concern that the Prime Minister is over - playing the benefits of such scanners to give the impression he is taking tough action on terrorism .
And experts in the US said airport " pat- downs " – a method used in hundreds of airports worldwide – were ineffective and would not have stopped the suspect boarding the plane .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , allegedly concealed in his underpants a package containing nearly 3 oz of the chemical powder PETN ( pentaerythritol tetranitrate ) .
He also carried a syringe containing a liquid accelerant to detonate the explosive .
Since the attack was foiled , body - scanners , using " millimetre - wave " technology and revealing a naked image of a passenger , have been touted as a solution to the problem of detecting explosive devices that are not picked up by traditional metal detectors – such as those containing liquids , chemicals or plastic explosive .
But Ben Wallace , the Conservative MP , who was formerly involved in a project by a leading British defence research firm to develop the scanners for airport use , said trials had shown that such low - density materials went undetected .
Tests by scientists in the team at Qinetiq , which Mr Wallace advised before he became an MP in 2005 , showed the millimetre - wave scanners picked up shrapnel and heavy wax and metal , but plastic , chemicals and liquids were missed .
If a material is low density , such as powder , liquid or thin plastic – as well as the passenger 's clothing – the millimetre waves pass through and the object is not shown on screen .
High - density material such as metal knives , guns and dense plastic such as C4 explosive reflect the millimetre waves and leave an image of the object .
Mr Wallace said : " Gordon Brown is grasping at headlines if he thinks buying a couple of scanners will make us safer .
It is too little , too late .
Under his leadership , he starved the defence research budget that could have funded a comprehensive solution while at the same time he has weakened our border security .
" Scanners can not provide a comprehensive solution on their own .
We must now start to ask if national security demands the use of profiling . "
Mr Wallace added that X - ray scanners were also unlikely to have detected the Christmas Day bomb .
The Government is looking at millimetre - wave scanners for widespread use in British airports as part of Mr Brown 's review .
They are safer to use than X - ray scanners because they do not emit radiation and do not require passengers ' consent .
Pregnant women cannot go through X - ray scanners but there are no such health risks with millimetre - wave technology .
However , a Whitehall source revealed that the DfT and the Home Office had already tested both the millimetre - wave and X - ray body - scanners as part of an ongoing assessment of airport security and anti- terror measures .
But the security scare has caused national governments and airports to renew their interest in body - scanners .
Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport , where Abdulmutallab changed flights en route from Nigeria to Detroit , is to activate 17 scanners it bought two years ago for flights to the US , despite EU advice that there are privacy and human rights issues .
Last week the US Transportation Security Administration ordered $ 165 m - worth of scanners , using both millimetre and X - ray technology , from L - 3 Communications .
Qinetiq had developed a similar millimetre - wave body scanner , but is now developing a sophisticated " stand - off " scanner which does not pose any privacy issues as it does not show a body image .
Materials hidden on a body reflect back signals , showing up as a red alert on screen .
Kevin Murphy , product manager for physical security at Qinetiq , admitted this SPO system would also not have picked up the Christmas Day bomb , but insisted that it could be used as part of a " layered approach " to security in mass transportation , which would also include monitoring people 's behaviour .
Mr Murphy echoed Mr Wallace 's doubts over whether the millimetre - wave body scanners being discussed by the Government would have picked up Abdulmutallab 's hidden explosive .
He said : " It is conjecture whether or not these methods would have seen through clothing .
I do n't think anyone knows . "
He added : " The solution is to acknowledge that there is n't a single technology out there that is an answer to the whole problem . "
Each full body - scanner costs around £ 100,000 .
However , opinion is divided among aviation experts .
Writing in The Independent on Sunday , Chris Yates , Aviation Security Editor of Jane 's Information Group , says : " Body scanning ( whether it be millimetre - wave or X - ray based and manufactured by any of the companies in this sector ) , has a significant role to play in enhancing UK airport security immediately .
" Body scanning is only half the story , though .
The Government cannot ignore the liquid aspect any more .
Liquid explosive became a high - agenda issue following the thwarted transatlantic bomb plot of 2006 and is clearly implicated in the attempted downing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 .
If the Government skirts over this aspect it will be nothing short of a dereliction of duty . "
On Friday , in an announcement on the Downing Street website , the Prime Minister said an urgent review of security at UK airports would be implemented .
Promising to react quickly to the " wake - up " call of last week 's attempted atrocity , Mr Brown added : " In co-operation with President Obama and the Americans , we will examine a range of new techniques to enhance airport security systems beyond the traditional measures .
These could include advancing our use of explosive trace technology , full body scanners and advanced X - ray technology . "
A spokesman for BAA , which owns six UK airports , including Heathrow , said on Friday : " Any comprehensive review of airport security should involve government and the aviation industry , and should establish how a combination of technology , intelligence and the profiling of passengers can build a better defence against the unpredictable and changing threat from international terrorism . "
Responding to Mr Wallace 's claims , a DfT spokesman said : " Body - scanners are being assessed urgently as part of a package of measures to respond to the latest incident .
Trials of body - scanners have already taken place and these are being assessed urgently as part of an immediate review of airport security . "
In the US , the " pat - down " search used by security staff was derided as ineffective – because officials are forbidden from frisking sensitive areas .
Analyst Michael Boyd said : " To have people hold up their arms and just pat them – like I 'm really going to carry a bomb down there .
You know where you 're going to put it , and no one 's going to go there . "
Mr Brown has also convened a meeting for 28 January on the terror threat posed by Yemen , where Abdulmutallab is alleged to have undergone terrorist training .
In a fresh announcement yesterday , Downing Street announced an emergency cabinet committee meeting with senior ministers and intelligence chiefs to discuss the UK 's response to the attempted attack .

Kevin has already weighed in on this , but I think he might be sort of missing the point about the latest Washington Post health care poll .
Kevin says the poll is a reminder that the GOP still has a “ quieter , non-Fox wing that would like to see some things get done . ”
But the far more noticeable thing about the graph is how committed Democrats are to moving forward on comprehensive health care reform .
We should spell that out .
These results are best understood in the context of Rep. Jay Inslee ’s “ finish the kitchen ” metaphor .
( People hate the “ renovation ” process to get to health care reform , but they ’ll love the results . )
Everyone likes the sweet smell of success .
People like winners .
That 88 percent of Democrats is going to be pretty demoralized when the November elections roll around if their party ca n’t get the job done .
But if the “ kitchen ” actually gets finished , and comprehensive health care reform passes , they ’ll be excited — and so , quite possibly , will the 56 percent of Independents who think Congress should press on .
We present the first two volumes ( out of 9 ) of the massive 2,200 page compendium that represents the just declassified examiner 's report in the Lehman bankruptcy case .
We will post the other volumes shortly .
Below are the key findings from a quick perusal of Anton Valukas ' report , which we will be combing through over the next week .
Pay particular attention to the Repo 105 scam which allows banks to materially misrepresent their leverage ratios whenever they so choose , thank you FASB , corrupt auditors ( in this case E&Y ) and Federal Reserve .
Some observations :
Lehman actively misrepresented its capital ratio with the benefit of Fed complicity , because instead of using traditional Repo transactions , it used " Repo 105 " which allowed repos to be treated as asset sales instead of financings .
Will someone please ask uberregulator
Fed how many other banks are using this borderline illegal accounting scheme RIGHT NOW to misrepresent their net leverage ratios ?
Lehman was forced to announce a quarterly loss of $ 2.8 billion – resulting from a combination of write ?
downs on assets , sales of assets at losses , decreasing revenues , and losses on hedges – it sought to cushion the bad news by trumpeting that it had significantly reduced its net leverage ratio to less than 12.5 , that it had reduced the net assets on its balance sheet by $ 60 billion , and that it had a strong and robust liquidity pool .
, that it had reduced the net assets on its balance sheet by $ 60 billion , and that it had a strong and robust liquidity pool .
Lehman did not disclose , however , that it had been using an accounting device ( known within Lehman as “ Repo 105 ” ) to manage its balance sheet – by temporarily removing approximately $ 50 billion of assets from the balance sheet at the end of the first and second quarters of 2008 .
In an ordinary repo , Lehman raised cash by selling assets with a simultaneous obligation to repurchase them the next day or several days later ; such transactions were accounted for as financings , and the assets remained on Lehman ’s balance sheet .
In a Repo 105 transaction , Lehman did exactly the same thing , but because the assets were 105 % or more of the cash received , accounting rules permitted the transactions to be treated as sales rather than financings , so that the assets could be removed from the balance sheet .
With Repo 105 transactions , Lehman ’s reported net leverage was 12.1 at the end of the second quarter of 2008 ; but if Lehman had used ordinary repos , net leverage would have to have been reported at 13.9
In an ordinary repo , Lehman raised cash by selling assets with a simultaneous obligation to repurchase them the next day or several days later ; such transactions were accounted for as financings , and the assets remained on Lehman ’s balance sheet . .
With Repo 105 transactions , Lehman ’s reported net leverage was 12.1 at the end of the second quarter of 2008 ; but if Lehman had used ordinary repos , net leverage would have to have been reported at 13.9 Lehman did not disclose its use – or the significant magnitude of its use – of Repo 105 to the Government , to the rating agencies , to its investors , or to its own Board of Directors .
Lehman ’s auditors , Ernst & Young , were aware of but did not question Lehman ’s use and nondisclosure of the Repo 105 accounting transactions .
[ And why should auditors question anything even remotely shady ?
After all they need to feed the monkey too . ]
The case for why the Fed would be a truly horrible systemic regulator .
Here is what happened at Lehman according to Valukas
Lehman decided to exceed the firm ?
wide risk appetite limit at several junctures .
First , though Lehman dramatically increased the limit for fiscal 2007 , Lehman nevertheless approached the new limit by May 2007 .
Then , in early October 2007 , when Lehman ’s risk appetite excesses were at their peak , at least some members of Lehman ’s senior management discussed the limit breaches and decided to grant a temporary reprieve from the limits based on the difficult conditions in the real estate and leveraged loan markets .
Rather than reduce its risk usage , Lehman cured its risk appetite overages by increasing the firm ?
wide risk appetite limit yet again .
The firm cooked its books :
Lehman also failed to apply its balance sheet limits in late 2007 .
Application of these limits would also have restricted Lehman ’s risk ?
taking .
Instead , Lehman dramatically increased the size of its balance sheet , and used increasingly large volumes of Repo 105 transactions to create the appearance that the firm ’s net leverage ratio remained within a reasonable range of such ratios established by the rating agencies .
The SEC was aware of the BS going on at Lehman :
Lehman ’s stress tests suffered from a significant flaw .
Although Lehman made a strategic decision in 2006 to take more principal risk , Lehman did not modify its stress tests to include the risks arising from many of its principal investments – including its real estate investments other than commercial mortgage backed securities ( “ CMBS ” ) , its private equity investments , and , during a crucial period , its leveraged loan commitments .
The SEC was aware that Lehman ’s stress tests excluded untraded investments and did not question the exclusion , because historically it had been the norm to limit stress tests only to traded positions .
The firm overindulged in speculative garbage LBO loan positions :
Lehman ’s principal investment strategy also included participating in leveraged loan transactions .
This business grew spectacularly in 2006 and the first half of 2007 .
Many of these loans were made to private equity firms , or sponsors , who were purchasing companies as part of leveraged buy ?
outs .
These transactions were risky for Lehman because they consumed tremendous amounts of capital , were made on terms that strongly favored the borrowers , and often involved bridge equity or bridge debt that Lehman hoped to distribute to other financial institutions ( but was committed to keep for itself if it was unable to do so ) .
Lastly , Lehman directors can sleep well .
Once again , nobody in the world is guilty for the biggest corporate bankruptcy in history :
The Examiner Does Not Find Colorable Claims That Lehman ’s Senior Officers Breached Their Fiduciary Duty to Inform the
Board of Directors Concerning the Level of Risk Lehman Had Assumed
Board of Directors Concerning the Level of Risk Lehman Had Assumed The Examiner Does Not Find Colorable Claims That Lehman ’s Directors Breached Their Fiduciary Duty by Failing to Monitor

Lehman ’s Risk ?
Taking Activities Lehman ’s Directors are Protected From Duty of Care Liability by the Exculpatory Clause and the Business Judgment Rule
Lehman ’s Directors Did Not Violate Their Duty of Loyalty
Lehman ’s Directors Did Not Violate Their Duty to Monitor
On the much prevalent conflict of interest of selling portfolios that one has originated ( especially as pertains to Goldman 's assorted CDOs held by AIG ) :
In one memorandum , Lehman ’s Head of Global Strategy expressed the concern that “ the team responsible for selling down these positions is the same one that originated them . ” 628 But several witnesses denied there was any incentive not to sell down the portfolio because they knew that no one in GREG would be getting a 2008 bonus
Attached are Volume one of the report ( just the first 240 pages , including the 45 page table of contents ) and Volume two .
We will upload the remainder shortly .
With no end in sight to the crisis – where do we go from here ?
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Last week ’s new unemployment numbers were bittersweet .
At the same time the Bureau of Labor Statistics was declaring that the unemployment rate had declined slightly , to 9.7 percent , the government also was announcing that the economy had lost about 824,000 more jobs during the recession from April 2008 to March 2009 than Americans previously had been told .
If this sounds like bureaucratic doublespeak , it is .
The government does n’t really know the exact number of people with or without jobs .
The number reported each month is based on surveys , and surveys often can have methodology issues .
As it turns out , the surveys estimating the number of people with jobs reported over the past couple of years suffered from some really big problems .
That ’s where government falsely claiming 824,000 more jobs than actually existed comes into play .
Unfortunately , those adjustments have so far been made only through March 2009 , and there are strong reasons to believe the survey data since then also need to be adjusted downward .
Economists measure the number of jobs two different ways : the establishment survey that asks about 370,000 employers how many people they are employing and the household survey that asks about 110,000 people each month whether they are working .
The establishment survey is often given more weight because about 40 million Americans work for the companies surveyed , a lot more than the 110,000 people interviewed in the other survey .
But 110,000 people still make up a huge sample ( a large survey for a presidential election might involve 2,000 to 3,000 people ) , and it is hard to ignore the results .
The household survey is also what is used to calculate the unemployment rate .
The problem is that the two surveys have reached different estimates , with the household survey showing a significantly greater drop in the number of jobs than the establishment survey .
It turns out that there might be a simple reason for that .
For the survey of firms , the list of firms surveyed does n’t change very often .
Thus , the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which puts these numbers together , can only guess at the number of jobs created by new firms because it does n’t even know how many new firms have been created each month .
To get around this gap in the data , the bureau makes an assumption that the jobs created at new companies are about equal to the jobs lost at companies that go out of business .
That assumption has n’t come close to being right during the current recession .
The error in estimating the number of jobs from April 2008 to March 2009 was 10 times greater than the average error over the preceding eight years .
Typically , the government error would underestimate the number of new jobs by 80,000 , but this time , it overestimated the number of jobs by more than 800,000 .
No one will know what the error rate has been with the establishment survey from April to December 2009 until the numbers are revised again in February 2011 , three months after the 2010 midterm elections .
But a great deal of skepticism seems warranted .
The establishment survey assumes that new firms generated almost a million new jobs over those nine months .
At the same time , the household survey just happens to show that about a million more jobs were lost than the survey of firms indicates .
The Obama administration has focused continually on the establishment survey in making its claims about changes in the jobs numbers , but this data can be quite misleading .
The bottom line is that job losses are likely to be worse than reported , not better .
Future jobs claims from the White House should be taken with a grain of salt .

When I was a kid , I always tried new things just for the heck of it .
I never thought about it too hard .
I simply went with the flow and followed my interests wherever they took me .
For example …
I spent one summer reading the encyclopedia all day because I was curious about all of the cool facts hidden in these massive tomes .

I spent hundreds of hours creating the ultimate Legend Of Zelda strategy guide on a typewriter .

I played Street Fighter II for 8 hours a day so I could beat all of my friends .
Street Fighter II for 8 hours a day so I could beat all of my friends .
I spent hours learning how to fold various animals out of square pieces of paper so I could entertain my friends ( origami )
No one ever told me to do these things and I did them out of pure enjoyment .
In fact , I never once gave these activities a second thought and my parents did n’t force me to do them either .
And the best part ?
If I did n’t feel like doing something anymore , I stopped .
I never wondered whether it was a good use of my time .
I never pontificated about how I could make any money from it .
I just did it .
So let me ask you this …
Do you remember back when you were a kid ?
Do you remember when you pursued an activity just because you loved it and not because you needed to earn money ?
Do you remember the last time you simply went with the flow and followed your interests ?

Becoming A Child Again
One of the biggest excuses that I hate hearing from ANYONE is that they “ do n’t have time ” to start a business .
If you look at my current lifestyle , I run an online store , a blog , an ecommerce course , a podcast and I work full time with 2 kids .
I ’ve had guests on my podcast who home school 7 kids while running multiple 6 figure businesses !
First off , I seriously doubt that you have no time to spare but that is besides the point .
You ’re clearly spending your time somewhere and the key is to figure out what you ’re doing with it .
And I ’m willing to bet that you ’ve found your passion already without realizing it .
Remember when you were a kid and you did n’t care ?
I ’m willing to bet that the kid inside of you still exists but you ’ve never tried to embrace it .
So question number one is how are you spending all of your leisure time ?
What do you enjoy doing that does n’t feel like work ?
Have you ever tried to do anything with it ?
Steve , I like playing video games all day .
Steve , I like reading romance novels whenever I have free time .
Steve , I like to eat out at restaurants .
How the hell can I turn this into a business ?
Well Have You Tried ?
First off , let ’s get this out of the way first .
Your problem is n’t about finding your passion .
The real problem lies with your priorities , your productivity and your confidence that you can actually make money doing what you enjoy .
So let ’s address these one by one .
Have you ever tried to do anything about your interests ?
to do anything about your interests ?
Have you ever tried to document your knowledge on a blog ?
to document your knowledge on a blog ?
Have you ever tried to express your opinion through a podcast or video ?
to express your opinion through a podcast or video ?
Have you ever tried to make your mind accessible to the outside world ?
If the answer is no to all of these questions , then sorry …
You have never tried to pursue your passion .
Period .
You ca n’t complain that your passion is worthless until you ’ve given it an honest try .
For example …
If you like playing video games all day , I ’m willing to bet that you ’re “ expert enough ” to influence other fellow gamers .
If you like eating out , then there ’s probably a group of people out there who want to know what you think about a particular restaurant or type of food .
If you are n’t sharing your knowledge , then start doing so and good things will happen .
The medium does n’t matter .
Just put yourself out there and document your thoughts .
Many Successful Entrepreneurs Are Created By Accident
As part of running my podcast , I ’ve interviewed many entrepreneurs who were successful simply because they put themselves out there with zero intention of making money .
Because they were passionate about what they were doing , they did n’t consider it work and money was never the motivation .
For example , my Stanford buddy Eric Cheng , who I interviewed in episode 67 , was passionate about underwater photography .
So he decided to throw up Wetpixel.com as an outlet for his hobby .
And within several years , he established the largest underwater photography community on the net .
Money started pouring in !
Recently , I interviewed Joe Jo of Just Kidding films in episode 94 .
Joe and his buddy Bart decided to put up goofy videos of themselves on YouTube for kicks .
They had no intention of making money .
They just loved being goofy on camera .
Fast forward to today and they make millions of dollars putting out videos that they would have produced regardless .
Pete Sveen ( episode 78 ) was passionate about doing woodworking projects around his house .
So he documented all of his projects on YouTube and now makes a 6 figure income doing so .
Large companies like Ryobi , QuickCrete and Gorilla Glue routinely sponsor his episodes for thousands of dollars !
I have countless examples of people like Eric , Joe and Pete and all you have to do is comb through my podcast archives for more !
Figuring Out Your Passions
Here ’s the funny thing about passion .
Sometimes you can’t figure it out unless you carefully analyze your actions and not your thoughts .
When I first started Bumblebee Linens with my wife , this is what I told her ( in so many words ) …
I have zero interest in selling handkerchiefs in the long run and you ’ll have to do most of the heavy lifting once we get the store off its feet .
But you know what happened ?
After the first few weeks , I found myself spending all of my free time learning how to design websites for fun .
After the website was done , I found myself reading books on marketing and sales in my spare time .
After we started getting some sales , I found myself doing research on handkerchiefs , linens and lace on my own volition .
I even learned how to sew !
Let me tell you this .
Engineering , marketing , sales , sewing and battenburg lace do n’t typically go together but I started loving it all !
Shortly afterwards , I created MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , an ecommerce course and a podcast too .
The rest is history !
Did I intentionally create a blog with the hopes of making 6 figures ?
Hell no !
It just happened on its own .
And to be honest , making 6 figures selling handkerchiefs online still sounds ridiculous .
And if you told me that I was going to make almost 700 K blogging this year ?
I would have slapped you silly .

Why Your Job Sucks
As an Asian male growing up in a tiger household , I know first hand why most people hate their jobs .
It ’s because most people ignore what they are interested in because they do n’t believe it ’s viable .
And most people are afraid to try .
It ’s like saying to yourself , “ Man I love battenburg lace wedding handkerchiefs but I better become a lawyer because that is what is going to pay the bills . ”
Then 3 years and 120 thousand dollars in debt later , you hate working 100 hour weeks and being a slave to your law firm partners .
By the way , I apologize to all of the lawyers out there .
It ’s just that out of all of my Asian friends , almost all of them hate being a lawyer .
If you hate your job , the REAL problem is that you are artificially limiting yourself to some preconceived notion about success that your Asian parent ( or society ) probably instilled in you !
Setting The Proper Expectations
So the million dollar question is can you really make a living doing what you love ?
Maybe yes , maybe no .
But there ’s nothing wrong with working a normal job while pursuing your passion on the side .
And if you truly love doing what you ’re doing , then you should n’t have any problems sharing it with the world .
The key is consistency .
Can you maintain a steady pace for an extended period ?
Can you push through the difficult times when you are bored and have no desire to continue ?
Here ’s the thing .
There ’s no such thing as a business or activity that you ’ll never get stressed over , never get bored over or never complain about .
Even though my ecommerce store , blog , course and podcast are successful , there are still times when I hate doing it .
But I just suck it up and keep on trucking .

Editor ’s note :
One of the first articles ever to appear on Truthdig was a dig led by Orville Schell , who asked the question “ China : Boom or Boomerang ? ”
Years later , with China ’s economy continuing to thrive amidst a global economic meltdown , the answer seems obvious .
But a boom to what end ?
China ’s rise is well documented , yet it remains one of the most misunderstood countries in the world .
China will soon become “ the most powerful and influential country in the world , ” says celebrated journalist Martin Jacques .
It is predicted that by 2050 , China ’s economy will be twice that of the United States .
What will Beijing do with all that power and influence ?
PART 1 : A Chinese Primacy in the Making Robert Scheer :
Hi , I ’m Robert Scheer , the editor of Truthdig.com , and as part of our commitment to dealing with books — our book review section , our interviews with authors — we think that books represent a vibrant source of information , the old media is still very relevant in the new - media world .
And it ’s actually a pleasure to talk about a book that in a very exciting way deals with a very important and complex subject : “ When China Rules the World ” by Martin Jacques , who is a well - known writer , and particularly in England , where he writes for the Guardian newspaper and has covered international affairs .
So , my first question : “ When China Rules the World : The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order . ”
Are you some kind of agent provocateur ?
This is to sell books ?
You do n’t believe this , do you ?
Martin Jacques :
Of course China will not rule the world any more than the United States has ruled the world for the last 60 years , or Britain before .
But I think China will , in time , become the most powerful and influential country in the world , and that ’s what I mean by ruling the world .
Scheer :
Why do you feel this ?
Because there are people who feel , oh , this is just a bubble , and they ’ll blow away , and all they make are T - shirts , and where ’s their imagination , and they ’ll never be able to design , and so forth .
Jacques :
The thing is that for the last 30 years , China has had a hugely impressive economic performance .
It ’s been growing double - digit growth , the size of the economy doubling every seven years , and they ’re responsible for the greatest reduction in poverty the world ’s ever seen .
And the consequence of this is that China is now a rapidly growing economy , projected by Goldman Sachs figures to overtake the size of the American economy in 2027 , which is not so far ahead .
And this is obviously more speculative , but by 2050 it will have an economy which is twice the size of that of the United States .
Scheer :
But why use the word rule ?
You know , “ When China Rules the World ” ?
Do you mean it in the sense that they will take over , they will tell us what to do ?
Jacques :
No , but I mean it in this sense : that when a country of power becomes globally hegemonic , it basically sets the rules .
It designs the major institutions .
It has a huge reach , not just economically , but politically , culturally , intellectually , morally , militarily .
Look at the United States and the way in which — or the West in general , before that Europe — have really set the tone of the world , the agenda for the world , overwhelmingly .
Very few other countries have had a real look - in in that period .
Now , the rise of China will see the same sort of phenomena , I think , which is that China will increasingly set the rules for the world , if you like .
Scheer : Yeah , but the Chinese are in many ways becoming more like us .
Would these rules really be so very different ?
I just read a story where the amount of English used in China now approaches the level of India , which is amazing , given that English was there in India because of their colonial experience , and that in China it ’s pretty difficult to make the transition from Mandarin to English , and yet they ’re getting the numbers even on that .
Wo n’t they be looking very much like us ?
What about the theory that the nation - state will disappear , that it does n’t matter where the center of economic activity is ?
We ’ll all pretty much even look alike through plastic surgery , we ’ll watch the same movies , we ’ll think the same way , we ’ll have the same kind of , sort of democratic order , is n’t that the expectation ?
Jacques :
No , I think this is , to be quite blunt about it , balderdash .
I mean , it ’s certainly true that the Chinese are learning English , but they do n’t learn it to speak in China , they learn it to speak with foreigners who speak English ; it ’s an interlocutor language .
And we should n’t forget that twice as many people speak Chinese in the world as speak English as a first or second language .
And while it ’s certainly true that China has learned heavily from the West over the past 30 years in terms of technology , in terms of markets and so on , at the same time it remains profoundly different .
And this is the point about modernization .
People think of it as a process of Westernization .
Well , maybe in part it is a process of Westernization , but only in part .
Because modernization is also shaped by history and culture , so if your history and culture is very distinct and very different from that of the West , which in the case of China it most certainly is , the result will be a very different kind of society , a very different kind of identity .
There is a classic example , actually ; we do n’t have to look very far , because it ’s embedded in history : Japan .
People think of Japan sometimes as a Western - style society ; this is not true .
Japan is profoundly different from the West .
It ’s got very different political and cultural characteristics ; it works in a very different way , even though it is , on the face of it , to be Western .
You go to Japan , you immediately know :
This is very different .
Scheer : Right .
And China , as you ’ve written , will likely be even more so .
You stress in your writing the thousands of years of Chinese history , that this is not kidding around , and it ’s not just because the Communist Party happens to be in power — that there ’s the notion of the state , the notion of the responsibility to the citizen , that goes back .
Do you want to talk about that a little bit ?
We seem to miss that .
Jacques : Yeah .
Well , I think — the bedrock idea , I think , in trying to understand China — you ca n’t understand China using Western concepts alone , or even mainly .
China dates back at least 2,000 years to the victory of the Qin at the end of the Warring States Period , when it began to assume , roughly , its present borders , at least on the eastern part of China .
So it has a 2,000 - year history , and it is that 2,000 - year history which defines the Chinese sense of identity — you know , the ideographic language , Confucian values , very distinctive idea of the family , and so on .
So the Chinese sense of who they are comes not from the nation - state period — which is just the last hundred years , which is nothing in terms of Chinese history — but comes from 2,000 years ago .
And the result is that the way China works , and the institutions that China possesses , are defined by this extraordinary history and the sheer vastness and diversity of the country .
So , for example , the state is a very different kind of institution , I think , in China , to what it is in Western countries .
Essentially , the state is seen by the Chinese as the custodian , the guardian , the embodiment of the civilization , the civilization - state .
And for that reason it enjoys much greater authority , much greater legitimacy than any Western state does amongst its people , even though not a single vote is cast .
Scheer :
Well , votes are cast , but they ’re not cast for the top . …
Jacques :
Well , they ’re not cast in a way that ’s familiar to us , that ’s for sure .
Scheer : Yeah .
Well , let ’s talk about that a bit , because this is probably the most provocative notion that I think you ’re putting forth : that we do n’t own the franchise on the modern model .
Or the democratic model , or the freedom model , or the human rights model .
And you ’re arguing — and this scares people , because they think you ’re going to start justifying tyranny , and you ’re going to start rationalizing , you know , for maltreating people and so forth .
But you have suggested in your writing that maybe they have the capacity to come up with something different that may also be better in some respects .
Jacques :
It will be different , that ’s for certain .
And I think in some respects — I mean , it ’s very difficult to know , because one is projecting so much into the future — but I would imagine that in some respects it will be better .
Maybe in some respects it will be worse .
But in some respects I think it will be different .
I think the idea that the West has a monopoly of all things that are good and wise , and everyone else is still sort of in a form of barbarianism , and as they develop they ’ll become like the West — I think this is a very hubristic way of thinking .
I think every culture , or most cultures in the world , have their own bit of genius , their own bit of wisdom .
Values like accountability , representivity , tolerance are not Western values alone .
Most cultures have , in some way , embodied them .
And there ’s no doubt at all that there ’s some fine values in the Chinese tradition .
What one has to distinguish , I think , is between — it ’s dangerous to compare a developing country with a developed country .
And this is constantly — we insist that the developing world is like the developed world , that we measure them by the same standards of human rights , of democracy , and so on .
But in fact they ’re in very different situations , very different circumstances to us .
I mean , when we went through our industrial revolutions — the United States , the European countries — we were n’t democratic .
We did n’t have universal suffrage .
So why do we insist that they have the same standards as we do now when we did n’t have them at their level of development ?
So we need to be historical rather than ahistorical about it .

– KAUFEN ! – Sterben . "

Anstöße aus politischen und kulturellen Szenen der Landeshauptstadt von NRW
Wir hätten gerne etwas Aufmunterung .
Der Winter war jetzt lang genug .
Die Heizkosten haben den kleinen Geldbeutel sehr belastet , und bei der politischen Eiszeit im Land weiß man angesichts all der Schamlosigkeiten im Einzelfall nicht immer , ob man sich amüsieren oder entsetzen soll .
Dass deutsche Kriegsverbrechen im öffentlichen Diskurs vor allem unter dem Gesichtspunkt der " strategischen Angemessenheit " zur Sprache kommen und sich das Parlament ein Opfergedenken verbietet , ist jedenfalls nicht lustig .
Dass das Entwicklungshilfeministerium unter gegnerischer Übernahme militarisiert wird , finden selbst einige bürgerliche Kritiker nicht gut .
So genannte Intellektuelle mit denkbar gutem Auskommen und Politiker , die bislang vor allem für ihr eigenes Wohlergehen erfolgreich agiert haben , blasen unverdrossen zur Hatz auf die Besitzlosen .
Auch geschickt verpackter Rassismus ist unter den feinen Herren , die von Weltbürgertum nichts mehr wissen wollen , wieder hoffähig .
Neuerdings sind sogar akademische Anstiftungen zu einer " Klassen - Eugenetik " zu vernehmen ( Das unwerte Hartz IV - Leben ) .
Die SPD will derweil mit aller Gewalt unter Beweis stellen , wie hartnäckig der schröderianische Rechts - und Selbstmordkurs die Partei wirklich verändert hat .
Ihr sicherheitspolitischer Sprecher im Parlament findet die unaufhörliche Explosion der deutschen Kriegswaffenexporte keineswegs verwerflich .
Der anschwellende Klassenkampf von oben ist für die Sozialdemokratie kein dringendes Thema .
Eine Vizevorsitzende preist den " gemeinnützigen " Einsatz von Erwerbslosen als Lebenshilfe an .
In der sich " liberal " nennenden FDP wird ein spießiger , autoritärer und populistischer Ton angegeben ( wir sparen uns an dieser Stelle den Namen des maßgeblichen Programmdirektors ) .
Gesundheitsminister Philipp Rösler , Mitglied im Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken , spricht angesichts der gesellschaftlichen Belastung durch astronomische Pharmaprofite die aussichtsreichsten Lösungsstrategien erst gar nicht an und hält unverdrossen an seinen Weichenstellungen für eine noch viel schärfere Zweiklassenmedizin fest .
Die Kette der Enthüllungen über Gewalt gegen Kinder und Jugendliche – vor allem im Raum der röm . - kath .
Kirche – bricht nicht ab , doch eine unabhängige Untersuchungskommission nach dem Vorbild anderer Länder ist von der CDU - dominierten Bundesregierung immer noch nicht eingerichtet worden ( der in Medienberichten immer noch auftauchende Terminus " Missbrauch " suggeriert , es gehe um Handlungen an " Dingen " , die man ansonsten auch richtig " gebrauchen " könne ) .
Dass politische
Macht ausleihbar , mietbar und käuflich ist , darf man in diesen Tagen so offen wie schon lange nicht mehr aussprechen .
Doch was nützt das in einer Zeit , in der selbst kritische Politthriller mit Echtzeitdrehbuch keinen Kinoskandal mehr auslösen ? …
Ohne Zweifel , die " geistig - politische Wende " in der herrschenden Moral ist voll im Schwange .
Auf der Gegenseite , so scheint es zumindest , bestreiten vor allem depressive oder humorlose Linke das Feld .
Das sollte uns angesichts der real existierenden Medienmachtverhältnisse nicht besonders verwundern .
Vielleicht ist es an der Zeit , den Blick einmal auf Dinge zu lenken , die nach vorherrschenden Maßstäben unbedeutend und gering sind ?
Als Theologiestudent habe ich vor vielen Jahren in einem Pastoralhandbuch das folgende Gedicht des Griechen Jannis Ritsos ( 1909 - 1990 ) gelesen : " Jeder Mensch / hat einen Himmel / über seiner Wunde / und einen kleinen / gesetzwidrigen Frühlingszettel / in seiner Tasche . "
Wenn das geistige Leben einer Gesellschaft winterlich geworden ist , brauchen wir die subversiven Denkzettel sichtbar im öffentlichen Raum .
Ich möchte einige davon vorstellen , die man an meinem Wohnort Düsseldorf entdecken kann .
Ich beginne mit einem persönlichen Favoriten .
Im späten Frühling 2009 tauchten – zunächst nur an einigen Straßenecken – längliche Aufkleber auf mit der Botschaft : " Arbeiten – KAUFEN ! – Sterben . "
Die einfache Grafik dazu zeigte Menschen mit Standardbekleidung und Einkaufswagen auf einem Fließband , welches am Ende in eine Müllgrube bzw .
ins Leere führt .
Die Botschaft war in kurzer Zeit überall zu lesen .
In welchen Stadtteil man auch kam , der Aufkleber war schon da .
Das Material ist wetterfest , deshalb hängt er noch immer an zahllosen Laternen , Containern und geeigneten Flächen jeglicher Art .
Ich war damals spontan begeistert : " Das ist doch mal was .
Wer steckt dahinter ? "
Über Rückfragen in der jungen Politszene erhielt ich eine Spur , der ich aber erst am vergangenen Sonntag nachgehen konnte .
" Jonathan " , der Urheber des subversiven Frühlingszettels , kam zu Besuch .
Er ist 22 Jahre alt , ausgebildeter Industriehandwerker und Kollegschüler .
Erst nach fünf Stunden voller anregender Dispute sind wir auf den Frühlingszettel , das eigentlich vorgesehene Thema , zu sprechen gekommen .
Die Grafik , so erfuhr ich , ist ein eher zufälliger Internet - Fund .
Die drei Wörter dazu standen als Assoziation sofort im Raum .
Das Ganze kam – etwas verpixelt – in eine PDF - Datei und wurde in 2000 Exemplaren gedruckt .
Die Kosten des Aufklebers ( 118 Euro ) hat sich Jonathan mit einem Freund geteilt .
Für BAföG - Bezieher keine kleine Investition .
Die erste Ausbreitungswelle in der Stadt erfolgte mit Hilfe von Freunden und Bekannten .
Schon bald verselbständigte sich die Sache ( Jonathan : " ich habe mich immer wieder gewundert , an wie vielen Stellen die wieder auftauchten , auf Schultornistern , Ordnern … " ) .
Eine Mitschülerin sagte zu Jonathan : " Ich hab ’ voll was Geiles ! "
Dann zeigte sie ihm auf dem Handy den Frühlingszettel , den sie in der Stadt entdeckt und fotografiert hatte .
Ein Handwerksmeister brachte den Aufkleber unter Protest der Ehefrau an seinem Firmenwagen an .
Über Freunde wanderte die Botschaft nach Saarbrücken und Berlin oder gar bis nach Belgien und England .
Ein Passant , den eine Freundin von Jonathan beim Abknibbeln ertappt hatte , rechtfertigte sich kleinlaut : " Ich wollte doch nur auch so einen Aufkleber haben . "
Schließlich gab es hier und da Abwandlungen zu sehen .
Ich verrate nicht die Vollversion .
Lassen Sie ihrer Phantasie freien Lauf : " Arbeitslos . XXXXXX ! Leben . "
Wo liegt das Erfolgsrezept ?
Der wirklich allüberall anzutreffende Frühlingszettel war irgendwie auch eine Karikatur der Orwellschen Allgegenwart bestimmter Werbebotschaften .
Doch es steht keine Gruppe nebst Logo drauf , die FÜR SICH wirbt .
Es wird auch keine der abgedroschenen und hehren Handlungsparolen aufgegriffen ( " Zerschlagt die Strukturen … " etc. ) .
Es gibt keinen ethischen Verweigerungsappell .
Es kommt nur etwas zur Sprache bzw .
ins Bild , und auch hierbei fehlt der moralische Unterton des klassischen Vorbildes " Memento mori " ( Bedenke dein Sterben ! ) .
Gewiß , wer mehr oder weniger als Konsumist funktioniert , wird die Trias " Arbeiten .
– KAUFEN ! – Sterben . " als ärgerlich , verunsichernd oder deprimierend empfinden .
Aber warum wirkt die Botschaft auf viele Suchende , die doch auch sterben müssen , heiter ?
Vielleicht , weil dem Schöpfer des Aufklebers an einem lustvollen Leben gelegen ist ?
Er hält den Kult um Warenfetische für einen " Ersatz - Hedonismus " , der ihm jedenfalls keinen Spaß bereiten kann .
Teure Klamotten und ein luxuriöses
Handy sind für ihn nicht attraktiv .
Er benutzt keine natürlichen oder synthetischen Glücksrauschstoffe , seien sie legal oder illegalisiert .
Aber auch hier liegt es ihm fern , zu moralisieren oder andere zu missionieren .
Das macht es für mich glaubwürdig , dass es ihm um gutes Leben und nicht um Verzicht oder um die selbstverliebte Verwirklichung einer " höheren Ethik " geht .
Die heimliche Anfrage des Frühlingszettels lautet : " Eros oder totes Haben ? "
" Konsum ist Gehorsam "
In der linken Szene gab es nun durchaus auch vereinzelt Kritik am Aufkleber .
Die Genügsamkeit des Wassertrinkens wird ja derzeit allerorten von denen gepredigt , die einen herrlich ausgestatteten Weinkeller haben ( Jonathan ist unbedingt für leckere Genüsse , nur muss es eben kein Wein sein ) .
Was soll , so überlege ich selbst , die mir bekannte Mutter , die ihren sterbenden Sohn im fernen Hospiz im Rahmen des " Hartz IV - Budgets " nur selten besuchen konnte , mit der Botschaft anfangen ?
Ein Kritiker hat gegenüber Jonathan auch geltend gemacht , dass eine Abgrenzung zur plakativen Konsumkritik aus der rechten Ecke und die " konstruktive Kritik " fehlten .
Nur , wo hat uns bislang die wohl abgewogene , allseits differenzierte , " konstruktive " oder hochmoralische Kritik auf überladenen Flugblättern und " Spuckis " wirklich weitergebracht ?
Die Friedensbewegung etwa legt gründliche Dossiers und Analysen vor ( die offenkundig nur von wenigen Journalisten zur Kenntnis genommen werden ) .
Doch es fehlen ihr derzeit das ausdrucksstarke Bild und die ansteckende Parole .
Vielleicht erhellt eine andere Aktion , die Jonathan mit Freunden an einem verkaufsoffenen Sonntag in der Adventszeit 2009 unternommen hat , etwas von der politischen Dimension des Aufklebers .
Von der höchsten Etage eines Kaufhauses ließen sie viele hundert Schnipsel mit der Aufschrift " Konsum ist Gehorsam " herunterflattern ( Aktionskosten etwa 5 Euro ) .
Die Leute versuchten – sofern das die Einkaufstaschen in ihren Händen zuließen – einen der Zettel zu ergattern .
Ein älteres Paar geriet in eine angeregte Diskussion .
Direkte Banknachbarn der Kommunikationsakteure auf der Empore packten die Zettel aber trotz aller Neugierde nicht an .
Sie witterten wohl etwas Verbotenes .
Warum lassen sich Menschen , die selbst für ein auskömmliches Leben kämpfen müssen , gegen andere , noch schlechter Gestellte aufhetzen ?
Warum kann eine Politik , die objektiv die Mehrheit der Menschen zu Verlierern macht , bezogen auf den größten Teil der Bevölkerung auf äußere Repression verzichten ?
Warum kommen Experimente wie die Bewegung der Umsonstläden zumindest langfristig in Bedrängnisse , wenn eine große Zahl von Nutzern an der herrschenden Bereicherungs - " Logik " festhält ?
Der Gehorsam , die passive Seite der Macht - Medaille , sitzt in den Köpfen fest .
Was nützen Schneidbrenner , die dicke Eisenketten sprengen können , wenn das Gefängnis sich unsichtbar in unserem Inneren breit gemacht hat ?
Gehorsam ist käuflich .
Käuflich werden wir , wenn unser Glücksbegehren außengelenkt ist , ohne dass wir dies merken .
Das hohle Heilsversprechen des Konsums angesichts unserer Sterblichkeit hat viel damit zu tun , denn die geheime Angst vor dem Tod und vor dem ewigen Zukurzkommen korrumpiert uns .
Der Slogan des Aufklebers könnte auch lauten : " Arbeiten .
FUNKTIONIEREN !
Sterben . "
Woran krankt die Linke ?
Sie versucht es noch immer ziemlich unvermittelt mit einer ehrenwerten politischen Ethik .
Das schöne Leben aber , zu dem unbedingt eine innere Freiheit gehört , kommt auf diese Weise noch gar nicht zur Ansicht .
Das Sonntagsgespräch mit Jonathan bekräftigt mich übrigens in der Überzeugung , dass auch Weltanschauungen vorzugsweise zum Modus des Habens gehören können und dann nur tote Kommunikationsversuche hervorbringen .
Wir besitzen unsere Raster als Sicherheiten und merken überhaupt nicht , dass wir in Begegnungen über das angstgetriebene Selbstgespräch gar nicht mehr hinauskommen .
Als Linkskatholik werde ich z.B. von orthodoxen Linken gerne mal mit ( zumeist langweiliger ) Aufklärung in Sachen " Religionskritik " beglückt .
Mein sonntäglicher Besucher , der sich als Anarchist bezeichnet , verschonte mich mit derlei missionarischen Belehrungen .
Ich offenbarte ihm z.B. , dass zwischen meiner Kopfethik und meinem Fleischeinkauf bei Discountern ein riesiger Widerspruch besteht .
Er ließ das als Veganer (! ) ganz unkommentiert .
Auch hier kein Missionierungsversuch .
Ich weiß ja selbst , dass ich mein Leben an dieser Stelle ( und anderswo ) ändern muss .
Die glühende " Mörder ! " - Anklage einer jungen antifaschistischen Tierschützerin hat mir bezüglich einer Umsetzung von guten Vorsätzen allerdings noch nicht weitergeholfen .
Spätabends fühle ich mich noch bemüßigt , ein Bekenntnis zu den Errungenschaften der bürgerlichen Revolution abzulegen ( die Heiligsprechung des Privateigentums ausgenommen ) .
Es gehört ja schließlich zu meinen Überzeugungen , dass die Ehrenrettung des " Liberalismus " nur von links kommen kann .
Mit einer ruhigen Anmerkung macht mein Gegenüber mir klar , dass solch ein ideales Bekenntnis angesichts der uns umgebenden Wirklichkeit nicht unbedingend jedem einleuchtend erscheinen muss .
" Der Inhalt Deines täglichen Lebens "
Beim Sonntagsgespräch haben wir natürlich auch über das Internet gesprochen .
Als Initiator eines Mundartarchivs bin ich hoch erfreut darüber , dass Jonathan – als Vertreter der Internetgeneration – von guten Aussichten für Sprachplattformen und regionale Kulturlandschaften spricht .
Was lässt sich nicht alles erträumen in einer globalen Netzkultur , die anstelle von Einheitscodes einem Eros der Kommunikation
Wege bahnt , in dem gerade das Vielfältige , Fremde und Gegensätzliche ins Gespräch kommen ?
Nur , wo steht der neuzeitliche Individualismus , hinter den wir nicht mehr zurück wollen ?
Zeigt er sich vor allem als Vereinzelung , in welcher letztlich doch eine strukturelle Fremdbestimmung waltet ?
Oder geht es in Richtung einer Individualisierung , die eigensinnige Persönlichkeiten in beziehungsreichen Lebensnetzen – mit anderen Menschen – hervorbringt ?
Jonathan unterscheidet sehr klar zwischen den nützlichen , instrumentellen Möglichkeiten des Internets für politische Bewegungen und dem Vorrang leibhaftiger menschlicher Beziehungen .
Sich von Mensch zu Mensch – auf gleicher Augenhöhe – zu begegnen , das ist es ja gerade , was ein Medienkonzern oder ein anderer großer Apparat nicht kann .
Und wie steht es um die Berechtigung kulturkonservativer Anfragen ?
Kann man ein moderner Mediennutzer sein und trotzdem gleichzeitig die Welt der virtuellen Abstraktionen und Illusionen auch skeptisch betrachten ?
Birgt eine Digitalisierung , in der sich leibhaftiges Leben mit allen Widersprüchen und Freuden auflöst , nicht ungeheure Potenzen der Angsteinflößung , Machtausübung und Fremdbestimmung ?
Vor einigen Jahren war in Düsseldorf insbesondere an vielen Haltestellen eine Wandzeitung angeklebt , die sich noch in meinem Archiv befindet .
Auch hier gab es kein Impressum , das auf eine einschlägige Gruppe hinwies .
Das kopierte Blatt war tunlichst über oder neben den Fahrplänen aufgehängt ( Jonathan hat mich am Sonntag darüber aufgeklärt , dass kein halbwegs gescheiter Kommunikationsaktivist Fahrpläne zukleben würde ) .
Unter der Überschrift " Der Inhalt Deines täglichen Lebens ? " stellte diese Wandzeitung folgende Fragen an die Passanten :
Wie viele Stunden am Tag verbringst Du vor einem Fernsehschirm ?
Einem Bildschirm ?
Einer Windschutzscheibe ?
Vor allen zusammen ?
Von was wirst Du abgeschirmt ?
Wie viele Dinge im Alltag kommen nur imitiert durch einen Bildschirm bei Dir an ?
Ist es genauso aufregend Dingen zuzusehen als sie zu erleben …?
Wer oder was kontrolliert Deine Stunden und Minuten ?
Die Minuten und Stunden Deines Lebens ?
Sparst Du Zeit ?
Für was ?
Kannst
Du einen wunderschönen
Tag wertschätzen , an dem die Vögel singen und die Leute einfach nur durch die Gegend schlendern ? …
Wie viel weißt
Du über das , was Du isst , und wo es herkommt ?
Wie sehr vertraust Du diesem Essen ?
Was wird uns entzogen durch arbeitssparende Maschinen ?
Durch gedankensparende Maschinen ?
Wie beeinflusst Dich der Drang nach Effizienz ?
Dass mehr
Wert auf das Produkt als auf den Prozess gelegt wird , mehr Wert auf die Zukunft als auf die Gegenwart ? …
Wie fühlst Du Dich , an einen
Ort gebunden zu sein und bereits verplant zu sein ? …
Wie viel Bewegungsfreiheit hast Du? Die Freiheit , Dich durch den Raum zu bewegen , so weit weg wie Du willst und in neue und unentdeckte Bereiche einzudringen ? … Sind Freude und Lust gefährlich ? … Hast Du jemals das Verlangen , den Himmel zu sehen ?
( Kannst Du noch Sterne an ihm sehen ? )
Hast du jemals das Verlangen , Blätter zu sehen , Tiere oder einfach nur Wasser ?
Wie es glitzert , schimmert und sich bewegt ? …
Oder sind Fernsehen und Videofilme Dein Glitzern , Schimmern und Deine Bewegungen ? …
Wäre Dein Leben ein Film , würdest Du ihn Dir ansehen ? … Brauchst
Du manchmal die Einsamkeit , die Stille , das Nachdenken ?
Erinnerst Du Dich daran , wie es ist , für sich selbst zu denken , anstatt nur stimuliert zu werden , um zu reagieren ? …

Single ladies strip off for love ( chinadaily.com.cn )

Eight single ladies looking for love took their search to the subway station holding the popular internet catchphrase " Believe in Sister Feng , be more confident " while handing out marriage request leaflets to passers - by in Guangzhou , capital of South China 's Guangdong province on March 8 , 2010 .
The girls removed some of their clothing in an attempt to attract attention .
For much of the 2010 Winter Olympics , there has been a North - America - against - the - world vibe .
Canadian fans have carried " Go North America " signs to venues , cheered wildly when Americans were in medal contention and have started or joined in chants of " U - S - A ! U - S - A ! "
U.S. athletes have called Vancouver their " home away from home . "
" I think the Americans and Canadians were rooting for each other 's teams a little bit , and that 's a special memory for me , " said Billy Demong , the first American to win a medal in the Nordic combined .
The North American love has produced some tender moments .
That ends today when Canada and the United States face off for the gold medal in men's hockey .
Canadians , who almost seem embarrassed to show national pride , do n't mess around when it comes to their national sport .
As Michael J. Fox says in a Winter Olympics commercial , " For Canadians , hockey is n't just a game , it 's our game . "
Here , every kid wants to be Sid the Kid .
" Hockey is not a sport in Canada ; it 's a cult , it 's a religion , " U.S. general manager Brian Burke said .
The North American brothers and sisters can go back to holding hands Monday .
" Canada 's been looking forward to this for what , eight years , since they announced that the Olympics would be on their home soil ? "
U.S. goalie Ryan Miller said after Saturday 's practice .
" Whatever happens is going to be remembered here for a long time . "
Canada entered this tournament with a decisive 10 - 2 - 3 edge on the United States in Olympic hockey games .
There is much talk about payback for the U.S. loss to Canada in the gold - medal game in Salt Lake City in 2002 .
Sell it all you want , but it 's just not that important to most of the United States .
It is everything to Canadians .
This is the most anticipated event in Canadian sports history , with Nos. 2 and 3 on the list being Canada 's games against the United States and Russia earlier in these Games .
" Here 's an opportunity of a lifetime and you want to make good on it , " Canada coach Mike Babcock said .
" That 's what everyone came to these Olympics for . "
Like most of the players , Babcock compared today 's game to a Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals .
He has coached in three of those , and says the pressure is a good thing .
His players feel it .
" People are saying it 's more intense , it 's more emotional , but if you take away all those things , it 's the same game , " Sid the Kid Crosby said .
What ?
Take away the intensity and the emotion , and you 've got just another hockey game ?
Well , that we wo n't have today , because of where we are .
This U.S. team , the youngest in the tournament at an average age of 26 1/2 , is n't stocked with unknowns like the 1980 squad .
This team has 23 established NHL players .
They are n't afraid of the moment , as they showed in a 5 - 3 win over the Canadians in round robin play .
And better yet , they have the best playing goalie in Miller , who has allowed five goals in five games ( 108 shots ) .
" For a lot of our young guys , it 's a chance to make their mark in history , " U.S. defenseman Brian Rafalski said .
" It 's a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity . "
With most of the pressure on their formerly friendly hosts .
Pressure can be a good thing .
It did n't help Canada when the teams played last week , but after what they describe as a wake - up call , the Canadians are playing a far more physical game than they did then .
" They tried to skill us to death , " U.S. forward David Backes said .
Said U.S. coach Ron Wilson : " We 're not going to be retreating . "
He said the team relied too much on Miller in that game , but not today .
With years of anticipation building to this moment , Canada will fight if it has to .
Today 's game
Who : U.S. vs. Canada
What : Gold - medal game

One bad pass by Peyton Manning has n't cost the Indianapolis Colts any cachet .
Manning and the Colts are favored to win next year 's Super Bowl , according to odds released Monday by BetUS.com .
Indianapolis is a 7 - 1 favorite to take home the NFL championship , followed by the San Diego Chargers ( 8 - 1 ) , New Orleans Saints ( 9 - 1 ) and the New England Patriots ( 10 - 1 ) .
The St. Louis Rams , coming off a 1 - 15 season , are the longest shot on the board at 150 - 1 .
The Colts were 5 - point favorites in the Super Bowl on Sunday , but Drew Brees and the Saints rallied for a 31 - 17 victory .
New Orleans sealed the upset when Tracy Porter intercepted Manning 's pass and returned it for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter .
Indianapolis is 3 - 1 to get back to the Super Bowl , while New Orleans is 5 - 1 .
In America , political power resides predominately in the business sector , whose economic interests are first and foremost on the minds of both major parties .
The Democrats have less naked loyalty to corporations , but their offices are funded , lobbied and coerced nonstop by businesses that hold stake in government affairs .
For a demonstration of this power relationship , look no further than today ’s news , which tells us that a “ business coalition ” is launching a massive advertising campaign against proposed health care reforms .
The ads , which are targeted to key Congressional districts , will cost up to $ 10 million .
Meanwhile , on the Left , a few thousand people held a picket in D.C. to support existing proposals ( though many advocated their expansion , too ) .
The picket was combined with a coordinated assault of sharply - worded letters to local representatives .
This is a roughly typical display of the disparity in resources and organizing power that separates the Right ( Business ) and the Left ( Labor ) .
It explains why the health care legislation process has been a gradual narrowing of reform , and it explains why the preferred option of the American population – a government - guaranteed health care system – was rejected before negotiations even began .
ere he developed with care , lucidity , and comprehensive sweep his fundamental message about the crucial role of the people who remain unknown in carrying forward the endless struggle for peace and justice , and about the victims of the systems of power that create their own versions of history and seek to impose it .
In wind - whipped tents , makeshift shelters and overcrowded family compounds , Afghans who fled the battleground town of Marja are asking themselves and one another :
When will it be safe to go home ?
Since the start this month of a massive assault by U.S. Marines and British and Afghan troops on the southern Afghan town , nearly 4,000 families have sought shelter in nearby Lashkar Gah , the capital of Helmand province .
By the calculation generally used by aid agencies -- six people per family , though many are far larger -- that would add up to at least 24,000 people , nearly one - third of the town ’s population .
The figure takes into account only those who have officially registered as displaced ; thousands of others are thought to be undocumented .
Many fled with only scant possessions , hoping the fighting that erupted Feb. 13 would end quickly .
“ People want to find a way to go back , ” said Ghulam Farooq Norzai , who heads of the directorate of displaced people in Helmand province .
“ They left everything behind : homes , livestock , farms . ”

The Western military says residents are beginning to trickle home , which it counts as a vote of confidence in the government ’s pledge to establish rule of law and restore long - vanished public services in the town , which was for years a Taliban haven .
But many of the Marja refugees are hesitating , fearful of roadside bombs , Taliban stragglers and continuing battles between insurgents and coalition troops .
“ People were very hopeful at first ; they thought the offensive would take a few days , ” said Mohammed Anwar , whose 15 - member clan is sharing a cold , cramped house in Lashkar Gah with four other displaced families .
“ But there is no hope of going back until one side or the other is in complete control . ”
The clashes have steadily diminished , though firefights still flare and tracts of the town remain minefields .
On Wednesday , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reported fewer engagements with insurgents over the previous 24 hours .
But commanders have said that clearing operations could take another month .

For agricultural families , the great majority of the town ’s residents , each passing day is a countdown to ruin .
Worry beads click as farmers envision their crops dying , livestock scattered or starving , irrigation ditches choked with debris .
Still , many believe their decision to flee may have saved their lives .
NATO says 16 civilians have been killed in the offensive , but the Afghanistan Human Rights Commission on Wednesday put the civilian death toll at 28 , of whom 13 were children .
At least 70 people have been hurt , the group said .
Although most of the displaced have access to food and at least rudimentary shelter , the privations are beginning to grate .
Kinship dictates that a family must take in fleeing relatives without question .
But many people in rural Helmand already live at the subsistence level , so host families and their guests alike face growing hardship .
“ Most people find relatives who can at least give them one room to share , but it ’s hard for both families , ” said Mohammad Hussain Haider , who fled Marja with his wife and five children .
“ It ’s winter , and people ran away without warm clothing and other necessary things . ”

Afghan officials expect the refugee exodus to reverse , but do not know when .
“ If there were no threat , people would go home immediately , ” said Norzai .
“ But it will take time . ”

Well , PyCon is over and it's time to get back to work .
First , I 'd just like to thank everyone who came to my GIL Talk and participated in all of the discussion that followed .
It was almost as if part of PyCon had turned into a mini operating systems conference !
This post is a followup to the GIL open space at PyCon where we looked at the new GIL and explored the possibility of introducing thread priorities .
For those of you not at PyCon , the open space was attended by about 30 - 40 people and included Guido , Antoine Pitrou , and a large number of systems hackers , some of which had previously worked on thread library implementations and operating system kernels .
First , a little background .
As might know , Antoine Pitrou implemented a new Python GIL that is currently only available in the Python 3.2 development branch ( you can obtain it via subversion ) .
This new GIL is described in his original mailing list post as well as the slides for my PyCon talk .
You should read those first if you have n't already .
Right before PyCON , I discovered an I/O performance problem with the new GIL that is related to CPU - bound threads stalling the progress of I / O bound threads which it turn leads to a severe performance degradation of I/O bandwidth and response time .
This is described in Issue 7946 : Convoy effect with I/O bound threads and New GIL .
In the bug report , I submitted a very simple test case that illustrated the problem .
However , here is a more refined experiment that you can try .
The following program , iotest .py contains both CPU - bound threads and an I/O server thread that echos UDP packets .
It is meant to study the case in which CPU - processing and I/O processing are overlapped .
# iotest.py import time import threading from socket import * import itertools def task_pidigits ( ) : " " " Pi calculation ( Python ) " " " _map = map _count = itertools .count _islice = itertools.islice def calc_ndigits (n ) : # From http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/ def gen_x ( ) : return _map( lambda k : ( k , 4 * k + 2 , 0 , 2*k + 1 ) , _count ( 1 ) ) def compose ( a , b ) : aq , ar , as_ , at = a bq , br , bs , bt = b return ( aq * bq , aq * br + ar * bt , as_ * bq + at * bs , as_ * br + at * bt ) def extract ( z , j ) : q , r , s , t = z return ( q*j + r ) // ( s*j + t ) def pi_digits ( ) : z = ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 ) x = gen_x ( ) while 1 : y = extract ( z , 3 ) while y != extract ( z , 4 ) : z = compose ( z , next ( x ) ) y = extract ( z , 3 ) z = compose ( ( 10 , - 10*y , 0 , 1 ) , z ) yield y return list ( _islice ( pi_digits ( ) , n ) ) return calc_ndigits , ( 50 , ) def spin ( ) : task , args = task_pidigits ( ) while True : r= task ( * args ) def echo_server ( ) : s = socket ( AF_INET , SOCK_DGRAM ) s.setsockopt( SOL_SOCKET , SO_REUSEADDR,1 ) s.bind ( ( " " ,16000 ) ) while True : msg , addr = s.recvfrom ( 16384 ) s.send to ( msg , addr ) # Launch threads ( adjust the number to see different results ) NUMTHREADS = 1 for n in range ( NUMTHREADS ) : t = threading .
Thread ( target=spin ) t.daemon = True t.start ( ) # Launch a background echo server echo_server ( )
Next , here is a client program ioclient .py that simply measures the time it takes to echo 10 MB of data to the server in the iotest .py program .
# echoclient.py from socket import * import time CHUNKSIZE = 8192 NUMMESSAGES = 1280 # Total of 10MB # Dummy message msg = b " x " * CHUNKSIZE # Connect and send messages s = socket ( AF_INET , SOCK_DGRAM ) start = time .
time ( ) for n in range ( NUMMESSAGES ) : s.sendto(msg , ( " " ,16000 ) ) msg , addr = s.recvfrom ( 65536 ) end = time .
time ( ) print ( " %0.3 f seconds ( %0.3 f bytes /sec ) " % ( end-start , ( CHUNKSIZE * NUMMESSAGES ) / ( end - start ) ) )
If you run iotest.py on a dual - core Macbook with only 1 spin ( ) thread .
You get the following result if you run ioclient.py :
Python 3.2 ( New GIL ) : 9.166 seconds ( 1143998.140 bytes/sec )
It works , but it 's hardly impressive ( just barely over 1MB / sec transfer rate between two processes ? ) .
However , if you make the server have two spin ( ) threads , the performance gets much worse :
Python 3.2 ( New GIL ) : 28.064 seconds ( 373642.858 bytes/sec )
Now to further complicate matters , if you disable all but one of the CPU cores , you get this inexplicable result :
Python 3.2 ( New GIL , 1 CPU ) : 0.297 seconds ( 35326299.028 bytes/sec )
Needless to say , there are many bizarre things going on here .
The most major effect is that on multiple cores , it is very easy for CPU - bound threads to reacquire the GIL whenever an I/O bound thread performs I /O .
This means that CPU - threads have a greater tendency to hog the GIL .
At PyCON , I did some experiments with thread priorities and a modified GIL that adjusted priorities in a manner similar to what you find with multilevel feedback queues in operating systems .
Namely :
If a thread is forced to give up the GIL due to a timeout , it is penalized with lower priority .
If a thread voluntarily gives up the GIL because it performed I/O , it is reward with higher priority .
High priority threads always preempty low - priority threads .
The results of this approach were impressive .
If you run the same tests with priorities on 2 CPU cores , you get this result :
Python 3.2 ( New GIL with priorities ) , 0.298 seconds ( 35156921.564 bytes/sec )
The prioritized GIL also gives good performance for Antoine 's own ccbench .py benchmark .

The overall outcome of the GIL open space was that having a priority mechanism was probably a good idea .
However , a lot of people wanted to study the problem in more detail and to think about different possible implementations .
I am posting the following tar file that has my own modifications to the GIL used for the above benchmarks :
Note :
This tar file has all of the modified files in the Python 3.2 source ( pystate.h , pystate.c , and ceval_gil.h ) along with the io testing benchmark .
Be advised that this patch is only intended for further study by others --- it 's kind of hacked together and really only a proof of concept implementation of one possible priority scheme .
A real implementation would still need to address some issues not covered in my patch ( e.g. , starvation effects ) .
Due to other time commitments , I 'm not going to be able to do much followup with this patch at this moment .
However , I do want to encourage others to at least consider the benefit of introducing thread priorities and to explore different possible implementations .
Initial results seem to indicate that this can fix the GIL for both CPU - bound threads and for
I/O performance .

All who draw the sword will die by the sword .
-- Yeshua Ha -Notsri , Palestinian dissident , c. 33 CE .
I .
As we all know – or rather , as everyone but those who climb and claw their way to the top of power 's greasy pole knows – the effects of war are vast , unforeseeable , long - lasting -- and uncontrollable .
The far - reaching ripples of the turbulence will churn against distant shores and hidden corners , then roil back upon you in ways you could never imagine , for generations , even centuries .
Nor is " victory " in war proof against these deleterious effects .
For the brutalization , moral coarsening , corruption and concentration of elite power that attend every war do not simply disappear from a society when the fighting stops .
They persist , like microbes , in myriad forms , working with slow , corrosive force to degrade and deform the victors .
Indeed , victory in battle often leads a society to enshrine war 's most pernicious attributes : violence is ennobled , and becomes entrenched as an ever - ready instrument of national policy .
Militarism is exalted , the way of peace dishonored : cries of " Appeasers !
Cowards !
Traitors ! " greet every approach that fails to brandish the threat of extreme violence , that fails to " keep all options on the table . "
The apparent " lesson " of victory – that there can be no right without armed might to win and safeguard it – quickly degenerates into the belief that armed might is right .
( William Astore has an excellent article here on how the collision with Nazi Germany infected America 's military with a continuing admiration for the German war machine . )
Military power becomes equated with moral worth , and the ability to wreak savage , unimaginable destruction through armed violence -- via thoughtless obedience to the orders of " superiors " – becomes a cherished attribute of society .
War is no longer seen as a vast , horrific failure of the human spirit , a scandalous betrayal of our common humanity , a sickening tragedy of irrevocable loss and inconsolable suffering – although this is its inescapable reality , even in a " good " war , for a " just " cause .
( And of course no nation or faction has ever gone to war without declaring that its cause is just . )
Instead of lamenting war , and girding for it , if at all , only in the most dire circumstances , with the most extreme reluctance , the infected society celebrates it at every turn .
No national occasion – even a sporting event !
– is complete without bristling displays of military firepower , and pious tributes to those wreaking violence around the world in blind obedience to their superiors .
Oddly enough , when a modern nation consciously adopts a " warrior ethos , " it casts aside -- openly , even gleefully -- whatever virtue that ethos has historically claimed for itself , such as courage in battle and honor toward adversaries .
In its place come the adulation of overwhelming technological firepower and the rabid demonization of the enemy ( or the perceived enemy , or even the " suspected " enemy ) , who is stripped of all rights , all human dignity , and subject to " whatever it takes " to break him down or destroy him .
Thus our American militarists exult in the advanced hardware that allows " soldiers " to slaughter people from thousands of miles away , with missiles , bombs and bullets fired from lurking , unreachable drones high in the sky .
( A recent study shows that even by the most conservative reckoning of who is or is n't a " militant , " at least one third of the hundreds killed in the Bush - Obama drone campaigns in Pakistan are clearly civilians . )
The drone " warriors " -- often living in complete safety and comfort -- see nothing but a bloodless image on a screen ; they face no physical threat at all .
This is assassination , not combat ; it reeks of cowardice , and dehumanizes everyone it touches , the victims and the button - pushers alike .
Yet our militarists -- most of whom , of course , have somehow never found the time to fight the wars they cheer for -- wax orgasmic about this craven weaponry .
In the transvaluation of values that militarism produces , cowardice becomes a martial virtue .
Barack Obama , the Nobel Peace Laureate , pushes forward with plans for the " Prompt Global Strike " system of " conventional " super - missiles that can rain down massive death -- unstoppable , undeterrable , without warning -- anywhere on the planet within an hour .
All this , while expanding shorter - range missile " defense " systems that bristle with blatantly offensive potential , and intent , all over the world .
Plus spending billions to " modernize " the nuclear arsenal , ensuring that it stays effective enough to murder the entire earth , while weeding out some " redundant " warheads as a PR gesture .
Meanwhile , the drone programs -- emblazoned with names that proudly proclaim their savage nature : " Predators " and " Reapers , " launching " Hellfire " missiles into sleeping villages -- keep expanding relentlessly .
As noted by Nick Turse -- who is doing invaluable work detailing the deadly nuts and bolts of the militarist empire and its profiteers -- the Pentagon is drooling over visions of vast robotic forces filling the heavens and roaming the earth , even down to the smallest crevice .
He rightly notes the main purpose of this massively funded R&D : to make war " easier , " less deadly to " our side , " and thus more palatable to the public :
This means bigger , badder , faster drones – armed to the teeth – with sensor systems to monitor wide swathes of territory and the ability to loiter overhead for days on end waiting for human targets to appear and , in due course , be vaporized by high - powered munitions .
It ’s a future built upon advanced technologies designed to make targeted killings – remote - controlled assassinations – ever more effortless .
...
For the Air Force , such a prospect is the stuff of dreams , a bright future for unmanned , hypersonic lethality ; for the rest of the planet , it ’s a potential nightmare from which there may be no waking .
But while Turse outlines this potential nightmare in grim detail ( the whole piece should be read in full ) , we are of course beset by present nightmares in horrific plenty .
And few are more chilling than the ruling establishment 's astonishingly swift acceptance of outright torture as an open tool of national policy .
This acceptance not only includes the increasingly frenzied praise and championing of torture by the circle of war criminals and accomplices led by Dick Cheney ; in slightly more restrained tones , it goes right across the board among the political and media elite .
Torture is now nothing more than a topic for " debate " -- debates which center largely on the relative " effectiveness " of various torture techniques , or else on mindless ( not to mention heartless ) hairsplitting over the meaning of the word " torture . "
There is of course a myth that Barack Obama has " ended " the practice of torture .
This is not even remotely true .
For one thing , as we have often noted here , the Army Field Manual that Obama has adopted as his interrogation standard permits many practices that any rational person would consider torture .
For another , we have no way of verifying what techniques are actually being used by the government 's innumerable " security " and intelligence agencies , by the covert units of the military -- and by other entities whose very existence is still unknown .
These agencies are almost entirely self - policed ; they investigate themselves , they report on themselves to the toothless Congressional " oversight " committees ; we simply have to take these organizations -- whose entire raison d'etre is deceit , deception , lawlessness and subterfuge -- at their word .
And of course , we have no way of knowing what is being done in the torture chambers of foreign lands where the United States often " outsources " its captives , including American citizens .
Finally , even if the comforting bedtime story of Obama 's ban of torture techniques in interrogation were true , there remains his ardent championing of the right to seize anyone on earth -- without a warrant , without producing any evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing -- and hold them indefinitely , often for years on end , in a legal limbo , with no inherent rights whatsoever , beyond whatever narrowly constricted , ever - changing , legally baseless and often farcical " hearings " and tribunals the captors deign to allow them .
Incarceration under these conditions is itself an horrendous act of torture , no matter what else might happen to the captive .
Yet Obama has actively , avidly applied this torture , and has gone to court numerous times to defend this torture , and to expand the use of this torture .
Many thousands of innocent people have already been forced through the meat grinder of this torture -- at one point early in the Iraq War , the Red Cross estimated that 70 - 90 percent of the more than 20,000 Iraqis being held by the Americans as " suspected terrorists " were not guilty of any crime whatsoever , much less ' terrorism ' .
And that is just a single snapshot , at a single point in time , of the vast gulag that America has wrapped around the earth -- a gulag where many have been murdered outright , not just tortured or unjustly imprisoned .
And it is still going on , with scarcely a demur across the bipartisan establishment .
The heinous and dishonorable practice of torture , physical and psychological , is now an intrinsic , openly established element of American society .
Murder , cowardice , torture , dishonor : these are fruits -- and the distinguishing characteristics -- of the militarized society .
What Americans once would not do even to Nazis with the blood of millions on their hands , they now do routinely to weak and wretched captives seized on little or no evidence of wrongdoing at all .
We are deep in the darkness , and hurtling deeper , headlong , all the time .
II .
Let 's not kid ourselves , however .
The militarism that has now gained such a strangulating ascendancy over American life did not drop down suddenly from the sky ( or arrive on the hijacked bus that Bush and Cheney drove to the White House ) .
Although this militarism has now reached unprecedented levels of institutional and political dominance , there has always been a strong warlike strain running through American history -- indeed , through its pre-history as well , as Fred Anderson and Andrew Cayton demonstrate in their book , Dominion of War , detailing the decisive influence of war and imperialism on America 's development over the past 500 years .
Nor is it a peculiarly American problem .
As Caroline Alexander notes in her remarkable new work , The War That Killed Achilles :
If we took any period of a hundred years in the last five thousand , it has been calculated , we could expect , on average , 94 of those years to be occupied with large - scale conflicts in one or more parts of the world .
This enduring , seemingly ineradicable fact of war is ... as intrinsic and tragic a component of the human condition as our very mortality .
We human beings have been shaped by millions of years of genetic breakage and mutation , all of which is still on - going .
We are compounds of chaos , ignorance and error .
Our psyches are frail and variegated things , isolated , with each individual consciousness formed from a unique and ever - shifting coalescence of billions of brain cells firing ( and misfiring ) in infinite , unrepeatable combinations .
Beneath this electrical superstructure lie mechanical rhythms and erratic surges of instinct and impulse , dark , hormonal tides and drives that never reach the plane of awareness .
In the infancy of our species we began to cling -- fiercely , in fear and desire -- to patterns of behavior , emotion and thought that seemed to bring some sort of order , some containment of the whirlwind within us , and some protection from the dangers , known and unknown , that lurked outside .
We began to do " whatever it takes " to preserve these patterns from the ever - present threat of their dissolution in the whirlwind , to impose them , by violence if necessary , on the recalcitrant material of reality -- including the always - unknowable , impenetrable reality of the Other , those mysterious combinations outside our isolated consciousness .
The patterns become ingrained , they sink into the substrate where they operate unquestioned and unseen , they become " natural , " the way that things must be .
Domination and obedience are among the strongest , and most enduring , of these patterns , taking multitudinous forms -- a " local habitation and a name " -- in the ever - changing circumstances of existence .
War is their expression writ large .
It is in us , it comes from us .
But to acknowledge war 's intrinsic , universal character does not absolve us of the need to resist it .
To say , " Oh , that 's just human nature ; it 's always been this way and always will be this way , " is not only a lazy , timorous acquiescence to base instinct , it also posits a settled , even eternal quality to human nature and human consciousness that simply does not and cannot exist .
To go against war , to step outside the ingrained behavioral patterns of domination and obedience is indeed an " unnatural " act -- and it feels unnatural , it feels strange , and raw , and frightening .
But the deeper fear -- of psychic and physical dissolution -- that lies at the foundation of these ever - more destructive patterns can only be faced down , changed , and wrenched into some more benevolent pattern by embracing the risk and discomfort of stepping forth , of stepping beyond -- literally , " transgressing " -- the boundaries of a wholly imaginary ( or even hallucinatory ) " human nature . "
The whirlwind that characterizes the imperfect , breaking , misfiring , evolving reality of human consciousness is not only a producer of ( very understandable ) deep - seated fears ; it is also a force for liberation .
Because our nature is not ultimately fixed , we can , literally and figuratively , burn new connections in our brains , we can enlarge our consciousness and extend our empathetic understanding of those strange Others .
And we have been doing this , in fits and starts , in lurches and staggers , with much backsliding and many wrong turns -- indeed , in ignorance and error -- for as long as we have been creatures cursed and gifted with self - awareness .
We do have the capacity , the space , to resist the patterns of domination and obedience , to seek out new ways of seeing the world , of being in the world , of communing with others .
Police followed a trail of pizza sauce and chicken wings to an apartment and arrested two men on suspicion of attacking a pizza delivery man early Saturday morning .
Mesa Police said the delivery man was lured to a vacant apartment , where two men attacked him by breaking a coffee pot over his head and stole his pizzas .
The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Saturday at Sycamore Shadows Apartments near Sycamore Street and Southern Avenue , police said .
The victim , who suffered a small knot on the back of his head , told police that when he arrived to deliver the pizza he was cornered outside the apartment by two men who said they ordered the pizza , police said .
When the victim reached into his bag to get the pizza , one of the men struck him with a coffee pot , breaking it over his head .
The two men grabbed the pizza bags and ran .
Police were able to follow a trail of pizza sauce and chicken wings in the direction the men were seen running , which led the officer to another apartment in the same complex , police said .
The delivery man was able to identify the two men in the apartment .
Michael Dornan , 18 , admitted to striking the victim with the coffee pot , police said .
Michael Le-Andre , 23 , was also found in the apartment and had pizza sauce on his pants and shirt .
Le - Andre refused to give the officer his name or identification and denied participation in the robbery .
A consent to search form was signed by the apartment owner and the officer found the pizza , wings and pizza bags in the bedroom , police said .
Dornan was booked on charges of armed robbery .
Le - Andre was booked on charges of armed robbery and failure to identify himself to an officer .
" [ T ]he Court is concerned about the lack of facts establishing that Defendant was using that IP address at that particular time .
Indeed , the [ complaint ] does not explain what link , if any , there is between Defendant and the IP address .
It is possible that Plaintiff sued Defendant because he is the subscriber to IP address ....
As recognized by many courts , just because an IP address is registered to an individual does not mean that he or she is guilty of infringement when that IP address is used to commit infringing activity .
"
" The complaints assert that the defendants – identified only by IP address – were the individuals who downloaded the subject “ work ” and participated in the BitTorrent swarm .
However , the assumption that the person who pays for Internet access at a given location is the same individual who allegedly downloaded a single sexually explicit film is tenuous , and one that has grown more so over time . "
" The concern of this Court is that in these lawsuits , potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated , and instead , the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants .
"
" The University has adequately demonstrated that it is not able to identify the alleged infringers with a reasonable degree of technical certainty ... [ C]ompliance with the subpoena as to the IP addresses represented by these Defendants would expose innocent parties to intrusive discovery .... [ T ]he Court declines to authorize discovery and quashes the subpoena as to Does # 8 , 9 , and 14 " " [ C ] ounsel representing the record companies have an ethical obligation to fully understand that they are fighting people without lawyers ... that the formalities of this are basically bankrupting people , and it 's terribly critical that you stop it .... " " Rule 11 ( b ) ( 3 ) requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the Plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees .
In my view , the Court would be well within its power to direct the Plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated Rule 11 ( b ) with their allegations respecting joinder .
[ I ]t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here ..... These plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme ... to obtain court - authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints , but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of Rule 11 ( b ) ( 3 ) because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined . " " [ N] either the parties ' submissions nor the Court 's own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons .....
In addition to the weakness of the secondary copyright infringement claims against Ms. Foster , there is a question of the plaintiffs ' motivations in pursuing them ..... [ T ] here is an appearance that the plaintiffs initiated the secondary infringement claims to press Ms. Foster into settlement after they had ceased to believe she was a direct or " primary " infringer . " " [ A ]n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant , usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal ..... The Defendant Does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse . "
" Plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time , and may not join defendants for their convenience .
"
" The Court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs . "
" Plaintiffs contend that unless the Court allows ex parte immediate discovery , they will be irreparably harmed .
While the Court does not dispute that infringement of a copyright results in harm , it requires a Coleridgian " suspension of disbelief " to accept that the harm is irreparable , especially when monetary damages can cure any alleged violation .
On the other hand , the harm related to disclosure of confidential information in a student or faculty member 's Internet files can be equally harmful ..... Moreover , ex parte proceedings should be the exception , not the rule . " " ' Statutory damages must still bear some relation to actual damages . " " [ T ] his court finds that defendants ' use of the same ISP and P2P networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is , without more , insufficient for permissive joinder under Rule 20 .
This court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action , but all other Doe defendants except Doe 2 . " " [ L] arge awards of statutory damages can raise due process concerns .
Extending the reasoning of Gore and its progeny , a number of courts have recognized that an award of statutory damages may violate due process if the amount of the award is " out of all reasonable proportion " to the actual harm caused by a defendant 's conduct .
[ T ] hese cases are doubtlessly correct to note that a punitive and grossly excessive statutory damages award violates the Due Process Clause ..... " " [ P] laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the Copyright Act .
On the other hand , Lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that , in a proper case , a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the Copyright
Act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered ..... " " ' [ S] tatutory damages should bear some relation to actual damages suffered ' ....( citations omitted ) and ' cannot be divorced entirely from economic reality ' " .
" The Court would be remiss if it did not take this opportunity to implore Congress to amend the Copyright Act to address liability and damages in peer to peer network cases ....
The defendant is an individual , a consumer .
She is not a business .
She sought no profit from her acts .....
[ T ]he damages awarded in this case are wholly disproportionate to the damages suffered by Plaintiffs . "
" If there is an asymmetry in copyright , it is one that actually favors defendants .
The successful assertion of a copyright confirms the plaintiff 's possession of an exclusive , and sometimes very valuable , right , and thus gives it an incentive to spend heavily on litigation .
In contrast , a successful defense against a copyright claim , when it throws the copyrighted work into the public domain , benefits all users of the public domain , not just the defendant ; he obtains no exclusive right and so his incentive to spend on defense is reduced and he may be forced into an unfavorable settlement . "
" Customers who download music and movies for free would not necessarily spend money to acquire the same product ..... RIAA ’s request problematically assumes that every illegal download resulted in a lost sale . "
Providence - A Senate commission will soon explore whether Rhode Island should decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and tax the drug , a path recently taken by neighboring Massachusetts .
Commission members are exploring several questions that suggest an underlying skepticism with criminalizing marijuana , including whether existing prohibitions have decreased drug use , caused corruption among law enforcement officials and resulted in violence .
The panel will present its findings early next year .
Commission member Nick Horton , a policy researcher for OpenDoors , which works to reintegrate criminal offenders into society , said presidential candidates have admitted using marijuana but people in his Providence neighborhood still get jailed for it .
" That double standard does more harm than good to our justice system , " he said .
Sen. Joshua Miller , D - Cranston , created the commission and serves as its chairman .
He has not yet backed any specific changes to Rhode Island 's drug laws , but members will hear testimony about recent changes in Massachusetts .
In November 2008 , Bay State voters decided to make possession of an ounce or less of marijuana punishable by a $ 100 fine and confiscation of the drug rather than a crime carrying a maximum six - month prison sentence and $ 500 fine .
The measure was approved over the objections of police and prosecutors in Massachusetts , who feared it would encourage use of what they consider more harmful drugs and interfere with their ability to prosecute traffickers who sometimes become suspects because of marijuana possession .
Some cities and towns in Massachusetts have since created additional penalties to discourage marijuana use .
Rhode Island lawmakers already have taken steps to legalize some marijuana use .
In 2006 , they started allowing patients who registered with the state to possess small amounts of marijuana if it's used to relieve pain or chronic ailments .
In June , the General Assembly expanded the medical marijuana program by authorizing up to three nonprofit stores to legally sell marijuana .
State health officials still are determining how those stores will be licensed and regulated .
Republican Gov. Don Carcieri and the State Police have opposed expansions of the medical marijuana system .
Miller 's panel is required to examine the cost of prosecuting and jailing offenders , as well as considering the possibility of legalizing marijuana sales and imposing a tax of $ 35 per ounce or more .
Financial arguments could be tempting since Rhode Island faces a $ 220 million budget deficit for the fiscal year ending in June , about 7 percent of what state authorities originally expected to collect .
With unemployment hovering around 13 percent , the deficit is expected to grow larger in the coming year .
" I think one of the things in order to be taken seriously is that there has to be a fiscal advantage , beyond other issues that are important , " Miller said .
( CNN ) -- Nine Massachusetts teenagers have been charged with involvement in a months - long campaign of bullying that led to the suicide in January of a 15 - year - old girl , a prosecutor said Monday .
Phoebe Prince 's body was found hanging in the stairway leading to her family 's second - floor apartment in South Hadley , Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth D. Scheibel told reporters in the western Massachusetts town of Northampton .
" It appears that Phoebe 's death on January 14 followed a torturous day for her when she was subjected to verbal harassment and physical abuse , " she said .
Earlier in the day , Prince had been harassed as she studied in the library at South Hadley High School , apparently in the presence of a faculty member and several students , none of whom reported it until after the death , Scheibel said .
Prince , who had recently moved to the area with her family from Ireland , was also harassed as she walked through the halls of the school that day and as she walked on the street toward her home , Scheibel said .
The harassment that day , by one male and two females , " appears to have been motivated by the group 's displeasure with Phoebe 's brief dating relationship with a male student that had ended six weeks earlier , " she said .
But that day 's events were not isolated ; they " were the culmination of a nearly three - month campaign of verbally abusive , assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm toward Phoebe on school grounds by several South Hadley students , " Scheibel added .
" Their conduct far exceeded the limits of normal teenage relationship - related quarrels .
The investigation revealed relentless activity directed toward Phoebe designed to humiliate her and to make it impossible for her to remain at school . "
In the indictments , returned Friday but not made public until Monday , the Hampshire County grand jury charged 17 - year - old Sean Mulveyhill of South Hadley with statutory rape , violation of civil rights with bodily injury resulting , criminal harassment and disturbance of a school assembly .
The indictments charged 18 - year - old Austin Renaud of Springfield with statutory rape .
Kayla Narey , 17 , of South Hadley , was charged with violation of civil rights with bodily injury resulting , criminal harassment and disturbance of a school assembly .
CNN was not able to reach any of the three , none of whom has been taken into custody , according to Scheibel .
She did not elaborate on the statutory rape charges .
Charges against another three girls included violation of civil rights with bodily injury resulting ; two were also charged with stalking .
Three other girls from South Hadley were named in four delinquency complaints from Hampshire Franklin Juvenile Court .
Their charges included violation of civil rights with bodily injury resulting , criminal harassment and disturbance of a school assembly , violation of civil rights , criminal harassment and assault by means of a dangerous weapon .
One of the juveniles was charged in a separate complaint involving a second victim , Scheibel said .
Though initial news reports blamed Prince 's suicide on cyberbullying , Scheibel said the students ' actions were " primarily conducted on school grounds during school hours and while school was in session . "
She said any use of electronic social networks was secondary to " commonly understood bullying methods . "
The bullying of Prince was common knowledge to most of the student body and to certain faculty , staff and administrators , Scheibel said .
At least four students and two faculty members had intervened during the harassment , but the school 's code of conduct was inconsistently enforced , she said .
Though the faculty , staff and administrators ' behavior was not deemed criminal , " the actions , or inactions , of some adults at the school are troublesome , " she said .
Scheibel said the Prince family had asked " that the public refrain from vigilantism in favor of allowing the judicial system an opportunity to provide a measure of justice for Phoebe . "
CNN was not able to reach the Prince family .
Scheibel said the investigation was continuing and that a 10th person may be charged .
Arraignments will occur " in the near future , " she said .
Several of the students remain in the school .
In a statement , South Hadley Public Schools Assistant Superintendent Christine Sweklo said school officials would meet with the district attorney to review any new evidence .
" Once we are able to obtain this information , we will be able to make a more comprehensive statement and possibly take further action against the students still attending South Hadley High School , " she said .
The statutory rape charges could result in penalties of up to life in prison , said Elizabeth Farris , a lawyer in the prosecutor 's office .
A conviction on a violation - of - civil - rights charge could result in 10 years in prison ; a conviction for criminal harassment up to 2 1 / 2 years ; a conviction for disturbance of school assembly up to one month , she said .
Those 17 and older will be tried as adults in Hampshire County Superior Court .
The juveniles will be tried in juvenile court .
A juvenile court judge may choose to institute an adult penalty , a combination of adult and juvenile penalties or a juvenile penalty alone , Farris said .

Rome , Italy ( CNN ) --
A priest who was accused of sexually abusing children -- and whose subsequent move from one location to another the pope approved when he was a German cardinal -- has been suspended , his archdiocese announced Monday .
The priest was later convicted .
The priest , identified only as H , violated the terms set out for him after his conviction , the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising said in a statement .
It did not say what the violation was , but at the time of his conviction by a German court , he was ordered to pay a fine and not work with children again .
The priest 's superior also resigned , the church said .
The pope -- then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the man 's move in the wake of the accusations from Essen to Munich in the early 1980s , but the archdiocese said the cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man 's case .
The priest was in therapy for having abused children when he was transferred , the archdiocese said .
Officials said the priest was released from church service in 2008 and was no longer serving actively as a priest .
He was a church counselor for tourists .
The move comes as hundreds of alleged victims have come forward in Germany , claiming priests abused them .
Some allege the abuse was sexual , while others refer to physical violence such as slapping .
German lawyers representing alleged victims said there are more than 300 cases across Germany .
Ursula Raue , who is representing alleged victims of sex abuse by a Jesuit order in Berlin , said she " must have had around 1,000 calls , none of them less than half an hour long . "
" Many people keep saying to me that this is the first time anyone has actually listened or believed my story , " she said .
Although she 's a lawyer , in this instance she describes herself as a go - between between the alleged victims and the Jesuit - run Canisius College in Berlin .
She has 160 cases she 's looking into throughout Germany , she said .
The Vatican has been working hard to defend the German - born Pope Benedict XVI as the scandal spreads .
As the head of the Vatican 's doctrinal arm in Rome before he became pope , Ratzinger " initiated intense activities to confront , judge and adequately punish the crimes in the context of ecclesiastical legislation , " Vatican spokesman the Federico Lombardi said Saturday .
" The line he followed was always one of rigor and coherence in dealing with even the most difficult situations , " he said .
Read why the allegations could mean trouble for the pope
Also on Saturday , a top Vatican official said Catholic Church officials never prosecuted more than half the roughly 3,000 priests accused of sexual impropriety in the last decade .
There has been " no trial " in 60 percent of cases , mostly " because of the advanced age of the accused , " said Msgr. Charles J. Scicluna , head of the Vatican office that investigates crimes the church considers most serious .
The priests in those cases were subject to " administrative and disciplinary provisions " such as instructions not to celebrate Mass or hear confessions , Scicluna told L'Avvenire , the Italian Catholic bishops ' newspaper .
Those cases include some of the most " sensational ... which have caught the attention of the media , " he said , without revealing more details .
Scicluna insisted the priests in question had not been absolved of their sins .
" It 's true that there has been no formal condemnation , but if a person is obliged to live a life of silence and prayer , then there must be a reason , " he said in an unusually revealing interview .
Scicluna was talking only about investigations by the church , not by civil authorities .
The Vatican released an official English translation of the remarks , which come as accusations of child abuse by priests sweep across Western Europe .
A damning Irish government - backed report into child abuse by priests led four bishops to resign in December , and Pope Benedict XVI is expected to issue a formal statement , or pastoral letter , about it before Easter .
The Netherlands , Austria and Germany also are facing new allegations of child abuse -- including ones in a diocese once directly connected to the pope and to his brother , Georg Ratzinger .
The coming months are likely produce more sexual abuse allegations across Europe .
" It is like a tsunami or an extensive fire , " said the Rev. Andreas Batlogg , editor of the German Jesuit magazine Stimmen der Zeit .
" The estimated number of undetected cases seems to be far higher than the yet known ones . "
Nearly every day since the end of January , more Germans have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests , with roughly 170 reporting such abuse .
Two self - identified German victims were connected to a boy 's choir that was directed by the pope 's brother from 1964 to 1994 .
Scicluna 's disclosures about the number of complaints and the results come as the Vatican fights to show it is handling the problem properly -- and to protect the pope .
About 20 percent of priests accused of " delicta graviora " faced full trial by church officials -- many of which ended in convictions , he said .
Ten percent requested a discharge from the priesthood , and the pope summarily dismissed 10 percent , Scicluna said .
A small minority of the 3,000 complaints against priests accused them of abusing children , he added .
" About sixty percent of the cases chiefly involved sexual attraction toward adolescents of the same sex , another 30 percent involved heterosexual relations , and the remaining 10 percent were cases of pedophilia in the true sense of the term , " he said .
About 300 priests were accused of child abuse between 2001 and 2010 , he confirmed .
He said the problem was " not as widespread as has been believed . "
" Please do n't misunderstand me .
These are of course too many , " he said .
There are about 400,000 Catholic priests around the world , he said , in an attempt to illustrate that the number of complaints against priests is relatively small .
Most of the complaints came from the United States , he said .
Scicluna said the Vatican should reconsider its policy of not prosecuting particularly old complaints .
The Vatican has a 10 - year statute of limitations on child abuse , starting from the date the alleged victim turns 18 .
Pope John Paul II introduced the policy in 2001 , at the height of scandals in Boston , Massachusetts , and Los Angeles , California .
" The limit of 10 years is not enough in this kind of case , " Scicluna said .
" It would be better to return to the earlier system of ' delicta graviora ' not being subject to [ a ] statue of limitations . "
CNN 's Hada Messia in Rome and Dan Gilgoff in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report
" It just does n't work out that well , so we definitely wo n't do it again . "
" I was trying to look at all the positive aspects of it – about the training camp and the fact that everyone from home could see us both at the same time , " Joe said .
" Normally you have to fly to see me fight , and then you have to fly to see him fight .
I was trying to look at all the upside , but I definitely knew there was a big downside – the emotion dump .
Plus we could n't corner each other . "
" I was screaming in the back room at the TV , almost like I 'm coaching , " Joe said .
" Obviously [ Dan ] can't hear me , so I 'm being retarded , but I 'm screaming .
I saw the reverse triangle coming way before Danny did , way before my coaches did .
I could tell the way Cole fell to his side that it was coming , but I could n't do anything about it . "
" I think we squashed the whole fighting thing , " Joe said .
" We both had such a tough time fighting at the same time .
" If it came way down the line and they were going to pay us some obscene amount of money , then I think we would think about it .
We were like , ' I 'd definitely fight him , ' but I think after seeing how tough it was just to see the other person fight on the same night , I think we 're kind of squashing that . "

Donations are not required , however if you appreciate my work , then perhaps mentioning my site on your blog or social media is good enough .
Currently W1 Limiter 2.0 is in beta .
The final version will introduce limiting meters and a graph .
Please also note , the OS X version is not backwards compatible , while Windows version is backwards compatible .
However on both systems projects saved with W1 v2.0 will not load with the previous obsolete version .
W1 Limiter is a clone of Waves L1 , with identical output , as well as an approximation of Waves L2 .
This was accomplished without reverse engineering Waves products , and the result was obtained by adjusting 4 Front YLimiter , by doing the following : Simplifying release curve
Increasing release time 3 times ( see notes below )
Altering softening circuit filter Waves L1 famous limiter ( and thus W1 - for compatibility reasons ) uses three times longer actual release time than standard RT60 metric .
This means that if you set 50 ms release in the limiter , it will actually yield with 150 ms standard RT60 release time .
Different engineers recommend different values for release time , the default value is chosen reasonably to provide a smooth limiting for most typical usage of the limiter .
If one is not experienced with limiters , it is recommended to keep the default release time .
Current beta version also adds the adaptive release .
I tried to replicate Waves L2 , however their tangent curve is very complex , so I could only approximate its behaviour ( which actually should be quite close , but unlike L1 part , not digitally identical ) .
Waves ARC uses fixed thresholds of 250 and 500ms , while W1 still allows changing release time while in adaptive mode .
Also , IDR dithering is not emulated .
Formats included : VST ( Windows , OS X )
AudioUnit ( OS X )
RTAS ( Windows , OS X ) .
I apologize for not being able to support ProTools / AAX at this time .
Avid / Digidesign people charge $ 500 / year for the permission to distribute AAX plugins , and it feels over the top for a freeware plugin .

Misandry - Men Don't Exist ?
This is really good .
Of course I have reservations with , in some ways , the matter is approached , but that is to be expected .
All of us will have varying opinions .
But overall , this is a fantastic little series .
And I want to stress the importance of watching the " Bonus clip " .
It is worth the price of admission all by itself .
If you forward a YT clip URL re misandry , etc. to anyone , this is the one to use .
Major props to ' manwomanmyth '.
The nature of transition , how change works its way through a system , how people acclimate to the new — all these questions .
So much of the change is driven by technologies that are elusive if not altogether invisible in their operation .
Signals , data , networks .
New habits and reflexes .
Watch older people as they try to retool ; watch the ease with which kids who have nothing to unlearn go swimming forward .
Study their movements , their aptitudes , their weaknesses .
I wonder if any population in history has had a bigger gulf between its youngest and oldest members .
I ask my students about their reading habits , and though I ’m not surprised to find that few read newspapers or print magazines , many check in with online news sources , aggregate sites , incessantly .
They are seldom away from their screens for long , but that ’s true of us , their parents , as well .
But how do we start to measure effects — of this and everything else ?
The outer look of things stays much the same , which is to say that the outer look of things has not caught up with the often intangible transformations .
Newspapers are still sold and delivered ; bookstores still pile their sale tables high .
It is easy for the critic to be accused of alarmism .
And yet …
Information comes to seem like an environment .
If anything “ important ” happens anywhere , we will be informed .
The effect of this is to pull the world in close .
Nothing penetrates , or punctures .
The real , which used to be defined by sensory immediacy , is redefined .
From the vantage point of hindsight , that which came before so often looks quaint , at least with respect to technology .
Indeed , we have a hard time imagining that the users were n’t at some level aware of the absurdity of what they were doing .
Movies bring this recognition to us fondly ; they give us the evidence .
The switchboard operators crisscrossing the wires into the right slots ;
Dad settling into his luxury automobile , all fins and chrome ; Junior ringing the bell on his bike as he heads off on his paper route .
The marvel is that all of them — all of us — concealed their embarrassment so well .
The attitude of the present to the past … well , it depends on who is looking .
The older you are , the more likely it is that your regard will be benign — indulgent , even nostalgic .
Youth , by contrast , quickly gets derisive , preening itself on knowing better , oblivious to the fact that its toys will be found no less preposterous by the next wave of the young .
These notions came at me the other night while I was watching the opening scenes of Wim Wenders ’s 1987 film Wings of Desire , which has as its premise the active presence of angels in our midst .
The scene that triggered me was set in a vast and spacious modern library .
The camera swooped with angelic freedom , up the wide staircases , panning vertically to a kind of balcony outcrop where Bruno Ganz , one of Wenders ’s angels , stood looking down .
Below him people moved like insects , studying shelves , removing books , negotiating this great archive of items .
Maybe it was the idea of angels that did it — the insertion of the timeless perspective into this moment of modern - day Berlin .
I do n’t know , but in a flash I felt myself looking back in time from a distant and disengaged vantage .
I was seeing it all as through the eyes of the future , and what I felt , before I could check myself , was a bemused pity : the gaze of a now on a then that does not yet know it is a then , which is unselfconsciously fulfilling itself .
Suddenly it ’s impossible to imagine a world in which many interactions formerly dependent on print on paper happen screen to screen .
It ’s no stretch , no exercise in futurism .
You can pretty much extrapolate from the habits and behaviors of kids in their teens and 20s , who navigate their lives with little or no recourse to paper .
In class they sit with their laptops open on the table in front of them .
I pretend they are taking course - related notes , but would not be surprised to find out they are writing to friends , working on papers for other courses , or just trolling their favorite sites while they listen .
Whenever there is a question about anything — a date , a publication , the meaning of a word — they give me the answer before I ’ve finished my sentence .
From where they stand , Wenders ’s library users already have a sepia coloration .
I know that I present book information to them with a slight defensiveness ; I wrap my pronouncements in a preemptive irony .
I could not bear to be earnest about the things that matter to me and find them received with that tolerant bemusement I spoke of , that leeway we extend to the beliefs and passions of our elders .
AOL slogan : “ We search the way you think . ”
I just finished reading an article in Harper ’s by Gary Greenberg ( “ A Mind of Its Own ” ) on the latest books on neuropsychology , the gist of which recognizes an emerging consensus in the field , and maybe , more frighteningly , in the culture at large : that there may not be such a thing as mind apart from brain function .
As Eric Kandel , one of the writers discussed , puts it : “ Mind is a set of operations carried out by the brain , much as walking is a set of operations carried out by the legs , except dramatically more complex . ”
It ’s easy to let the terms and comparisons slide abstractly past , to miss the full weight of implication .
But Greenberg is enough of an old humanist to recognize when the great supporting trunk of his worldview is being crosscut just below where he is standing and to realize that everything he deems sacred is under threat .
His recognition may not be so different from the one that underlay the emergence of Nietzsche ’s thought .
But if Nietzsche found a place of rescue in man himself , his Superman transcending himself to occupy the void left by the loss — the murder — of God , there is no comparable default now .
Brain functioning cannot stand in for mind , once mind has been unmasked as that , unless we somehow grant that the nature of brain partakes of what we had allowed might be the nature of mind .
Which seems logically impossible , as the nature of mind allowed possibilities of connection and fulfillment beyond the strictly material , and the nature of brain is strictly material .
It means that what we had imagined to be the something more of experience is created in - house by that three - pound bundle of neurons , and that it is not pointing to a larger definition of reality so much as to a capacity for narrative projection engendered by infinitely complex chemical reactions .
No chance of a wizard behind the curtain .
The wizard is us , our chemicals mingling .
“ And if you still think God made us , ” writes Greenberg , “ there ’s a neuro­chemical reason for that too . ”
He quotes writer David Linden , author of The Accidental Mind : How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love , Memory , Dreams , and God ( ! ) :
“ Our brains have become particularly adapted to creating coherent , gap - free stories … .
This propensity for narrative creation is part of what predisposes us humans to religious thought . ”
Of course one can , must , ask whence narration itself .
What in us requires story rather than the chaotic pullulation that might more accurately describe what is ?
Greenberg also cites philosopher Karl Popper , his belief that the neuroscientific worldview will gradually displace what he calls the “ mentalist ” perspective :
With the progress of brain research , the language of the physiologists is likely to penetrate more and more into ordinary language , and to change our picture of the universe , including that of common sense .
So we shall be talking less and less about experiences , perceptions , thoughts , beliefs , purposes and aims ; and more and more about brain processes … .
When this stage has been reached , mentalism will be stone dead , and the problem of mind and its relation to the body will have solved itself .
But it is not only developments in brain science that are creating this deep shift in the human outlook .
This research advances hand in hand with the wholesale implementation and steady expansion of the externalized neural network : the digitizing of almost every sphere of human activity .
Long past being a mere arriving technology , the digital is at this point ensconced as a paradigm , fully saturating our ordinary language .
Who can doubt that even when we are not thinking , when we are merely functioning in our new world , we are premising that world very differently than did our parents or the many generations preceding them ?
What is the place of the former world now , its still - familiar but also strangely sepia - tinged assumptions about the self acting in a larger and , in frightening and thrilling ways , inexplicable world ?
Let me go back to that assertion by Linden : “ Our brains have become particularly adapted to creating coherent , gap - free stories … .
This propensity for narrative creation is part of what predisposes us humans to religious thought . ”
What a topic for surmising !
I would almost go so far as to say that it is a mystery as great as the original creation — the what , how , and whither — the contemplation of how chemicals in combination create things we call narratives , and how these narratives elicit the extraordinary responses they do from chemicals in combination .
The idea of “ narrative creation ” carries a great deal in its train .
For narrative — story — is not the same thing as simple sequentiality .
To say “ I went here and then here and then did this and then did that ” is not narrative , at least not in the sense that I ’m sure Linden intends .
No , narration is sequence that claims significance .
Animals , for example , do not narrate , even though they are well aware of sequence and of the consequences of actions .
“ My master has picked up my bowl and has gone with it into that room ; he will return with my food . ”
This is a chain of events linked by a causal expectation , but it stops there .
Human narratives are events and descriptions selected and arranged for meaning .
The question , as always , is one of origins .
Did man invent narrative or , owing to whatever predispositions in his makeup , inherit it ?
Is coming into human consciousness also a coming into narrative — is it part of the nature of human consciousness to seek and create narrative , which is to say meaning ?
What would it mean then that chemicals in combination created meaning , or the idea of meaning , or the tools with which meaning is sought — created that by which their own structure and operation was theorized and questioned ?
If that were true , then “ mere matter ” would have to be defined as having as one of its possibilities that of regarding itself .
We assume that logical thought , syllogistic analytical reason , is the necessary , right thought — and we do so because this same thought leads us to think this way .
No exit , it seems .
Except that logical thought will allow that there may be other logics , though it cannot explicate them .
Another quote from the Harper ’s article , this from Greenberg : “ As a neuroscientist will no doubt someday discover , metaphor is something that the brain does when complexity renders it incapable of thinking straight . ”
Metaphor , the poet , imagination .
The whole deeper part of the subject comes into view .
What is , for me , behind this sputtering , is my longstanding conviction that imagination — not just the faculty , but what might be called the whole party of the imagination — is endangered , is shrinking faster than Balzac ’s wild ass ’s skin , which diminished every time its owner made a wish .
Imagination , the one feature that connects us with the deeper sources and possibilities of being , thins out every time another digital prosthesis appears and puts another layer of sheathing between ourselves and the essential givens of our existence , making it just that much harder for us to grasp ourselves as part of an ancient continuum .
Each time we get another false inkling of agency , another taste of pseudopower .
Reading the Atlantic cover story by Nicholas Carr on the effect of Google ( and online behavior in general ) , I find myself especially fixated on the idea that contemplative thought is endangered .
This starts me wondering about the difference between contemplative and analytic thought .
The former is intransitive and experiential in its nature , is for itself ; the latter is transitive , is goal directed .
According to the logic of transitive thought , information is a means , its increments mainly building blocks toward some synthesis or explanation .
In that thought - world it ’s clearly desirable to have a powerful machine that can gather and sort material in order to isolate the needed facts .
But in the other , the contemplative thought - world — where reflection is itself the end , a means of testing and refining the relation to the world , a way of pursuing connection toward more affectively satisfying kinds of illumination , or insight — information is nothing without its contexts .
I come to think that contemplation and analysis are not merely two kinds of thinking : they are opposed kinds of thinking .
Then I realize that the Internet and the novel are opposites as well .
This idea of the novel is gaining on me : that it is not , except superficially , only a thing to be studied in English classes — that it is a field for thinking , a condensed time - world that is parallel ( or adjacent ) to ours .
That its purpose is less to communicate themes or major recognitions and more to engage the mind , the sensibility , in a process that in its full realization bears upon our living as an ignition to inwardness , which has no larger end , which is the end itself .
Enhancement .
Deepening .
Priming the engines of conjecture .
In this way , and for this reason , the novel is the vital antidote to the mentality that the Internet promotes .
This makes an end run around the divisive opposition between “ realist ” and other modes of fiction ( as per the critic James Wood ) , the point being not the nature of the representation but the quality and feel of the experience .
It would be most interesting , then , to take on a serious experiential - phenomenological “ reading ” of different kinds of novels — works from what are seen now as different camps .
My real worry has less to do with the overthrow of human intelligence by Google - powered artificial intelligence and more with the rapid erosion of certain ways of thinking — their demotion , as it were .
I mean reflection , a contextual understanding of information , imaginative projection .
I mean , in my shorthand , intransitive thinking .
Contemplation .
Thinking for its own sake , non-instrumental , as opposed to transitive thinking , the kind that would depend on a machine - drive harvesting of facts toward some specified end .
Ideally , of course , we have both , left brain and right brain in balance .
But the evidence keeps coming in that not only are we hypertrophied on the left - brain side , but we are subscribing wholesale to technologies reinforcing that kind of thinking in every aspect of our lives .
The digital paradigm .
The Google article in The Atlantic was sub­titled “ What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains , ” ominous in its suggestion that brain function is being altered ; that what we do is changing how we are by reconditioning our neural functioning .
For a long time we have had the idea that the novel is a form that can be studied and explicated , which of course it can be .
From this has arisen the dogmatic assumption that the novel is a statement , a meaning - bearing device .
Which has , in turn , allowed it to be considered a minor enterprise — for these kinds of meanings , fine for high - school essays on Man ’s Inhumanity to Man , cannot compete in the marketplace with the empirical requirements of living in the world .
This message - driven way of looking at the novel allows for the emergence of evaluative grids , the aesthetic distinctions that then create arguments between , say , proponents of realism and proponents of formal experimentation , where one way or the other is seen as better able to bring the reader a weight of content .
In this way , at least , the novel has been made to serve the transitive , goal - driven ideology .
But we have been ignoring the deeper nature of fiction .
That it is inwardly experiential , intransitive , a mode of contemplation , its purpose being to create for the author and reader a terrain , an arena of liberation , where mind can be different , where mind and imagination can freely combine , where memory and sensation can be deployed , intensified through the specific constraints that any imagined situation allows .
The question comes up for me insistently :
Where am I when I am reading a novel ?
I am “ in ” the novel , of course , to the degree that it involves me .
I may be absorbed , but I am never without some awareness of the world around me — where I am sitting , what else might be going on in the house .
Sometimes I think — and this might be true of writing as well — that it is misleading to think of myself as hovering between two places : the conjured and the empirically real .
That it is closer to the truth to say that I occupy a third state , one which somehow amalgamates two awarenesses , not unlike that short - lived liminal place I inhabit when I am not yet fully awake , when I am sentient but still riding on the momentum of my sleep .
I experience both , at times , as a privileged kind of profundity , an enhancement .
Reading a novel involves a double transposition — a major cognitive switch and then a more specific adaptation .
The first is the inward plunge , giving in to the “ Let there be another kind of world ” premise .
No novel can be entered without taking this step .
The second involves agreeing to the givens of the work , accepting that this is New York circa 2004 as seen through the eyes of a first - person “ I ” or a presiding narrator .
Here I have to emphasize the distinction , so often ignored , between the fictional creation “ New York ” and the existing city .
The novel may invoke a place , but it is not simply reporting on the real .
The novelist must bring that location , however closely it maps to the real , into the virtual gravitational space of the work .
Which is a fabrication .
The vital thing is this shift , which cannot take place , really , without the willingness or intent on the reader ’s part to experience a change of mental state .
We all know the sensation of duress that comes when we try to read or immerse ourselves in anything when there is no desire .
At these times the only thing possible is to proceed mechanically with taking in the words , hoping that they will somehow effect the magic , jump - start the imagination .
This is the power of words .
They are part of our own sense - making process , and when their designations and connotations are intensified by rhythmic musicality , a receptivity can be created .
The problem we face in a culture saturated with vivid competing stimuli is that the first part of the transaction will be foreclosed by an inability to focus — the first step requires at least that the language be able to reach the reader , that the word sounds and rhythms come alive in the auditory imagination .
But where the attention span is keyed to a different level and other kinds of stimulus , it may be that the original connection ca n’t be made .
Or if made , made weakly .
Or will prove incapable of being sustained .
Imagination must be quickened and then it must be sustained — it must survive interruption and deflection .
Formerly , I think , the natural progression of the work , the ongoing development and complication of the situation , if achieved skillfully , would be enough .
But more and more comes the complaint , even from practiced readers , that it is hard to maintain attentive focus .
The works have presumably not changed .
What has changed is either the conditions of reading or something in the cognitive reflexes of the reader .
Or both .
All of us now occupy an information space blazing with signals .
We have had to evolve coping strategies .
Not merely the ability to heed simultaneous cues from different directions , cues of different kinds , but also — this is important — to engage those cues more obliquely .
When there is too much information , we graze it lightly , applying focus only where it is most needed .
We stare at a computer screen with its layered windows and orient ourselves with a necessarily fractured attention .
It is not at all surprising that when we step away and try to apply ourselves to the unfragmented text of a book we have trouble .
It is not so easy to suspend the adaptation .
When reading Joseph O’Neill ’s Netherland , I am less caught in the action — there is not that much of it — than the tonality .
I have the familiar , necessary sense of being privy to the thoughts ( and rhythmic inner workings ) of Hans , the narrator , and I am interested in him .
Though to be accurate I do n’t know that it ’s as much Hans himself that I am drawn to as the feeling of eavesdropping on another consciousness .
All aspects of this compel me , his thoughts and observations , the unexpected detours his memories provide , his efforts to engage in his own feeling - life .
I am flickeringly aware as I read that he is being written , and sometimes there is a swerve into literary self - consciousness .
But this does n’t disturb me , does n’t break the fourth wall : I am perfectly content to see these shifts as the product of the author ’s own efforts , which suggests that I tend to view the author as on a continuum with his characters , their extension .
It is the proximity to and belief in the other consciousness that matters , more than its source or location .
Sometimes everything else seems a contrivance that makes this one connection possible .
It is what I have always mainly read for .
This brings me back to the old question , the one I have yet to answer convincingly .
What am I doing when I am reading a novel ?
How do I justify the activity as something more than a way to pass the time ?
Have all the novels I ’ve read in my life really given me any bankable instruction , beyond a deeper feel for words , the possibilities of syntax , and so on ?
Have I ever seriously been bettered , or even instructed , by my exposure to a theme , some truism about existence over and above the situational proxy - experience ?
More , that is , than what my own thinking has given me ?
And how would this work ?
I read novels in order to indulge in a concentrated and directed sort of inner activity that is not available in most of my daily transactions .
This reading , more than anything else I do , parallels — and thereby tunes up , accentuates — my own inner life , which is ever associative , a shuttling between observation , memory , reflection , emotional recognition , and so forth .
A good novel puts all these elements into play in its own unique fashion .
What is the point , the value , of this proxy investment ?
While I am reading a novel , one that reaches me at a certain level , then the work , the whole of it — pitch , tonality , regard of the world — lives inside me as if inside parentheses , and it acts on me , maybe in a way analogous to how materials in parenthesis act on the sense of the rest of the sentence .
My way of looking at others or my regard for the larger directional meaning of my life is subject to pressure or infiltration .
I watch people crossing the street at an intersection and something of the character ’s or author ’s sense of scale — how he inflects the importance of the daily observation — influences my feeling as I wait at the light .
And the incidental thoughts that I derive from that watching have a way of resonating with the outlook of the book .
Is this a widening or deepening of my experience ?
Does it in any way make me better fit for living ?
Hard to say .
What does the novel leave us after it has concluded , resolved its tensions , given us its particular exercise ?
I always liked Ortega y Gasset ’s epigram that “ culture is what remains after we ’ve forgotten everything we ’ve read . ”
We should n’t let the epigrammatical neatness obscure the deeper truth : that there is something over and above the so - called contents of a work that is not only of some value , but that may constitute culture itself .
Having just the other day finished Netherland , I can testify about the residue a novel leaves , not in terms of culture so much as specific personal resonance .
Effects and impacts change constantly , and there ’s no telling what , if anything , I will find myself preserving a year from now .
But even now , with the scenes and characters still available to ready recall , I can see how certain things start to fade and others leave their mark .
The process of this tells on me as a reader , no question .
With O’Neill ’s novel — and for me this is almost always true with fiction — the details of plot fall away first , and so rapidly that in a few months ’ time I will only have the most general précis left .
I will find myself getting nervous in party conversations if the book is mentioned , my sensible worry being that if I ca n’t remember what happened in a novel , how it ended , can I say in good conscience that I have read it ?
Indeed , if I invoke plot memory as my stricture , then I have to confess that I ’ve read almost nothing at all , never mind these decades of turning pages .
What — I ask it again — what has been the point of my reading ?
One way for me to try to answer is to ask what I do retain .
Honest answer ?
A distinct tonal memory , a conviction of having been inside an author ’s own language world , and along with that some hard - to - pinpoint understanding of his or her psyche .
Certainly I believe I have gained something important , though to hold that conviction I have to argue that memory access cannot be the sole criterion of impact ; that there are other ways that we might possess information , impressions , and even understanding .
For I will insist that my reading has done a great deal for me even if I can not account for most of it .
Also , there are different kinds of memory access .
You can shine the interrogation lamp in my face and ask me to describe Shirley Hazzard ’s The Transit of Venus and I will fail miserably , even though I have listed it as one of the novels I most admire .
But I know that traces of its intelligence are in me , that I can , depending on the prompt , call up scenes from that novel in bright , unexpected flashes : it has not vanished completely .
And possibly something similar explains Ortega ’s “ culture is what remains ” aphorism .
In a lifetime of reading , which maps closely to a lifetime of forgetting , we store impressions willy - nilly , according to private systems of distribution , keeping factual information on one plane ; acquired psychological insight ( how humans act when jealous , what romantic compulsion feels like ) on another ; ideas on a third , and so on .
I believe that I know a great deal without knowing what I know .
And that , further , insights from one source join with those from another .
I may be , unbeknownst to myself , quite a student of human nature based on my reading .
But I no longer know in every case that my insights are from reading .
The source may fade as the sensation remains .
But there is one detail from Netherland that did leave an especially bright mark on me and may prove to be an index to everything else .
O’Neill describes how Hans , in his lonely separation from his wife and child ( he is in New York , they are in London ) , makes use of the Google satellite function on his computer .
“ Starting with a hybrid map of the United States , ” he tells ,
I moved the navigation box across the north Atlantic and began my fall from the stratosphere : successively , into a brown and greenish Europe …
From the central maze of mustard roads I followed the river southwest into Putney , zoomed in between the Lower and Upper Richmond Roads , and , with the image purely photographic , descended finally on Landford Road .
It was always a clear and beautiful day — and wintry , if I correctly recall , with the trees pale brown and the shadows long .
From my balloonist ’s vantage point , aloft at a few hundred meters , the scene was depthless .
My son ’s dormer was visible , and the blue inflated pool and the red BMW ; but there was no way to see more , or deeper .
I was stuck .
At the very end of the novel , Hans reverses vantage .
That is , he pursues the satellite view from England — he has returned — looking to see if he can see the cricket field where he worked on Staten Island with his friend Chuck Ramkissoon :
I fall again , as low as I can .
There ’s Chuck ’s field .
It is brown — the grass has burned — but it is still there .
There ’s no trace of a batting square .
The equipment shed is gone .
I ’m just seeing a field .
I stare at it for a while .
I am contending with a variety of reactions , and consequently , with a single brush on the touch pad I flee upward into the atmosphere and at once have in my sights the physical planet , submarine wrinkles and all — have the option , if so moved , to go anywhere .
I find this obsession of his intensely moving , a deep reflection of his personality ; I also find it quite effective as an image device .
To begin with , the contemplation of such intensified action - at - a - distance fascinates — the idea that one even can do such a thing .
And I confess that I stopped reading after the first passage and went right upstairs to my laptop to see if it was indeed possible to get such access .
It is — though I stopped short of downloading what I needed out of fear that bringing the potentiality of a God vantage into my little machine might overwhelm its circuitry .
This idea of vantage is to be considered .
Not only for what it gives the average user : sophisticated visual access to the whole planet ( I find it hard to even fathom this — I who after years of flying still thrill like a child when the plane descends in zoom - lens increments , turning a toy city by degrees into an increasingly material reality ) , but also for the uncanny way in which it offers a correlative to the novelist ’s swooping freedom .
Still , Hans can only get so close — he is constrained by the limits of technology , and , necessarily , by visual exteriority .
The novelist can complete the action , moving right in through the dormer window , and then , if he has set it up thus , into the minds of any of the characters he has found / created there .
This image is relevant in another , more conceptual way .
The reality O’Neill has so compellingly described , that of swooping access , is part of the futurama that is our present .
The satellite capability stands for many other kinds of capabilities , for the whole new reach of information technology , which more than any transformation in recent decades has changed how we live and — in ways we ca n’t possibly measure — who we are .
It questions the place of fiction , literature , art in general , in our time .
Against such potency , one might ask , how can beauty — how can the self ’s expressions — hold a plea ?
The very action that the author renders so finely poses an indirect threat to his livelihood .
No , no — comes the objection .
Is n’t the whole point that he has taken it over with his imagination , on behalf of the imagination ?
Yes , of course , and it is a striking seizure .
But we should not be too complacent about the novelist ’s superior reach .
For these very things — all of the operations and abilities that we now claim — are encroaching on every flank .
Yes , O’Neill can capture in beautiful sentences the sensation of a satellite eye homing in on its target , but the fact that such a power is available to the average user leaches from the overall power of the novel - as - genre .
In giving us yet another instrument of access , the satellite eye reduces by some factor the operating power of imagination itself .
The person who can make a transatlantic swoop will , in part for having that power , be less able , or less willing , or both , to read the labored sequences that comprise any written work of art .
Not just his satellite ventures , but the sum of his Internet interactions , which are other aspects of our completely transformed information culture .
After all my jibes against the decontextualizing power of the search engine , it is to Google I go this morning , hoping to track down the source of Nabokov ’s phrase “ aesthetic bliss . ”
And indeed , five or six entries locate the quote from his afterword to Lolita : “ For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss . ”
The phrase has been in my mind in the last few days , following my reading of Netherland and my attempts to account for the value of that particular kind of reading experience .
“ Aesthetic bliss ” is one kind of answer — the effects on me of certain prose styles , like Nabokov ’s own , or John Banville ’s , or Virginia Woolf’s .
But the phrase sounds trivial ; it sounds like mere connoisseurship , a self - congratulatory mandarin business .
It ’s far more complicated than any mere swooning over pretty words and phrases .
Aesthetic bliss .
To me it expresses the delight that comes when the materials , the words , are working at their highest pitch , bringing sensation to life in the mind .
Sensation … I can imagine an objection , a voice telling me that sensation itself is trivial , not as important as idea , as theme .
As if there is a hierarchy with ideas on one level , and psychological insights , and far below the re-creation of the textures of experience and inward process .
I obviously do n’t agree , nor does my reading sensibility , which , as I ’ve confessed already , does not go seeking after themes and usually forgets them soon after taking them in .
What thou lovest well remains — and for me it is language in this condition of alert , sensuous precision , language that does not forget the world of nouns .
I ’m thinking that one part of this project will need to be a close reading of and reflection upon certain passages that are for me certifiably great .
I have to find occasion to ask — and examine closely — what happens when a string of words gets something exactly right .
We always hear arguments about how the original time - passing function of the triple - decker novel has been rendered obsolete by competing media .
What we hear less is the idea that the novel serves and embodies a certain interior pace , and that this has been shouted down ( but not eliminated ) by the transformations of modern life .
Reading requires a synchronization of one ’s reflective rhythms to those of the work .
It is one thing to speed - read a dialogue - rich contemporary satire , another to engage with the nuanced thought - world of Norman Rush ’s characters in Mating .
The reader adjusts to the author , not vice versa , and sometimes that adjustment feels too difficult .
The triple - decker was , I ’m theorizing , synchronous with the basic heart rate of its readers , and is now no longer so .
But the issue is more complicated still .
For it ’s one thing to say that sensibility is timed to certain rhythms — faster , slower — another to reflect that what had once been a singular entity is now subject to near - constant fragmentation by the turbulent dynamic of life as we live it .
Concentration can be had , but for most of us it is only by setting oneself against the things that routinely destroy it .
Serious literary work has levels .
The engaged reader takes in not only the narrative premise and the craft of its realization , but also the resonance — that which the author creates , deliberately , through her use of language .
It is the secondary power of good writing , often the ulterior motive of the writing .
The two levels operate on a lag , with the resonance accumulating behind the sense , building a linguistic density that is the verbal equivalent of an aftertaste , or the “ finish . ”
The reader who reads without directed concentration , who skims , or even just steps hurriedly across the surface , is missing much of the real point of the work ; he is gobbling his foie gras .
Concentration is no longer a given ; it has to be strategized , fought for .
But when it is achieved it can yield experiences that are more rewarding for being singular and hard - won .
To achieve deep focus nowadays is also to have struck a blow against the dissipation of self ; it is to have strengthened one ’s essential position .
Iceland 's strip clubs are getting the boot .
With the world 's first openly gay head of state as well as the usual raft of envy - inducing Scandinavian policies , it 's being called the most feminist country in the world .
Could it happen here ?
Well , probably not .
We 're talking about a country where almost half the parliamentarians are female , where the banning of commercialized sexual activity ( including brothels and stripping ) was , in a 2007 poll , supported by 82 percent of women and 57 percent of men .

That said , there 's reason to believe that Iceland 's crippling economic crisis — a sort of hyper - speed version of what the U.S. went through — laid the groundwork for empowering the women 's movement there to push ahead such policies .
After all , the post - crisis consensus , explored most prominently in the U.S. in Michael Lewis 's " Wall Street On The Tundra " piece in Vanity Fair ( sadly , not online in full anymore ) , was that male domination of the economy had played a big role in toppling it .
One of the distinctive traits about Iceland 's disaster , and Wall Street 's , is how little women had to do with it .
Women worked in the banks , but not in the risktaking jobs ....
A few days before [ Lewis met a rare female banker ] for instance , she heard banging on the front door early one morning and opened it to discover a little old man .
" I 'm so fed up with this whole system , " he said .
" I just want some women to take care of my money . "

But after its turbulent 2008 , last year Iceland banged on women 's doors in more ways than just money management .
According to an Assocation For Women in Development report ,
Led by Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurdardóttir , the world 's first openly lesbian head of state , banks were nationalized and several women were promoted up the ranks or brought in to head them .
Additionally , several prominent women - led financial firms emerged , espousing a new ‘ feminine ' way of working that shunned ‘ business as usual . '
Critics had attributed the economic downfall to a brash ‘ masculine ' culture that involved buccaneering , financial engineering and reckless , shortsighted decision - making by the male elite , jeopardizing the country 's immediate and long - term economic stability [ . ]

It is in this climate that politician Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir pushed for the stripping ban , which will " will make it illegal for any business to profit from the nudity of its employees . "
Her reasoning : " It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold . "
Whatever you think of stripping , it is fascinating to see how Iceland 's crisis has become opportunity .
Given the relative lack of profound soul - searching that followed the crisis in the United States , it 's hard to imagine something similar happening here .

Then , they will create their own superhero to help us cope .
China ’s undervalued currency is costing the U.S. economy more than $ 200 billion per year in lost growth and is reducing American employment by as much as 1 million jobs , two leading international trade economists claim .
Beijing uses currency manipulation to maintain the value of its currency , the yuan , at an artificially low value , which makes its exports much cheaper and its imports more expensive , charged Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The currency manipulation keeps the yuan , also known as the renminbi , undervalued by 25 percent on a trade - weighted basis and 40 percent relative to the dollar and provides China with an unfair trade advantage in violation of international trading rules , Mr. Bergsten charged .
China vehemently denies that it is a currency manipulator in violation of trading rules and that it engages in unfair trade practices .
Premier Wen Jiabao used a rare press conference Sunday to reiterate China ’s denials and warn other countries against pushing Beijing too hard .
“ We are opposed to the position of engaging in mutual finger - pointing or taking strong measures to force other countries to adjust exchange rates , ” Mr. Wen told reporters in Beijing .
But there was no shortage of finger - pointing Friday in Washington , when Mr. Krugman and Mr. Bergsten spoke at a conference sponsored by the liberal Economic Policy Institute .
Mr. Bergsten described China ’s intervention in the currency market as “ staggering and unprecedented , ” which Mr. Krugman seconded .
Mr. Bergsten estimated China is spending $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion per month to keep its currency undervalued .
The International Monetary Fund ’s rules “ are very clear , ” Mr. Bergsten insisted .
“ They say , ‘ Thou shall not competitively undervalue . ’
With any prolonged , one - way , massive intervention , you are violating the IMF rules of the game , ” he explained .
He also noted that the preferred approaches of “ sweet reason ” and multilateralism have not succeeded in persuading China to change its policies .
“ If the United States wo n’t itself designate China as a manipulator , how can we expect the IMF to do it ? ” he rhetorically asked .
Mr. Bergsten said the exchange rate problems “ totally swamp ” all the adverse effects on U.S. employment caused by free trade agreements , such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada that Congress ratified in 1993 .
Arguing that the United States and other advanced countries face a liquidity trap with short - term interest rates already near zero , Mr. Krugman described a world in which China ’s mercantilist policies injure its trading partners .
China ’s massive trade - related current account surplus , which peaked at 12 percent of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2008 , does “ come at the expense of jobs and employment elsewhere in the world , ” charged Mr. Krugman , who received his Nobel Prize in economics in 2008 for his work on international trade theory .
If China stopped manipulating its currency , it would produce a favorable net export shock to the United States , Europe and Japan amounting to about 1.5 percent of GDP , increasing the U.S. economy by about $ 220 billion , Mr. Krugman estimated .
According to Mr. Bergsten ’s calculations , a 25 percent to 40 percent revaluation in the yuan would reduce the U.S. trade deficit between $ 100 billion and $ 150 billion per year , adding between 750,000 and 1 million jobs to American payrolls .
Robert Scott , a senior economist at EPI , estimated that China ’s currency manipulation cost the U.S. economy between 1.5 million and 3 million jobs .
With America having lost nearly 8.5 million private - sector jobs since the recession began in December 2007 , all three economists acknowledged that addressing the currency problem with China would only partially offset the America ’s biggest jobs slump since the Great Depression .
However , Mr. Bergsten also emphasized that this economic improvement would come at “ no budget cost ” and would be “ a lot better than any fiscal stimulus package . ”
All three economists at the forum endorsed a policy that would label China a currency manipulator when the Treasury Department submits its next semiannual currency report to Congress on April 15 .
Unless China relents and allows its currency to significantly appreciate , Mr. Krugman called for a temporary , across - the - board tariff on all Chinese imports , insisting the chances for a trade war were “ very small . ”
Noting that India ’s prime minister has complained about Chinese mercantilism and Mexico has “ screamed ” about it , Mr. Bergsten even offered a “ guarantee ” that most of China ’s other trading partners would follow suit if the United States imposed a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods .

Calendar buffs will recognize 28 years as an important period , the so - called Solar Cycle in which exactly one leap day will occur on each day of the week and the calendar repeats .
With exceptions that do not apply in our lifetimes , the Gregorian calendar will exactly repeat after 28 years .
You can hang a 1982 calendar on your wall in 2010 and know it 'll work just fine .
It 's a pretty significant fraction of a lifetime , a generation in some families , or a very solid career for an individual ; one is lucky to survive three of them .
A lot can change in that period of time , including the welfare of the Edmonton Oilers .
Special things were happening a Solar Cycle ago ; today , not so much .
So let 's take another skate down memory lane , shall we ?
March 25 , 1982 was a Thursday , of course .
Oilers were coming off a 5 - day layoff after a 5 - game homestand , and heading down the road to Calgary .
The eyes of the hockey world were again still on Wayne Gretzky as he stood on the cusp of another major milestone : the first 200 - point season .
Such a figure was unimaginable before the Great One came along .
13 years earlier Phil Esposito had become the first to hit the century mark , and just two years later Espo had surpassed the 150 - point barrier as well , setting the new standard at 152 .
That mark stood as the high - water mark for a decade , as Art Ross winners routinely posted in the mid-130s each year .
Then Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers arrived on the NHL scene in 1979 .
After merely tying for the scoring lead his first season , Gretzky would demolish Espo 's points record in his sophomore year with 164 , also toppling Bobby Orr 's single - season assists mark and Bill Cowley 's points - per - game record in becoming the first - ever player to average 2 points a game .
To get to 200 required a further increase of 0.5 points per game .
Surely that was impossible !
I knew one person who thought otherwise : me .
On the night of Game One of the 1981 - 82 season I chatted with my buds between periods back behind Section E and we talked of our expectations for the new season .
What new heights could the Great One achieve ?
Thinking of the 94 points he had sniped in the previous year 's second half , I suggested 200 points was within range , and predicted 80 - 120-200 which turned out to be conservative simply by not being quite outrageous enough !
The Great One laid waste to the record books in 1981 - 82 like nobody before or since , inexorably adding points game after game with occasional outbursts of superscoring whenever he got near a milestone or record .
I 've written before of the surge to 50 in 39 , when Wayne scored 15 goals and 10 assists in a 5 - game Christmas homestand , and hit the milestone by being setting an entirely independent record - becoming the only player in NHL history to score 4 + goals in consecutive games .
In Feburary he demolished Esposito 's record of 76 goals ( and his own single - season points record ) with another amazing surge of 4 consecutive 5 - point games , which I 'm virtually certain is also a record of its type .
The young man who said " my dad always told me an assist is as good as a goal " proved it again and again , getting four primary assists before finally scoring himself in Detroit to tie the record .
The next game with the record - breaker on his stick he had a bad angle at an open net and fed it to Jari Kurri with a better angle at that open net , but later demolished the record anyway with a third period natural hat trick to blow open a 3 - 3 game .
When the Oilers returned home in mid-March for a 5 game homestand , Gretzky 's astonishing total stood at 70 GP , 82-105-187 .
" All " he had to do was maintain that 2.6 + P/ G average and we'd see that milestone right at home .
Alas , it did n't quite work out that way .
Gretzky would get blanked by Don Edwards , Kerry Fraser and the Buffalo Sabres in the first game of that stand .
Fraser made an horrific error on a quick whistle to disallow a late tying goal that cost both the Oilers and Gretzky a point .
To his credit , Fraser owned up to the blunder after the game , an impressive move for a young official which gained my respect even as I was ( am ! ! ) still hating on him for the call .
That Fraser is still reffing today , an entire Solar Cycle later , is no mean feat in itself .
The Oilers would not lose another game in 1981 - 82 , not would 99 be held off the sheet .
He resumed scoring with 3 assists against the Canucks , then 2 goals vs. the Kings , before another scoring explosion against the Penguins : 5 points including his NHL record 10th hat trick of the season , also breaking his own assists record in the process with his 110th .
The Oilers also hit double - digits with a 10 - 4 win , surpassing 100 points in the standings for the first time .
That was one celebratory St. Patrick 's Day in Northlands Coliseum , I can tell you .
Needing 3 points in the last game of the stand , Wayne was held in check by the darn Flames for two and a half periods .
Oilers trailed 3 - 1 until Gretzky set up Messier , then scored his 88th of the season 23 seconds later to knot the count at 3 - 3 .
But there the score remained , and so did the point count at a frustrating 199 points .
Wayne looked visibly disappointed when he skated out as the game 's first star .
Written all over his face was " We did n't win , and I did n't get the 200th " .
That matter would have to wait a few days , for the return encounter of the home - and - home .
Unfortunately that game was n't even on the tube locally , so I could merely listen to the voice of the Oilers , Rod Phillips - another Solar Cycle survivor !
congrats , Rod !! - describe the historic moment .
Predictably , it did n't take long .
Just 9:16 into the first period Gretzky " lost " a faceoff in the Calgary zone , retrieved the puck himself , and skimmed it out to Pat Hughes who connected on a one - timer from the high slot , and Oilers had opened the scoring .
There were no ceremonies - the Flames ' plan was simply to shut Gretzky out , haha - but as the PA guy announced the assist , a strange thing happened in the Corral : 7234 true hockey fans rose to give the Great One a brief standing ovation in recognition of his truly extraordinary feat .
( I could hear the ovation , had to trust Rod on the " standing " part . )
Then it was back to business as usual , the Flames fans trying to get on Gretzky 's case , and Wayne successfully getting on theirs by cranking it up .
A couple minutes later he got # 201 , an assist on Dave Semenko 's powerplay marker , and the cheers were considerably more muted . :)
But the best was yet to come , as for yet a third time that season , Wayne would set an independent scoring record in the same game he was achieving a major milestone , exploding midway in the second for a pair of shorthanded markers just 27 seconds apart that blew the game open at 4 - 1 .
From there the Oilers would roll to a 7 - 2 triumph .
The first of these stood up as 99's 12th game winner of the season ; the second was Wayne 's 90th goal of the season , a level which has never again been reached .
Moreover , the two goals together established yet another NHL record - fastest 2 shorthanded goals - as Wayne once again put an exclamation point on his total dominance .
He had surged past 200 points with a relatively modest outburst of 16 points in 5 games , but he stamped his passport in a whole different section of the record book while he was at it .
* * *
Historical notes :
Not only did Gretzky soar through the 200 - point barrier , a week later his Oilers would become the first team to score 400 goals .
Wayne would finish the season with 212 points , in on an astonishing 50.8 % of the team 's 417 GF .
The Oil would go on to score 400 + goals in 5 straight seasons , a feat no other team has ever accomplished ; Gretzky would score 200 points in 4 of those seasons , 196 in the other .
In fact Gretzky has a rank majority ( 9 of 16 ) of all the 150 - points seasons in NHL history , while his first 12 seasons - from age 18 to 30 - all rank among the top 30 seasons of all time .
He was as consistent as he was prolific .
It turned out that the " fastest two shorties " record would be the first of Wayne 's marks to be broken by anybody but himself , as it would fall the very next season to , oddly enough , Pat Hughes , who notched a pair of shorthanded markers in 25 seconds .
It 's also one of the few of Gretzky 's records to ever be approached let alone broken ; the Great One retired in 1999 with 61 official NHL records ; today he has 60 .
He remains the only NHLer ever to score 200 points in a season .
Here 's something I did n't know :
A couple of hours after President Obama signed the health - care bill , an elated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with a group of columnists and commentators , issuing a warning to insurance companies and offering a surprising view of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
Asked if insurance companies might raise their rates on health coverage and blame the increases on the new health - care bill , Pelosi said that the insurance companies should be aware that they ’re not “ automatically included ” in the new health exchanges the bill creates .
“ Unless they do the right thing , they ’re not going in , ” she said .
“ They will be relinquishing the possibility of having taxpayer - subsidized consumers in the exchange , ” she said .
Under the new law , the health exchanges Pelosi referred to will be created in 2014 .
By pulling customers together , they will give individuals and companies a better chance of bargaining when they buy health insurance .
Because the exchanges are expected to serve millions of new customers , insurance companies will want to be part of them .
Kyle Kondik analyses U - S elections at the University of Virginia where he 's the managing editor of Sabato 's Crystal Ball .
He gives his takes on the debate and the latest on the Presidential election .
Professor of sociology and editor of Monthly Review , John Bellamy Foster , talks about the triple crises in the economy , the environment , and the imperial wars and occupations in Iraq , Afghanistan and beyond ..
Excerpt from John Bellamy Foster : " What I 'm trying to suggest here is that we 're facing something else .
It is n't simply a crisis in capitalism ; it 's a crisis of capitalism .
We 're in the midst of a structural crisis of our entire civilisation , which begain , I would say , in the mid-1970s .
We are in the middle of it ; we are not at the end by any means .
But the whole set of problems is getting worse and worse .
" I think that this is crucial to understand .
The problems of empire , the problems of ecology and the problems of economy are all related to this crisis of capitalism , the crisis of our civilisation as it exists .
The system that we know of as capitalism -- and we are forced back to the term `capitalism ' , nobody really talks about ` the free market ' anymore , that metaphor is gone , and we 're forced back to the reality of the society in which we live -- is facing both internal and external limits at this point , and we have to try to understand what these are .

( Newser ) – Glenn Beck ’s meteoric rise has some at Fox News worried that he ’s becoming the face of the network — and ruining any chance it has to be viewed as a legitimate news source .
Anonymous sources at the network tell Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post that Beck is a constant topic of conversation among Fox ’s journalists , who believe he undermines their credibility with his inflammatory rants .
Beck largely operates as an outsider , and has stocked his staff with personal loyalists .
He ’s clashed with Fox over his touring schedule and appearances , and there ’s a network VP assigned to monitor his show — a full - time job .
Some staffers also dish that Beck ’s emotional breakdowns are fully rehearsed .
Asked about it , the president of Beck ’s Mercury Radio said that Beck was “ proud to show his emotions , unlike the cowardly , two - faced critics who hide behind anonymity . ”

MADRID ( Reuters ) - Spanish criminals who stole bank details from computers around the world did not realize the power of the illegal network they had created which could have paralyzed an entire country ’s computer systems , police said .
Police gave a news conference on Wednesday , a day after they arrested three people for what they believe to have been one of the biggest computer crimes ever detected .
They declined to identify the men , aged between 25 and 31 , from small Spanish towns , whom they suspect of infecting more than 13 million computers with spyware .
Police believe the men were not expert hackers and bought their virus program on the black market before using it to take over other people ’s computers in order to create a “ botnet , ” a network of enslaved computers .
“ Fortunately this botnet of 13 million computers was controlled by someone who had n’t realized how powerful it was , ” Juan Salon , the head of the cybercrime unit of Spain ’s Civil Guard Police , told a news conference .
The network would have had much more computing power than the one used in a notorious “ cyber- attack ” on Estonia , police said , adding that it could in theory have been used for a similar assault on a nation ’s vital computer infrastructure .
Estonia accused Russia of being behind the 2007 attack , which swamped websites belonging to many of the country ’s institutions , putting them out of action .
“ Thank God , their criminal mentality was n’t very sophisticated , ” said Salon , who said the men apparently tried to offer their botnet to criminal gangs for hire , but do not seem to have made huge profits although they made a comfortable living .
The criminals used the virus to infect machines -- initially exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Corp ’s Internet Explorer browser -- which then allowed them to record key strokes and login credentials .
This botnet was known as “ Mariposa ” -- the Spanish word for butterfly .
The leader of the gang was caught with personal details of 800,000 people , said the Civil Guard .
Government institutions and companies had also been affected , it said , although it declined to give more details .
This year 's Shell Eco-Marathon was held over this past weekend , and the winner in the top " prototype " category was a bunch of Canadian students .
At first , that might seem surprising , but as it turns out , the students from Laval University won last year , so they seem to be the team to beat .
The Shell Eco-Marathon is right up our alley here at Autopia .
It 's got everything we love : Cars , technology , hi-level geekery , racing – what 's not to love ?
And the numbers the competitor 's return are just mind blowing .
We 've covered it in the past , and were looking forward to this year 's races to see who would come out on top .
Turns out that in 2010 , it was the same team that won in 2009 : A student team from Laval University in Canada .
They brought home the gold in the prototype category from the race in Houston , Texas with a winning miles per gallon figure of 2,487.5 mpg .
The Laval University team 's car used an Alerion Supermileage combustion engine to accomplish the feat .
Interestingly , they were unable to match the MPG figures they set last year , a staggering 2,757.1 mpg .
Although it 's really a race ( of sorts )
Shell calls their Eco-Marathon " an educational competition " .
The whole point is to challenge teams of high school and college students from around the world to design and build very efficient vehicles .
The winners are the teams who can go the farthest distance on the least amount of fuel .
There are annual Eco-Marathon events in the Americas , Europe and Asia .
Other class winners in the Prototype category included the team from Cicero North Syracuse High School in Cicero , New York , that won with a fuel - cell vehicle named the Clean Green Machine that returned the equivalent of 780.9 mpg .
The Purdue University Solar Racing Team with its Pulsar vehicle returned an equivalent of 4,548 mpg .
The winner in the UrbanConcept category was a team from Mater Dei High School in Evansville , Indiana .
They took also the grand prize for the second year in a row returning with Miles per gallon figures of 437.2 mpg in a car named George .
In the video , I demonstrate that A plays better with the .
command than it ’s longhand equivalent : $ a .
The dot command replays the last edit , but it does not replay motions such as $ .
The A command compresses the move to line end motion with the append command into a single edit , making the motion implicit , and therefore repeatable with the .
command .
The video also demonstrates that c{motion} is a contraction of d{motion}i .
Having implicit motion means that the c command also plays well with the dot command .
Implicit motion command Longhand equivalent c{motion} d{motion}i C d$a s xi S ^C I ^i A $ a o $ a < CR >
If you are doing a repetitive task , then composing your brush strokes so that they can be replayed with the dot command can save you a lot of time .
Learning these ‘ implicit motion commands ’ will enable you to exploit the dot command to its fullest .

A new cartoon series , modelled on the American show The Simpsons , is topping the television ratings charts in the former Soviet state of Georgia , weeks after it appeared on screens .
The Samsonadzes , which features a family of yellow , big - eyed characters , has already sparked controversy by including a scene with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Tom Esslemont reports from Georgia .
If London had the grid system of Manhattan , or had been rebuilt entirely like the Paris of Haussmann , then maybe it would have a readily identifiable sound .
After all , you can spot the sound of Manchester – whether it's the Hollies , Joy Division , the Stone Roses or MC Tunes – at 20 paces .
London has always been more fluid , in its architecture and its population .
Different eras , and different postcodes , define the sound of the city at any given time .
The Barbican 's forthcoming Songs
In the Key of London event could have included such mismatched performers as Chas & Dave , Rod Stewart , and Dizzee Rascal on the bill and it would have all made perfect sense .
Instead , along with likely lads Suggs and Chris Difford , it features a bunch of singers who are n't even from London – Robyn Hitchcock is Cambridge to his toes , Kathryn Williams 's Byker Grove accent is a bit of a giveaway .
The reason they will be sharing a stage with compere Phil Daniels is that most of the great London songs have been written by outsiders and suburbanites .
David Bowie , tucked away on the fringes of Kent in Beckenham , wrote a few pre-fame songs in the 60s about moving to the big bad city : Can't Help Thinking About
Me saw him on the station platform , I Dig Everything was a sarcastically joyous arrival ( " I 've got more friends than I 've had hot dinners / Some of them are losers , but the rest of them are winners " ) , and , best of all , the London Boys saw the former Face on his knees , beaten down by the cold , pill - popping demands of the city ; even in 1966 Bowie was ahead of the game , giving Swinging London a scornful kick .
Ray Davies penned the similarly damning Big Black Smoke in the same year , though where Bowie had used a sobbing voice and Tony Hatch 's foggy brass section to highlight the city 's meanness , the Kinks sneered and stomped all over the smashed dreams of the arriviste country girl : " Every penny she had was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes . "
With even more scorn , Sleeper 's Gants Hill - born singer Louise Wener wrote a revenge song for the whole city , winningly entitled Cunt London .
The fact Morrissey hates the whole city has never stopped him writing about it : Dagenham Dave may be a clunky Essex boy caricature but Come Back to Camden is entirely evocative of mouse - ridden bedsits .
He sings of " drinking tea with the taste of the Thames " , the only recorded complaint about the city 's hard water .
The further the writer lives from London the more he is likely to romanticise it .
Bob Merrill wrote such brainless singalongs as How Much Is That Doggie in the Window and Mambo Italiano , but on She Wears Red Feathers – a 1953 No 1 for Guy Mitchell – the singer works in a London bank where " from 9 to 3 they serve you tea " before meeting a native girl ( in a " huly huly skirt " ) who sails back to London for a life of tea - drinking antics in Piccadilly .
It 's ludicrous but adorable .
Another American , Nat D Ayer , wrote Dear Old Shepherds
Bush when he first arrived in London – has anyone else in the world ever thought of that grizzled triangle of grass with such unabashed love ?
If Ayer had spent more than a day or two in his dear old Bush he might have written quite a different song .
Some parts of London are impervious to gentrification or hipness and remain defiantly unloveable .
For the teenage Marc Bolan , a move from happening Hackney to tedious Tooting , where he he was no longer a mod face , was written up in the wry Over the Flats – part glam demo , part music - hall moan .
Finnish band Hanoi Rocks moved to deeply unfashionable SW17 and commemorated their grim times there in Tooting Bec Wreck : " I 'm the sort of case that people find hard to face / I'm the living wreck , I live in Tooting Bec / I 'm the Cosmic Ted spaced out of my head . "
Not a great song , but still the greatest song ever written about Tooting .
You can travel a short distance and the musical climate will change completely .
A few tube stops from from Tooting , Brixton has two solid London classics to its name in Eddy Grant 's Electric Avenue and the Clash 's paranoid but prescient Guns of Brixton , released 18 months before the 1981 riots .
A mile or so east , Camberwell is only celebrated in a comical way – Basement Jaxx have paid winking respect to it three times over with I Live in Camberwell , Camberwell Skies and Camberskank while Gracie Fields 's Heaven Will Protect an Honest Girl has her losing both dignity and clothing in SE5 : " I pawned me shawl in Camberwell / Then me skirt and blouse I sold 'em , and went trampin ' back to Oldham . "
It 's pretty obvious that a cool area like Brixton will inspire songs with a little more gravitas , yet that does n't entirely explain why Brixton songs have an air of impending menace while songs about Portobello Road are almost uniformly skippy and tend to feature a whistling solo :
The Spectrum ( more famous for singing the Captain Scarlet theme ) , Cat Stevens and Caetano Veloso all eulogise London 's most Trumptonesque street .
I put it down to the architecture ; brightly painted Georgian terraces are more likely to inspire a whistle than towering Victorian edifices .
In the 60s , Portobello Road was an oasis of gaiety .
Just a few yards west , Notting Hill was a grim area namedropped by Van Morrison on Friday 's Child , He Ain't Give You None ( " I got messed up 'round somewhere called Notting Hill Gate / I lived up there for a while and when I moved out I was in such a state " ) and the distressing TB Sheets , a British blues about a lonesome death in Ladbroke Grove 's Rachman slums .
Architecture changes , though ; Ladbroke Grove is now as chi-chi as Chelsea was in 1967 .
But not everywhere is upwardly mobile .
It is fascinating to take a square mile of London and see how it has been recorded in song over the decades .
The East End music halls filled and eulogised by Marie Lloyd with songs like The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery at the turn of the 20th century were largely wiped out by the Luftwaffe ; Duncan Browne sang about post - war childhood games
On the Bombsite , referencing the remnants of Garden Street in Stepney ; on Play With Fire , the Rolling Stones mocked the slumming socialite who " gets her kicks in Stepney , not in Knightsbridge any more " ; and in 1993 Pulp – then poverty - stricken students just down from Sheffield – lived in a tower block that was built on Duncan Browne 's rubble , and wrote Mile End to commemorate their less than charming home : " It was on the fifteenth floor , it had a board across the door / It took an hour to pry it off and get inside , it smelt as if someone had died . "
Some districts have a sound that seems to seep , unalterable , from the pavements .
A few miles north west of Mile End is a leafy corner of London which drew in pastoral folkies from St Albans , Kingston , Tanworth - in - Arden and Glasgow – Muswell Hill is where you 'll find a gorgeous arts and crafts pile called Fairport , and this is where a budding psychedelic band called Fairport Convention shacked up in 1967 .
Having settled in the Edwardian suburb , surrounded by woods and parks with jaw - dropping views over the city , their sound quickly mutated into folk rock .
Living within cycling distance were the similarly wistful Sandy Denny ( soon to become their singer ) , Nick Drake , and John and Beverly Martyn .
Clearly the vistas of Highgate Wood and Alexandra Park affected the music of the locale as deeply as Ridley Road market and the semi-dereliction of Clapton and Dalston have dictated jungle / UK garage / grime narrative of the last 20 years .
Manchester denizen Anthony Wilson reckoned that London had no musical soul .
The truth is that it is impossible to pin down , it shifts constantly , which is why the city continues to be a draw for talents who – whether they love the place or not – end up creating its soundtrack .
Take a look on YouTube at a clip of Nico singing I'm Not Sayin ' .
Wandering around an unrecognisable Docklands in 1965 , here 's a German model singing a song written by Canadian folkie Gordon Lightfoot , produced by Hampstead public school boy Andrew Loog Oldham , yet it has the authentic feel – with its chutzpah , its minor chords , its refusenik lyric and foggy air – of something essentially , perfectly London .
Five songs about less celebrated parts of London : New Vaudeville Band – Finchley Central
With its 20s bent and megaphone vocal , this makes for a sunnier ode to London Transport than Down in the Tube Station at Midnight : the singer is nonetheless stood up on the platform having travelled " 10 long stations from Golders Green " for a fee of " two and sixpence " .
Nick Nicely – Hilly Fields 1892
A veteran of just two singles , Nicely still managed to record the best psychedelic songs of the 80s with a mellotron - soaked evocation of a paranormal event at a south London beauty spot .
The only building on Hilly Fields is now a music school .
Elvis Costello – Hoover Factory
" Five miles out of London on the Western Avenue / Must have been a wonder when it was brand new . "
For once , a Costello song is simple , pun -free and heartfelt .
The now listed ( and currently empty ) deco marvel was in danger of demolition at the time that this was recorded ; it 's survival was " not a matter a life and death – but what is ? "
Mott the Hoople – Waterlow
Following a divorce , Ian Hunter wrote this gorgeous cello - led song about walking around the titular Highgate park with his young son in a pushchair .
Mott later gave the London borough of Croydon a much needed high five on Saturday Gigs .
Nadia Cattouse – Bermondsey
" The tide is turning now on barges in Bermondsey . "
The area has changed more than Belize - born Cattouse could have imagined when she sang this in 1969 , just as the docks were starting to close .
Cold but wise , it has a beautiful 2 am feel : " On London Bridge young lovers shiver and gaze at the lamplight in the river . "

Marc Crawford , to borrow a phrase Mike Heika used today on his blog , remains " defiant in his optimism " regarding the Stars chances at playing more than 82 meaningful games .
We can't blame him .
It 's his job .
The general who knows his troops are hopelessly out - numbered cannot admit defeat to his men .
Everyone wants to keep a brave face .
Everyone wants to fight to the death , and more importantly , everyone answers to someone .
The players and coaches will play their roles well until the math runs out .
GM
Joe is watching through his budget - colored - binoculars , after all .
Luckily the rest of us can be a bit more candid in our assessment of the situation , and that assessments is considerably less than good .
Were the Stars season a curling match , ( damn you , Winter Olympics ) the time for handshakes would be fast approaching , if not here already .
Alas , hockey is a business , and every game represents revenue streams and contract commitments left and right .
The feeling of the inevitable must unfortunately make way for the somewhat meaningless hockey that will ensue , and perhaps the team will get the chance to spoil someone else 's season along the way .
But what if it 's not meaningless at all ?
Kicking this thing while it 's down will get it 's fair run on this blog , we promise you that , but in the mean time , we have 14 games to watch .
My Windows calculator tells me that 's 17 % of the season .
It also told me to stop using Firefox .
Weird .
Anyway , this morning there will be no autopsy .
Let 's take a look instead at the 5 best things to watch and look forward to as April 10th nears ...
# 5. Kari Lehtonen .
Two or three more losses down the road , the Stars will be formally eliminated from the playoffs , if not , they 'll be so close that even management must relent and call a " spade a spade . "
When that happens , Marty Turcos ' tenure with the team , having already been through a few symbolic swan songs , will come even closer to an official end .
At some point , the " goaltender of the future " ( and by the way , right now , that future could possibly be the 2010 - 2011 season only as far as a contract goes ) will start to see the majority of the action , or at least an increased work load as his health allows .
These starts will give fans and the front office alike tape on a guy that will command a few million dollars next year .
Kari Lehtonen has not started well for the Stars so far , but his continued return from a lengthy NHL layoff is one of the big reasons I will continue to watch the Dallas this season .
GP MIN W L EGA GA GAA SA SV SV % SO 2009 - Kari Lehtonen 2 98 0 1 8 4.90 50 42 .840 0
# 4 . Brandon Segal
Brandon Segal was picked up just before Olympic break off of waivers from the Los Angeles Kings , and already he strikes me as a bright spot to watch the rest of the season above most else that 's happening with this team right now .
In his Dallas debut , he tallied a goal ( the game winner ) and an assist against the Phoenix Coyotes .
He 's played in only 6 games , has 6 points and is a plus + 4 .
Already he has three multi point games ( Mark Fistric recorded the first of his entire career yesterday ) and somehow got benched the game before against Los Angeles in favor of Brian Sutherby .
( Start Krys Barch discussion here ... no , wait , not now . )
His impact speaks for itself statistically , short though the sample size may be , but his impact passes the eye ball test as well .
We talked about it yesterday during the game :
He just looks impactful out there .
His right shot creates chances that a lineup with 11 left - shot forwards did n't before .
Mike Ribeiro likes playing with right handed shots .
That 's not a bad place to be .
The reason why this is a bright spot going forward ?
Segal is only 26 and is signed for next season at only $ 550,000 .

# 3. Jamie Benn
This one speaks for itself .
I must apologize for things I said back in August and September .
I , of little faith , did not believe that Jamie Benn was ready to make the leap to the NHL , and boy am I glad to be proven wrong .
He is among the leaders in NHL rookie goal scoring .
He has played with a dozen different line combinations .
He has even consented to learn a new position ( center ) for the betterment of his team and his own game .
He 's a big kid who is only 20 years old ( wow ) and he 's only going to get bigger , faster , stronger , and better .
Jamie needs only 3 more goals to reach 20 in his rookie NHL season , and we bet he can do more .
Jamie Benn is a good reason to keep watching this team and hoping for a bright future .

# 2 . Mike Modano
No one knows for sure what Mike Modano wants to do after this season , but let us assume here that Mike is at least as smart as we are .
He sees the writing on the wall .
He knows the financial situation the team is in .
He knows that things are unlikely to change drastically for next season .
He knows that in a little under 3 months , he turns 40 years old .
If Mo wants to come back for another season , there are many who feel that the Stars should let him .
They should let him come back for as many years as he wants , they say .
He 's earned it .
Hard to argue there , but I can't help but wonder if lost in this whirlwind season of disappointment is the " Mike Modano Farewell Tour . "
There 's been very little written about it in papers here or elsewhere , but every time Mike visits Chicago , Montreal , Colorado , Detroit , etc , for the last time , I wonder if he feels it when he leaves those places .
He may not be returning again .
Worst of all , when the Stars play the Anaheim Ducks on April 8th , I worry that Mike Modano 's career will come to a proverbial " thud " of an obscure , uncelebrated end .
I urge everyone to keep an eye on this guy .
Maybe he 'll be back , maybe he wo n't , but I plan to err on the side of caution , appreciating every Mike Modano shift from now until the end , whenever it may be .

# 1. ( Potential ) Sale of the Team
This one you can not see on your television screen .
You can't read about it here at Defending Big D ( not until there 's some real news ) .
You can't hear Ralph Strangis describe it to you on the radio , and you can't listen to BaD radio talk about it on The Ticket just yet .
But it 's out there .
There was a shred of news earlier this year , lending an equally small shred of hope to the Dallas Stars faithful .
It 's not that Tom Hicks was n't a good owner .
He was .
For a very long time he was , you can not deny it .
But he is n't NOW .
Every single conversation we have is framed in this $ 45 million box that everything must fit into , and we 're tired of it .
The # 1 hope , bright spot , whatever , we have going forward is the potential sale of this team .
It might be this off - season .
It might be next off - season .
It might be five off - seasons from now , but it 's going to happen .
And things will get better .
Some day .
That 's my top 5 list .
What is yours ?
What positives and hopefuls did I leave out ?
Sound off in the comments .
Gays and lesbians in Virginia have lost specific protection from discrimination in the workplace after Gov. Bob McDonnell ( R ) reissued the state ’s non-discrimination policy with one group conspicuously absent from the list .
This order is in furtherance of the stated policy enacted by the General Assembly , and specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , sex , color , national origin , religion , age , political affiliation , or against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities .
ADVERTISEMENT
It did n’t take McDonnell long to issue this executive order .
He took office Jan. 16 of this year and signed the order less than three weeks later on Feb .
5 .
The order rescinds the policy of his predecessor Gov. Tim Kaine , a Democrat who promised to be “ fair and inclusive ” in his inaugural address and then — as one of his first actions — added veterans and sexual orientation to the state ’s non-discrimination policy .
Gov. McDonnell assured reporters that his administration is not anti-gay , and that he will work to ensure fair treatment of all workers .
“ The only thing I care about is will they work hard , will they follow the vision that I ’ve outlined for state government , will they have a servant ’s heart , do they love Virginia and will they get results , ” he said .
The gay and lesbian press was not convinced , pointing out that he opposed protecting gays from discrimination when he was the state ’s Attorney General .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Governor has released a policy he recently sent to staff members and Cabinet secretaries indicating that his office would not discriminate “ for any reason , ” but his message could hardly be clearer : discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is not prohibited .
“ People in the commonwealth want individuals to be judged on performance rendered on the job , not their personal lifestyles , ” said House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong , D - Henry .
McDonnell faced opposition during his 2009 campaign for governor when his 1989 graduate thesis emerged , in which he argued that homosexuality could have a negative impact on society .
ADVERTISEMENT
He has stated that his views have changed since then .
Iraq has apparently had enough of the controversial Xe Services LLC , the private military contractor previously known as Blackwater .
The Voice of Iraq reports , “ A total of 250 employees working for the U.S. security firm Blackwater have been dismissed and given seven days to leave Iraq , the Iraqi minister of interior said on Wednesday , according to the semi-official al - Iraqiya TV . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Iraq has ordered about 250 former and current employees of Blackwater Worldwide to leave the country within seven days or face having their visas pulled , ” the Associated Press reports in a breaking story .
The AP adds , “ Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani said on Wednesday the order targets security contractors who worked for Blackwater at the time of the shootout .
He said all ‘ concerned parties ’ were notified of the order three days ago . ”
“ We want to turn the page , ” al - Bolani told AP .
“ It was a painful experience , and we would like to go forward . ”
US Vice President Joe Biden announced during a visit to Baghdad in January that Washington will appeal a judge ’s decision to clear five US security guards accused of killing 14 unarmed Iraqis in 2007 while working for Blackwater .
The five guards , who had been part of a convoy of armoured vehicles , had been charged with killing 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians and wounding 18 others during the attack at a busy Baghdad square using guns and grenades .
ADVERTISEMENT
Iraq says 17 people were killed .
But , on December 31 , US Federal Judge Ricardo Urbina dismissed the charges against the five guards , saying prosecutors violated their rights by using incriminating statements they had made under immunity during a US State Department probe .
The verdict provoked a furor in Iraq .
“ The United States does not tolerate attacks on innocent Iraqi civilians , ” State Department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters in January .
“ Whatever the case ’s ultimate outcome , we deeply regret the suffering and loss of life caused by the Nisour Square shootings , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And we are fully committed to holding accountable persons who commit such crimes , whether at home or abroad , ” Crowley said .
The case was among the most sensational that sought to hold Blackwater employees accountable for what was seen as a culture of lawlessness and lack of accountability in the company ’s Iraq operations .
ADVERTISEMENT
Blackwater , which has since renamed itself Xe , pulled out of Iraq in May , after the US State Department refused to renew its contracts .

Aus Piratenwiki
Dieser Artikel überschneidet sich mit Neupiraten .
Bitte hilf mit , beide zu vereinigen oder diese von-/gegeneinander abzugrenzen .
Dieser Artikel ist keine offizielle Aussage der Piratenpartei ; die Idee ist von Carlos
Wenn du meinst diese Idee erweitern zu können , tu es.
Diskutiert ihr zu mehreren an der Idee , könnt ihr auch die Vorlage : Diskussion setzen .
Diese Seite im Wiki ist allen Neumitgliedern und Interessenten gewidmet , die nicht wissen , wie sie in die Parteiarbeit einsteigen sollten .
Dies ist ein Kurzleitfaden ohne Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit , der in das Dickicht von Privat- , Gruppen - und Parteimeinungen einführt .
Was ist offizielle Parteimeinung ?
Offizielle Statements der Piratenpartei werden mit einem Label gekennzeichnet und für Veränderung durch jedermann gesperrt :
Unter Vorstandsbashing .de werden die Links zu den Vorständen und Protokollen der Vorstände aus Bund , Ländern , Bezirken und Kreisen erfasst .
Sollte euer Vorstand dort noch nicht verlinkt sein , könnt ihr euch bei Bastian melden .
Siehe auch : Protokolle
Parteispenden
Ganz besonders möchte ich auf den Umgang mit Parteispenden hinweisen , weil er sich zum einen wohltuend von den vergesslichen und ehrenwortbehafteten ( ein unrechtmäßig gegebenes Versprechen ist kein Ehrenwort ) Kofferempfängern der CDU abhebt , zum andern aber auch von der noch übleren F.D.P. , welche die Demokratie nach Meinung des Autors stückchenweise zu Lasten zukünftiger Generationen verscherbelt .
Der Kontostand der Bundespiraten beträgt :
Siehe auch : Kontostand Bundesverband
Weitere Details der Gliederungen sind auch abrufbar .
Klar – politische Arbeit kostet auch Geld , insofern sind Spenden stets willkommen , aber bitte nicht Prozente bei der Mehrwert - oder einer anderen Steuer erwarten .
Der Staat ist dank der Misswirtschaft der anderen Parteien eh schon bis über die Halskrause verschuldet .
Parteiausgaben
Entsprechend der Forderungen der Parteibasis wird über die Ausgaben regelmäßig zeitnah Rechenschaft abgelegt .
Wie bekomme ich Kontakt zu Piraten in meiner Umgebung ?
Nutzeraccount im Wiki
Genauso wichtig wie das Finden ist das Gefundenwerden .
Und das ist wesentlich einfacher .
Zunächst einmal sollte man sich einen Account im Wiki besorgen .
Voraussetzung ist eine E - Mail - Adresse und ein Zugang zum WWW .
Mit diesem Account erhält man das Recht , an diesen Seiten mitzuarbeiten .
Eine Mitgliedschaft in der Partei ist dazu nicht nötig , die wird erst gebraucht , wenn man in der Partei Stimmrecht erhalten will .
Privatmeinung kundtun
Jeder Nutzer erhält automatisch einen so genannten Benutzernamensraum , bestehend aus Haupt - und Unterseiten .
Dieser Raum kann vom Nutzer nach eigenem Ermessen zur Selbstdarstellung genutzt werden – solange er sich an die geltenden Gesetze hält .
Sinnvollerweise sollte der Nutzer die Vorlage : Steckbrief benutzen , die die wichtigsten Daten zusammenstellt .
Gibt man Kontaktdaten an , kann man von anderen Piraten erreicht werden .
Am einfachsten geht das , indem man den Quellcode einer anderen Person , z. B. des Erstautors dieser Seite , nimmt und entsprechend anpasst .
Wenn
Sie wissen wollen , wie ein bestimmtes Element erzeugt wird , klicken Sie einfach auf Bearbeiten , um sich den Quelltext anzeigen zu lassen .
Das geht selbst bei gesperrten Seiten wie dem Parteiprogramm .
Sinnvoll ist auch ein kurzer Abriss der eigenen politischen Schwerpunkte .
Das hilft , von den passenden Leuten gefunden zu werden .
Als nächstes sollte man seine Benutzerseite in alle zutreffenden Benutzerkategorien eintragen , damit man gefunden werden kann .
Das erfolgt durch einen Kategorieeintrag auf der eigenen Seite und wird vom System zusammengetragen .
Das gilt sowohl geografisch als auch für besondere Fertigkeiten , die eventuell anderen Mitgliedern wochenlange Einarbeitung ersparen können .
An Wikiseiten mitarbeiten
Jeder kann auf den zur Diskussion stehenden Seiten mitarbeiten .
Dazu muss man lediglich angemeldet sein und auf den Bearbeiten - Verweis klicken .
Die Quellcodesyntax ist die auch in der Wikipedia verwendete .
Mit dieser kann man serverseitiges Einbinden veranlassen , was die Pflege erheblich erleichtert .
So ist z .
B. die aktuelle Mitgliederseite hier ein solcher Einschluss , so dass dieser sich ständig ändernde
Wert nicht ständig manuell angepasst werden muss .
Die Syntax lernt man am einfachsten dadurch , dass man sich Komponenten ansieht und Dinge , die einem gefallen , einfach aus einer Vorlage kopiert und sie dann mit den eigenen Inhalten füllt .
Wenn man Seiten zu neuen Themengebieten erstellt , so kann man diese auch außerhalb des Benutzernamensraums anlegen , sollte sie aber als solche mit der Vorlage imho kennzeichnen , die folgende Anzeige liefert :
Dieser Artikel ist keine offizielle Aussage der Piratenpartei ; die Idee ist von Carlos
Wenn du meinst diese Idee erweitern zu können , tu es.
Diskutiert ihr zu mehreren an der Idee , könnt ihr auch die Vorlage : Diskussion setzen .
Das ist nötig , um Wählern und Journalisten klarzumachen , worum es auf der jeweiligen Seite geht .
Ich habe es immer so gehandhabt , dass ich z .
B. zum Thema Konjunkturförderung ein Original auf meinem
Blog veröffentlicht habe und dann eine Kopie im Wiki , um anderen Piraten die Lizenz zu gewähren , mit dem Text und den Bildern zu arbeiten .
Die Bilder müssen gesondert hochgeladen werden .
Den Link findet ihr rechts unter Werkzeuge .
Habt ihr ein Bild hochgeladen , so könnt ihr es einfach mit seinem Dateinamen einbinden .
Als Beispiel sei hier die Grafik mit dem mathematischen Zusammenhang zwischen „ Zeit nach einer Erfindung in Jahren auf der X - Achse nach rechts “ , „ Akzeptanzgeschwindigkeit einer neuen Technologie auf der Y - Achse nach hinten “ und „ Beschäftigungseffekt auf der Z - Achse nach oben “ aus dem oben erwähnten Artikel eingebunden .
Der Code [ [ Datei:arbeitsmarkt9.gif ] ] erzeugt also folgende Ausgabe :
Wird ein
Text dann von vielen Piraten genutzt und ist mehr als eine Einzelmeinung , so kann er mit der Vorlage Diskussion versehen werden , was dann so aussieht :
Dieser Artikel ist keine offizielle Aussage der Piratenpartei Deutschland , sondern hier findet / fand eine offene Diskussion des Themas statt .
Wenn
Du meinst , diese Idee erweitern zu können , tu es , aber bitte beachte die Diskussionsregeln .
Ist die Idee tragfähig und mehr als eine Einzelmeinung , so kann man das Ganze auch als Entwurf kennzeichnen .
Meinungsbilder im Wiki
Hat ein
Text eine gewisse Reife erreicht , finden im Wiki Probeabstimmungen statt .
Dies geschieht offen , da geheime Abstimmungen zurzeit technisch noch nicht möglich sind .
Als Beispiel möchte ich hier die Anerkennung der Jungen Piraten als Jugendorganisation anführen .
Auf der Seite haben sich fast alle Piraten positiv zu dem Antrag geäußert , so dass von einer Annahme beim Parteitag ausgegangen werden konnte .
Auf diesem
Wege können die Protagonisten im Vorfeld erfahren , wie sich die übrigen zu ihrem Anliegen positionieren .
In kontroversen Situationen geben Piraten auf solchen Seiten auch Einblick , ob sie ein Anliegen rundum ablehnen oder ob nur ein Aspekt des Ganzen Missfallen erregt .
Verlinkung im Wiki
Dadurch , dass Wikiseiten mit Kategorien versehen werden , kann das System halbautomatisch einen Suchbaum aufbauen , mit dessen Hilfe man Piraten an bestimmten Orten oder mit bestimmten Fähigkeiten finden kann , um diffizilere Aktionen zu planen .
Stammtisch im Wiki finden
Am einfachsten geht das , indem ihr auf die Seite mit den regelmäßigen Terminen geht und die Suchfunktion des Browsers verwendet , um die größeren Städte in eurer Umgebung abzuklappern .
Natürlich ist auch die Suche über eine Suchmaschine eurer
Wahl möglich .
Wenn
Du dich vorbereiten willst , kannst Du unter Slang etwas über die piratige Sprache erfahren .
An die Koordinatoren : Pflegt dort bitte eure Stammtische ein .
Danke .

FAQ
Werden bei Austritt zu viel gezahlte Mitgliedsbeiträge erstattet ?
Zitat der Satzung : Ein Anspruch auf Rückzahlung von Beiträgen besteht nicht .
Besteht die Möglichkeit eine Spendenquittung über zu viel gezahlte Mitgliedsbeiträge zu erhalten ?
Nein , dies ist aber auch nicht nötig .
Einkommensteuerrechtlich stehen Mitgliedsbeiträge und Parteispenden gleich , sowohl für die Nutzung des § 34g EStG als auch für die Nutzung nach § 10 b Abs. 2 EStG !
Zuwendungen umfassen Beiträge wie auch Spenden .
Für Beiträge bis 200 € reicht dem Finanzamt laut § 50 EStDV „ der Bareinzahlungsbeleg oder die Buchungsbestätigung eines Kreditinstituts “ .
Ansonsten können gezahlte Mitgliedsbeträge natürlich vom Schatzmeister als solche ( aber eben nicht als Spenden ) bescheinigt werden .
Werbemittel
Wenn man nach Abschluss der Einarbeitungsphase dann selbst zur Mehrung von Wählern und Parteimitgliedern beitragen will , dann stehen einem mittlerweile eine große Zahl von On - und Offline - Werbemitteln zur Verfügung .
Wie bekomme ich aktuelle Trends mit ?
Twitter
twitter.com ist ein Kurzmitteilungsdienst .
Jeder dort veröffentlichte
Text hat maximal 140 Zeichen .
Der Vorteil dieses Dienstes ist es , dass es neben dem Interface auf der Webseite unzählige andere Möglichkeiten gibt , Nachrichten zu versenden oder zu empfangen .
Zum Einen hat jeder Nutzer seine persönliche Liste von Autoren , deren Meldungen er mitlesen will , zum Anderen werden den Nachrichten so genannte Hashtags beigefügt , das sind alphanummerische Zeichenketten , die auf ein " # " - Zeichen folgen .
So wird z.B. ein " #fail " einer Nachricht beigefügt , um ein Versagen anzuzeigen .
Beispiel :
Westerwelle nimmt vorzugsweise Parteispender in Wirtschaftsdelegation auf # fdp - # fail
Das Minuszeichen nach " #fdp " zeigt an , dass der Autor seinen Beitrag in Statistiken als negative Bewertung gewertet sehen will .
Das Gegenteil wäre ein " #piraten + " - Tag , welcher zum Ausdruck bringt , dass das Objekt positiv gesehen wird .
Viele Webseiten blenden Meldungen von Twitter ein .
Beispielweise kann via Google in Echtzeit gesucht werden : google.com .
Es gibt aber auch Seiten , in denen inhaltsbasiert spezielle Postings eingeblendet werden , z.B. die Politikübersichtsseite parteigefluester .de Eine Seite wie wahlgetwitter .de erzeugt regelmäßig Statistiken zum Stimmungsbild der in Twitter veröffentlichen Meinung .
Über die Webseite von Twitter können Codes erzeugt werden , um Nachrichten in die eigenen Webseite einzubinden .
Auch der umgekehrte
Weg ist möglich , dass also eine Webseite es anbietet , einen bestimmten Sachverhalt über den eigenen Twitteraccount zu verbreiten .
Auf der Seite Liste von Piratenpartei -Mitgliedern in Microblogging - Diensten finden sie besonders aktive Piraten - Twitterer , auf der Seite Microblogging die offiziellen Parteigliederungen und die Hashtags wichtiger Aktionen .
Da zündende Ideen weitergeleitet werden , werden Sie auch indirekte Nachrichten erhalten .
Wenn Sie diesen Autoren dann folgen , werden Sie im Lauf der Zeit ganz von allein ein passendes Umfeld zur Diskussion finden .
Der IRC
Der Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) ist ein weltweiter Kommunikationsdienst , der es ebenso vielen tausend Benutzern erlaubt , sich gleichzeitig und in Echtzeit miteinander auszutauschen .
Im Unterschied zu Twitter isr es dort eher unüblich , die kommunizierten Inhalte dauerhaft zu veröffentlichen .
Wir benutzen das IRC - Netzwerk von Freenode .
Es existiert auch noch ein Netzwerk namens PirateNet , das u.a. von den Piratenparteien aus Schweden , Österreich , Finnland und der Schweiz unterstützt wird .
Näheres hier .
Mailinglisten
Mailinglisten sind Verteiler , die eine E - Mail an eine Liste von Empfängern weitergeben .
Bei dem Empfang von Rundschreiben in Form von E - Mails hat das den Nachteil , dass jede E - Mail weitergeleitet wird .
Das führt dann dazu , dass mit einigen wenigen Mitgliedschaften das eigene E - Mail - Fach sehr unübersichtlich wird .
Ich rate daher zu einem sehr sparsamen Gebrauch von Mailinglisten .
Hinzu kommt , dass erstaunlicherweise die Nutzer trotz Transparenzgebot der Mailinglisten in der Mehrheit nicht wollen , dass die Diskussionsbeiträge auch in einem öffentlichem Archiv archiviert werden .
Im Verzeichnis der Mailinglisten können Sie die Mailinglisten suchen .
Ich empfehle , diejenigen zu abonnieren , die Sie aus organisatorischen Gründen brauchen , z.B. um zu erfahren , wann das nächste Treffen " Ihres " Stammtisches stattfindet .
Dann sollten Sie in Ihrem E - Mail - Client einen Filter einrichten , der die Nachrichten in einen separaten Ordner verschiebt und ältere Nachrichten automatisch über eine Regel entsorgt .
Viele Maillinglisten stehen auch als Web Forum und NNTP Groups zur Verfügung .

Blogs
Etliche Piraten bloggen im Internet .
Dies sind Einzelmeinungen .
Aber sich in den Blogs umzusehen hilft zu verstehen , wie Piraten gestrickt sind und welche Probleme sie umtreiben .
Spätestens , wenn es um die Wahl in Parteiämter geht , sollte man diese Blogs lesen .
Schließlich sollte man wissen , für was der Kandidat des Vertrauens denkt und welche Meinungsumschwünge er vielleicht schon gehabt hat .
Der Piratenplanet und der Piratenmond versuchen möglichst viele Piratenblogs zu aggregieren und so einfach abonnierbar zu machen .
Hierbei ist anzumerken , dass der Piratenplanet sowohl offizielle Parteiblogs als auch private Blogs von Piraten enthält .
Auf Wunsch einiger Piraten wurde hier noch einmal eine Trennung vorgenommen , es wurde eingerichtet :
blog.piratenpartei.de für offizielle Parteiblogs
piratenblogs.piratenpartei.de für private Blogs der Piraten .
Piratenradio
Wie heißt es so schön in den Rundfunkstaatsverträgen der öffentlich - rechtlichen Anstalten :
Alle gesellschaftlichen Gruppen sollten Zugang zu den elektronischem Medien des Radio und Fernsehen erlangen .
Dies erscheint überholt .
Jeder kann heute im Internet Rundfunk machen , und Piraten tun das :
Was ist das PiratenRadio ?

When using multiple systems the indispensable tool is , as we all know , ssh .
Using ssh you can login to other ( remote ) systems and work with them as if you were sitting in front of them .
Even if some of your systems exist behind firewalls you can still get to them with ssh , but getting there can end up requiring a number of command line options and the more systems you have the more difficult it gets to remember them .
However , you do n't have to remember them , at least not more than once : you can just enter them into ssh 's config file and be done with it .
For example , let 's say that you have two " servers " that you connect to regularly , one at your house that 's behind your firewall .
Further , let 's say that you use dyndns to make your home IP address known , and that you 've got ssh listening on port 12022 rather than the default port 22 ( and you 've got your firewall forwarding that port to the server ) .
So to connect you need to run :
$ ssh -p 12022 example.dyndns.org
The second system , let 's say is local and you just connect with :
$ ssh 192.168.1.15
The second one is not too bad to type , but a name would be easier .
You could put the name in your /etc / hosts file , or you could set up a local DNS server , but you can also solve this problem using ssh 's config file .
To create an ssh config file execute the commands :
$ touch ~/.ssh / config $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/ config
Now use your favorite text editor to edit the file and enter the following into it :
Host server1 HostName example.dyndns.org
Port 12022 Host server2 HostName 192.168.1.15
The Host option starts a new " section " : all the options that follow apply to that host till a new " Host " option is seen .
The " HostName " option specifies the " real " host name that ssh tries to connect to ( otherwise the " Host " value is used ) .
The " Port " is obviously the port that ssh tries to connect to , if you do n't specify a port , the default port is used .
Now you can connect much more simply :
$ ssh server1 $ ssh server2
These are just a few of the options that you can set in ssh 's config file .
You can also , for example , specify that X11 forwarding be enabled .
You can set up local and remote port forwarding ( i.e. ssh 's - L and - R command line options , respectively ) .
Take a look at the man page ( man ssh_config ) for more information on the available options .
One of the added benefits of using ssh's config file is that programs like scp , rsync , and rdiff - backup automatically pick up these options also and work just as you 'd expect ( hope ) .
File this under “ Seriously Fucked Up ” :
While most of America has been hiding under the covers afraid they might have to confront the ghost of Joe Stack , shooing him away by pretending he was something else –
“ He was a Tea Bagger ! ” / ” He was a liberal ! ” / ” No he was a psychopath ! ” – anything to avoid seriously talking about how profound and how widely popular his suicide - dive - bombing was …here ’s a story that ’s a little easier to chew on .
It comes to you live from Kiddie Land , where there ’s a war on pitting thousands of police and the full force of the law Surging against pre-pubescent doodlers , food - throwers , and tardy students .
Earlier this month , at a New York junior high school , a 12 - year - old girl named Alexa Gonzalez pulled out a green magic marker during class , and doodled , “ I love my friends Abby and Faith . ”
The teacher sent her to the principal , who promptly called the “ Zero Tolerance ” police .
The next thing Alexa knew , New York City ’s finest burst into the principal ’s office , pulled the girl ’s arms behind her back , cuffed her , and frog - marched across the quad , so that all her fellow students and teachers could see her bawling her eyes out on her way to the police station .
That ’ll teach her .
Alexa is a much better person for it , as reported on CNN :
“ They put the handcuffs on me , and I could n’t believe it , ” Alexa recalled .
“ I did n’t want them to see me being handcuffed , thinking I ’m a bad person .
” Alexa Gonzalez missed three days of school because of her arrest .
She spent those days throwing up , and it was a challenge to catch up on her homework when she returned to school , she said .
Her mother says she had never been in trouble before the doodling incident .
Throwing up and traumatized –sounds kind of like what you ’d expect from a Guantanamo Bay inmate who ’s not cooperating .
But America is n’t in its most imaginative–or smart–mood these days , so I guess the thinking is , “ Works well in Abu Ghraib , why fix somethin ’ that ai n’t broke . ”
For New York City ’s school system , that translates into Surging with an additional 5,000 truancy cops whose job is to root out doodlerists and truants and the like .
Unfortunately , with all the budget problems , paying all those cops–poorly trained cops , I might add–means no money left for school counselors , who number just 3,000 , or almost half the number of these new counter - doodling cops .
Alexa is n’t the first doodler - terrorist they ’ve neutralized .
In 2007 , NYC cops arrested a 13 - year - old girl , Chelsea Fraser , for doodling “ Okay ” on her desk .
Within minutes , Operation Zero Tolerance swung into action :
Fraser was arrested at the Dyker Heights Intermediate School on March 30 along with three other male students .
She says she was made to empty her pockets and take off her belt .
Then she was handcuffed and led out of the school in front of her classmates and placed in the back of a police car .
“ It was really embarrassing because some of the kids , they talk , and they ’re going to label me as a bad kid .
But I ’m really not , ” Fraser said .
“ I did n’t know writing ‘ Okay ’ would get me arrested . ”
“ All the kids were … watching these three boys and my daughter being marched out with four — they had four police officers — walking them out , handcuffed , ” [ her mother ] Silva said .
“ She goes to me , ‘ Mommy , these hurt ! ' ”
[ She was ] taken to the 68th Precinct station house where Silva says they were separated for three hours .
“ My child is 13 - years - old — does n’t it stand that I ’m supposed to be present for any questioning ? ” Silva said .
“ I ’m watching my daughter , she ’s handcuffed to the pole .
I ask the officer has she been there the entire time ?
She says , ‘ Yes . ' ”
The ACLU told CNN about several other doodling - arrests which they are now fighting with a class - action lawsuit .
Almost as shocking is the story of a school teacher who was arrested while trying to help one of his students whom the teacher thought was being far too roughly handled .
Police arrested the teacher and charged him with assault , although they later dropped those charges .
That ’s fine for teachers .
But kids ca n’t be shown any mercy , whether we ’re talking about doodling , or food fights .
A couple weeks ago in Chicago , police mass - arrested 25 students aged 11 - 15 following a school cafeteria food fight :
More than two dozen students were slapped with criminal charges in connection with a food fight in the cafeteria at a Chicago charter school .
“ The next thing you know I saw a tray fly up in the air , and then I saw an orange fly , ” student Jordan Grevious said .
‘ Then , I heard the words ‘ food fight . ' ”
But instead of Animal House , these kids are facing the Hot House .
And they know it :
They fear some of the kids will have a tough time getting a job or applying for college until their misdemeanor reckless - conduct charge disappears from their records .
They ’ll appear in court Nov. 30 .
“ These kids are going to have records for things that they potentially did not even do , ” parent Monique Greene complained .
“ Twenty - seven children up here for a food fight . ”
Even the innocent students will face lasting consequences .
If the charges are dropped , juvenile records ca n’t be expunged until the accused becomes 17 .
Parents are worried this could affect future jobs and college applications .
It ’s all part of a meatheaded Zero Tolerance campaign used to terrorize school kids all over the country , part of what ’s making this country a meaner place to grow up in .
Zero Tolerance does n’t work , of course .
The school shootings in middle - class schools still go on with clockwork regularity , fueled in part by the Zero Tolerance mentality .
Zero Tolerance is worse than a failure ; it ’s taking a bad situation and making worse , locking both students into what two studies are calling a “ Schoolhouse - To - Jailhouse pipeline “ :
zero - tolerance policies “ are derailing students from an academic track in schools to a future in the juvenile justice system ” this schoolhouse - to - jailhouse track has damaged a generation of children , particularly children of color , by criminalizing trivial offenses and pushing children out of the school system into the juvenile justice system and introducing prison - like secure environments , with drug - sniffing dogs , metal detectors and uniformed law enforcement personnel , thus turning schools into prisons .
And of course , if you feed more and more doodlers and tater - tot tossers into the prison pipeline , that means you produce more and more criminals ; and if you create more criminals , well , you gotta do something about all those criminals hitting the streets .
Which means : hiring more cops , and training them to attack and pacify any school that ’s threatened –like this exercise recently held in Avoca , New York :
Authorities say with school violence on the rise , being prepared for any situation is key .
On Friday , Steuben County law enforcement officers took part of a mock school shooting drill at Avoca High School .
The purpose : in case of an emergency , local law enforcement officials in Steuben County want to make sure they are prepared .
“ When we get there and have an active shooter we ca n’t wait for a SWAT team to come .
We can ’t .
We have to go in then and have to know who is going in right or left and how we are going to contain the situation , ” says Steuben County Sheriff Joel Ordway .
It ’s so insanely counter - intuitive that it borders on black comedy .
Or just bad comedy .
But that ’s how we like doin ’ things ’round here these days .
The more something fails , the more it will be favored –whether it ’s a bank , a pundit , or a policy on doodling and food fights .

Russell Wiseman , the mayor of Arlington , Tenn. , ( pop. 2,569 in 2000 ) , was infuriated by President Obama ’s address on Afghanistan Tuesday night .
This is what Wiseman posted on his Facebook page , according to the Commercial Appeal in Memphis .
Ok , so , this is total crap , we sit the kids down to watch ‘ The Charlie Brown Christmas Special ’ and our muslim president is there , what a load ….. try to convince me that was n’t done on purpose .
Ask the man if he believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he will give you a 10 minute disertation ( sic ) about it ….w…hen the answer should simply be ‘ yes ’ …. you obama people need to move to a muslim country …oh wait , that ’s America …. pitiful .
Indeed !
Later in the same post , Wiseman dug himself even deeper .
( Yes , this is possible . )
you know , our forefathers had it written in the original Constitution that ONLY property owners could vote , if that has stayed in there , things would be different …….
Indeed !
Wiseman , a vice president and commercial lender at First Capital Bank in Germantown who has twice been elected mayor , has about 1,600 friends on Facebook .
When contacted by the Appeal to discuss his views further , Wiseman declined to elaborate .
“ It ’s ridiculous for someone to send my Facebook post , ” Wiseman said .
“ You guys are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill . ”
It does n’t take a lot of work .
Some California voters are already experiencing the benefits of ranked choice voting such as reduced political polarization , less negative campaigning , and more choice .
On top of that , votes matter more .
Every district becomes a swing district , each vote much more important .
And it eliminates the problem of gerrymandering and makes voting more representative and fairer .

It ’s hard now to recall what an exhilarating moment Seattle was .
It came at a time when most on the left were dispirited and disorientated .
There had been next to no good news from the US of all places for decades Suddenly we could see thousands of activists fighting with riot police not just in America but in Seattle , symbolic capital of a ‘ frictionless ’ , ‘ post industrial ’ capitalism .
The riots and demonstrations at the WTO clearly involved an alliance between young political and environmental activists and workers , the kind of movement that socialists dream of .
What was striking too was that the protests were at the same time seriously militant and impressively big .
And then there were the placards and the singing , which suggested a whole new radical language .
Signs and chants of people before profit , this is what democracy looks like , globalise this , whose streets our streets , resist corporate tyranny , pointed to a combative political generalisation not seen for decades .
The feeling that Seattle marked a break from the wilderness years of the left was confirmed within months when similar protests were organised at business summits round the world .
The most spectacular of the series was a year and a half later at the G8 in Genoa , Italy when delegates were besieged in the centre of the city for 3 days by a total of 300,000 protestors .
Even establishment commentators were able to see that globalisation itself was creating an alarming counter reaction :
The international finance and trade bodies seek to make the world profitable for the same corporations that are running the show in US politics , the demonstrators say ...
Framing the issues in this way has allowed disparate causes to unite against common enemies .
Save the rainforest and anti-sweatshop activists , for example , stand against the same trade and development policies that might boost corporate investment in a poor country engaged in selling off its natural resources .
Global capitalism is unjust and ineffective in these situations , the activists say . [ 3 ]
The movement ca n’t be reduced to the great demonstrations .
In fact what happened after Seattle was only a movement at all in a loose sense .
But Seattle helped to accelerate a linked cycle of protests and strikes and land occupations and mass forums and various kinds of direct action around the world .
It was a cycle that did real damage to the globalisers ’ project .
In the second half of the decade the cycle stalled and the movement went into something of a crisis .
Protests continued and there is a direct line of development from Seattle through to the recent climate protests , but problems were evident in the fall off of the demonstrations and a tiredness about the big anti capitalist conventions .
Now , ten years on , some on the left are writing the whole thing off .
Following the huge and militant climate protests in Copenhagen and at a time of economic crisis and popular contempt for capitalist institutions that ca n’t be right .
What we need to do is try to understand the movement ’s crisis and to learn from its history so we can do our best to reinvent the movement for a new situation .
Looking back over the last ten years , the priority seems to be a rethink of the relationship between spontaneous action and the role that conscious , radical activists need to play to try and influence it .
The double impact of neo liberalism
The neoliberal project launched by Thatcher and Reagan has had a deeply contradictory impact on the left .
On the one hand its been an exhausting and demoralising experience .
By 1999 many on the left were too drained to get excited about anti capitalism .
The movement emerged at a time of confusion and demoralisation .
Many socialists were still reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the right ’s subsequent attacks .
Meanwhile , led by Tony Blair , social democrat leaders almost everywhere were very publicly selling their souls to the purveyors of the free market .
New Left Review Editor Perry Anderson used strong language but expressed a widespread sense of gloom when he wrote in spring 2000 :
“ The only starting point for a realistic left today is a lucid registration of historical defeat .
For the first time since the Reformation there are no longer any significant oppositions , - that is systematic rival outlooks - within the thought world of the West , and scarcely any on a world scale either ” [ 4 ]
Anderson and others were so focussed on the defeats of the 1980s , the impact of the fall of the Soviet Union and the degrading of social democracy that they forgot how the lived reality of capitalism can generate resistance and in the process renew the search for alternatives .
As a result they missed the first great emancipatory movement for decades .
Because as well as dejection neoliberalism has generated resistance and radicalisation .
The programme of neoliberalism involves a permanent attack on the bases of the social compromise that sustained consent for the post war capitalist system .
The problem for neo-liberalism ’s boosters is that most people living it have had a horrible time .
The result is , in the words of the French socialist Stathis Kouvlakis , “ Neoliberalism in France and elsewhere cannot and could not produce anything but weak consensus , passive , essentially by default , relying in the end on the weaknesses of its adversaries .
Its real base scarcely goes beyond some entrepreneurial layers , certain fractions of the better off middle classes and middle management in limited sectors including the dot com industries , new technologies and finance . ” [ 5 ]
This and the inherent aggressiveness of neoliberalism means that its leaders have , in Kouvelakis ’ words , “ domination without hegemony . ” [ 6 ]
However devastating the defeats which ushered it in such a combination was bound to create opposition over time .
Two other characteristics of the project helped encourage a kickback .
Neoliberalism was both highly ideological and internationalised .
Its pioneers knew it would involve frontal attacks on the mass of the population and for that reason spent a lot of time and energy trying to justify the project intellectually .
As the huge gulf between reality and rhetoric became clear this encouraged critiques of the project as a whole .
Meanwhile the attempt by the US and its allies to export the neoliberal model through structural adjustment programmes and other mechanisms - again with a balast of ideological blather - helped activists North and South to see the importance of mutual solidarity .
The US and its allies made the mistake of institutionalising their post Cold War hubris in high profile international gatherings designed to promote or impose their model .
Events like the summits of the World Trade Organisation , the very public gatherings of the group of 8 most powerful economies and the World Economic Forum were perfect rallying points for the new movement of opposition .
But the movement was also shaped by the left ’s crisis .
The feeble showing of social democracy in the face of globalisation had a partly radicalising effect .
In the absence of credible reformist opposition , it was easier to grasp neoliberal capitalism as a total system .
On the other hand the low ebb of much of the radical left meant that Marxist politics was at least at first marginal to the project .
The achievements
However diffuse , the movement made its mark .
Apart from anything else it chased the G8 and the WTO into the hills .
For a long time after Seattle and Genoa the masters of the universe felt unable to meet near any large population centres .
This tactical retreat symbolised real ideological damage .
Economic commentators were seriously concerned that their institutions and their economic policy were falling in to disrepute .
“ The protestors are right to say that the most urgent political moral and economic question of our time is third world poverty .
They are also right to say the wave of globalisation , however powerful it may be , can be turned back .
It is the fact that these two things are true which makes the protestors , and crucially the current of opinion that sympathises with them , so terribly dangerous ” [ 7 ]
They were right to worry .
After Genoa majorities across Europe supported the anti-capitalist protests [ 8 ] and a list of its spokespeople and intellectual supporters from Arundhati Roy to Jose Bove , Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky became the first radical celebrities for decades .
The stalling of the Doha round of negotiations after protests at the 2003 WTO showed the movement had some disorganising impact on the other side .
The movement can also take part of the credit for the current low profile of the IMF , which is still suffering from a terrible image problem .
Just as important the movement helped put radical protesting back in the mainstream .
International demonstrations of the scale and energy of Genoa were something completely new and without them the anti war movement would never have achieved its epic scale or its global reach .
And it would n’t have taken on the radical anti-imperialist character it did at least in countries where the left were able and willing to give it a lead .
The international mobilisations also catalysed new domestic movements .
Famously in Italy the police murder of activists Carlo Guiliani in Genoa led to a wave of mass protests across the country that revitalised the left and lead more or less directly to two or three years of mass mobilisations against the Berlusconi government culminating in a series of mass strikes .
In Spain an anti EU demonstration of 500,000 in Barcelona ‘ against a Europe of Capital and War ’ persuaded the unions to organise Spain ’s the first general strike in eight years [ 9 ] .
In France , Germany , Greece and elsewhere there was a similar interaction between the movement and domestic struggles .
Even in Britain , where the return of working class confidence has been slow , the anti capitalist mood and the anti war movement has helped restore combativity . [ 10 ]
The impasse
Despite its successes , from roughly the middle of the decade the movement experienced a crisis .
You could see it in the tailing off of the demonstrations , fragmentation in some of its key networks like Attac in France , and the stagnation of the movement ’s most characteristic institution - the social forums .
The social forums were monster regional and global assemblies which at their peak drew as many as a hundred thousand activists together in one place to discuss politics and protest .
They launched a host of campaigns including the global anti war demonstrations on 15 February 2003 .
At their best the forums were electrifying manifestations of the desire for a common project for a better world .
The possibilities they suggested were mind boggling .
No one who was there could forget sharing a stadium with tens of thousands of workers and peasants and activists from around the world listening to calls for resistance from Arundhati Roy and Noam Chomsky in Porto Alegre in 2003 or joining the million strong march against capital and war which took over Florence at the ESF in 2002 .
Tragically , although the WSF still meets , it has become something of a ritual , largely irrelevant to any activity .
Partly this is because it was organised round an agreement to deny any kind of internal democratic decision making process .
The forum was to be in the words of Chico Whittaker , one its Brazilian pioneers , ‘ an open space ’ rather than a deliberative gathering . [ 11 ]
This meant that there was no agreed mechanism for debating political approaches or strategic priorities .
Partly as well , though the movement ’s emphasis on internationalism was one of its great strengths , it could conceal weaknesses .
‘ Summit hopping ’- serial demonstrating at international gatherings - had its limits and put off the day when the question of building domestic movements had to be faced .
But these were symptoms of deeper problems , particularly the way in which the movement was in awe of spontaneity .
If some on the left had forgotten the importance of spontaneous struggle , the movement itself worshipped it .
Movement ideas tended to echo the hype of the globalisers that economics reigned supreme .
The revival of autonomist ideas led by Michael Hardt , Tony Negri and John Holloway downgraded politics .
For Hardt and Negri globalisation produces opposition by creating a ‘ smooth space ’ in which the multitude becomes a counterpower because of the erosion of mediating structures like nation state , representative institutions and trade unions . [ 12 ]
These views led to the conclusion that globalisation had superseded the world of competing nation states .
And the emphasis on spontaneity led to an in - principle opposition to any kind of political leadership .
The spontaneity hype was ironic considering the Herculean feats of organisation by often small networks of individuals that co-ordinated the great protests .
And it led to a string of problems .
Naomi Klein , herself an admirer of horizontal , non-hierarchical methods of organisation , was sharp enough to point out their tactical downsides early on .
She describes how a blockade of the IMF in Washington in 2001 ran in to problems because the group at each intersection declared autonomy and there was no central plan .
“ This was impeccably fair and democratic , but there was just one problem - it made absolutely no sense .
Sealing off the access points had been a co-ordinated action .
If some intersections now opened up and other rebel- camp intersections stayed occupied , delegates on their way out of the meeting could just hang a right instead of a left , and they would be home free .
Which is , of course , exactly what happened . ” [ 13 ]
But as the British historian of the movement Ray Kiely points out , the problems went beyond the tactical :
“ A politics which over emphasises autonomy can easily descend into one that advocates local de-linking or , on a personal level , a politics of ‘ dropping out ‘ rather than changing the system .
Certainly there is a fine line between advocating social transformation and retreating from mainstream society and from politics based on social transformation …
one potential result of this approach to politics is that resistance through spectacle ‘ may offer no more than the experience of managed spectatorship . ” [ 14 ]
Alongside the decision to exclude any democratic decision making process from the social forums there was a formal ban on political parties .
Partly this was an understandable reaction to the behaviour of the social democrats , but it was extended to cover all left parties , including the revolutionaries .
The fact was that reformist leaders could find ways round the ban , Presidents Lula of Brazil and Chavez of Venezuela both spoke to crowds of many thousands at the World Social Forums in their countries , activists from less well connected left groups had a harder time .
So , ironically , the result of the hostility to politics was that quite moderate forces came to dominate .
It meant for example that the NGO ’s , also keen to keep radical politics out of the mix , found their place at the movement ’s top table .
The Make Poverty History coalition which helped organise the 200,000 strong protests at the G8 in Scotland in 2005 even tried ( unsuccessfully ) to work with the authorities to keep the issue of the war in Iraq off the main demonstration .
There was a constant tension at the forums between the many who wanted to make links between the various issues that concerned activists , to establish a critique of a whole system , and those who wanted them taken separately .
And , certainly at the WSF events themselves , it was the single issue campaigners who won the day - visibly .
At the last World Social Forum in Porto Allegre the huge site was divided in to massive thematic areas , ‘ the environment ’ , ‘ human rights ’ , ‘ development ’ , ‘ war and peace ’ etc .
You could spend your whole weekend specialising in just one aspect of the problem that confronts us , and many did .
The different approaches inside the movement underline how even radical rationales for keeping politics out of the movement are wrongheaded .
They assume that militant unity is something that just happens in the right circumstances , rather than something that needs to be consciously fought and argued for .
As Gramsci famously argued there is no such thing as a purely spontaneous movement .
Every movement in fact contains activists with various ideas and perspectives .
Even when Social Democracy is at an all time low ebb , sectional and gradualist ideas continue to influence unless actively challenged .
The depoliticisation and lack of real strategic discussion laid the basis for disorientation when difficult questions came up .
Most significantly , 9/11 destabilised the movement .
Though the movement provided a launchpad for the anti war demonstrations , the questions of imperialism , nationalism and racism raised broke the its momentum in many places , particularly the US .
There were many attempts to downplay the war ’s significance .
Some networks like Attac tried to avoid the issue of the War on Terror altogether because it saw war as a diversion from economic issues rather than intimately connected to them .
They wanted to preserve the illusion that neoliberalism could be tackled at the level of economics alone .
The aversion to national politics meant that most of the movement ducked the question of building radical electoral alternatives .
It thus missed one important mechanism for breaking out beyond its activist base and let sometimes less principled radical forces off the hook .
In Italy Rifondazione Communista , an earlier left split from the Italian Communist Party got a huge boost from its impressive participation in the movement at Genoa and beyond and then made the disastrous decision to join a government with a neo liberal programme .
This helped disorganise and demoralise the most powerful movement in Europe at the time , a result which might have been avoided if the movement itself had paid more attention to politics .
In general the suspicion of politics and strategic discussion made crisis almost inevitable .
It meant the movement never faced up to the problem of how to move out from the great mobilisations , how to relate to wider forces in society and start giving a lead to the millions beyond the activist world made to suffer by the system .
Anti-capitalism and the economic crisis
The movement was of course a product of a particular moment , the capture of social democracy by the market just at the time when free market economics was losing all credibility .
But the terms of the contradiction have sharpened since then , partly because of the spate of disastrous and blatantly imperial wars and partly because of the most serious economic crisis since the 1930s .
Meanwhile the threat of climate chaos increases the sense of emergency and vividly illustrates the psychotic short term -ism of our rulers .
The situation is much more dangerous for the ruling class than that of ten years ago .
Crises always tend to expose the apparent separation of the political , the ideological and the economic that is one secret of capitalism ’s ability to survive .
This is particularly true now when states have intervened so generously to save the banks .
Far from resolving the situation , state intervention has raised the crisis to the level of the state , and in so doing made it more dangerous and politicised it .
Politicians have become ( even more ) tainted and the notion of the market as an impersonal force of nature has broken down .
More and more people are making connections between venal politics , a biased , bloated media , trigger happy foreign policy and a corporate world addicted to profit .
The failure of almost every section of the ruling class to spot the problems created by unchecked speculation discredits them all and creates a crisis of legitimacy .
A failure to sort the problem out now would create a full blown crisis of leadership .
Some of the more intelligent pro marketeers sense the extent of the damage .
As one influential US CEO writes “ The Anglo Saxon financial system is seen as having failed .
The global downturn , and all its human devastation is being attributed to that failure … globalisation is in retreat , both in concept and in practice .
Much of the world now sees it as harmful .
Those nations , especially developing ones , that embraced increased capital flows and open trade have been particularly injured . ” [ 15 ]
This is the view from above and this particular commentator is drawing no conclusions about capitalism itself .
Others have .
For what is significant is that apart from stimulus measures , limited financial deregulation and some moves towards protectionism there is no new economic model emerging and certainly nothing resembling a progressive Keynesianism .
Contemporary political economy may well prohibit this as John Bellamy Foster and Fred Magdoff point out .
Short of mass mobilisations state intervention to boost productive jobs and welfare is almost unimaginable in economies as dominated by finance capital as many in the West . [ 16 ]
Far from leading to a return of Keynesian social policy the crisis is generating its opposite ; promises of massive cuts in social spending in order to pay for a public bailout of the banks , which has had little or no impact on bank policy . [ 17 ]
The promised new round of attacks on the welfare state and pay and conditions will hopefully lead to resistance .
But the ideological fall out is immediate and serious .
The Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs pointed out that the moment the bourgeoisie no longer appears to have an understanding of its own system is the moment it “ loses its own qualification for leadership . ” [ 18 ]
Again and again recent opinion polls show unprecedented contempt for people in power .
Not surprisingly bankers have taken the big hits but the disillusion goes much wider .
One British poll taken earlier this year showed only one percent people said they trust politicians , putting them on the bottom of the league table with estate agents .
Bankers actually did better with two per cent . [ 19 ]
A similar US poll showed business executives at a historic low trust rating of 14 per cent with congressmen below them beating only car salesmen , telemarketers and lobbyists .
The recent outcry over MPs expenses in Britain was not mainly about individual misdemeanours but a sense that the whole political class is on the make , captured by the values of a society based on greed .
This sense that democracy is being hollowed out - central to the anti capitalist movement - has led to a crisis in democratic participation almost everywhere .
Across the world there has been a falling away of voter turnout in elections and a parallel break down of party loyalty .
One study shows that in a survey of 15 European countries 75 per cent of the lowest electoral turnouts have been since 1990 .
The study ’s author Peter Mair argues this is a two way process , not just a result of mass disillusion .
Establishment insiders are well aware of the sense of a democratic deficit , but their favoured response is not to reconnect with the electorate but to continue down the road of social managerialism .
Mair quotes influential US social scientist Fareed Zakaria as representing a growing trend : “ what we need in politics today is not more democracy but less . ” [ 20 ]
Such thinking has clearly been influential in New Labour circles .
While Prime Minister Blair himself boasted “ I was never really in politics . . .
I do n’t feel myself a politician even now , ” for him the role of ‘ progressive ’ politics was not to provide solutions from above , but to bring together ‘ dynamic markets ’ and strong communities so as to “ offer synergy and opportunity . ” [ 21 ]
Mair concludes ,
“ The past few decades have witnessed a gradual but inexorable withdrawal of the party leaderships from the realm of civil society into that of government and the state .
Today opposition , when structurally constituted , increasingly comes from outside conventional party politics , whether in the form of social movements , street politics or popular protests .
The parties , on the other hand , are either governing or waiting to govern . ”
The huge stresses imposed by neoliberal economics have had an impact way beyond the economic sphere .
The erosion of mediating mechanisms in civil society that Mair describes is likely to lead to tremendous volatility .
Permanent war and climate chaos
As we have seen , 9/11 and its aftermath had a contradictory effect on the anti-capitalist movement .
But the war led to a massive expansion of protest and in many countries including Britain , Greece , Turkey and Canada the anti-war movement built on the model of broad radicalism first hinted at in Seattle .
In Spain , Britain the US and - alas only temporarily - Italy the movements helped remove warmongering Presidents and Prime Ministers .
The level of popular mobilisation around the war on terror has varied with the fortunes of war and the scale of involvement of particular governments .
It is important to recognise though that neither the onset of economic crisis nor the absurd claims of success in Iraq mean the de-prioritisation of imperialist war by the west .
Certainly no one should believe that President Obama can resolve the central problems that drove the US down the path of the War on Terror in the first place .
In general for the US , military power is still its strongest card in a world that is more and more economically contested .
Specifically , the fact that Iraq has become at best a military stalemate and a public relations catastrophe makes success in Afghanistan virtually essential for the projection of US power abroad .
Hence the otherwise baffling decisions to continue to pump more and more troops in to an obviously failing enterprise .
Britain is locked into its role as junior partner to the US in Afghanistan and elsewhere , as recently retired commander of the British forces Sir Richard Dannatt has very clearly outlined :
“ Succeed we must : our own national security , our credibility and reputation , our strategic partnership with the US , and the future of NATO are all bound up in Afghanistan …
We should not assume that the experience of the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan make intervention less likely … the weight of likelihood is that intervention and stabilisation operations will be the pattern for the future , and with increasing frequency .
Iraq and Afghanistan are not aberrations - they are signposts for the future . ” [ 22 ]
The threat of devestation through climate change is a major mobilising issue in its own right .
But Governments ’ failure to get to grips with the threat - catastrophic in itself - is also horrible evidence of politicians ’ inability to see beyond ‘ economic realities ’- ie profit margins .
Millions are now anxious about the endgame but the mid and short term impact is terrifying too .
Sharp climate swings will increase tensions within the system by creating local economic disasters , resource shortages and huge refugee flows .
The grim conditions that generated the anti-capitalist movement are still here with a vengeance .
Aggressive corporations continue to dictate policies around the world that threaten the fabric of our lives and the very future of the planet .
Far from being sidelined , or trying to limit the worst excesses of corporate greed , national governments continue to pursue neoliberal policies come hell or high water .
Meanwhile the imperialist logic of the economic crisis was spelt out once again by British General Sir Richard Dannatt : “ Ironically the global economic crisis will also serve as a catalyst of global insecurity - increasing the threats and perhaps by extension , the demands on our armed forces . ” [ 23 ]
The challenge for today
Although the social democratic parties are on the retreat in many places and there has been an alarming resurgence of the far right in some countries , there are few signs of tide - turning victories by neoliberal governments .
In South Africa a new strike wave developed last summer out of protests against the pro-capitalist policies of the new ANC government there .
There has been a relatively high level of struggle ever since the end of the 1990s in South Africa , but government officials believe that the rate of protests in 2009 far exceeded those for 2007 and 2008 . [ 24 ]
France has experienced a rumbling crisis for years punctuated by government offensives and huge social struggles that led in 2003 and 2006 to peaks of popular mobilisation bigger than that of May 1968 [ 25 ] .
In Egypt the cycle of mass anti imperialist and pro democracy mobilisations and strikes which marked most of the decade continues .
Despite heavy government repression the free union of taxpayers last year won an important victory for the right to organise . [ 26 ]
Last year too Ireland experienced one of the most spectacular social struggles it has ever seen as 120,000 people took the streets of Dublin to oppose a tax on pensions .
Even in Britain where workers suffered perhaps the worst defeats in Europe in the 1980 ’s , there has been a significant rise in workers combativity - and over the last eighteen months there has been a spate of high profile workers ’ occupations . [ 27 ]
These are no more than snapshots but they show that , far from dissipating , the kinds of resistance which helped to galvanise and sustain the anti-capitalist movement continue in the midst of economic crisis .
And of course in the context of the crisis they take on a new significance .
In these circumstances and with reformist organisations further weakened by events of the last decade , the radical left really can’t afford to stand on the sidelines .
The first crucial point is that we must n’t repeat the mistake of downplaying the political dimensions of the situation .
What we are facing is a compound , societal crisis detonated by economic disaster .
There is a growing minority who see climate chaos , MP ’s corruption , inequality , the growth of the far right and so on all as aspects of a fundamental systemic problem - the fact that society is driven by profit .
Encouraging statistics from Britain for example say that 6 % of young people here when asked , put themselves in the most radical category the ‘ far left ’ .
And this at a time when the far left is going through something of a crisis .
But this politicisation is n’t confined to an activist minority .
Almost everyone is feeling the strains caused by what has come close to system failure .
Because of the feeble showing of the mainstream left anger and rejection remain underground or express themselves in unexpected ways .
That is why the media has often been the only vehicle for outrage at bankers bonuses , politicians kickbacks and general inequality .
The second conclusion is that while its next to inevitable that the state of affairs will produce further resistance , if we are going to learn anything from the last decade it must be that this resistance will not automatically take us safely to our destination .
It is not enough to just encourage , support or glorify the struggles that emerge however important they are .
Lenin called that attitude ‘ tailism ’ and he was right to rail against it [ 28 ] .
The power of ruling ideas does n’t evaporate at the first clarifying scent of struggle .
Reformism remains the first instinct for people brought up in our atomised , hierarchic world .
While a growing minority join the dots and start to understand the way the system works , most people do n’t become revolutionaries or activists just through their own experience .
Nor is it enough for the left to passively ‘ propose alternatives ’ however alluring they may be .
We have to help to generate the networks , movements , campaigns that can give people the ideas , the examples and the confidence they need .
And so the third and final conclusion concerns organisation .
Revolutionaries need to organise together in order to pool our resources and clarify our ideas .
But the only earthly purpose of this is to more powerfully reach out .
The left has to remember that the point of organising as socialists is so we can be part of building movements and united fronts with others that can mobilise the bitterness that millions feel and actually make a difference .
We need to find ways of taking people forward politically , of making the connections on the streets that people are sensing in their minds .
The climate protests at Copenhagen were impressive , the anti war movement remains mobilised and crucial , but how can it be that the left has failed to organise protests over MP ’s expenses , corporate bonuses or even in the last year or more , the bank bailouts ?
The history of anti capitalism is full of ironies .
Despite the widespread downplaying of politics and the highlighting of spontaneity , the truth is the energy and radicalism of the movement helped inspire struggle and resistance around the world .
Now just at the time when such a movement could have an explosive impact it is having trouble getting back on its feet .
One of the reasons for this is that large sections of the left are unconsciously mimicking the autonomists they criticise so fiercely by just hoping that the next strike will break through of its own accord .
Naomi Klein is absolutely right to say that “ what is missing from this populist moment is what was beginning to emerge a decade ago : a movement that does not just respond to individual outrages but had a set of proactive demands for a more just and more sustainable economic model . ” [ 29 ]
But we ca n’t just hope such a movement develops .
We have to show imagination , flair and confidence and be part of making it happen .
Chris Nineham helped organise some of the early international anti-capitalist mobilisations .

[ 28 ] V.I. Lenin Whatis to be Done
Adam Barr writes about Workplace Advantage , a new project going on at Microsoft to rethink how offices are arranged .
“ This is the plan to have people working in flexible space that can be quickly reconfigured into offices , cubicles , open desks , pods , or whatever you want , ” writes Barr .
Microsoft is famous throughout the tech industry for putting literally everyone in individual , private offices , about half of which have windows .
There ’s not much debate that this is the most productive environment for programmers , but not everyone at Microsoft is a programmer .
“ The goal of Workplace Advantage is to reconfigure offices to fit the 4 employee types that were identified after studying the workforce : travelers , orchestrators , concentrators , and providers ( examples of which , respectively , are sales , program management , dev/test , and IT ) , ” Barr reported in an earlier post .
Makes a lot of sense : private offices are n’t right for every type of work .
Not every programmer in the world wants to work in a private office .
In fact quite a few would tell you unequivocally that they prefer the camaradarie and easy information sharing of an open space .
Do n’t fall for it .
They also want M&Ms for breakfast and a pony .
Open space is fun but not productive .
Last summer , the Project Aardvark interns were all in a big open space .
The net result was that there was no such thing as a conversation between two people .
Every time I went out there to talk to one of them , it became a conversation with all of them ; every time two people had to talk , instead of going off to a quiet space somewhere , they just spoke directly to each other , interrupting the other two ’s concentration .
Although this slightly helps keep everyone “ in the loop , ” it also knocks programmers out of flow causing them to lose their concentration and devastating productivity , so I prefer to keep people in the loop using more formal methods , like weekly email status reports , and through informal methods like eating lunch together every day , which is why we have free catered lunches and a really big table .
This summer , we have much more private niches ( not quite offices ) for the summer interns , and I ’ve noticed that when I talk to one of them , the others do n’t even notice and certainly do n’t stop cranking away at their work .
I do n’t think it has hurt communication much , either .
