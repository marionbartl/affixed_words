WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two refrigeration engineers have been convicted by a New Zealand court for depleting the ozone layer .
The country ’s Ministry for Economic Development prosecuted the two men in the first ever case taken under a 1996 law protecting the ozone layer .
The pair released an ozone depleting substance , chlorodifluoromethane HCFC22 , into the atmosphere as they were repairing a drinks chiller , and ignored a warning that it was hazardous .
The Ministry said it took the case as a warning to industry .
The two were convicted and fined NZ $ 750 each ( $ 568 ) .
Permits are needed to handle HCFCs , which will be banned under an international agreement from 2015 .
It is coming up on 2 years post my declaration that only a moron would buy Youtube and that Google was crazy for actually going through with it .
In that period of time , while Youtube traffic has skyrocketed , they have been steadfast in their admission that they have n’t been able to monetize Youtube ’s traffic in a profitable manner .
Youtube has become the poster child for the old saying “ we are losing money on every sale , but we will make it up in volume ” .
To the Youtube fan club , its inconceivable that any website with so much traffic and marketshare could be in anything but an enviable position .
The fan boys would be increasingly wrong .
The Youtube business model is broken and there is no light at the end of the tunnel as they are currently constructed .
The reason is Hulu .
Hulu does n’t serve up more videos than Youtube .
They are n’t even remotely close in number of total users or videos served .
But there is one area in which Hulu is just stomping up and down Youtube , and another in which Hulu is laughing at Youtube all the way to bank .
Lets start with the 2nd , Hulu laughing at Youtube .
Youtube has presented to Hulu something that we can simply call The Youtube Arbitrage .
Whats the Youtube Arbitrage you ask ?
Simple .
Hulu posts clips , not full episodes , clips on its Youtube channel and elsewhere on Youtube .
Those clips are preroll AND overlays AND post rolls promoting Hulu and its full episodes of shows and movies .
All of which costs
Hulu the ginormous cost of ….nothing .
From which it generates traffic to its
Hulu site on which it sells , to the point of often selling out , display and preroll ads .
That ’s the ultimate arbitrage .
We pay you nothing , and you send us traffic that generates ad revenue for us .
Which leads us to the one area , OK lets say two areas that Hulu is just stomping all over Youtube ;
1. Revenue Per Video
2. Revenue Per User
Hulu has one HUGE advantage over Youtube , it has the right to sell advertising in and around every single video on its site .
It can package and sell any way that might make its customers happy .
Youtube on the other hand , has that right for only the small percentage of the videos on its site that it has a licensing deal with .
For probably 99 pct or more of the videos on the site , Youtube is n’t supposed to know what they even are .
How can that be ?
Because Youtube hides behind the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Hulu is a media site that presents videos with advertising .
It can do whatever it wants .
Youtube ts a hosting service .
Its not allowed to know what videos are uploaded by users and its not allowed to generate revenue against those videos .
It can only sell advertising around videos it has licenses to .
Which leads to a question and a prediction .
The Question :
Which site currently has more monetizable video and traffic , Youtube or Hulu ?
I do n’t know the answer .
I ’m guessing that its already a close race and may even be in Hulu ’s favor .
I do know that Youtube ’s need for more monetizable traffic is why they added the check box for Partner Videos .
Notice that those are the only videos that you see ads next to .
The Prediction :
That by next year , not only will Hulu have more monetizable traffic than Youtube , but it will have more total revenues than Youtube as well .
It would n’t sup rise me if they are already at a higher annual run rate than Youtube .
All of which puts Youtube in a VERY BAD spot .
Because Hulu can monetize 100 pct of their growing traffic , they should be in a position to pay for the best content available .
Not a lot of money , but even with the tiniest of guaranteed payments to producers , they will not only attract better content than Youtube , but they will also increase the cost to Youtube for the content they want most to license .
Furthermore , because Hulu knows exactly what they have on the site and can sell 100 pct of it , their professional sales force will be in a better position to package and sell bigger and more profitable ad solutions .
It will be interesting to see how Youtube responds .
As it stands today however , there is no doubt that Hulu , if it does n’t already , will have more monetizable traffic and greater revenues than Youtube going forward .
Which means that the more traffic
Hulu generates , the more money it makes .
The more traffic Youtube generates , the more money it loses ..
Maybe they think they will make it up with even more volume ?
I ’m sure the fan boys are convinced they will .
Liu Keli could n’t tell you much about South Carolina , not even where it is in the United States .
It ’s as obscure to him as his home region , Shanxi province , is to most Americans .
But Liu is investing $ 10 million in the Palmetto State , building a printing - plate factory that will open this fall and hire 120 workers .
His main aim is to tap the large American market , but when his finance staff penciled out the costs , he was stunned to learn how they compared with those in China .
Liu spent about $ 500,000 for seven acres in Spartanburg -- less than one - fourth what it would cost to buy the same amount of land in Dongguan , a city in southeast China where he runs three plants .
U.S. electricity rates are about 75 % lower , and in South Carolina , Liu does n’t have to put up with frequent blackouts .
About the only major thing that ’s more expensive in Spartanburg is labor .
Liu is looking to offer $ 12 to $ 13 an hour there , versus about $ 2 an hour in Dongguan , not including room and board .
But Liu expects to offset some of the higher labor costs with a payroll tax credit of $ 1,500 per employee from South Carolina .

“ I was surprised , ” said the 63 - year - old president of Shanxi Yuncheng Plate - Making Group .
“ The gap ’s not as large as I thought . ”
Liu is part of a growing wave of Chinese entrepreneurs expanding into the U.S. From Spartanburg to Los Angeles they are building factories , buying companies and investing in business and real estate .
Individually , these deals pale next to high - profile investments such as the $ 5 - billion stake China ’s sovereign wealth fund took in Morgan Stanley last year , or state - owned oil giant CNOOC Ltd .'s $ 18.5 - billion bid to acquire El Segundo - based Unocal Corp. in 2005 .
But unlike the suspicion or uproar those moves generated -- CNOOC withdrew its offer amid U.S. political pressure , and the Bush administration and other governments have pushed for a “ code of conduct ” for sovereign wealth funds -- private Chinese businesses such as Shanxi Yuncheng are being wooed by states hungry for investment and jobs .

Last month , Wyoming ’s governor toured firms in China ’s coal - mining country .
Georgia ’s leader brought a team of 40 on a mission to boost trade and attract investment , and Alabama ’s governor paid a visit too .
“ It ’s like a land grab , ” quipped James Rice , Tyson Foods ’ China manager and a board member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai , who has attended some of these states ’ functions in China .
A bit of apprehension
Many Chinese entrepreneurs remain wary of entering the U.S. , uncertain about restrictive visa rules , language and cultural barriers and the political environment .
Recent tensions related to Tibet and the Olympic torch relay have spurred calls in China to boycott Western companies .
But no one says that ’s slowing the march of Chinese companies into the world ’s biggest economy .

“ They do n’t want to miss this opportunity to bottom - fish in the U.S. , ” said Mei Xinyu , an economist at China ’s Ministry of Commerce , referring to the depressed asset prices in a sluggish American economy .
Flush with cash , many Chinese companies want to compete globally .
Others feel they ’ve hit a wall in the domestic market and need to go out to expand sales .
And the Chinese government is urging them on by loosening previously cumbersome restrictions , in part to help Beijing reduce a lopsided trade balance with the U.S. and make the most of its massive foreign reserves .
“ At seminars and talks , government authorities are saying , ‘ You ’re a capitalist ; you should be going out , ’ ” said Fred Hong , a Pasadena lawyer who has worked in Guangzhou for 15 years advising Chinese companies .
One of Hong ’s clients , a Wenzhou man who operates two printing factories in China , recently signed a deal to spend $ 1 million to buy a 60 - worker plant in the City of Industry that makes magnetic cards .
Hong said the man ’s factories had produced strong profit in the last several years , leaving him with a pot of cash .
With the dollar having lost nearly 10 % of its value against the Chinese currency in the last 12 months , the yuan can go a lot further in the U.S .

Changing direction
For years , investment between the U.S. and China flowed one way , with American firms spending billions in the Asian nation .
But the Beijing government ’s $ 5 - billion stake in Morgan Stanley and $ 3 - billion investment in the private equity firm Blackstone Group brought China ’s overall investments in U.S. firms to $ 9.8 billion in 2007 , up from $ 36 million the year before , according to Thomson Financial .
By comparison , U.S. investment in China was $ 2.6 billion last year , down from $ 3 billion in 2006 , said China ’s Ministry of Commerce .
But many Chinese entrepreneurs prefer to keep a low profile , and experts say those figures do n’t include a lot of investment activity happening under the official radar .

Karen Shen , Washington state ’s trade development representative in Shanghai since 2000 , used to focus on promoting exports of Washington - made goods and produce .
Now she ’s helping the state ’s companies and officials hook up with Chinese investors .
Tech companies in China are keen to buy or launch businesses near Redmond - based Microsoft , she said .
In February a Beijing company , ISoftStone Information Service Corp. , went to a Seattle suburb and bought a small technology research and design firm , Akona Consulting .
For ISoftStone , a leading outsourcing firm in China , the acquisition was a way to stay ahead of Chinese rivals .
For Akona , the tie - up was a way to grow faster .
Chinese manufacturers , particularly those that import parts or raw materials from the U.S. , are also looking at setting up assembly operations in Washington .
They would save on shipping costs , Shen said .
What ’s more , land , labor and business - operating costs are soaring in China .
Shen said the president of a Shanghai machinery maker told her that opening a plant in eastern Washington might be more economical than expanding in Shanghai ’s free - trade zone .

“ The president told me the assembly line [ capability ] and quality would be much higher ” in the U.S. , she said , adding that he had n’t made a final decision .
More than 30 states in the U.S. have staff members or representatives in China , according to the Council of American States in China .
With the U.S. economy slumping and unemployment rising , even some tough critics of China and outsourcing are courting Chinese money .
In March , a Missouri delegation included the governor , two U.S. senators , the mayor of St. Louis and two dozen other officials and businesspeople .
Their aim : to get Air China and Chinese officials to back Missouri ’s bid to create an air - freight hub in St. Louis .
California ’s efforts to attract Chinese investment have been more hodgepodge .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger came on a trade mission in 2005 , and state legislators and city governments have visited from time to time to promote California products .
Sacramento has no permanent trade office in China .

Nevertheless , the state ’s proximity to China , diverse economy and large ethnic Chinese population are a big draw for many businesses in China .
In one of the deals last year , China Minsheng Banking Corp. agreed to spend as much as $ 317 million to buy 9.9 % of United Commercial Bank of San Francisco , which serves the Chinese American community .
Capitalizing on growth
Few states have been as aggressive in reaching out to China as South Carolina .
In recent years , 10 Chinese businesses , including appliance maker Haier , have expanded there and created about 2,000 jobs , said John Ling , managing director of South Carolina ’s China office .
That ’s a fraction of the textile jobs the state has lost to Asia , but it ’s a start , he said .
Shanxi Yuncheng is Ling ’s latest catch -- but it took two years .

The company ’s owner , Liu , was reluctant .
He had built his printing - equipment business from the ground up in Yuncheng , an industrial city of 5 million in central China .
In the early 1980s , Liu traveled to Germany and , with a $ 250,000 loan from a state bank , bought a world - class machine that would make the copper cylinders for the gravure method of printing .
Within a decade , Liu ’s company dominated this niche for commercial printing in China .
Today ,
Liu owns more than 80 gravure cylinder - making plants in China and 20 more in a dozen countries , including Mexico , Brazil and Vietnam .
He has more than 10,000 employees , and sales last year surpassed $ 250 million .
Why , he asked himself , should he take the risk of setting up a factory in the U.S. ?
Besides higher labor costs ,
Liu worried that his company and managers would not be welcomed and feel a backlash from the bad publicity about cheap and unsafe Chinese goods .
Advertisement
But the more he thought it over , the more it made sense .
Shanxi Yuncheng was n’t going to grow much faster at home .
Its expansion into Mexico four years ago showed him he could succeed outside Asia .
Although Shanxi Yuncheng ’s labor costs in Mexico are about double China ’s , managers said , the company undercut rivals by offering quicker delivery and better quality and prices .
The company now controls about 30 % of the gravure printing market in Mexico , and its Mexico operations are its most profitable .
“ Being a Chinese company , customers in the U.S. may associate us with low - tech , ” said Liu .
“ It will take time .
People ’s perception can only change little by little with hard work . ”
Liu , the son of farmers , has never been to South Carolina but sees his company ’s move into the U.S. as a source of pride .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a lot of pressure going to the largest market in the world , ” Liu said .
But he thinks it ’s certain to help his business become more competitive .
“ That ’s one of the real benefits from this expansion . ”

NEW YORK — Yoko
Ono has lost her Manhattan legal battle to block the use of John Lennon ’s song “ Imagine ” in a film challenging the theory of evolution .
Lennon ’s widow had sued the makers of “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , ” saying they used parts of the song without her permission .
In a decision Monday , federal Judge Sidney Stein says the filmmakers are protected under the “ fair use ” doctrine .
That permits small parts of a copyrighted work to be used without an author ’s permission under certain circumstances .
Your Sex Industry Questions Answered
Last week Sudhir Venkatesh solicited your questions for Mindy and Dorothy , two of his contacts in the high - end ( and low - end ) sex worker world .
Mindy and Dorothy also had a pop quiz for Freakonomics readers — which you answered enthusiastically ( though not all of you passed ) .
Thanks to Mindy and Dorothy for their generosity and to all of you for your good questions and guesses .
Mindy and Dorothy provide some responses below .
But first … the pop quiz .
1 . What was the most common lawyer fantasy / role play ?
A : Lawyers have one common fantasy , according to high - end sex workers : they want their lady - friend to play the role of “ opposing counsel , ” by visiting them in the hotel room to strike a plea bargain .
I ’ll leave the rest to the imagination .
2 . What ’s the best way to keep the john around for a long time ?
A : Dorothy says that “ the best ” sex workers will try to persuade their clients to discuss their marriages openly :
See , if you can start providing that kind of help , then the man thinks you ’re not trying to hurt him , and he ’ll come back for more .
He ’ll start being one of your regulars , and there ’s nothing better than a man who keeps on paying !
On to the queries :
Q : There were several questions about hiding income from the I.R.S. and planning for the future .
Mindy offered this reply :
MINDY : Most of us ca n’t make investments — we were never trained .
We really operate in a world of cash , and we do n’t tend to think about the future .
But , then again , I would say most people probably are n’t so good at financial planning .
I do n’t report my income .
But sex workers will often form a business — some will style hair , others will do some kind of consulting — in order to start “ cleaning ” their money .
A big problem is that ( if you do n’t start a business or work part - time ) , when you try to apply for a job , you have this huge part of your life that ’s empty .
But that ’s easy : you tell the employer you had kids .
They never ask another question after that .
Q : What are your thoughts on legalization ?
DOROTHY : I think legalization is really bad for the women because they will just get exploited .
They ’ll get paid a lot less and be forced to do a lot more .
I do n’t condone prostitution , but I do understand survival .
Women sell their bodies for survival — I do n’t care how much money they make .
You do n’t want to make that a permanent thing .
Q : How do you deal with cops ?
DOROTHY : If you want to stay in the game , you better keep a police man happy .
You always give a freebie now and then , because most women get caught now and then , especially if you ’re on the streets .
And you always want to tell him he ’s the biggest man you ’ve ever seen .
Men ai n’t that hard to figure out .
MINDY : Every sex parlor or escort service I ’ve ever known has had cops who know what ’s going on .
I ’m not saying that cops get laid , but they do know the clientelle .
Its simple : you keep the police in the know , because you never want to surprise your local officers .
I ’m not an expert on policing , but it seems that police do n’t like surprises .
Q : How difficult is it to transport money at the high end of the sex work market ?
MINDY :
The women who make more than $ 5,000 per visit are the ones who have this problem .
It ’s really not common because most women do n’t actually make that much money — the strip club , the manager , or the escort service takes most of their paychecks .
That ’s what happened to the girl they called “ Kristen ” ( from the Spitzer affair ) .
I recommend that women always hold a part - time job because , if you have a pay check , you have a legitimate bank account .
Then it ’s pretty easy to hide your money .
Q : Is there much mobility from low to high - end sex work ?
DOROTHY : I ’ve seen a lot of women get off the streets and make a lot more money .
They end up doing a dating service , or working at a hotel bar , or maybe they go place an ad on the internet .
But most of these women make about $ 30,000 if they get really successful .
They do n’t make a lot more than that because they have a lot of expenses and they usually have children , rent , and things like that .
They ca n’t keep a full - time job doing anything else while they are selling themselves .
Once in a while you find somebody who meets a rich man — or maybe two or three rich men — and then they hit the jackpot !
These men start liking them , and then they let their friends know , and on and on .
That ’s how you can start earning a lot in the game .
But the women who do this are really smart : they know that the man wants to be treated like a king .
He does n’t just want to get laid ; he wants to know he ’s like a bull in the bed .
He wants to know that he ’s like a President or something like that .
Q : If men pay by the hour , they would want to consume as many acts per hour as possible .
How do sex workers feel about this ?
MINDY : I ’m trying to be delicate with my answer : this usually does n’t happen .
DOROTHY : Is he kidding ?
Q : Mindy , why did you choose a nursing career ?
MINDY : A lot of people probably wo n’t believe this , but much of our work is about therapy .
These men who paid me thousands of dollars control their worlds .
Everyone listens to them .
And , at the same time , they are incredibly insecure people .
Every man I ’ve had as a regular client went through a period of several months where he just cried — and I still got paid .
I pursued nursing because I realized I wanted to relieve people ’s anxieties in a more legitimate way .
Two of the nation 's leading civil liberties organizations and a new organization dedicated to the abolition of software patents have all filed amicus briefs in a patent case that could give the courts an opportunity to revisit the issue of software and business method patents .
The case involves an application for a patent that would cover " a method for managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity " through a series of financial transactions .
Not surprisingly , the Patent Office rejected the application on the grounds that purely abstract ideas are not patentable .
The applicant , Bernard Bilski , the CEO of a small firm called WeatherWise , appealed the patent office 's decision .
Last fall , the case was heard by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which has jurisdiction over patent issues .
But rather than issue a ruling , the Federal Circuit decided to rehear the case en banc , meaning that the case will be re-heard before all of the Circuit 's judges .
Amicus briefs were due this week , and a number of organizations weighed in .
Ars looked at three briefs from prominent public interest organizations .
ACLU : Patents do n't trump the First Amendment
The ACLU 's brief is a rare foray into patent law for an organization that has focused on more traditional civil liberties issues like free speech and privacy .
The ACLU 's interest was piqued by the breadth of the claims in Bilski 's patent application .
In essence , the patent covers not a discrete machine or process , but a broad class of financial transactions .
Indeed , the ACLU points out that it is not even necessary for any financial transactions to take place — merely attempting to initiate the transactions described in the patent could be sufficient to trigger liability .
Which , the ACLU points out , means " All that is necessary in order to violate the claim is that the seller have in his or her mind a purpose ( to minimize risk ) and engage in two conversations . "
It 's not hard to see how this would raise First Amendment issues .
The ACLU asks the Federal Circuit to reaffirm the traditional patent law doctrine that abstract ideas are not patentable .
Or , if the court is unwilling to do that , then the ACLU suggests that the court should squarely address the First Amendment implications of patenting abstract ideas .
EFF : rein in patents on abstract ideas
The EFF brief , which was also signed by Consumers Union and Public Knowledge , took a broader view of the case , asking the court to revise the series of 1990s decisions that have opened the floodgates to the patenting of software , business methods , and other abstract " inventions . "
EFF asked that the Federal Circuit explicitly require that inventions be " technological " — that is , related to a physical device or process .
Purely abstract ideas such as the one at issue in Bilski would be disallowed as " non-technological . "
EFF proposed a new five - factor test to sort out which patents are " technological . "
The prongs of the test are based on the Supreme Court 's landmark rulings on the patentability of software , which date from the 1970s and early 1980s .
EFF 's proposed test is designed to prevent applicants from obtaining patents by adding a trivial " physical " element to a fundamentally abstract concept .
For example , merely executing software ( an abstract idea ) on a computer ( a physical device ) would not render it " technological . "
End Software Patents Project : every company is a software company
Ars covered the launch of the End Software Patents Project back in February .
Like the EFF brief , the ESP brief argues that the key Supreme Court precedents rule out patenting software and other abstract ideas .
The ESP brief also points out that unlike the pharmaceutical or automotive industries , the " information processing industry " is the entire economy .
A patent on a new drug or a new automotive design is likely to only affect a relatively small number of companies in those industries .
But almost every large organization develops software for its own use .
That means that virtually any organization is vulnerable to claims of patent infringement for engaging in ordinary information - processing activities .
The ESP Project has compiled a list of firms that have been sued for violating software patents .
The list includes Foot Locker , Walgreens , the Green Bay Packers , and the Weather Channel .
These are not software companies , yet because of the de facto legalization of software patents , they now face liability for developing or using run -of - the - mill software in their businesses .
Will the Federal Circuit listen ?
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has faced mounting criticism from almost everyone for its handling of patent issues .
The US Supreme Court has slapped down the Federal Circuit 's overly permissive standards for obviousness , and several Supreme Court justices have expressed doubts about the patentability of software .
Meanwhile , concerns over excessive patent litigation have spurred Congress to consider a patent reform bill of its own , albeit a relatively timid one .
And disputes like the BlackBerry patent battle have created a steady drumbeat of bad press for the patent system .
The Federal Circuit 's decision to rehear the Bilski case en banc may be a sign that the Federal Circuit is hoping to stem the tide of criticism my tightening the rules for patenting abstract ideas .
We can only hope they will listen to the advice of public interest groups that are strongly signaling that such patenting has gotten out of control .
OK , Occam's Razor would indicate that Barack Obama has a maternal great uncle ( i.e. , his mother 's mother 's brother ) , named Charles Payne ( middle initial unclear ) who served with the 355th Infantry that liberated one of the camps in the Buchenwald complex , despite previous concerns on that score .
It seems very unlikely that he would have a great uncle by that name , and that someone by that name would have had that service record , who also was an Obama political supporter , and he would put forth such a story , and that they are not the same person , despite the confusion about the middle initial .
So , if we ignore the " Auschwitz " reference , and the fact that he calls his great uncle his uncle ( understandable , given that he had no actual uncles , at least on his mother 's side ) , the story is accurate .
But it 's not that easy to ignore Auschwitz .
That 's because " Auschwitz " has become one of the most emotionally charged words in the English ( well , OK , it 's not English - - it 's German ) language .
It 's one of the most emotionally charged words in any language , for anyone who is aware of what happened there , and few educated people are n't , regardless of their native language .
The word is significant in the context of the Obama campaign for two reasons .
First , because it has such emotional connotations , particularly for Jews , with whom Obama has had trouble closing the deal , it looks like he 's pandering to them .
I 'm not saying that he is , but it has that appearance .
Auschwitz was the site of the deliberate extermination of many of them ( as well as Catholics , Gypsies , homosexuals , and others deemed " unworthy of life " by the National Socialists aka Nazis ) and one might cynically think that an attempt to say that one of his family members was responsible for the liberation of the camp would give that constituency a warmer feeling for him , despite his many foreign policy advisors who clearly are not fans of the state of Israel ( e.g. , Zbig ) .
Buchenwald , on the other hand , while atrocious beyond normal human understanding , was merely a slave labor camp , and not historically abnormal in a time of war .
The people who died there did so under the stress of work and disease , rather than as a deliberate attempt to wipe them off the planet .
Which , of course , says much more about human nature and history than it does about the Nazis .
But beyond that , it is of concern because it reveals a profound ignorance of history and / or geography .
Anyone familiar with the history of World War II knows that Auschwitz ( despite its Germanic name , which like Dansk to Danzig after the conquest in 1939 , was a rename -- the Polish name is Oswiecim ) , was in the occupied country of Poland , which before the war had hundreds of thousands of Jews , and after the war had ... virtually none .
Furthermore , anyone familiar with that history knows that American troops never advanced past the River Elbe , in Germany , and that the Soviet forces advanced all the way across Poland and into eastern Germany , raping and pillaging as they went .
Which is why there was an East Germany .
Has Barack never heard of that " country , " which was a colony of the Soviet Union , of which his mother was not obviously unfond ( to understate the issue ) ?
No one , in other words , familiar with that history , would imagine that an American soldier , under Patton , had contributed to the " liberation " ( scare quotes because the Soviets never liberated anyone -- they only enslaved them ) of Auschwitz .
Obama did n't know this .
Nor , apparently , did anyone on his staff , since he had been spouting the same fable since 2002 and no one had bothered to correct him .
Or if they had , they were ignored .
I 'm not sure which is worse .
Given his unfamiliarity with Jack Kennedy 's less - than - successful negotiations with Khrushchev , it makes one wonder what else he does n't know .
[ Late evening update ]
Some have taken issue of my characterization of Buchenwald as " merely a slave labor camp . "
This has to be taken in context .
I 'm not sure what part of " atrocious beyond human understanding " with regard to that camp the commenters do n't understand .
I was n't excusing it in any way .
I was simply pointing out that in the historical context of war , in which civilians were generally enslaved or killed , and disposed of when they could no longer work , it was hardly abnormal .
Auschwitz ( and Treblinka , and Sobibor , and Chelmo , and Betzec , and Majdenek ) were in a separate class , previously unknown , which gave rise to the term " genocide , " in which the intent was to wipe out an entire people .
I 'm sorry that some do n't get the point .
[ Thursday morning update ]
Well , I certainly seem to have stirred up a hornet 's nest among some .
Let me pick up the remains of the straw men that were strewn around and kicked apart here overnight .
For the record , I did not say , or imply , that Buchenwald was a summer camp .
I did not say , or imply , that the leftist Hitler 's crimes were a " drop in the bucket " compared to the leftist Stalin's .
I did not say , or imply , that working people to death is not murdering them .
I did not say , or imply , that anyone 's death ( including Anne Frank's ) was less tragic because it occurred at Bergen - Belsen than at Auschitz .
I did not say , or imply , that I would " smile with satisfaction " if I were at Buchenwald instead of Auschwitz .
I 'm not sure how to have a rational discussion with anyone nutty enough to have managed to infer any of the above from what I actually wrote .
Also , for the record , I am not now , and have never been a Republican , or ( AFAIK ) a " right winger , " unless by that phrase one means a classical liberal .
As for " sitting down with my Jewish friends and discussing this , " I not only have Jewish friends , but Jewish relatives by blood , or perhaps I should say had , because they include many who doubtless died in both types of camps .
[ Update a few minutes later ]
One other straw man .
I did not say , or imply , that because of this single incident Barack Obama was unfit to be president of the United States .
But it is part , albeit a small one , of a much larger tapestry .
[ One more update ]
To the people in comments asking me what I meant by this , or why I wrote it , I do n't know how to better explain my points than I already have .
If after having actually read it carefully , for comprehension , you still do n't get it , or willfully choose to misinterpret it , I can't help you .
[ Update again ]
OK , I 'll make one attempt , for those who think that I am somehow " minimizing " what happened at Buchenwald .
Perhaps they do n't understand the true meaning of the word " atrocious , " as in the phrase I used , " atrocious beyond human understanding . "
I was n't using it in perhaps a more popular ( and trivial ) sense as " that movie or meal was atrocious . "
I was using it in its most literal sense , as in a place where actual atrocities occurred .
The two words are related , you know ?
[ Update about 9:30 ]
If I change the phrase " merely a slave labor camp , " which is what seems to be generating such irrational fury and umbrage , to " not a site for the extermination of a people on an industrial scale , " will that mollify people ?
Probably not , but I 'll do it anyway .

To the people mentioning bacon grease and bacteria , the alcohol has caused the fat to separate out , hence the plan to filter it through cheesecloth , and anything above about 15 % ABV will kill most bacteria .
That 's why beers and wines never go higher than that , only spirits like vodka can .
Not the OP , by the way , just mentioning it .
This reminds me about an idea I had a while ago for lentil sake , brewed with lentils instead of rice .
I 'd use it for cooking , being teetotal , but it still sounds brutal .
Should I try it ?
What is stackoverflow.com ?
Nothing , yet .
But here ’s the concept :
Programmers seem to have stopped reading books .
The market for books on programming topics is miniscule compared to the number of working programmers .
Instead , they happily program away , using trial - and - error .
When they ca n’t figure something out , they type a question into Google .
And sometimes , the first result looks like it ’s going to have the answer to their exact question , and they are excited , until they click on the link , and discover that it ’s a pay site , and the answer is cloaked or hidden or behind a pay - wall , and you have to buy a membership .
And you wo n’t even get an expert answer .
You ’ll get a bunch of responses typed by other programmers like you .
Some of the responses will be wrong , some will be right , some may be out of date , and it ’s hard to imagine that with the cooperative spirit of the internet this is the best thing we programmers have come up with .
Jeff Atwood and I decided to do something about it .
We ’re starting to build a programming Q&A site that ’s free .
Free to ask questions , free to answer questions , free to read , free to index , built with plain old HTML , no fake rot13 text on the home page , no scammy google - cloaking tactics , no salespeople , no JavaScript windows dropping down in front of the answer asking for $ 12.95 to go away .
You can register if you want to collect karma and win valuable flair that will appear next to your name , but otherwise , it ’s just free .
When I ’m building a new product , my policy has always been to keep quiet about it until I have something to ship .
But this is n’t really a product .
This is a free new community site for programmers around the world and we need your help to design it , to program it , and to build it .
We want to hear your suggestions , hear your ideas , and we ’re going to build it right in front of your eyes .
Thus , the vaporware announcement .
Every week , Jeff and I talk by phone ( he ’s in California , I ’m in New York ) , and we ’re going to record those phone calls and throw them up on the web for you to listen in on , and call it a podcast .
We have a lot of trouble keeping on topic , so the podcast may be interesting to you even if you do n’t want to hear about stackoverflow.com .
The first episode is up right now .
Eventually I imagine we ’ll figure out this newfangled “ RSS ” technology and you ’ll be able to actually subscribe and get fresh episodes delivered into your ears automatically .
All in good time .
Jeff ’s Announcement
PS I ’m still CEO of Fog Creek full time .
StackOverflow.com is a joint venture between Fog Creek and Jeff Atwood .
He ’s the full time CEO which means he ’s calling the shots .
I ’m sort of a consultant on this one .
Economic Daily News reports ( via Engadget ) that Apple will start using LED backlit screens in all of their MacBooks in 2009 .
Steve Jobs had previously announced the intended transition to the environmentally friendly LED screens , but left no exact time - table for the switch .
LED displays were first introduced into the Mac line with the 15 " MacBook Pro in June 2007 .
Advantages of the first Macbook Pro LED screens included :
- extended battery life
- instantly at full brightness , no warm up necessary
- same brightness and color range as previous screens .
The LED screen has since made its way into the 17 " MacBook Pro as a $ 100 upgrade and the MacBook Air as a standard part .
In fact , the MacBook Air 's LED display has been noted to be particularly bright compared to the rest of Apple 's laptops .
Meanwhile , even though the next MacBook revision is expected in the 3rd quarter of this year , MacBook customers may have to wait until 2009 for LED screens .
Using sound and laser technology , researchers have begun to reveal the secrets of the ocean floor from the Sonoma Coast to Monterey Bay .
By creating complex 3 - D maps , they 're hoping to learn more about waves and achieve ambitious conservation goals .
Actor Wesley Snipes clasps his hands together as he arrives at the U.S. Federal Court to stand trial for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and filing a false claim for a $ 7 million refund , in Ocala , Florida , January 14 , 2008 .
Federal prosecutors have recommended that Snipes serve a three - year prison sentence and pay a $ 5 million fine for his conviction in February of failing to file tax returns .
REUTERS / Scott Audette
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Actor Wesley Snipes should serve a maximum three - year prison term and pay a $ 5 million fine for failing to file his income taxes , U.S. prosecutors recommended in a tax - season court filing .
Making an example of Snipes , after years of “ brazen defiance ” of U.S. tax laws aimed at cheating the government of $ 41 million , would help deter other tax avoiders , U.S. Attorney Robert O’Neill of Florida wrote in a court document .
The recommendation was filed on Monday and released Tuesday on the annual deadline for filing U.S. income taxes .
“ This case cries out for the statutory maximum term of imprisonment , as well as a substantial fine , because of the seriousness of defendant Snipes ’ crimes and because of the singular opportunity this case presents to deter tax crime nationwide , ” O’Neill wrote .
Snipes , who starred in the “ Blade ” movies series , was convicted in February on three misdemeanor counts of willfully failing to file federal tax returns for 1999 - 2001 .
Each count carries a maximum sentence of one year .
Snipes was acquitted on two felony charges of filing false claims and fraud in seeking millions of dollars of refunds in other tax years .
Two men affiliated with American Rights Litigators / Guiding Light of God ministries , a Florida - based tax protest organization , were convicted at the same trial , on conspiracy to defraud and false - claims charges .
The sentencing recommendation said Snipes , with the aid of the other two men , “ brazenly waged a campaign ” against the Internal Revenue Service by sending phony claims , filings and demands to the agency and making “ frivolous ” Freedom of Information
Act requests for IRS records .
Couple of key points I ’ve gleaned about Erlang as a language ; first , concurrency is n’t just something it does well , it defines its overall approach to problem solving .
Whereas languages like Smalltalk and Java do things by designing objects and systems of interrelated objects , Erlang breaks a problem into concurrent processes and systems of interrelated processes .
So some design patterns and refactoring patterns from the Java world for instance , wo n’t always have a directly corresponding pattern or refactoring strategy in Erlang , BUT I think the more general principals can still be applied in at least most cases .
Tim Watson does a good job explaining how Erlang ’s dynamic types are similar to dynamic types in Perl or Ruby , and also how they can be used to support a sort of polymorphism .
I wo n’t add much here , except to say that I really like the dynamic type approach as opposed to strong static data types and all kinds of type checking .
One benefit of Erlang ’s concurrency orientation is that it really promotes short functions that are very tightly cohesive , and loosely coupled with other processes .
This means that each function should and typically is designed to do just one very specific job , not several ; that the interface between processes is explicit , and consists just of what messages they can send and receive ; consequently a process generally can’t know or depend on how another process is implemented , just on the process ’
API , namely what messages it sends and receives .
These things promote good software design in different ways , and while I ’m still learning , I strongly suspect at this point that they ’ll tend to make up for any weaknesses due to not being object oriented .

The Legendary Game Pac - Man Has No Meaning .
Let 's take a look at how this word came about .
Actually , Pac - Man first came up …
In a paper published this week in Nature , the authors â€ “ including Dr Ying Ping Wang from The Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research â€ “ say that nitrogen fixation has long been recognised as an important process in controlling responses of many ecosystems â€ “ particularly boreal and temperate forests â€ “ to global environmental change .
" However , there have been significant discrepancies between real - world observations and the theories used to predict nitrogen fixation patterns across major sectors of the land biosphere , " Dr Wang says .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
" We believe our theory provides a unifying framework for nitrogen fixation which can explain the different levels of fixation observed in a wide range of climatically and geographically - defined terrestrial ecosystems right around the world , " he says .
The team found that nitrogen - fixing species in phosphorous - limited tropical savannas and lowland tropical forests enjoyed a clear advantage over nitrogen - fixing species found in mature forests at high latitudes , where modern - day temperatures appeared to have constrained their numbers and nitrogen - fixing abilities .
The team developed two new hypotheses for understanding the distribution of nitrogen fixing plants across global ecosystems .
The first is that temperature constrains the distribution of nitrogen fixation , contributing to the lack of nitrogen - fixing trees in mature forests at high latitudes .
The second â€ “ that nitrogen - fixing plants hold an advantage in terms of their ability to acquire additional phosphorus â€ “ provides an explanation for the persistence of nitrogen - fixing plants in mature lowland tropical forest and savannas .
" Working on the basis of these two hypotheses we have produced a new model , which should help scientists to better predict the effect of climate change on different ecosystems and the interactions between terrestrial biosphere and climate change at decadal - to - century time scales , " Dr Wang says .
President Bernie Machen has proposed that the University of Florida 's Ph.D program in Philosophy , along with two other Arts / Letters Ph.D. programs , be eliminated in the face of the State of Florida 's budget reductions .
In truth , we agree with Dr. Ariew of USF when he states " I do n't have all the figures , but Florida 's canceling its Ph.D. in Philosophy will not result in great savings ; it is a short - sighted and stupid move .
Certainly it will result in a black mark for the " flagship " University in Florida . "
This decision is not only bad for the University of Florida , but sets a dangerous precedent that treats Philosophy programs as expendable or optional , rather than as a crucial component of any institution claiming to teach Liberal Arts .
Sign this petition to show President Machen that this decision is not being taken lightly by the academic community of philosophers .

Even though stevia has not been authorized as a food ingredient in the United States , a number of food , beverage and ingredient companies are investing significant money to expand production for what they view as its inevitable approval .
Stevia , a sweetener derived from a South American plant , is said to have approximately 300 times the sweetness of sugar , with a slower onset and longer duration .
Because it has no significant effect on blood sugar and has essentially zero calories , it has attracted attention as a natural , non-synthetic sugar alternative .
While stevia tends to have a slightly bitter aftertaste , producers claim to have eliminated this drawback with new processing methods .
Although the Food and Drug Association ( FDA ) allows stevia to be used only as an ingredient in dietary supplements , the agency has said that it expects a petition to grant stevia Generally Recognized as Safe ( GRAS ) status any day .
Coca -Cola has filed 24 patent applications for stevia in the United States , and has teamed up with Cargill to begin marketing the sweetener .
Media reports suggest that the companies are preparing to petition the FDA .
Meanwhile , Malaysian ingredient firm PureCircle is raising $ 50 million to expand its stevia production by three times in the next two years .
The company has already secured patents on a technique for extracting Rebaudioside - A , one of the sweeteners found in the stevia plant .
U.S. company Blue California has also developed a process for extracting Rebaudioside - A.
Through comments that its process allows the price of stevia to be competitive with that of sugar , the firm has indicated that it is viewing stevia as more than a dietary supplement .
While the company is only planning to begin small - scale production of the sweetener , it says that it is preparing the infrastructure to be able to scale up significantly once stevia is approved for foods and beverages .
Stevia is approved for use as a food and beverage ingredient in a handful of countries including Brazil , Canada , China and Japan .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Kuwaiti man released from U.S. custody at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2005 blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq last month , Pentagon officials said Wednesday .
This photo of Abdullah Saleh al - Ajmi was posted on a jihadist Web site .
Abdullah Saleh al - Ajmi was one of two Kuwaitis who took part in a suicide attack in Mosul on April 26 , the officials said .
Records show that an attack in Mosul that day targeted an Iraqi police patrol and left six people dead , including two police officers .
An announcement on a jihadist Web site earlier this month declared that al - Ajmi was one of the " heroes " who carried out the Mosul operation .
A second man from Kuwait also took part in the suicide attack , the Web site said .
Pentagon officials who had been keeping track of al - Ajmi said they were aware he had left Kuwait for Syria , a launching ground for terrorists into Iraq .
A video posted on various jihadist Web sites shows a number of images of al - Ajmi , followed by text reading , " May God have mercy on you Abdullah al - Ajmi .
I send you a warm greeting O you martyr , O you hero , O you , a man in a time where only few men are left . "
U.S. military records of Guantanamo detainees indicate that a man with the same name and nationality was held at the Cuban prison .
Those records said al - Ajmi , 29 , was picked up in Afghanistan as he tried to enter Pakistan after the 2001 U.S. invasion .
He claimed to have fought for the Taliban , the records show , and said he fought in a number of battles against the Northern Alliance .
Watch a firefight in Afghanistan »
Though he was never charged with any crime , al - Ajmi was held at Guantanamo through 2005 .
Military documents show he later claimed that his statements about fighting for the Taliban were made after he was threatened while in U.S. custody .
He asserted that he was in Afghanistan to study the Quran .
Al - Ajmi was transferred to the custody of Kuwaiti authorities in November 2005 , with four other Kuwaitis , and was released after a trial there , according to Pentagon officials .
Al - Ajmi is not the first former Guantanamo detainee to reportedly return to the battlefield after being released .
Pentagon officials say there are more than 10 people once held by the U.S. at Guantanamo who have been killed or captured in fighting after being released from the detention facility .
" Our reports indicate that a number of former [ Guantanamo Bay ] detainees have taken part in anti-coalition militant activities after leaving U.S. detention .
Some have subsequently been killed in combat , " said Cmdr. Jeff Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman .
Documents provided by the Pentagon show other former detainees returning to the battlefield , including Abdullah Mahsud , who was released from Guantanamo in 2004 .
He returned to Afghanistan , where he became a militant leader in the Mahsud tribe in southern Waziristan , the documents said .
" We have since discovered that he had been associated with the Taliban since his teen years and has been described as an al Qaeda - linked facilitator .
" In mid-October 2004 , Mahsud directed the kidnapping of two Chinese engineers in Pakistan .
During rescue operations by Pakistani forces , a kidnapper shot one of the hostages .
Five of the kidnappers were killed .
Mahsud was not among them , " the documents provided by the Pentagon said .
" As these facts illustrate , there is an implied future risk to U.S. and allied interests with every detainee who is released or transferred from Guantanamo , " Gordon said .
Reports of former detainees returning to the battlefield show they are dedicated to their cause and have been trained to be deceptive , the Pentagon officials said , but such factors will not prevent the release of other detainees from Guantanamo Bay .
Of the more than 500 detainees released from Guantanamo since the detention camp was opened in 2002 , 38 have been stripped of their " enemy combatant " status and determined to pose no future threat to the United States .
The remaining 462 were repatriated to home countries or resettled to third - party countries and still considered a threat , Pentagon records show .
Some countries have since released those detainees back into the public , according to various reports .
The United States is still holding about 65 detainees scheduled to be released to their home governments .
But before that can happen , the United States has to get assurances the detainees will not be persecuted or harmed when they arrive home , Pentagon officials have said .
" We have no desire to be the world 's jailer , which is why the 500 were allowed to depart , " Gordon said .
There are about 270 detainees still held at the U.S. prison camp in Cuba .

Playing Brain AgeAnyone who has ever begged their parents for a videogame system knows the standard lines of appeal ( " You do n't want me to have inferior hand - eye coordination , do you ? " ) .
Now kids can argue that some games may make them smarter .
That 's the promise of Nintendo 's Brain Age , which claims to " help train your memory and keep your mind sharp " through reading exercises , math puzzles , and other mental gymnastics .
After diligent effort , players routinely see their " brain age " plummet from , say , a sluggish 60 to a taut 30 .
But the improved performance may not be a sign of wit- sharpening .
Many users start with little gaming experience , so it 's not surprising that their scores improve — a phenomenon known as the practice effect .
Sadly , there 's no evidence that in - game gains translate to the real world .

Doing Crosswords__Completing__ that Sunday New York
Times crossword puzzle is n't just a diverting — if usually futile — pastime .
It 's also a great way to keep your wits about you as you age .
At least that 's the common belief , which holds that a regular schedule of cognitive exercise can bulk up your brain with new neurons , the same way vigorous weight lifting can build muscle mass .
You can continue to sprout new neurons well into adulthood , but they will be only as powerful as the neural networks they 're connected to .
And it 's not clear that puzzles help forge those connections .
Some studies have reported that mental exercise can slow or reverse cognitive decline .
But aging expert Timothy Salthouse of the University of Virginia says the evidence is all correlational , not causal :
The respondents who were most drawn to mental exercise or pursued brain - intensive professions probably had greater cognitive reserves to begin with .
So no , crossword puzzles probably wo n't fend off senility .
What 's a four - letter word for " commonly held but unproven belief " ?
Oh , right : myth . — G.L .
Eating Fish__Herman Melville__ .
Ernest Hemingway .
Schröedinger 's cat .
Some of our brightest minds had a thing for seafood .
That may be no coincidence .
Oily fish are rich in docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , an omega - 3 fatty acid that accounts for 40 percent of the makeup of brain cell membranes and which could improve neurotransmission .
DHA is necessary for fetal brain development , and a handful of studies have linked fish - heavy diets with reduced risk of mental decline in old age .
But before you take the bait , consider :
Those studies trusted subjects to remember and report their dietary habits — a fishy procedure .
A test of mice found that an omega - 3 - rich diet had no impact on cognitive function .
And cold - water fish that are high in omega - 3s are also likely to have elevated levels of methylmercury and PCBs , both known neurotoxins .
It would be great if fish really were brain food .
Unfortunately , we 've got to throw this one back .

Chewing Gum__School principals__ may scoff , but the notion that gum enhances alertness dates to World War I , when sticks were slipped into soldiers ' rations .
The rationale : Chewing increases blood flow to the motor cortex and can trick the brain into expecting a meal .
This triggers an increase in insulin production that could boost cerebral glucose levels — and thus smarts .
Too bad a 2004 study found gum chewers to be less attentive than a control group .
Looks like Mrs. Snodgrass was right after all .

Listening to Music__Music can certainly__ expand your mind ; if you do n't believe us , play Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz .
But can it amp up your brain power ?
That 's the claim of companies like the Monroe Institute , which market CDs and MP3s that promise to increase focus and improve memory .
11 This ai n't Baby Bach :
The recordings pump a different frequency into each ear , and these tones mix in the brain to produce a pulse that supposedly shifts the firing pattern of neurons , altering brain waves and – the thinking goes – reverse - engineering the mental state that accompanies them .
A compelling idea , but it 's less likely to produce serious thought than a Fergie concert .
In a recent study at Oregon Health and Science University , subjects exposed to a binaural pulse in the 3 - to 8 - Hz theta band ( which is linked to working memory ) showed no change in brain wave activity as measured by EEG .
What 's more , they actually became depressed and forgetful .
If you wanted that , you 'd just listen to Celine Dion . — G.L .

I ’ve just seen something seriously cool on the German TV news about the Nuernberg Toy Fair .
A company called Nikko has made and released a 6.5 meter model of R2 - D2 which can be used as a movie projector , CD player and iPod player .
Remember the scene in Star Wars when R2 plays the holographic message of Princess Leia to Obi-Wan ?
Well for the bargain basement price of $ 2,500 ( a steal ! ) , you can have your own R2 unit projecting your DVD movies onto your own cinema screen .
I ca n’t say how good the picture quality is but for $ 2,500 , you can be reasonably sure that it is at least decent quality .
Or alternatively you can play your music CD ’s or your IPod music on Artoo ’s “ integrated 20 W speakers ” .
You can even project your digital photos directly from a USB stick or memory card plugged into one of the robot ’s sockets .
The R2 unit can be moved backwards and forwards by controls embedded inside a Millenium Falcon model .
So after playing your movies , you can send it off to the kitchen with a tray on its head to serve drinks on your barge .
Below is a YouTube video of the Artoo model when it appeared at the CES in Las Vegas recently .
Nothing really exciting in the video – just it scooting around doing its beeping act .
But it gives you an idea of how it looks and how mobile it is .
Someone get Harry Reid a handkerchief .
On Monday , the Senate Majority Leader sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten lamenting the news that a Democratic nominee to the Federal Election Commission , Robert Lenhard , has withdrawn his name from consideration since the process is taking so long .
This is yet another nail in the coffin of the campaign - finance reform movement .
One of its goals has been to reduce the role of " money " in elections , and thereby elevate the tenor of campaigns .
Pretty much the opposite ...
Jeremiah
Wright re-emerges to say his church has been threatened with attack just as the Democratic race heads for its last big contest
Racial divisions loomed over the Democratic race last night as Senator Barack Obama 's controversial pastor Reverend Jeremiah Wright admitted his church has received bomb threats .
Wright , whose fiery sermons on America and race relations have stirred anger among some critics , has re-emerged into the headlines just as Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton kick off 10 days of campaigning in Indiana .
In his first interview since videos of Wright preaching began a storm of recrimination , Wright was asked by PBS journalist Bill Moyers if he had received death threats .
' Yes ... and bomb threats at the church , ' Wright replied .
' What have we gotten into here ?
People ... telling us how they are going to wipe us off the face of the earth in the name of Jesus . '
He also described how journalists had been harassing church members , including one who was dying in a hospice .
In the lengthy interview , Wright defended his criticisms of America , which included saying : ' Not God Bless America , God damn America . '
He said his remarks had been misinterpreted by the media and defended his church 's record in helping Chicago 's poor .
Wright has undoubtedly been the biggest thorn in Obama 's side during his campaign to be America 's first black president .
The controversy derailed Obama 's plans to run a ' post - racial ' campaign and forced him into a landmark speech on race in America .
That was aimed at settling the issue , but since then the contest has become increasingly racially polarised .
Clinton has been successfully wooing white working - class voters in states such as Pennsylvania and her supporters point out such a voting bloc will be crucial in November 's general election .
They are also crucial in Indiana , the last competitive state in the contest and Obama 's last real chance to knock Clinton out of the contest before the party convention .
Wright 's return to the headlines as the contest moves into Indiana is undoubtedly a blow to Obama 's chances .
Nor is Wright likely to disappear from the headlines .
He has two more interviews scheduled this week , including an address to the National Press Club in Washington DC .
That will add fuel to a fire of negative attacks on the campaign trail .
The past two weeks have seen almost unprecedented levels of negativity as Clinton seeks to prove that she is a better candidate , despite trailing Obama in both the popular vote and the delegate race .
She has staked her whole strategy on persuading so - called superdelegates - top party officials and politicians - that they should give the nomination to her because Obama cannot beat Republican nominee John McCain .
However , some feel that if Clinton 's strategy succeeds , the Democrats will terminally alienate the black voters who have flocked to Obama and represent the most solid voting bloc of Democratic support in a general election .
They also feel that , even if Obama becomes the nominee , he will have been fatally weakened by Clinton 's attacks , which are already being mimicked by Republican operatives .
' If this continues on its current course [ the damage ] will be irreparable , ' Congressman James Clyburn told the Washington Post .
Clyburn is the highest ranking black politician in Congress and his remarks will be seen as a warning to tone down Clinton 's attacks .
That appeal may fall on deaf ears .
After months of attacks Clinton 's team believe they have finally succeeded in raising enough questions about Obama to weaken him .
A win in Indiana , they believe , will ensure Clinton can carry that fight all the way to the Denver party convention in August where she will try to rally superdelegates to her side .
An Obama win would be his best chance to knock her out and show that he can win working - class white voters .
Polls have put the two virtually neck and neck in the state which goes to the polls on 6 May .
However , the most recent surveys show Obama opening a slight lead .
Amazing set of the two gorgeous lady with a bit of sado - masochistic insight .

There 's considerable literature on graph algorithms , which are an important part of discrete mathematics .
Graphs also have much practical use in computer algorithms .
Obvious examples can be found in the management of networks , but examples abound in many other areas .
For instance , caller - callee relationships in a computer program can be seen as a graph ( where cycles indicate recursion , and unreachable nodes represent dead code ) .
Few programming languages provide direct support for graphs as a data type , and Python is no exception .
However , graphs are easily built out of lists and dictionaries .
For instance , here 's a simple graph ( I ca n't use drawings in these columns , so I write down the graph 's arcs ) :
A -> B A -> C B -> C B -> D C -> D D -> C E -> F F -> C
graph = { ' A ' : [ ' B ' , ' C ' ] , ' B ' : [ ' C ' , ' D ' ] , ' C ' : [ ' D ' ] , ' D ' : [ ' C ' ] , ' E ' : [ ' F ' ] , ' F ' : [ ' C ' ] }
Let 's write a simple function to determine a path between two nodes .
It takes a graph and the start and end nodes as arguments .
It will return a list of nodes ( including the start and end nodes ) comprising the path .
When no path can be found , it returns None .
The same node will not occur more than once on the path returned ( i.e. it wo n't contain cycles ) .
The algorithm uses an important technique called backtracking : it tries each possibility in turn until it finds a solution .
def find_path ( graph , start , end , path= [ ] ) : path = path + [ start ] if start == end : return path if not graph .
has_key ( start ) : return None for node in graph [ start ] : if node not in path : newpath = find_path ( graph , node , end , path ) if newpath : return newpath return None
>>> find_path ( graph , ' A ' , ' D ' ) [ ' A ' , ' B ' , ' C ' , ' D ' ] >>>
Note that while the user calls find_path ( ) with three arguments , it calls itself with a fourth argument : the path that has already been traversed .
The default value for this argument is the empty list , '[ ] ' , meaning no nodes have been traversed yet .
This argument is used to avoid cycles ( the first ' if ' inside the ' for ' loop ) .
The ' path ' argument is not modified : the assignment " path = path + [ start ] " creates a new list .
If we had written " path.append ( start ) " instead , we would have modified the variable ' path ' in the caller , with disastrous results .
( Using tuples , we could have been sure this would not happen , at the cost of having to write " path = path + ( start , ) " since " ( start ) " is n't a singleton tuple -- it is just a parenthesized expression . )
It is simple to change this function to return a list of all paths ( without cycles ) instead of the first path it finds :
def find_all_paths ( graph , start , end , path= [ ] ) : path = path + [ start ] if start == end : return [ path ] if not graph .
has_key ( start ) : return [ ] paths = [ ] for node in graph [ start ] : if node not in path : newpaths = find_all_paths ( graph , node , end , path ) for newpath in newpaths : paths.append( newpath ) return paths
>>> find_all_paths ( graph , ' A ' , ' D ' ) [ [ ' A ' , ' B ' , ' C ' , ' D ' ] , [ ' A ' , ' B ' , ' D ' ] , [ ' A ' , ' C ' , ' D ' ] ] >>>

To the contrary , " this program runs in exponential time , while find_shortest_path can be done in linear time using BFS [ Breadth First Search ] .

We ’re getting the numbers down pretty well now about how much we do n’t know about the universe :
Only about 5 % of our universe consists of normal matter , made of atoms .
The rest of our universe is composed of elusive matter that we do n’t understand : dark matter ( 23 % ) and dark energy ( 72 % ) .
And of that 5 % of normal matter , well , we do n’t know what half of that is , either .
All the stars , galaxies and gas observable in the universe account for less than a half of all the matter that should be around .
About 10 years ago , scientists predicted that the missing half of â€˜ordinaryâ€ ™ or normal matter exists in the form of low - density gas , filling vast spaces between galaxies .
The European Space Agency announced today that the orbiting X - ray observatory XMM - Newton has uncovered this low density , but high temperature gas .
The universe has been described as a cosmic web .
The dense part of the web is made of clusters of galaxies , which are the largest objects in the universe .
Astronomers suspected that low - density gas filled in the filaments of the web .
But the low density of the gas has made it difficult to detect .
With the XMM - Newtonâ€™s high sensitivity , astronomers have discovered the hottest parts of this gas .
Astronomers using XMM - Newton were observing a pair of galaxy clusters , Abell 222 and Abell 223 , located 230 million light - years from Earth , when the images and spectra of the system revealed a bridge of hot gas connecting the clusters .
“ The hot gas that we see in this bridge or filament is probably the hottest and densest part of the diffuse gas in the cosmic web , believed to constitute about half the baryonic matter in the universe , ” says Norbert Werner from SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research , leader of the team reporting the discovery .
The discovery of this hot gas will help better understand the evolution of the cosmic web .
“ This is only the beginning , ” said Werner .
“ To understand the distribution of the matter within the cosmic web , we have to see more systems like this one .
And ultimately launch a dedicated space observatory to observe the cosmic web with a much higher sensitivity than possible with current missions .
Our result allows to set up reliable requirements for those new missions . ”

Pediatrician Dr. Jim Sears
That 's because you have a stronger immune system that gets rid of the tiny cancers before they become tumors .
In an interview with the Wild blueberry Association of North America , respected author , pediatrician , and talk show personality Dr. Jim Sears said eating wild blueberries is one of the most important things people can do for their brains .
The little blue fruit has risen in the ranks as a powerful food when it comes to promoting health and nutrition , and is now enjoying a boost from Sears , who credits taste , versatility , and powerful nutritional value for the berry 's starring role in the world of nutritional health .
Dr. Sears is a respected pediatrician known for his contribution to improving the health , nutrition , and child - rearing practices of families throughout the country .
He has offered his unique perspective on the importance of good family nutrition as a frequent guest of Dr. Phil and on the health website AskDrSears.com .
He was chosen by producer Dr. Phil McGraw to star in the new syndicated TV show , The Doctors , with other prominent physicians , including former star of The Bachelor , Travis Stork .
Sears has been a proponent of the blueberry , particularly the wild blueberry , which carries even stronger nutrient value , since he discovered studies that showed that a diet of blueberries reversed short - term memory loss and improved motor skills in laboratory rats .
He cited eating wild blueberries , and fruits and vegetables in general , along with eating a good source of omega - 3 oils , as simply the two best things people can do to maintain brain health .
Wild blueberries are notorious for their deep blue color , which is an indicator of high amounts of anthocyanin , a powerful antioxidant believed to protect against brain aging and promote vision health .
In the interview , featured in the latest issue of the Wild Blueberry Health News newsletter and available in full at http://www.wildblueberries.com,
Sears referred to wild blueberries as a " happy food " because of their low glycemic index , which helps maintain mood , energy and concentration throughout the day , and referenced the berry 's extraordinary potential to scavenge cancer - causing free - radicals .
" We know that those who eat the most fruit cut their cancer risk in half , " said Sears .
" That 's because you have a stronger immune system that gets rid of the tiny cancers before they become tumors . "
Sears also shared his Smoothie Recipe , a staple of the Sears family , which features a serving of wild blueberries , and discussed his role in his upcoming TV show , a spin - off of the popular Dr. Phil .
" We 're very pleased that someone of the caliber of Dr. Sears , a respected member of the medical and health community who offers advice to millions of people , is such a vocal supporter of the health benefits of wild blueberries , " said Wild Blueberry Association Nutrition Advisor Susan Davis , M.S. , R.D. " We continue to learn about the many specific health benefits of blueberries , in particular wild blueberries , that make them a popular food and recipe ingredient , including antioxidant benefits and benefits related to cardiovascular health .
That Dr. Sears recognizes the wild blueberry for its amazing nutrient properties - and makes it part of his own healthy lifestyle - helps to further our mission of expanding the public knowledge of the berry 's unique advantages . "
Dr. Sears is not the first health advocate to have touted wild blueberries as a favorite .
Others include SuperFoods author Dr. Steven Pratt , and Oprah show favorite Dr. Oz , who named the fruit as nutritional powerhouse because of its anti-aging properties .

With demonstrators disrupting the progress of the Olympic torch , six Chinese people reflect on the protests and meaning of the Games .
ZHONGZE , 25 , STUDENT , ANHUI PROVINCE , CHINA Like many others in China , I am really saddened and enraged by the chaotic scenes in London and Paris .
The failure of the French government to protect the torch in Paris has already aroused an outcry amongst Chinese people in cyberspace .
Dozens have posted suggestions of French brands that should be boycotted in response .
I agree that our country does have human rights problems .
For example , there is a general lack of freedom .
With regard to Tibet , I do n't support everything our government does - and have even posted apologies on YouTube following events in 2006 .
But those protesters should wait until a more appropriate time to take a stand .
I e-mailed Reporters Without Borders to say I support their cause - but they are choosing the wrong time to take a stand .
The demonstrators are in danger of making an enemy of everyone in China .
We are very excited and proud about the Olympics .
I really hope they will be harmonious and magnificent .
The best outcome would be improved communication between people inside and outside China - with the Games helping to reduce fear of foreigners within the nation .
ZHIFU FAN , 20 , STUDENT , DALIAN , CHINA I really can't agree with those so - called democrats who urge China to give greater freedom to Tibetans , or raise the issue of Darfur .
Look at what the US and UK have done to Iraq .
Will these people protest over the London Olympic Games ?
We Chinese people love European countries , but the protesters are wrong when it comes to Tibet - which has been part of China for more 1,000 years .
I also disagree with the action of celebrities like Steven Spielberg .
He is still living in America - and look at that country 's record with regard to Guantanamo Bay .
The Olympics should be a chance for the world to see a new China and help people learn more about our country .
I am happy that we are hosting the Games , but not proud as such - it just means China has become rich enough to host this huge sporting event !
LAN WANG , 34 , PROFESSOR , LIVING IN SINGAPORE Many Western people misunderstand China and Beijing 's policy in regard to Tibet .
And this is made worse by the way the Western media portrays the country .
I read news from the BBC and CNN very often and I feel stories crudely stereotype China .
China is actually doing a lot to develop the Tibet region .
For example , Tibetan education is poor - so ethnic Tibetans , along with other minorities , are allowed into university with lower scores than ethnic Han Chinese to boost their chances .
China has also poured money into the region to increase development .
You also have to realise that Tibetan society was far from perfect before China entered the region .
My father was in the army in the 1950s and he tells me how unfair society was before the Chinese arrived .
It was essentially a feudal system .
I think everyone has the right to protest , but they should do so peacefully , like the Dalai Lama suggested .
We , the Chinese people , are very proud to be hosting the Games for the first time .
These violent protests are making Chinese people feel angry .
We feel some Western people and governments have a hidden agenda : they do n't want China to become a powerful country .
HANWEN LIAO , 33 , RESEARCH FELLOW , LIVING IN LONDON
I was in London during the torch relay and was terrified to see the violence and chaos created by the protesters .
As a man living in the West for quite a long time , I totally support everyone 's right to express their feelings and opinions .
But what happened during the torch relay put ordinary civilians in danger .
The violent protests damage not only the image of the Olympics , but also the way ordinary Chinese people see the Dalai Lama and the political system of the West .
The consensus here in the UK seems to be that the Games are nothing but a parade by the Chinese government .
This is totally misleading .
Ordinary Chinese people do feel very proud of the Beijing Games .
We have long been dreaming of the Olympic flame being lit in China .
The Dalai Lama himself said that the 1.3 billion Chinese people deserve the Olympics , and this is about a dream of the people not the government .
I understand that many feel strongly about the Tibet issue and do n't know how else to let the Chinese government know how they feel .
But it is a complex matter , and I suggest people instead visit China and Tibet to see the situation with their own eyes and draw their own conclusions .
JINJIE CHEN , 32 , LAWYER , BEIJING
The Beijing Olympics should actually be about an improved dialogue with the world
There is no excuse for linking the issue of Tibet and the Olympic Games .
The Games should actually be a golden opportunity to improve communication between China and the rest of the world .
I have spent time abroad , and I think people greatly misunderstand the reality of modern China .
This stems from the fact that most Westerners have not visited our country .
I 'll give you an example of this confusion .
While I was in the UK , I was asked by one man whether it was true that 60 % of the population was in the Communist Party .
Other people seemed to think we were still a fully communist society .
People still seemed to view us through the prism of the Cold War .
I also believe there is a growing hostility towards China .
I think this may be because China is developing so fast - at a greater speed than anyone could have imagined .
The economy is now performing better than the economies of many other nations .
And so people feel threatened by our advance .
All this goes to show that the Beijing Olympics should actually be about an improved dialogue between China and the rest of the world .
Improved communication will benefit everyone .
LIU XIAOXI , 37 , PROFESSOR , LIVING IN JAPAN I was in China again recently for a couple of weeks , and I noticed how immensely proud people are of the Olympics .
And I feel very proud .
This a great opportunity for a developing country , a chance for us to communicate with the world .
Which just makes me feel more angry with the way the Western media has portrayed the protests over the Olympics .
The focus has always been on the negative side .
But there are many pro-China protesters too - for example there were large numbers on the streets of San Francisco .
Of course , it is a good idea to try and improve human rights in China .
But the US has human rights issues too , and so does Britain .
In general I think politics and sport should be separated .
Look at the history of the Games .
When the US and the former Soviet Union boycotted one another 's Games - did this achieve anything ?
I also think the Dalai Lama has been inconsistent .
He says he wants protests without violence - yet we see the violence across the world , from the burning of shops in Tibet to the action in London and Paris .

GUATEMALA CITY ( Reuters ) - Guatemala is investigating radio advertisements seeking elite ex-soldiers , who have been known to work for drug cartels , to smuggle goods into Mexico , officials said on Thursday .
A Kaibil sniper is seen with full gear during an exhibition in the Special Forces Brigade , known as " Kaibil 's Hell " , in Poptun , Peten , October 30 , 2006 .
A REUTERS / Carlos Duarte
The ads were broadcast in the lawless northern jungle region of Peten , home to a tough military training center for Kaibil soldiers , infamous during Guatemala ’s civil war as a brutal guerilla - fighting , special forces unit .
“ We invite all citizens who have served in the military and graduated as Kaibils to work securing vehicles transporting merchandise to Mexico , ” the radio spot said , according to a local newspaper .
The ad gave a telephone contact number .
Former Kaibil soldiers have been lured to work as assassins and run security for powerful drug lords by cash payments that can be as much as 10 times the average army salary , according to a Kaibil commander interviewed by Reuters .
Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry and the army said authorities still were investigating the origin of the radio ads , which may have been transmitted on pirated airwaves .
Created in the 1970s to fight a counter - insurgency campaign against leftist guerrillas during the 1960 - 96 civil war , the red - bereted Kaibil fighters were made to eat raw dog guts as part of their training .
They were accused of massacres during the war , which left more than 200,000 dead .
More recently , beheadings of policemen and drug rivals in Mexico have been blamed on ex-Guatemalan soldiers working with the Zetas , a renegade unit that broke from the Mexican army to serve as the Gulf cartel ’s enforcement arm .
The Zetas have used brazen advertising along the northern U.S. - Mexico border to recruit foot soldiers , stringing banners from bridges over main roads in the towns of Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo offering well - paid jobs .
Some 75 percent of the cocaine leaving Colombia is smuggled through Central America and much of it ends up crossing the porous Guatemalan - Mexican border .
Drug planes land on secret jungle landing strips and trucks move the cargo north to the United States .
President Felipe Calderon is cracking down on Mexico ’s drug gangs , deploying thousands of police and soldiers to hot spots around the country .
Drug violence in Mexico has killed more than 900 people this year .
There are two places my cat likes to be when I 'm at my desk .
1 ) Right in the gap between the edge of the keyboard and the edge of the desk .
This makes typing quite difficult .
2 ) Next to the keyboard , on the right side .
This makes mousing quite difficult .
That cat bed thing will never work because the reason your cat is on your desk is because it wants attention and therefore will put itself in what it knows to be the inconvenient place for you .
Chris Rock Testifies in Wiretapping Case
Comedianwas put on the stand Friday to testify against " private eye" Rock hired Pellicano in 1999 when Hungarian modelfiled a paternity suit against him after a one night stand at the Beverly Hills Hotel .
Anthony Pellicano is being charged with illegally wiretapping and bribing dozens of Hollywood stars and movie executives .
Anthony has plead not guilty .
Charges that are being examined are , wiretapping , bribing police and telephone company officials to run illegal background checks .
If convicted he could spend the rest of his years behind bars .
Rock was said to look very nervous at his 20 minutes questioning .
There are to be 100 more witnesses that are going to take the stand , including Sylvester Stallone and Farrah Fawcett .
Rock , it turns out , was not the father of Zsibrita 's child .
Rock thought that was the end of the story where he was concerned .
The tide turned in 2001 when Zsibrita claimed she was raped by the comedian in 1999 .
That was when he hired Pellicano and his real troubles got a whole lot murkier .
This story fits right into our Bitten and Bound logo : The Not so Pretty Side of Hollywood .
Imagine , if you will , a parallel universe where a pretty blonde pop star can actually carry a tune , writes her own songs , and frets over artistic integrity .
In this universe , when her record company demands more hits , she tells them to shove it and starts her own label .
There 's no making out with Madonna , no messy divorce , no custody battle , no 5150 .
Instead there 's bankable talent and a credible , long - arc career .
In other words , it 's the anti-Britney Spears .
Meet Robyn , the 28 - year - old Swedish singer whose latest US release drops in April .
In the mid-'90s , both were courted by the same big label to be molded into the Next Big Thing : Robyn said no .
Britney said yes .

Drop 'em in the comments .
Caracas , May 19 , 2008 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) – Venezuelan Information Minister Andrés Izarra , confirmed that the government has proof of that sixty Colombian troops made an illegal military incursion into Venezuelan territory last Friday .
“ We have photos and other materials that demonstrate the military incursion into our territory , ” Izarra assured on Sunday after Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos , denied the claims .
“ There was no incursion , ” said Santos in comments broadcast on Colombian radio on Sunday .
“ I looked into it and they were not doing anything , ” Santos said of the Colombian troops .
“ It appears that Minister Santos is not well informed of what his troops are doing , ” Izarra countered .
On Saturday Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro denounced through an official note of protest to the Colombian government that sixty Colombian troops had illegally entered 800 meters into Venezuelan territory .
The incursion occurred Friday , May 16 , in the Los Bancos sector in the municipality of Páez in the border state of Apure .
Maduro said the group was under the command of Colombian Army Sub- lieutenant Jhonny Ocampo Jurado , from the Cubará Military Base in the Colombian department of Arauca .
Once they were intercepted the Colombian troops were forced to leave Venezuelan soil immediately .
“ The commission of 60 men from the Colombian Army , under the command of someone who identified himself as Sub- lieutenant Jhonny Ocampo Jurado , assigned to Special Battalion Energético and Vial No 1 , General Juan José Negro Velasco , from the Cubará Military Base , in the department of Arauca , Colombia , was intercepted at the coordinates N - 07° 02 '
12,5 '' - W - 072° 02 ' 6,4 '' , 800 meters from the frontier line in Venezuelan territory and was required to leave immediately , ” the communiqué read .
The Venezuelan government characterized the incursion as an “ act of provocation ” that “ aims to deliberately destabilize the region ” and called on Colombia to immediately “ cease these violations of international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Venezuela . ”
The Venezuelan denunciation comes two and a half months after the Colombian military carried out an illegal bombing raid on a camp of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , in Ecuadorian territory on March 1 , killing twenty - five people and violating the sovereignty of this country .
The incident provoked the break off of diplomatic relations between Quito and Bogota and sparked a regional crisis .
Tensions increased further over claims by the Colombian government that documents allegedly found on computers belonging to the FARC showed links between the Venezuelan and Ecuadorian governments and the guerrillas – claims that both governments have vehemently denied .
An investigation into the computers by the International Police Organization ( INTERPOL ) , found no evidence that the computers had been tampered with , despite more than four thousand files being dated later than March 1 ( when the Colombian government says the computers were seized ) .
However Izarra said the INTERPOL report did not link the Venezuelan government , “ in any manner with the accusations they [ the Colombian government ] have been making supposedly based on that computer . ”
“ In reality they are accusations empty of content , without real backing , that they are generating in order to create a matrix of opinion to condition the public for other political and military actions with the aim of destabilizing the region and maintaining a sustained attack against Venezuela , ” he declared .
Former Venezuelan vice - president José Vicente Rangel argued it was “ urgent ” for the Venezuelan government to redefine its political , diplomatic , economic , and security relations with Colombia and said that the deterioration of bilateral ties was a result of the “ media show ” by the Uribe government .
In a press conference today Maduro confirmed that Venezuela has decided to activate diplomatic mechanisms to resolve the situation after speaking to his Colombian counterpart Fernando Araújo .
“ We have decided to activate mechanisms for the solution of border controversies that exist between both countries to clarify and resolve the situation , ” said Maduro .
“ We have taken the initiative to deescalate , in a diplomatic manner , this affair which we classify as a provocation by sectors that want to provoke minor incidents , then escalate them in order to convert them into an excuse for bigger incidents and an armed conflict between our countries , doing the dirty work of the imperialist plan to destabilize and fill our region with violence , ” he added .
Maduro also said the Venezuelan government , over the past few weeks , has warned of the existence of a plan by sectors of the Colombian government , in coordination with sectors of the US government , to escalate an armed conflict against Venezuela and the Bolivarian revolution , as the process of progressive change underway in the country is known .
“ These events form part of a general framework of provocation against our country , ” he said .
Venezuelan has various options in dealing with the situation he warned , however , “ following the pacifist doctrine of the Venezuelan government and in line with respect for international law and bilateral agreements , as well as being clear that there is a sector of the Colombian government that is committed to violence and wants to escalate a plan of confrontation … we consciously activate the mechanism of a formal protest . ”
This sector of the Colombian government is being incited by the U.S. , Maduro said , “ to participate in a process of destabilization against the region and against the new democratic and progressive leaderships and transformations that have been consolidating during the first decade of the 21st Century . ”

If you thought your boss did n't know when you were looking at porn while you were supposed to be working , well , think again .
And in our case , the watches would probably break from overuse , thanks to our constant state of arousal .

Domenica .
Breve annuncio sul canale LCI .
Un sotto - prefetto di Charente - Maritime è stato dimesso dalle sue funzioni su istruzione del ministro degli Interni , Michèle Alliot - Marie .
Motivo ?
L’essere venuto meno al dovere di riservatezza , regola per i servitori dello Stato .
E ciò a causa di un " punto di vista " rilasciato al giornale on - line Oumma.com secondo il quale Israele sarebbe il solo Stato al mondo i cui i tiratori scelti abbattono le bambine all ’uscita da scuola ed i cui centri di tortura , per via dello shabbat , fanno pausa il sabato .
Ritornello conosciuto .
Nulla di nuovo sotto il sole dell ’insondabile stupidità politica .
Salvo che questo psicotico passaggio all ’atto proviene , ed è una novità , da un alto funzionario della Repubblica .
E salvo che l’alto funzionario ha scelto , per rompere il suo dovere di riservatezza , non un grande quotidiano , una rivista , una radio , ma l’organo ufficiale dei Fratelli musulmani in Francia e , in particolare , di Tariq Ramadan .
La notte passa .
L’affare mi ronza in testa .
Perché non si tratta solo di Oumma .
Ma pure del nome dell ’ uomo , che , anch ’esso , mi dice qualcosa .
Guigue ... Sotto- prefetto Bruno Guigue ...
Cerco tra i miei ricordi .
Sollecito l’amico Google .
E , ben presto , mi ricordo : ma sì , sicuro !
sempre quel Guigue che , al mio ritorno dal Darfur , aveva consegnato allo stesso Oumma un articolo particolarmente avvelenato su di me ( la qualcosa non è poi grave ) e sulla tragedia dei Darfuriani ( e questo è , evidentemente , più importante ) .
La coincidenza è quasi troppo bella .
Perché è come una dimostrazione in laboratorio della mia vecchia tesi sull ’effetto accecamento prodotto , immancabilmente , dalla monomania antisionista .
Perché non si sentono mai gli avversari di Israele sul Tibet ?
sulle guerre dimenticate d’Africa ?
sulla Bosnia , quindici anni fa ?
perché si accaniscono , oggi , a negare il martirio del Darfur ?
Ebbene ecco .
La prova la fornisce Guigue .
Un martirio non interessa queste persone se non quando è questione di Israele o , cito , del suo servo americano .
Un massacro dove né Israele né gli Stati Uniti siano coinvolti non gode , nella galleria dei cliché che costituisce la loro visione del mondo , che di una esistenza di secondo genere .
Nella mia frenesia , navigando di sito in sito , mi imbatto in tutta una nebulosa di altri siti che accorrono in difesa del " coraggioso " funzionario sanzionato .
Non li nominerò , questi siti .
Non voglio far loro pubblicità e dunque non li nomino .
Ma ciò che scopro è – nuova sorpresa - che essi sono , in effetti , molto numerosi ; che , dal rosso ( no - global ) al bruno ( Fronte nazionale e affiliati ) o al verde ( islamista radicale ) , coprono l’essenziale dello spettro del peggio ; e che si accordano tutti , di fatto , su una rappresentazione articolata in tre proposizioni tanto deliranti quanto semplici .
Israele è uno Stato nazista .
Il mondo è organizzato per dissimulare questa verità .
E il cervello di questo complotto , il suo direttore d’orchestra clandestino , il vero agente dei neri disegni dell ’eterna " Internazionale giudaica " , si scopre essere qui , a Parigi , giusto dalle parti al disopra di Alliot - Marie che non sarebbe , con Kouchner , Attali e altri nuovi " Ebrei Süss " ( cito sempre la stessa amena letteratura ) , che uno strumento docile tra le sue mani – questo ebreo vergognoso , nascosto , canonizzato , ma smascherato , non sarebbe altri che ...
Nicolas Sarkozy stesso !
Ripenso , ad un tratto , a quei siti antisemiti che si scatenarono , durante la campagna elettorale , sul ritornello del " Tutto tranne Sarkozy " , denunciati da Liliane Kandel , membro del comitato di redazione di Tempi Moderni .
Riprendo il libro , apparso , questo , dopo le elezioni , in cui il filosofo Alain Badiou , pretendendo richiamarsi a Freud ( povero Freud ! ) , non chiama più il presidente con il suo nome ma " l’uomo dei ratti " , giusto " l’uomo dei ratti " , come nei film di propaganda che davano nei cinema sotto l’Occupazione .
Penso a tali segni , minuscoli senza dubbio , derisori , ma che vanno dagli attacchi personali ( in particolare sul fisico ) ad un tipo di aggressione che non ci si era concessi nei confronti di nessuno dei suoi predecessori ( l’affare dell ’ SMS ) nel programma dei " Guignoles de l’Info " , dove ora gli affibbiano ( se ne saranno loro stessi accorti ? ) l’accento dei commedianti della " La verité si je mens " .
Metto tutto questo in fila .
E finisco per dirmi che siamo di fronte , lo si voglia o no , a qualche cosa di sintomatico : non più di cosa Sarkozy ma di cosa l’antisarkozismo è il nome ?
Dio sa se ci sono buone ragioni per opporsi a questo governo .
L’immigrazione .
La legge sulla ritenzione di sicurezza .
Il discorso di Dakar .
Gi slittamenti , à Riyad o in Vaticano , su quella pietra angolare della Repubblica che è l ’idea di laicità .
La parola tradita sui Ceceni , sui Tibetani , sulla democrazia in Russia , sui diritti dell ’uomo in generale .
Non bisogna cedere di un passo in nessuno di questi terreni .
In nessuno di essi bisogna lasciarsi intimidire .
Ma ragione in più per non tollerare che venga superata la linea gialla che separa il vero dibattito dall ’ ingiuria alla persona e al nome .
Credo di essere stato uno dei primi , ben prima dell ’ inizio della campagna , a denunciare , in queste colonne , la demonizzazione di cui cominciava ad essere fatto oggetto il futuro candidato .
Ebbene , allo stesso modo , oggi , metto in guardia contro i tanfi fetidi che di nuovo sembra liberare , al lato destro come a quello sinistro , l’inebetito odio per l’oramai capo dello Stato .
Bernard - Henri Lévy , Le Point , 27.03.2008 ( traduzione : Daniele Sensi
I find it very productive working in a terminal environment , as it's efficient and flexible to deal with processes and data , especially text , and especially on remote machines .
Now terminals have advanced in capability over time , with some form of " xterm " being the usual terminal of choice .
Therefore one should not restrict programs to their usual monochrome defaults , as colour can be used to greatly ease the parsing of text by humans .
We have dedicated sensors and portions of the brain specifically for colour , so we should not ignore them .
It 's a pity that most programs do n't enable colours automatically when available , requiring the user to explicitly configure them to do so .
Though I am starting to notice newer commands like " htop " for example use colours by default when possible , which is a much more sensible approach given the capabilities of terminals today .

System colors : Color cube , 6x6x6 : Grayscale ramp :
38 ; 5 ; $number
RGB colors
38 ; 2;$R ; $G ; $ B
Note I 'm not going to describe colour settings that most people know about already .
Please see my . bashrc for things like highlighting the shell prompt , or an alias for colouring output from the " ls " command for example .
The standard set of " ANSI " colours available , as output by this simple script , are shown below .
Note these colours are indexes into a palette , with those shown being the standard linux palette .
This is quite a rich set of colours which lots of applications support , and can be used to highlight text in many useful ways , some of which I 'll detail below .
( Note I wrote another simple script to convert ANSI colour codes to HTML for display here ) . " xterm " , " konsole " and " gnome - terminal " on my Fedora 8 distribution at least , support 256 colours .
[ Update : Fedora 18 enables 256 colours by default , and the 256 colour feature page details all of the supported terminals , and a setup script to enable 256 colours for those terminals ] .
To configure applications to use 256 colours when available , just set the TERM environment variable to , which I do in my . bashrc .
Note ubuntu / debian users , ensure you have the ncurses - term package installed which defines the xterm - 256 color terminal parameters .
This means unfortunately that that package must also be installed on any remote machines you log into , or otherwise you 'll need to reset your TERM variable to " xterm " there .
Note also that if you have a /etc / DIR_COLORS or ~/.dir_colors file , then for ls to colourise the output correctly , you 'll need aentry in those files .
[ Update : I 've updated my ansi2html script to support 256 colours , and running the 256 colour palette generator referenced above through it we get ... You can hover over the palette above to get the number to use in thecode .
Note the default xterm palette is displayed above , but any of the RGB values can be changed and that is also demonstrated in the referenced palette generating script .
]
One application I use all the time , which supports 256 colours " out of the box " is VIM , and you can see the difference between 16 and 256 colours with the default colour scheme below :
Note you can hover over the screenshots above to see how the 8 colour version requires extensive use of the " bold " attribute to get the desired colours .
The 256 colour version does n't need to use " bold " for this , but unfortunately it does for certain highlighted items .
I always disable the display of bold text anyway in my xterm settings as I think it looks terrible .
Specifying arbitrary RGB colours is possible in some terminal emulators , though not that useful really with character cell resolutions .
To specify RGB colours you useSGR codes .
konsole supports RGB for a long time , while xterm supports RGB since Oct 2012 , by mapping the RGB codes to the nearest entry in the 256 color palette .
[ Update Jan 2017 : There was recently a good summary of the state of true colour support in various terminals ]

Viewing file differences
laptop : ~$ idiff grep-multibyte-color.diff
The -- color option messes up UTF8 output .
Compare the following : echo " útf8 " | LANG=C grep --color=always - E '[ - ~ ] ' echo " útf8 " | LANG=C grep -- color=always - E '[ ^ -~ ] '
Note those regular expressions match ascii and non ascii data respectively .
The second one in particular is useful for highlighting UTF8 characters .
It was pointed out to me later that '+ ' can be used to highlight all adjacent non ASCII bytes .
I.E the following patch is useful only to minimize the number of colour codes output , and the non printable ASCII matching can be done like this for UTF - 8 : echo " útf8 " | LANG=C grep -- color=always '[ ^ -~ ]\+' --- grep.c.orig 2005-12-09 17:37:35.000000000 +0000 +++ grep.c

It 's also worth noting here that I use terminals with a dark background .
Current linux distributions default to light backgrounds so it 's sometimes necessary to tweak program settings accordingly which I 've detailed before
When searching through text it 's very useful to highlight the specific thing you 're searching for .
To that end , the " grep " command now supports the -- color option which I enable by default using an alias in my . bashrc file .
I find this extremely useful and had even created a sedgrep script before this became available in grep itself .
Note sed is really a superset of grep , and I use it in the scripts presented below to apply colours based on various matches .
Here are what grep searches look like with my alias in place :
There are many programs available to colour logs like grc or logtool , as it is very useful to highlight particular info in log files , or to colour various fields to aid in parsing logs .
Note grc is a python program , and I also noticed the terminfo .
py module which looks useful for applying colour attributes portably to a terminal .
The example below is from my script using similar techniques which I wrote to view web server requests from access_log as they occur .
It both filters out insignificant entries and highlights the referrer column which greatly eases the parsing of this information .
Actually I 've previously described GUI programs being a bit better for viewing file differences , but using colour when at the terminal really does help a lot .
To this end I 've created an idiff script for reviewing patches interactively .
This script is also a good demonstration of how to portably apply colour as it uses the terminfo database to output the correct codes for the terminal , if in fact it does support colour at all .
One can invoke it like diff , passing it source files to compare , or instead , filter an existing patch through it as demonstrated below .
You can paste the following into a terminal to get a stupid matrix like screensaver , or for an infinitely better example , see cmatrix
For a silly 256 colour demo here is a command line to cycle through all shades of grayNote also the venerable game 0verkill , and the Colour AsCii Art library , which is included with mplayer for example :
Baking a cake to celebrate 20 years in business was n't enough fun for sub makers Erbert and Gerbert , oh no — they decided to build a man-sized air vortex cannon to blow out its candles .
What 's an air vortex canon , you ask ?
It 's one of those big gun-like toys that fires puffs of air surprisingly far across the room .
Watch the video of it blowing smoke - rings that would even impress Gandalf : you 'll be blown away .
According to Erbert and Gerbert , their " Candle Cannon " is the largest and most powerful version ever built .
The windy beast is larger than the Mercury space capsule , and requires two aimers and one ( brave ? ) cord-puller .

Having exhausted its candle - snuffing capabilities , the guys also put it to another good use : recreating the Three Little Pigs tale , with just one pig but a whole lot of huff and puff .

What does it mean to be a man today ?
How can men consciously express their masculinity without becoming cold or closed - hearted on the one hand … or wimpy and emasculated on the other ?
What ’s the most loving way for a conscious man to express himself ?
Here are 10 ways to live more consciously as a man :
1 . Make real decisions .
A man understands and respects the power of choice .
He lives a life of his own creation .
He knows that life stagnates when he fails to decide and flourishes when he chooses a clear path .
When a man makes a decision , he opens the door he wants and closes the doors he does n’t want .
He locks onto his target like a guided missile .
There ’s no guarantee he ’ll reach his target , and he knows this , but he does n’t need such guarantees .
He simply enjoys the sense of inevitability that comes from pushing the launch button .
A man does n’t require the approval of others .
He ’s willing to follow his heart wherever it leads him .
When a man is following his heart - centered path , it ’s of little consequence if the entire world is against him .
2 . Put your relationships second .
A man who claims his # 1 commitment in life is his relationship partner ( or his family ) is either too dishonest or too weak to be trusted .
His loyalties are misplaced .
A man who values individuals above his own integrity is a wretch , not a free thinker .
A man knows he must commit to something greater than satisfying the needs of a few people .
He ’s not willing to be domesticated , but he is willing to accept the responsibility that comes with greater challenges .
He knows that when he shirks that duty , he becomes something less than a man .
When others observe that the man is unyieldingly committed to his values and ideals , he gains their trust and respect , even when he cannot gain their direct support .
The surest way for a man to lose the respect of others ( as well as his self - respect ) is to violate his own values .
Life will test the man to see if he ’s willing to put loyalty to others ahead of loyalty to his principles .
The man will be offered many temptations to expose his true loyalties .
A man ’s greatest reward is to live with integrity , and his greatest punishment is what he inflicts upon himself for placing anything above his integrity .
Whenever the man sacrifices his integrity , he loses his freedom … and himself as well .
He becomes an object of pity .
3 . Be willing to fail .
A man is willing to make mistakes .
He ’s willing to be wrong .
He ’d rather try and fail than do nothing .
A man ’s self - trust is one of his greatest assets .
When he second - guesses himself by worrying about failure , he diminishes himself .
An intelligent man considers the prospect of failure , but he does n’t preoccupy himself with pointless worry .
He accepts that if a failure outcome occurs , he can deal with it .
A man grows more from failure than he does from success .
Success cannot test his resolve in the way that failure can .
Success has its challenges , but a man learns more about himself when he takes on challenges that involve risk .
When a man plays it safe , his vitality is lost , and he loses his edge .
4 . Be confident .
A man speaks and acts with confidence .
He owns his attitude .
A man does n’t adopt a confident posture because he knows he ’ll succeed .
He often knows that failure is a likely outcome .
But when the odds of success are clearly against him , he still exudes confidence .
It is n’t because he ’s ignorant or suffering from denial .
It ’s because he ’s proving to himself that he has the strength to transcend his self - doubt .
This builds his courage and persistence , two of his most valuable allies .
A man is willing to be defeated by the world .
He ’s willing to be taken down by circumstances beyond his control .
But he refuses to be overwhelmed by his own self - doubt .
He knows that when he stops trusting himself , he is surely lost .
He ’ll surrender to fate when necessary , but he wo n’t surrender to fear .
5. Express love actively .
A man is an active giver of love , not a passive receiver .
A man is the first to initiate a conversation , the first to ask for what ’s needed , and the first to say “ I love you . ”
Waiting for someone else to make the first move is unbecoming of him .
The universe does not respond positively to his hesitation .
Only when he ’s in motion do the floodgates of abundance open .
Man is the out - breath of source energy .
It is his job — his duty — to share his love with the world .
He must wean himself from suckling the energy of others and become a vibrant transmitter of energy himself .
He must allow that energy to flow from source , through him , and into the world .
When he assumes this role , he has no doubt he is living as his true self .
6. Re-channel sex energy .
A man does n’t hide his sexuality .
If others shrink from him because he ’s too masculine , he allows them to have their reaction .
There ’s no need for him to lower his energy just to avoid frightening the timid .
A man accepts the consequences of being male ; he makes no apologies for his nature .
A man is careful not to allow his energy to get stuck at the level of lust .
He re-channels much of his sexual energy into his heart and head , where it can serve his higher values instead of just his animal instincts .
( You can do this by visualizing the energy rising , expanding , and eventually flowing throughout your entire body and beyond . )
A man channels his sexual energy into his heart - centered pursuits .
He feels such energy pulsing within him , driving him to action .
He feels uncomfortable standing still .
He allows his sexual energy to explode through his heart , not just his genitals .
7 . Face your fears .
For a man , being afraid of something is reason enough to do it .
A man ’s fear is a call to be tested .
When a man hides from his fears , he knows he ’s fallen out of alignment with his true self .
He feels weak , depressed , and helpless .
No matter how hard he tries to comfort himself and achieve a state of peace , he cannot overcome his inner feeling of dread .
Only when facing his fears does a man experience peace .
A man makes a friend of risk .
He does n’t run and hide from the tests of fear .
He turns toward them and engages them boldly .
A man succeeds or fails .
A coward never makes the attempt .
Specific outcomes are of less concern to a man than his direction .
A man feels like a man whenever he faces the right way , staring straight into his fears .
He feels even more like a man when he advances in the direction of his fears , as if sailing on the winds of an inner scream .
8 . Honor the masculinity of other men .
When a man sees a male friend undertaking a new venture that will clearly lead to failure , what does the man do ?
Does he warn his friend off such a path ?
No , the man encourages his friend to continue .
The man knows it ’s better for his friend to strike out confidently and learn from the failure experience .
The man honors his friend ’s decision to reach out and make the attempt .
The man wo n’t deny his friend the benefits of a failure experience .
The man may offer his friend guidance , but he knows his friend must fail repeatedly in order to develop self - trust and courage .
When you see a man at the gym struggling to lift a heavy weight , do you jump in and say , “ Here … let me help you with that .
Maybe the two of us can lift it together ” ?
No , that would rob him of the growth experience — and probably make a quick enemy of him as well .
The male path is filled with obstacles .
It typically includes more failures than successes .
These obstacles help a man discover what ’s truly important to him .
Through repeated failures a man learns to persist in the pursuit of worthy goals and to abandon goals that are unworthy of him .
A man can handle being knocked down many times .
For every physical setback he experiences , he enjoys a spiritual advancement , and that is enough for him .
9 . Accept responsibility for your relationships .
A man chooses his friends , lovers , and associates consciously .
He actively seeks out the company of people who inspire and challenge him , and he willingly sheds those who hold him back .
A man does n’t blame others for his relationship problems .
When a relationship is no longer compatible with his heart - centered path , he initiates the break - up and departs without blame or guilt .
A man holds himself accountable for the relationships he allows into his life .
He holds others accountable for their behavior , but he holds himself accountable for his decision to tolerate such behavior .
A man teaches others how to treat him by the relationships he ’s willing to allow into his life .
A man refuses to fill his life with negative or destructive relationships ; he knows that ’s a form of self - abuse .
10 . Die well .
A man ’s great challenge is to develop the inner strength to express his true self .
He must learn to share his love with the world without holding back .
When a man is satisfied that he ’s done that , he can make peace with death .
But if he fails to do so , death becomes his enemy and haunts him all the days of his life .
A man cannot die well unless he lives well .
A man lives well when he accepts his mortality and draws strength from knowing that his physical existence is temporary .
When a man faces and accepts the inevitability of death … when he learns to see death as his ally instead of his enemy … he ’s finally able to express his true self .
So a man is n’t ready to live until he accepts that he ’s already dead .

Add More Languages
Because it queries Google Translate I can only have the language pairs Google Translate supports ; I can't add more languages .
Get a better Translation
The quality of the translation depends on the language pairs .
Do n't be surprised if it's not perfect , there are many definitions for the same word and a lot of the meaning comes from the context words are used in .
Take Google for what it is , incredibly fast with a useful word by word translation .
Some languages likes japanese / korean / chinese can have different sounds represented by the same symbol so things get even more complicated , not to mention their grammar is completely different .
Google may have some contextual analysis but if it does , it 's minimal .

Enlarge By Daniel Burke , Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia / AP
Doctors Albert Maguire , right along with wife Jean Bennett at the University of Pennsylvania are part of two teams of scientists in the U.S. and Britain that are using gene therapy to dramatically improve vision in four patients who inherited eye disease .

For the first time , doctors have used gene therapy to restore vision in patients with a rare and usually incurable form of blindness , researchers announced Sunday .
Experts say the results are a welcome success in gene therapy , a promising idea that has had several major setbacks during the past 15 years .
" It 's a breakthrough , " says Ronald Crystal , chairman of the department of genetic medicine at New York 's Weill Medical College of Cornell University .
" It really helps to validate that gene therapy can work and is going to be important . "
None of the six patients treated regained normal vision , but four have much better eyesight than before , according to two studies published online in The New England Journal of Medicine .
The patients had a rare inherited disorder called Leber 's congenital amaurosis , which begins eroding eyesight at birth and leaves them blind by their mid-20s .
Though cataract surgery and medication can restore sight in patients with other eye ailments , doctors have never before been able to restore vision to patients with this kind of hereditary degenerative disease , says Albert Maguire , an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and co-author of one of the studies .
Leber 's congenital amaurosis afflicts 2,000 to 10,000 people in the USA , says Maguire 's co-author Jean Bennett , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
There is no effective treatment .
She hopes gene therapy may work for patients with more common kinds of blindness .
Two patients in her study began the trial barely able to see hand movements .
After treatment , they became three times as sensitive to light and could read lines on an eye chart , according to an international team led by doctors at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania .
Stanford University researcher Mark Kay , former president of the American Society of Gene Therapy , says the studies suggest gene therapy may be most successful in patients in early stages of the disease , while they still have some vision .
In gene therapy , doctors aim to replace defective genes with normal ones , using harmless viruses as delivery vehicles , Crystal says .
Crystal says gene therapy may work particularly well with eye disorders because the immune system , which can reject the virus carrying the genes , is n't as active in the eye .
And because it 's easy to test vision , doctors know quickly whether the therapy works .
Despite high hopes for gene therapy , scientists have struggled to realize its potential .
For example , doctors have treated 20 to 30 children who suffer from a rare and severe immune disorder .
Though most of the children are healthy , several developed leukemia .
And in 1999 , a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger died after gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania .

US intelligence on Syrian reactor : justifying last year ’s crime to prepare for new ones
By Peter Symonds
28 April 2008
More than seven months after Israeli warplanes destroyed a building in Syria ’s eastern desert , the Bush administration has released intelligence purporting to prove that Damascus was building a nuclear reactor at the site , with the assistance of North Korea , as part of plans to build an atomic bomb .
The CIA intelligence briefing last Thursday raised more questions than it answered , and fuelled considerable speculation about its timing and purpose .
In all the commentary , however , the most obvious point is deliberately obscured .
The US is belatedly justifying an unprovoked and illegal act of aggression by Israel , undoubtedly sanctioned at the time by Washington , that had the potential to spark a new war in the Middle East .
A White House statement hypocritically warned that Syria ’s covert construction of the reactor was “ a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world ” , carried out in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
It is an open secret , however , that Israel , with Washington ’s tacit approval , has covertly manufactured a substantial arsenal of nuclear weapons , refused to sign the NPT and blocked International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspections of its facilities .
IAEA director general Mohamad ElBaradei has previously criticised Israel for bombing Syria , rather than providing information to the IAEA .
Last Friday he issued a statement , which “ deplored the fact that this [ CIA ] information was not provided to the agency in a timely manner ” in line with the international body ’s responsibilities under the NPT .
ElBaradei declared that he regarded “ the unilateral use of force by Israel as undermining the due process of verification that is at the heart of the non-proliferation regime ” .
Syria has again denied that the building destroyed by the Israeli air strike last September housed a nuclear reactor and that Syria has any intention of building nuclear weapons .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad told that media that the air strike “ hit a military site under construction , not a nuclear site as Israel and America claimed ...
Does it make sense that we would build a nuclear facility in the desert and not protect it with anti-aircraft defences ?
A nuclear site exposed to [ spy ] satellites , in the heart of Syria and in open space ? ”
While it is possible that Syria was constructing a nuclear reactor , none of the evidence made public by the CIA provides definitive proof .
Nor does it show that the facility was “ nearing operational capacity ” .
Even more tenuous are the claims of North Korean involvement and the existence of a Syrian nuclear weapons program .
The presentation includes satellite images of the site before and after the attack , along with photographs of the building ’s exterior , of the internal construction and of North Korean and Syrian nuclear chiefs standing side by side .
The accompanying commentary claims that the building and internal construction match the design of North Korea ’s nuclear reactor at Yongbyon .
Given the Bush administration ’s lies about non-existent weapons of mass destruction that were used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq , none of this “ evidence ” can be taken at face value .
In an editorial on Saturday entitled “ The curious Syrian nuclear affair ” , the British - based Financial Times pointedly commented : “ It would appear to justify retroactively the Israeli air strike on the site in Syria ’s eastern desert last September .
But given the US and Israel ’s recent record in these matters , it could also be just another dog and pony show . ”
Jon Wolfstal , from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , pointed out that the photo of North Korean and Syrian nuclear scientists was not conclusive proof of collaboration .
The reactor shown in the photographs was an old British design that was available on the Internet , he explained .
It should also be noted that none of the photos , which almost certainly were supplied by Israeli intelligence , were dated .
As the CIA acknowledged in passing , construction dates back to at least 2001 .
The New York Times reported last October that a photograph released by the private company GeoEye showed that construction on the building was well underway in September 2003 .
Jeffrey Lewis , an analyst with the New America Foundation , told the newspaper that “ it was surprising from the photos how little progress had been made at the site between 2003 and 2007 ” .
Obvious questions arise .
If a reactor was under construction , when exactly did Israel and the US first know about it ?
And did Syria call a halt , in the wake of the US invasion of Iraq ?
US claims that Syria has a nuclear weapons program rest on the following dubious argument : North Korea and Syria are collaborating , Pyongyang used plutonium from its reactor to test a crude nuclear device in 2006 , and therefore Damascus must be doing the same .
But as several commentators have pointed out , there is no indication from the satellite photos that Syria was constructing a processing plant needed to extract plutonium from spent reactor rods .
Moreover , it is not clear where Damascus was to get the fuel for a nuclear reactor .
And finally , there were no signs of high levels of security that would be expected around such an installation .
In a lengthy article in February entitled “ What did Israel bomb in Syria ? ” veteran American journalist Seymour Hersh commented : “ In three months of reporting for this article , I was repeatedly told by current and former [ US ] intelligence , diplomatic and congressional officials that they were not aware of any solid evidence of ongoing nuclear weapons programs in Syria . ”
High - level Syrian officials confirmed that North Korea had contracted to construct the building , as it had done on other projects , but denied that it was a nuclear reactor .
The obvious question is : why has the Bush administration chosen to release its intelligence now , seven months after the Israeli strike ?
The two immediate targets are North Korea and Syria .
However , amid the increasingly belligerent US propaganda campaign against Iran , last week ’s dossier on Syria is also a menacing threat against Tehran , which , in defiance of US demands , is continuing to build a uranium enrichment plant as well as a nuclear research reactor .
In the case of North Korea , the latest revelations cut directly across a deal struck to dismantle Pyongyang ’s nuclear facilities in return for a normalisation of relations and economic aid .
The agreement was reached in late 2006 at six - party talks involving the two Koreas , the US , China , Russia and Japan .
While going along with the arrangement , Bush administration hardliners such as Vice President Dick Cheney continued to regard the deal as an unacceptable concession to North Korea .
The talks have reached a turning point .
North Korea has shut down its nuclear reactor and associated plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon .
But Pyongyang is insisting that Washington show good faith by removing the country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and easing economic sanctions before North Korea makes a full declaration of nuclear facilities and starts to dismantle them .
Pyongyang ’s alleged “ proliferation ” to Syria is a convenient means for cutting across negotiations .
In a comment in the Wall Street Journal on April 15 entitled “ Bush ’s North Korea Capitulation ” , former US ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , derided a plan to allow Pyongyang to “ acknowledge ” US concerns about proliferation , declaring it looked “ like something out of Bill Clinton ’s or Jimmy Carter ’s playbook ” .
A right - wing push is also underway in Congress to demand a full accounting of North Korea ’s activities before its removal from the terrorist list .
The CIA allegations are also a threat to Syria , which is now linked to the remaining two members of Bush ’s “ axis of evil ” — Iran and North Korea .
By backing last September ’s attack , the Bush administration is effectively giving Israel a green light for similar raids .
The US and Israel routinely condemn Syrian influence in neighbouring Lebanon and demand an end to its support for Hezbollah .
While not directly implicated in American claims about a Syrian nuclear reactor , Iran is undoubtedly at the top of the list of US targets .
For months , the Bush administration has been escalating its rhetoric over Tehran ’s alleged nuclear weapons programs and support for anti-occupation militia inside Iraq .
During his tour of the Middle East last month , Vice President Cheney referred to Iran as the “ darkening cloud ” over the region , underscoring the Bush administration ’s oft - repeated threat to maintain “ all options on the table ” .
Iran was at the top of the agenda when Cheney spoke with leading Israeli officials .
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu bluntly told the media : “ I spoke to him [ Cheney ] about the need to remove the Iranian threat before [ Tehran ] arms itself with a nuclear bomb . ”
When later asked by an American reporter if Israeli leaders had asked for approval for an Israeli attack on Iran , Cheney dismissed the suggestion as “ hypothetical ” but did not deny it outright .
Since Cheney ’s trip , Israel has conducted its largest - ever civil defence drill , during which National Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer threatened “ the destruction of the Iranian nation ” in response to any attack by Tehran .
US accusations of Iranian “ meddling ” in Iraq have become more strident .
Saturday ’s New York Times noted that “ the administration has , in fact , discussed whether to attack training camps , safe houses and weapons storehouses inside Iran that intelligence reports say are used by the [ Iranian ] Quds Force to train fighters , according to two senior administration officials . ”
While such strikes are off the agenda “ for now ” , the newspaper reported that General David Petraeus , the top US commander in Iraq , had ordered the preparation of a public dossier to expose Iran ’s covert activities inside Iraq .
In comments last Friday , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Michael Mullen , underscored the threat .
He stated that the Pentagon was planning for “ potential military courses of action ” against Iran , which he branded as an “ increasingly lethal and malign influence ” in Iraq .
While describing a conflict with Iran as “ extremely stressing ” , Mullen explained that it was not impossible for the US military .
“ It would be a mistake to think that we are out of combat capability , ” he said .
The agenda behind the CIA briefing is provoking alarm in European ruling circles .
The Financial Times concluded its weekend editorial on an ominous note .
After referring to the assassination of a top Hezbollah commander in February , the newspaper declared : “ The air strike and the hit could also be interpreted as warnings to Iran to cease its regional meddling and nuclear ambitions — and maybe scare Damascus off its alliance with Tehran .
One video show in Washington does not shine a light through the regional murk .
But it should remind us there is too much dry tinder out there for anyone to be careless with matches . ”
Far from pulling back from threats against Tehran , however , the CIA ’s “ video show ” justifying last September ’s air strike is another warning from the US and Israel .
If a Syrian site can be struck without warning then Iran ’s nuclear and military facilities can suffer the same fate .
MEDFORD , Wis. ( AP )  Frank Oresnik is on the verge of making history driving his old standby — the pickup he says is about to pass the 1 million mile mark .
Oresnik took the 1991 Chevrolet Silverado to the Oil Ex-Change Quick Lube in Medford on Thursday for what he expects will be its last oil change and tuneup before hitting the magic number .
He said the truck is 1,200 miles from a million , and once he hits the mark he will retire the vehicle .
" I feel almost like the longtime NFL player as he goes into his last training camp knowing this is the end , " Oresnik said .
He credits proper maintenance and a good measure of luck for allowing the truck to rack up so many miles .
He said he's had more than 300 oil changes and tuneups at the Medford business , going in every 3,000 miles .
The truck has had four radiators , three gas tanks , five transmissions and six water pumps , but the engine has never been overhauled , Oresnik said .
He bought the Silverado in June 1996 after the original owner put 41,000 miles on it .
Oresnik uses the vehicle to deliver seafood in three states , putting on about 85,000 miles a year .

John McCain 's Full Hour on " Hannity & Colmes "
SEAN HANNITY , FOX NEWS ANCHOR : And welcome to this special program .
We have Senator John McCain for the full hour tonight .
Senator , how are you ?
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN ( R - AZ ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : Good .
HANNITY : Good to see you .
MCCAIN : Thank you .
Thanks for having me on .
HANNITY : Well , we really appreciate it , especially all the time you 're going to be giving us here .
Let me start -- tomorrow is the 35th anniversary of your return from Vietnam .
And I went back and I looked .
You were held for five and a half years of your life , tortured , beaten .
Take us back to that night when you ended up .
MCCAIN : Well , it was a little bit anticlimactic because we knew that we were going home , but it was still an exciting moment .
You know , one of the bad things about that war is that you never knew when it was going to end , although when the B - 52s came over at Christmas - time -- it 's all long - ago history now , but we knew that we were going home now , when the full power of America was unleashed .
I was very excited , very happy .
And it was -- it was a moment obviously that I 'll never forget .
HANNITY : When you were captured , you had broken your two arms .
You had shattered your knee , you broke your shoulder .
And then when they captured you , they had beaten you , I read , and stabbed you with a bayonet .
MCCAIN : You know , I had the misfortune of landing in a lake in the center of the city of Hanoi , or practically .
So the natives were a little restless , as we say .
And so it got a big crowd around .
I land in this lake .
To make a long story short , the army people came up .
Otherwise , it might have been a lot worse than that .
And took me a very short ride to the prison .
So my escape and evasion part of this story is very brief .
HANNITY : Well , but with all those broken bones in your body --
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : -- and then I understand you did n't get any medical help for nine days .
You spent two years of this five - and - a - half - year period in solitary confinement .
What does that do to a person , to spend that much time in solitary confinement ?
MCCAIN : I think it makes you a better person .
Obviously , it makes you love America .
I really did n't love America until I was deprived of her company , but probably the most important thing about it , Sean , is that I was privileged to have the opportunity to serve in the company of heroes .
I observed a thousand acts of courage and compassion and love .
My senior ranking officer was Colonel Bud Day , who now lives down in Florida .
He 's from Iowa .
By the way , he did n't carry Iowa for me .
But he was a very tough old bird , awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor .
And I still stand in great awe of him , and he inspired me .
He inspired me to do things I otherwise would n't have been capable of .
HANNITY : Well , now one story that maybe people do n't know is , because of the rank of your father , who was an admiral , as was your grandfather --
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : -- they offered to give you personal release , and you declined the offer .
And then you were beaten for one straight week afterwards .
MCCAIN : Because our Code of Conduct says that everybody goes home in order of their capture .
Also , and far more importantly than that , I knew that it would be used as a propaganda tool .
The Vietnamese made it very clear .
Ho Chi Minh made it very clear that they would win the war not on the battlefields of South Vietnam .
They never won a battle in South Vietnam , but in the streets of Washington , San Francisco , et cetera .
So , I knew that it would be not only propaganda , but also they would call in my fellow prisoners and say , see , the admiral 's son goes home and you stay .
HANNITY : And it would be used against you .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : You know --
MCCAIN : Could I also finally say , I 'm glad I did n't know the war was going to last a few years longer .
HANNITY : You might have had a different opinion .
Well , maybe that 's honest .
You know , I was surprised in one of our earliest interviews -- and I know there 's been a lot of highlighting the differences that conservatives have with you , but I know that it is universal that people respect and honor your heroism and your service to your country .
You know that , and we 've had a relationship over the years where we 've agreed on times and we 've disagreed at times .
MCCAIN : But could I also mention I think people are grateful for your past service , but I think you know very well , and so do our viewers , that they want to know what you 're going to do for them , not what you have done for them .
HANNITY : I agree .
I think in light of the anniversary , though , this is a day for you , and also for the country .
And I think it gives you an opportunity to tell a story that maybe some people do n't know about you .
I 'll never forget one of the first times I interviewed , and I was talking -- maybe it was when your book first came out -- and you had actually said -- because you signed statements that you confessed to be a war criminal .
And you said to me -- and we had gone through all the torture you had been through , all the beatings , all the broken bones , the five and a half years .
You did n't take the opportunity to get out when they gave you the opportunity .
And you said , " I failed myself , my fellow prisoners , and my family , and my country . "
How could you possibly be that hard on yourself ?
MCCAIN : I think that I thought that I was unbreakable .
You know ?
I was -- I was a pilot , a Navy pilot , carrier pilot .
And I thought that I would never show those traits .
But I also want to point out , leaders like Colonel Bud Day and Jim Stockdale and Robbie Reisner and Bill Lawrence and so many others , they said , look , you failed , go back at it again .
All of us are human .
Go back and do better the next time .
And that 's the way their leadership inspired us .
They knew that we might fail , but they wanted us to go back into the fight .
HANNITY : But you 'd have broken arms , and they 'd hang you from your arms for hours .
I mean , look , I know Sean Hannity , I 'd tell them whatever they wanted to hear .
And I think most Americans would .
MCCAIN : Sean , you say that .
You say that , but it 's not true .
It 's not true .
You love your country .
You know what 's right .
They are the enemy .
HANNITY : Even when you 're tortured , huh ?
MCCAIN : I can't tell you -- but I can't tell you -- I could never do it .
Look , I 'm just a human being .
HANNITY : Yes .
MCCAIN : But we 're inspired by our leaders .
We 're inspired by our love of our country .
And people who love their country would do the same or better than I did .
HANNITY : Well , let me ask you this .
This was an unknown story to me , and I think I 'm pretty up on the news .
This is my business every day , I 'm on the air probably much more than liberals would like , four hours a day every day .
But I did n't know until recently that your son got back from Iraq after he had served seven months there .
MCCAIN : Yes .
But we really never talk about our sons .
We have two sons in the military , but we never talk about them , if that 's all right .
HANNITY : Yes .
But you 're proud of them .
MCCAIN : Oh , I 'm so proud of them -- of both of them .
I 'm proud of all my children .
We 're proud of every single one of them , and equally so .
But we really just -- you know , we really do n't want to talk about our sons in the military .
HANNITY : Only in this context , without discussing it .
I 'll honor your wishes obviously here .
But considering your position on the war and how strongly you believe in it , that does bring a personal side to this story , does n't it ?
MCCAIN : Yes , but , you know , there 's family all over America , and some of them were n't as fortunate as Cindy and I were .
And so I look at my hero , Teddy Roosevelt .
Teddy Roosevelt had four sons who served in World War I .
His youngest and his favorite was killed on the western front .
He was a pilot , as you know .
HANNITY : Right .
MCCAIN : So , you know , it 's -- there 's so many Americans who have done so much more .
HANNITY : All right .
We 're going to come back .
We have a special edition .
Senator McCain with us for the full hour tonight .
And we 'll talk about the things we agree with and maybe some of the things we might have some disagreement with as we continue this special program with Senator McCain for the full hour -- straight ahead .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
HANNITY : And we continue our special program tonight .
Senator John McCain for the full hour with us .
All right .
George Bush , the president , said that you must win over conservatives .
At CPAC you said you have a responsibility to unite the party .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : You acknowledged you can't win this election , or you do n't think you can win this election without conservative support .
How do you plan -- because you have heard the criticism , how do you plan on bringing conservatives over to your camp enthusiastically ?
MCCAIN : Well , I think we have done very well on it .
We obviously have more to go .
But according to recent polls we have more Republicans supporting me than Democrats supporting Senator Obama or Senator Clinton .
One of the first steps , of course , was Governor Romney , Rudy Giuliani , Governor Huckabee , Fred Thompson , all of the nominees coming forward and supporting my candidacy .
That was very important , you know , a signal that we are all together .
And I have got to say they were very gracious , all of them were very gracious in -- so you have got to do that .
The second thing , very briefly , is we have got to re-energize our base because we want to regain their trust and confidence that we are going to control spending .
So I do n't have to tell you , you take calls from listeners , you travel around the country and speak , you know our Republican base wants us to get spending under control .
They -- our base , I believe , is with us on this struggle against radical Islamic extremists whole - heartedly .
But we have got to get spending under control .
And we have got to secure our borders .
And we have got to get them re-energized .
You were around in the 2004 and 2000 races , I saw President Bush energize our base .
We have got to energize our base again .
And I think I can do it with a strong conservative message .
But we also have to get independents and we also have to get old and new Reagan Democrats .
HANNITY : Let 's look at the things that -- the areas where I know conservatives agree with you , that we have got to win the war .
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : That is a good beginning .
HANNITY : We have got to win the war in Iraq .
We can't create a safe haven for al Qaeda or Ahmadinejad .
I think all conservatives agree on that .
And win the war .
You have promised that you are going to eliminate all earmarks .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : You have said three times in the last week or week - and - a- half that you promised no new taxes .
You mean none .
MCCAIN : None .
HANNITY : Throughout your presidency .
MCCAIN : No .
And look , here we are , Americans are hurting , you know that , I know that .
These are tough economic times .
Do we want to raise their taxes and have the government take more of their money right now when they are facing these challenges ?
I look forward to this debate between myself and Senator Clinton or Senator Obama .
I will be respectful , but it will be vigorous .
And one of them is taxes .
We can't raise people 's taxes , particularly at this particular time .
And if you do n't make the present tax cuts permanent , then you are going to -- every family and business in America is going to experience a tax increase .
That is what this permanency of the tax cuts is all about .
HANNITY : You have also promised that you will pick originalist justices .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : Who is your favorite Supreme Court justice ?
MCCAIN : I would have to say Roberts , probably .
I think -- and I think particularly in his position as chief justice .
I think he is really a remarkable leader .
I respect and admire Alito .
Scalia
I have disagreed with on a couple of things , but the fact is he is a staunch conservative .
But I would have to say Roberts .
But the important thing -- the important thing is nominate judges who have a strict interpretation of the Constitution of the United States .
And that is going to be a big job for the next president because everybody says there could be at least two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court .
HANNITY : And those would be the type of justices you would look for .
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
HANNITY : No more David Souters .
MCCAIN : Oh , no .
It has to be a proven record in my view .
A proven record and there 's plenty of , frankly , justices out there that we were able to get through that have that background and record , judicial record on lower courts .
HANNITY : Staying on the areas where conservatives agree with you , you will not have --
MCCAIN : Let 's keep it up .
HANNITY : We wo n't have Hillary - care .
You 're not going to nationalize health care .
You 'd look for free market solutions .
MCCAIN : We tried this .
We 've seen this movie before back in 1993 , OK .
And it is a government takeover and there is nothing -- it 's one of my -- it 's not an original line but it 's a great one .
Nothing is going to be more expensive for America than free health care .
OK ?
And we can make America the highest quality health care in the world , affordable and available and it's not the quality , it 's the cost .
And we can put in a lot of incentives that bring costs down and make it affordable and available and let families make the choices of health care of their families rather than the government .
HANNITY : I got a call from a lot of people and they knew I was going to interview you today .
MCCAIN : Sure .
HANNITY : And I think one of the areas that came up the most is would you leave the pro-life language in the platform and the marriage amendment in the platform .
MCCAIN : Yes .
But as you know , I believe that the states should make these decisions on the marriage amendment .
I am a Federalist and I believe that states like mine and other states that we should amend our state constitutions , and I will stick to that position until such time , if ever , a higher court says that my state or another state has to recognize the other status of marriage .
I am committed to maintaining the unique status of marriage between man and woman .
I think it can best be accomplished , and in keeping with my federalist philosophy that states should do as much as possible to have that done at the state level .
But if it is overturned by a superior court , I will then obviously support the other path .
HANNITY : Last question .
Back to Iraq in one second , in the areas of agreement .
As long as it takes to finish it ?
Because Hillary and Barack Obama both attacked you on that .
MCCAIN : Yeah .
And could I just mention this 100 year thing .
HANNITY : Yes .
MCCAIN : I love town hall meetings and I 'm going to continue them .
That 's the important way you learn from people as well as they learn from you .
I was in an exchange with a guy .
Look , that is American presence .
This war will be won if we stay with it and then it's a question of American presence .
We have troops in South Korea as a result of the Korean War .
We have troops in Germany and Japan .
HANNITY : Right .
MCCAIN : Et cetera , et cetera .
So that 's an agreement .
We have troops in Kuwait as a result of the First Gulf War .
But we will win this war .
We will win it .
We will succeed .
And by the way , let me remind you again , Sean , the last few days have proven again , al Qaeda is on the run but they are not defeated .
They are not defeated .
We made an enormous sacrifice in the last few days .
So we 've got to trust General Petraeus and these brave Americans that are over there to tell us when it 's appropriate to withdraw but the important thing to Americans is not American presence .
I have n't seen anyone demonstrate against troops in Kuwait .
It 's American success .
And I 'm sorry it took so long to answer --
HANNITY : No , it 's important .
MCCAIN : -- but it 's a key issue of this campaign .
HANNITY : We 'll take a break , we 'll come back .
A special hour with John McCain .
We 've got a lot of issues to cover tonight as we continue .
We 're glad you 're with us .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
HANNITY : We continue our special program tonight .
Senator John McCain for the full hour .
All right , Senator .
At CPAC you said , " I have held positions that have not met with widespread agreement with conservatives .
I wo n't pretend otherwise , nor will you permit me to forget it . "
Where do you think --
MCCAIN : I thought that was a pretty good line .
HANNITY : Yes .
Well , you got a lot of applause .
I think the only time you got real opposition -- and we 'll get to it in a minute -- is on the issue of immigration .
Where do you see the opposition with conservatives ?
Where do you see the differences ?
MCCAIN : The Gang of 14 , I think .
This group of Republican senators and Democratic senators had gotten together , and we got the nominations through , all except for two .
I think we covered one of them , the marriage amendment .
I think my vote against the tax cuts .
Let 's see--
HANNITY : Immigration .
MCCAIN : Immigration , yes .
Maybe we ought to talk about immigration .
HANNITY : Why do n't we start with the tax cuts where you are .
You are now for extending the Bush tax cuts .
MCCAIN : We have to , otherwise a tax increase .
HANNITY : All right .
But you initially voted against them , and there were two of them in particular .
One in , what , 2001 , one in 2003 ?
There were two phases of it .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : And things that I know , because I talk to conservatives every day , I think the thing that bothered them the most is when you said these tax cuts go to the wealthiest Americans .
Because that sounds to them like , that 's what we'd expect from Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
MCCAIN : I understand that .
And by the way , I voted several times to keep them permanent since then .
I wanted us to restrain spending .
I wanted -- I had a package of tax cuts .
I believe if we restrain spending and it was more steered toward middle - income Americans , then I think we'd bet talking about further tax cuts today .
HANNITY : Do you wish now that you voted for those tax cuts ?
MCCAIN : No , because I really believe that spending restraint was an important part of the package .
Just when Reagan -- just as when Reagan came -- President Reagan came to office , and we had Gramm - Latta , which was restraint of spending .
Because you can't increase the size of government and then expect us not to have to spend more .
And we presided , to our shame , over one of the greatest increases in the size of government in history , since The Great Society .
HANNITY : But you do n't believe in the philosophy -- the quote was , you know , " The GOP tax cuts go to the wealthiest Americans . "
Do you believe -- because that sounds like --
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : I want all Americans -- but I want all Americans to have a reduction in taxes , and mine were more skewed towards the middle - income Americans .
HANNITY : In other words , your proposal versus the president's .
MCCAIN : Yes .
But it had spending restraints in it .
HANNITY : Which is why you 're going to eliminate all earmarks , wo n't sign a bill with them .
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
There 's $ 35 billion in earmark projects in the last two big appropriations bills .
That could have been a $ 1,000 tax credit for every child in America .
HANNITY : Yes .
MCCAIN : Instead of the " Bridge to Nowhere . "
HANNITY : I could tell you , Senator , if there was one issue that I know I , as a conservative , and others as a conservative -- and I 've been on the radio 20 years --
MCCAIN : Right .
HANNITY : -- and I 've been expressing my opinions --
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : -- as independently as I think you have yours .
And there 's a lot of pride .
A lot of people say , well , that 's what they like about Senator John McCain .
Hopefully that 's what they like about me as a radio host .
But immigration --
MCCAIN : Yes ?
HANNITY : -- after McCain / Kennedy was defeated , you said , I hear you .
I understand .
People do n't trust us , and they want the borders secured first .
MCCAIN : That 's exactly right .
HANNITY : What does that mean in terms of practicality ?
MCCAIN : It means that I , as president , I would have the border state governors certify that their borders are secure .
Americans will trust the border state governors .
They wo n't trust us in Washington .
That 's the message -- they want it secure .
And I 'm sorry for a long answer , but in ' 86 , as you may recall --
HANNITY : President Reagan .
MCCAIN : Yes .
We said we 'd give amnesty and secure the borders .
We did n't secure the borders .
We ended up with 12 million or more people here illegally .
So there 's no trust there .
So you 've got to prove to the American people that your borders are secure .
Then you move to temper - proof biometric documents for temporary workers .
HANNITY : Right .
MCCAIN : And any employer who hires someone without that , and an employer electronic verification system , then is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
I mean , and then we address the issue in a humane and compassionate fashion .
They are God 's children , and we can be humane and compassionate about this .
HANNITY : Yes .
For conservatives , I would argue that the issue is law - breaking , respecting our sovereignty , the laws of the United States --
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : And if you did n't , that there is a penalty to pay .
Let me ask you --
MCCAIN : Yes .
There should be .
There should be .
HANNITY : -- you had said that --
MCCAIN : And no one will take priority -- if someone who either came here legally or waited to come here legally --
HANNITY : All right , we 've got less than a minute .
Would you sign McCain - Kennedy today or --
MCCAIN : It 's not going to be there .
The lesson is , they want the border secured first .
HANNITY : And that 's -- that 's your mission now .
You are focused on securing the borders ?
MCCAIN : Yes , sir .
HANNITY : Not -- you look at McCain - Kennedy , the country does n't want it ?
MCCAIN : We failed .
My friend , we failed .
I think you noticed , because you were one of the reasons .
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : All your fault .
HANNITY : No , I understand .
We 've got to take a break and we 're going to come back and we 're going to continue .
Senator McCain , special program that we have tonight for the entire full hour .
And among some of the other issues we 're going to talk about is his potential opponents , and that would be Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , emerging controversies in both of those campaigns today ; one with Geraldine Ferraro , and another with Senator Barack Obama and his preacher and the ties to the Weather Underground group , which is an issue we have been talking about a lot on HANNITY & COLMES and " HANNITY'S AMERICA . "
But we 'll continue with Senator McCain after this .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( NEWSBREAK )
HANNITY : And we continue our special program tonight .
Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee for president , for the full hour tonight .
All right , let 's stay on some of the areas we disagree , and then I know you 're probably looking for an opportunity to talk about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
McCain -Feingold .
And I do n't know if you remember this , but you came on my radio program -- we had a pretty heated exchange at the time ...
MCCAIN : I remember .
HANNITY : And I think you -- no , you were thinking of hanging up on me .
You did n't .
MCCAIN : No , I could never do that .
HANNITY : Newt Gingrich said it's an assault on the First Amendment .
Could be called a , in his -- stifles free speech , incumbency protection act .
James Dobson said , " McCain - Feingold kept us from telling the truth right before elections , " before 30 days before a primary , 60 days before a general election , groups that would want to have ads mentioning candidates .
Why have any limits on free speech ?
MCCAIN : Because I saw in Washington million - dollar checks and hundreds - of - thousands - dollar checks in the form of , quote , " soft money , " that were contributed at the time legislation was being framed or passed .
And I saw the influence of special interests .
I led the investigation against Abramoff .
We ended up with members of Congress in federal prison .
I saw legislation affected by special interests in the form of soft money , hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars from trial lawyers , from union leaders , and from very wealthy corporations .
So I saw what it was doing to the process .
I thought we ought to fix it .
I thought that it -- I know , because I saw it -- I saw legislation passed which represented everybody but the American people .
And I still think that it is necessary to curb unlimited campaign contributions if they are done in the way that soft money was in Washington .
HANNITY : Would you support the right of any citizen to unite with other citizens ?
MCCAIN : Sure .
HANNITY : Before a primary , make ads , mention candidates and go after them ?
MCCAIN : As long as those moneys are subject to campaign contribution limits .
As long as it's not unlimited money , and under our legislation they can do that .
HANNITY : Do you support the Fairness Doctrine ?
MCCAIN : No . I do not .
I think the Fairness Doctrine might shut down Hannity 's program .
HANNITY : It would .
I think it would .
MCCAIN : If you 're required to do that , then it is -- it would shut down , I think , voices in America .
HANNITY : It would ruin the format because stations ...
MCCAIN : Oh sure .
Yes .
HANNITY : ... would be forced to take on shows that are not financially viable .
MCCAIN : It 's one of the most misnamed ...
HANNITY : The Fairness Doctrine .
So we 're on the same page .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : All right .
Let me ask you in more general terms , because we talked about immigration .
We talked about the taxes .
We talked about McCain - Feingold and some of the differences you have with conservatives here .
What about conservatives that are worried when you reach across the aisle with Russ Feingold , Ted Kennedy ?
MCCAIN : Joe Lieberman .
HANNITY : Joe Lieberman .
MCCAIN : Carl Levin .
I 've got a list this long .
HANNITY : Can you reach across the aisle to the conservative base ?
Can you reach across to people that have been critical of you ?
Rush Limbaugh , James Dobson and people that have been critical ?
MCCAIN : Listen , I 'm willing to talk with anybody who wants to talk with me .
But the people of Arizona sent me to the Senate to get things done , and I believe that I was able to get a lot of things done .
Joe Lieberman and I joined together with legislation that created the 9/11 Commission .
I 'm not saying it would have never been created .
But we did and we worked together .
And I think the 9/11 Commission was important to America .
Every year I worked with the Democrats to come up with a bill that authorizes the training and equipping and the readiness of the men and women in the military .
We worked together on those issues .
And do I -- am I a strong conservative Republican voice ?
Yes .
But I know that people want us to get things done .
And one of the reasons why they think so little of us is they think that all we do is fight in Washington and not address issues .
HANNITY : How do you get along with Democrats , going back to the Iraq War , that say the surge has failed , the war is lost ?
Senator Kerry said that our troops are terrorizing women and children in the dark of night .
John Murtha accused our marines of killing civilians in cold blood .
How do you get along with people with that ...
MCCAIN : I fight them every step of the way .
But I am respectful in that debate .
And sometimes , of course , I 'm angry at some of the language that we -- that you were referring to .
But I am respectful .
But I will take them on every step of the way .
And I am so proud of the effort that some of us were involved in that stopped this effort to set a date for withdrawal .
We came very close .
Came very close .
And a lot of us put everything on the line , because we knew that , if there 's a date for withdrawal , that 's surrender , al Qaeda wins , and there 's chaos and genocide .
And we 're back , and they follow us home .
I think one of the seminal events historians will look at in this whole struggle against radical Islamist extremism is our ability to beat back the Democrats ' effort to set a date for a withdrawal , which I believe would have been chaos .
HANNITY : Do you regret -- you look back over the years you 've been in the Senate , and do you regret any votes ?
Do you think you 've changed ?
Do you think you 've moderated ?
Do you think you ...
MCCAIN : Sean , I 'm sure over these number of years that my fundamental principles have n't changed .
But I look back , and maybe I voted for some legislation that was n't effective or had unintended consequences .
One of the reasons I am a small - government , less - government federalist is because every time we act as a federal government , there 's intended consequences and unintended consequences .
That 's why I'm a conservative that fundamentally believes that less government is best government .
Leave it to the individuals to make decisions about their lives .
HANNITY : And that is your governing philosophy ?
That is your ...
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
HANNITY : And you say you 're a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution ?
MCCAIN : I was , and I was proud to do that .
And I was proud to support the tax cuts , which were amongst the highest in the country .
A lot of Americans forget that when Ronald Reagan came to office inflation was 10 percent , interest rates were 20 percent , unemployment -- I mean , the numbers were phenomenal .
And what did we do ?
He stopped the growth of government .
He restrained spending .
He cut taxes .
And he gave -- and he restored faith and hope and confidence in America .
I believe I can inspire Americans to serve a cause greater than their self - interest .
HANNITY : All right .
We 're going to continue .
More with Senator McCain , who 's with us for the full hour tonight .
We might be getting to one of his favorite topics when we come back , and that is his potential opponents in the general election , come November , and that would be , of course -- it 's either going to be Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
And potentially who he may pick for a vice president and what he 's looking for in a vice president , as we continue .
Glad you 're with us .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
HANNITY : And we continue our special program with Senator John McCain .
All right .
Washington
Post had reported that in 2001 that you once met with Daschle and Kennedy and Edwards , talked about leaving the Republican Party .
Not true ?
MCCAIN : No -- well , they asked to meet with me , and I met with them .
And I said categorically , absolutely not .
HANNITY : And John Weaver did n't arrange that or ...
MCCAIN : No one , no one arranged it that I know of .
But the fact is that I thought it was incredible .
I am a proud Republican conservative , and I made that very clear .
HANNITY : Let 's talk a little bit about ...
MCCAIN : By the way , I was very proud to campaign hard for the president in 2000 and campaign hard for his re-election in 2004 .
I think actions speak a lot louder than words .
I think the president would tell you nobody campaigned harder for him than I did .
HANNITY : I think that 's true , and he gave you a strong endorsement the other day .
MCCAIN : Absolutely .
HANNITY : You 've got to pick a vice president in the days to come .
I interviewed Mitt Romney Tuesday .
He would certainly be somebody that would be willing , he said .
I just saw Rudy Giuliani , who was with you tonight campaigning .
Condi Rice , Governor Pawlenty , Lindsey Graham , Fred Thompson , Mike Huckabee , all of these candidates ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
And since Governor Romney was on your program , I 'll tell you , he 's been -- he was very gracious to me .
He endorsed me , he had encouraged his supporters .
HANNITY : He says he has campaigned all around the country for you .
MCCAIN : Oh , yes .
Listen , he's -- he has earned a place in the Republican Party that 's very important .
Rudy , I 've loved for years , and I mean that .
I 'll never forget , as long as I live , when he came to Arizona , and we were at the World Series .
And everybody in the stadium ...
HANNITY : Did the Yankees win ?
MCCAIN : No , they lost , I 'm happy to say .
But the point is -- and Governor Huckabee is -- really earned himself -- so we were just starting a process , but obviously there are people that are highly qualified .
But I 'd like to move forward with the process before we discuss it .
( CROSSTALK )
HANNITY : Do you have three or four people in your mind that you are leaning towards ?
MCCAIN : Not really , no .
HANNITY : Five or six ?
MCCAIN : No .
What I would like to do is put together a list and then have the kind of process that you need to go through .
But there are so many wonderful , great Republicans out there .
But it 's -- really the criteria has got to be who can best immediately take your place , if necessary .
HANNITY : I thought I had found the quote that you probably will most regret in your career .
MCCAIN : Whoops .
HANNITY : Are you getting nervous ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : February 20th , 2005 , " Meet the Press , " " I 'm sure that Senator Clinton would make a good president . "
MCCAIN : But what I mean by that , from the standpoint of the philosophy and beliefs that they -- in other words , I think she 's a person of integrity .
I think Senator Obama is a person of integrity .
It 's not that they 're not good people .
It 's that they are liberal Democrats , and this is a fundamental clash between a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican .
I respect their views ; I just strongly disagree with them .
So when it -- so when that 's taken out of context , quote , " good , " good for the policies and programs and ideology that she and Senator Obama hold .
I mean , they 're good -- they 're decent people .
HANNITY : Well , let me ask ...
MCCAIN : But it is a strong difference of views .
And I think there 's going to be more stark differences in this campaign than there 's been in a long time .
HANNITY : Probably it 's Reagan and Carter ...
MCCAIN : Exactly .
HANNITY : ... and Reagan and Mondale .
The Democrats have been telegraphing , though , how they 're planning to run against you .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : Howard Dean , for example , basically said you 're running nothing more than a third Bush term .
Barack Obama said you 're a genuine hero that represents the politics of yesterday .
Hillary Clinton said , " Senator McCain really does n't know much about the economy .
That 's not been an issue of concern for him . "
So they 're giving a little bit of -- it looks like they 're going to try and say that you 're Bush 's third term .
MCCAIN : And I think , according to the newspaper , the AFL - CIO said they 're going to spend $ 53 million ...
HANNITY : A lot of money .
MCCAIN : ... attacking me on those themes .
Look , I relish -- I relish the combat .
I relish it .
I look forward to traveling all over this country , everywhere , taking my case to the American people , having the town - hall meetings , going on the talk shows , having the debates and discussions .
I am confident that our philosophy and my vision and my ability to inspire Americans will prevail .
I do not underestimate the challenge .
I do not underestimate what 's required here .
And I 'm incredibly humbled that a guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy ...
HANNITY : I 've read that , but you know what ?
You did pretty good for a guy that was fifth from the bottom .
Let me ask you this : one of the issues I care most about is energy independence .
We have n't built a refinery in 30 years .
MCCAIN : Yes .
HANNITY : We 're not -- the second largest oil find in American history is at ANWR .
We 're not using that resource .
We 're more dependent than ever before .
The French get 70 percent of their energy , 70 to 80 percent , from nuclear power .
We can't drill offshore ; we can't drill in the 48 states ; and we 're becoming more energy - dependent every day .
Would you -- let me run down the list .
Would you support nuclear power ?
MCCAIN : I think nuclear power is a vital element in any ...
HANNITY : We only have a minute .
Would you support more refineries ?
MCCAIN : The Navy -- of course .
The Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them ; there 's never been an accident .
You mentioned the French -- 80 percent of their electricity .
You store it and you reprocess it .
HANNITY : ANWR ?
MCCAIN : We 've got to make those decisions .
ANWR is a pristine place .
I do n't support drilling there .
I just feel that it's an area that , one , it would take years , I think , before you could actually exploit it .
I think we 've had enough -- a lot of problems in Alaska , although that ...
HANNITY : Prudhoe Bay was very successful .
MCCAIN : It 's been successful , but there 's also been Exxon Valdez , and there 's been a number of other things .
But that 's just an environmental position that I have .
And by the way , another area that we may not agree on -- I believe climate change is real , but I believe that the innovation , the technology and the ability of Americans is that we can develop green technologies , which will be good for our economy , not harmful .
HANNITY : I was just with the GM guys , and they 've got even a hybrid Escalade coming out .
We 'll come back -- we 'll take a break , we 'll come back .
More about Senator McCain 's opinions of his potential opponents , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , as we continue the hour with Senator McCain , straight ahead .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
HANNITY : And we continue our special program with Senator John McCain , who is with us ...
MCCAIN : Can I just ...
( CROSSTALK )
HANNITY : ... go ahead .
MCCAIN : Could I just , before the break ...
HANNITY : Sure .
MCCAIN : I met with the big three automakers , you 're right .
Hybrids , flexsteels , battery that will take a car 100 miles before you have to plug it in .
I believe the innovation and the technology and the greatest worker in the world resides in the United States of America .
We can become energy - independent if we need to .
We 're sending $ 400 billion a year of American - - half our trade deficit -- to countries that do n't like us very much , and some of that money is ending up in the hands of terrorist organizations .
This is a national security issue .
HANNITY : Senator Clinton claims that Barack Obama has not had the scrutiny that other candidates have had in this campaign .
There is a big emerging controversy about his pastor of 20 years , a man who went on a trip with Louis Farrakhan to Tripoli , a guy that has -- his church has given a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan .
We now have some of his sermons .
He used " g-d America , " " the U.S. of KKK of A . "
" The chickens have come home to roost , " he said the Sunday after the attack on this country on 9/11 .
He has called him -- Barack has said of his pastor , his trusted adviser , he 's proud of his pastor .
He married him and his wife .
He 's baptized his kids .
Does that sound like a problem for you ?
MCCAIN : I think that when people support you , it does n't mean that you support everything they say .
Obviously , those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with , and I do n't believe that Senator Obama would support any of those , as well .
HANNITY : He 's been -- but he 's been going to the church for 20 years .
His pastor -- the church gave a lifetime achievement award to one of the biggest racists and anti-Semites in the country , Louis Farrakhan .
Would you go to a church that -- where your pastor supported Louis Farrakhan ?
MCCAIN : Obviously , that would not be my choice .
But I do know Senator Obama .
He does not share those views .
And we get sometimes -- I do n't -- a lot of those statements I 've just heard for the first time that you mentioned .
But I know that , for example , I 've had endorsements of some people that I did n't share their views ...
HANNITY : Pastor Hagee recently , yes .
MCCAIN : ... but they endorsed mine .
And so I think we 've got to be very careful about that part .
HANNITY : Yes , but he was n't your pastor for 20 years .
Let me give you one other emerging controversy we 've dealt with a lot on " Hannity & Colmes " and my Sunday show , " Hannity 's America , " and on the radio show .
And the Barack Obama campaign in the last week and a half said that he has a friendly relationship -- he 's been on a board -- with a guy by the name of William Ayers .
William Ayers was with the Weather Underground , a group that declared war against the United States .
On 9/11/2001 , of all days , he had an article where he bragged about bombing our Pentagon , bombing the Capitol and bombing New York City police headquarters .
His campaign said last week they have a friendly relationship .
Does that , when you hear about that -- and I know you 're on the road a lot -- does that concern you ?
And should that be an issue in the campaign ?
MCCAIN : My life has been one of reconciliation .
If people want to put their past behind them , to apologize , to say , " Look , we made mistakes in the past , but we want to move forward , " I respect that and embrace it , because all of us have made serious mistakes in our lives , and I certainly am one of them .
But if this person is still proud of that kind of activity ...
HANNITY : In 2001 , he said , " I regret not doing more . "
MCCAIN : Then obviously , a person like that has to be repudiated , or apologize for doing things that could have done damage to America ...
HANNITY : It 's a terrorist we 're describing .
MCCAIN : I would hope that that individual would come forward and say that they regret -- that he regrets deeply what he did .
And frankly , to -- for anyone to be proud of that kind of activity , of breaking laws , is just not something that we can -- in America we think is right .
HANNITY : What do you say to conservatives like -- and we have a minute -- Rush Limbaugh , James Dobson , Tom DeLay , Rick Santorum , that have been pretty strong in their opposition against you ?
MCCAIN : Well , I respect their views .
I will continue to reach out to all parts of our party .
And if anyone would like to talk with me , I 'd love to have the opportunity to talk with them .
HANNITY : Would you go on Rush 's show ?
MCCAIN : Well , if he -- if he wanted to talk with me , I would be glad to talk to him .
Honestly , I will not ask to speak to him .
His views and others have been made very clear .
But my job is to unite the party and to energize it and try and get as many people engaged and involved .
And remember , we 've got a big job ahead of us , including the independents , including the old Reagan Democrats .
But I am -- I am proud of my conservative Republican credentials and record .
HANNITY : All right .
We 're going to take a break .
Our final moments with Senator John McCain , coming up straight ahead .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
HANNITY : And our final moments tonight with Senator John McCain .
Thank you , by the way , for being with us for the hour .
We really appreciate it .
What do you think happened to Hillary Clinton 's campaign ?
MCCAIN : I do n't know , but I was not surprised that she was able to come back in Ohio and Texas .
I think she is a very resilient campaigner , and I think she is -- of the little I 've observed , she 's become a better campaigner as this campaign has worn on .
I would never underestimate her .
I would never underestimate Senator Obama , either .
They 're both very formidable opponents .
But as I said before , clear philosophical differences .
Respectful but vigorous .
HANNITY : And so you 're going to -- this is going to be about the war in Iraq .
This is going to be about health care .
This is going to be about taxes .
Judges .
MCCAIN : Higher taxes , lower taxes , bigger government .
Judges .
Going to be a conservative Republican against a liberal Democrat , and I hope the American people will be proud of this debate .
It will be respectful but very vigorous .
HANNITY : But you keep going back to the respectful .
You really -- this is a top priority for you , in the 20 seconds we have .
MCCAIN : I think people want that , you know ?
They do n't want ...
HANNITY : They just want me and Alan to fight each other .
MCCAIN : There you go .
But you guys have gotten along pretty well .
HANNITY : Now , we 've -- it 's been 12 years .
Senator , you 've been very gracious with your time .
MCCAIN : Thank you .
HANNITY : Thank you for being with us for the full hour .
And that ends this special program , this special edition .
And we appreciate Senator McCain 's time .
And of course , we 'll be back tomorrow night with more lively debate .
We 're also following the story tonight night of Senator Barack Obama and the new tape that has been revealed about this pastor .
As always , thank you for being with us and have a great night .
Amputee Combat Vet Daniel McConnell Plans Big Trip
It only takes a few moments in the presence of Daniel McConnell before you start to feel this man is destined for great things .
Self - deprecating humor aside , McConnell has a refreshingly positive attitude and his joie de vivre is infectious .
McConnell is a 30 - year - old Army veteran who miraculously escaped death in an Apache helicopter crash two years ago while serving in Afghanistan .
He lost his right hand , partial hearing in his right ear and sustained a brain injury and a broken back , but make no mistake about it ; the injuries are not what defines this man .
In each person 's life , there are Defining Moments , moments in time that open your eyes to new possibilities and everything after is forever altered .
On April 28 , 2006 , the Apache helicopter McConnell and another pilot were flying was cut off by the Black Hawk they were escorting while they were attempting to clear a landing zone for insurgents *( see note below ) .
The 1st Lieutenant found himself on the desert floor , staring at an empty bloodstained sleeve and thinking " Well hell , there goes med school , " - a Defining Moment , for sure , but after digging a bit deeper , I find another , perhaps more poignant moment in Daniel 's life .
At age 18 , fresh out of high school in a small town north of Jackson , TN , with no money for college , McConnell saw the Army as a way out .
Ridiculed in his early days of enlistment , because he could n't run very well , McConnell began to believe “ I suck , I do n’t belong here , I made a mistake , and this is not my thing . ”
McConnell says , “ I ended up getting put into the headquarters company , which , at the time and in the unit I was with … when you got stuck in the headquarters company , it was because you sucked and there was nothing else for you .
That was your last stop on your way out .
You were going to end up getting separated from the military for some reason . "
“ And I went in there , and I like organization but it was a train wreck .
So I organized everything .
I put all the files the way they should be , and got all the company rosters organized , and threw out all the stuff that was old and did n’t need to be there anymore .
I turned the training room around , ” he says , quickly adding , “ With the help of other people there , not single - handedly .
Nobody accomplishes anything alone . ”
When he was done , the 1st Sergeant commended him for a job well done .
“ That was probably the first time in the Army I ’d ever had any positive reinforcement for anything , ” says McConnell .
“ I was like , ‘ Wait , hold on .
I did well ?
Wow , I just thought I sucked all the time . ’
And , I mean , it ’s like a dog that you feed , you know ?
They ’ll keep coming back for more food , and so I ’m like , what can I do now ? ”
Not wanting to let the 1st Sergeant down , McConnell began looking for other things to do , and do well .
He kept his uniform pressed , shined his boots , and read all the field manuals .
“ You could ask me anything related to infantry tactics at the time , anything about weapons range , the Bradley , and I knew it backwards and forwards .
Ultimately they were like ‘ Why is this guy up here at headquarters company ?
Why is he not down in a line unit where he can put all this to use ? ’
So I ended up getting put back down in a line unit , which is the actual unit level where you ’re doing your job …and see , now I came with a reputation rather than being the new guy straight out of basic training , who could n’t run and sucked , I came as that guy who gets shit done .
And because of that , the whole ‘ he ca n’t run for shit ’ thing started getting overlooked .
They were like , well he ca n’t run for shit , but he shoots expert , well he ca n’t run for crap but he knows everything he needs to know .
So basically , even though I had n’t changed much from the way I was , the reputation was established as to how I was now .
And there were some changes in leadership along the way .
So thanks to that 1st Sergeant - 1st Sergeant Duncan , I still remember him well - George Duncan . ”
McConnell says
“ This was a lesson I always tried to give to people I ran into , when I was a Sergeant , or a Lieutenant or a Captain and I was training guys below , or even guys at my same level , I would tell them never , ever underestimate the power of positive reinforcement . ”
So we have another Defining Moment that provided a paradigm shift for Daniel McConnell .
And now Daniel begins another chapter of his life .
As his first year of medical school at East Tennessee State University comes to an end , McConnell is using the break to follow the advice given to students to “ set themselves apart ” during their “ golden summer ” ( the only summer they will have off during med school . )
Questioning how doing research , like all the other students , would set him apart , he tried to think outside the box , and it dawned on him that he dedicated 11 ½ years of his life to this country and he ’d like to see it .
Touring the country in a 1984 Suburban , affectionately dubbed the Pinto Bean , with his mildly retarded Boxer , Rocky , ( ha , I just got the joke ) , McConnell plans to sleep in his truck and stay off the interstate as much as possible to keep costs down .
Originally budgeting for the trip when gas was $ 2.15 a gallon , Daniel unfortunately had to resort to asking for donations on his website to help him cover the cost of the trip , now that gas is nearing $ 4.00 a gallon .
He realizes the risks involved ( the truck breaking down , the money running out , etc ) however he has a gut feeling on this one , and if there is one thing Daniel 's accident has taught him , it is to follow his instincts – but that is a whole other story , perhaps one for the book .
When I asked him if there was anything in particular he was looking forward to seeing , McConnell responded , “ What I ’m really , really looking forward to seeing … it sounds corny to say , but …everything ! ”
Daniel will be chronicling his travels at danielsbigtrip .
blogspot.com where you can also make donations , or just e-mail with ideas and suggestions , good and bad .
He hopes to write a book about his adventures when he returns .
At the very least , I would recommend reading the prologue by clicking HERE .
* Note : Both McConnell and the other pilot distinctively remember the Blackhawk cutting them off ; however , despite the accident occurring in combat action , the official findings listed the cause as “ mechanical failure ” making Daniel ineligible to receive a Purple Heart .
PRINCETON , N.J .
Many of us have known this scholar :
The hair is well - streaked with gray , the chin has begun to sag , but still our tortured friend slaves away at a masterwork intended to change the course of civilization that everyone else just hopes will finally get a career under way .
We even have a name for this sometimes pitied species — the A.B.D. — All But Dissertation .
But in academia these days , that person is less a subject of ridicule than of soul - searching about what can done to shorten the time , sometimes much of a lifetime , it takes for so many graduate students to , well , graduate .
The Council of Graduate Schools , representing 480 universities in the United States and Canada , is halfway through a seven - year project to explore ways of speeding up the ordeal .
For those who attempt it , the doctoral dissertation can loom on the horizon like Everest , gleaming invitingly as a challenge but often turning into a masochistic exercise once the ascent is begun .
The average student takes 8.2 years to get a Ph.D. ; in education , that figure surpasses 13 years .
Fifty percent of students drop out along the way , with dissertations the major stumbling block .
At commencement , the typical doctoral holder is 33 , an age when peers are well along in their professions , and 12 percent of graduates are saddled with more than $ 50,000 in debt .
These statistics , compiled by the National Science Foundation and other government agencies by studying the 43,354 doctoral recipients of 2005 , were even worse a few years ago .
Now , universities are setting stricter timelines and demanding that faculty advisers meet regularly with protégés .
Most science programs allow students to submit three research papers rather than a single grand work .
More universities find ways to ease financial burdens , providing better paid teaching assistantships as well as tuition waivers .
And more universities are setting up writing groups so that students feel less alone cobbling together a thesis .
2008 is shaping up to be the year of the 5 - megapixel camera phone .
And we could n't be more excited .
Let 's face it , the crummy , submegapixel imaging chips crammed into most phones today take awful - looking photos .
The iPhone 's 2 - megapixel camera is an improvement , but even its photos look crummy next to a standard - issue digital camera from five years ago .
Thankfully , most handset manufacturers are realizing that a phone with an integrated 5 - megapixel camera makes for a much more satisfying device .
In fact , some of these gadgets look more like cameras with integrated cellular data technology than phones with added - on digital imaging sensors .
Here are a few of the 5 - megapixel camera phones on display at CTIA Wireless this week .
We had a chance to play with a lot of handsets at the conference , but these phones stood head and shoulders above the others .
LG Viewty
We first saw this camera at CeBit earlier this year .
It has one of the finest cameras ever integrated into a cellphone .
The shutter speed is phenomenal and colors are true and vibrant – even under the harsh halogens of the Las Vegas Convention Center .
Samsung Soul
No , it wo n't be available in the United States right away ( those cheese - eating , deodorant - eschewing Europeans get it first ) , but it does come with the requisite 5 - megapixel camera .
Plus it also includes a vibrant OLED display right above the keypad .
Sony Ericsson C902
This way - too - thin , way - too - pretty handset also first appeared at CeBit .
It contains useful picture - taking apps like face detection and a program Sony Ericsson calls " bestpic " technology , which lets you fire off nine pictures in rapid succession and then pick the one that looks best .
Nokia N82 Black Edition
Yes , it 's just like the silver N82 released earlier this year and yes , it still sports the same specs : auto focus , Carl Zeiss lens and Xenon flash .
And yes , its image quality is still dead - on gorgeous .
But hey :
It 's black !
__Samsung F480 __
This is sort of a clone of the much - maligned , perpetually delayed LG Prada phone we first saw at last year 's CTIA .
It 's gorgeous , sports a full touchscreen interface , snaps lovely 5 MP pictures with its built - in LED flash , and will be sold in the United States sometime this year .
We would n't mind carrying any of these handsets around in our pockets .
In addition to their quality cameras , many are mated with super - speedy HSDPA ( high - speed downlink packet access ) for retrieving wireless data , quad - band capability and innovative upgrades like OLED screens .
All that adds up to a lot more than just cellphones with cameras haphazardly slapped on them .
For the first time , instead of hiding our camera - phone pics in the darkest , most inaccessible recesses of a Flickr account , we might feel like blowing these pictures up and actually showing them to our friends .
Well , here you are at your college graduation .
And I know what you ’re thinking : “ Gimme the sheepskin and get me outta here ! ”
But not so fast .
First you have to listen to a commencement speech .
Do n’t moan .
I ’m not going to “ pass the wisdom of one generation down to the next . ”
I ’m a member of the 1960s generation .
We did n’t have any wisdom .
We were the moron generation .
We were the generation that believed we could stop the Vietnam War by growing our hair long and dressing like circus clowns .
We believed drugs would change everything -- which they did , for John Belushi .
We believed in free love .
Yes , the love was free , but we paid a high price for the sex .
My generation spoiled everything for you .
It has always been the special prerogative of young people to look and act weird and shock grown - ups .
But my generation exhausted the Earth ’s resources of the weird .
Weird clothes -- we wore them .
Weird beards -- we grew them .
Weird words and phrases -- we said them .
So , when it came your turn to be original and look and act weird , all you had left was to tattoo your faces and pierce your tongues .
Ouch .
That must have hurt .
I apologize .

So now , it ’s my job to give you advice .
But I ’m thinking :
You ’re finishing 16 years of education , and you ’ve heard all the conventional good advice you can stand .
So , let me offer some relief :
1 . Go out and make a bunch of money !
Here we are living in the world ’s most prosperous country , surrounded by all the comforts , conveniences and security that money can provide .
Yet no American political , intellectual or cultural leader ever says to young people , “ Go out and make a bunch of money . ”
Instead , they tell you that money ca n’t buy happiness .
Maybe , but money can rent it .
There ’s nothing the matter with honest moneymaking .
Wealth is not a pizza , where if I have too many slices you have to eat the Domino ’s box .
In a free society , with the rule of law and property rights , no one loses when someone else gets rich .

2 . Do n’t be an idealist !
Do n’t chain yourself to a redwood tree .
Instead , be a corporate lawyer and make $ 500,000 a year .
No matter how much you cheat the IRS , you ’ll still end up paying $ 100,000 in property , sales and excise taxes .
That ’s $ 100,000 to schools , sewers , roads , firefighters and police .
You ’ll be doing good for society .
Does chaining yourself to a redwood tree do society $ 100,000 worth of good ?
Idealists are also bullies .
The idealist says , “ I care more about the redwood trees than you do .
I care so much I ca n’t eat .
I ca n’t sleep .
It broke up my marriage .
And because I care more than you do , I ’m a better person .
And because I ’m the better person , I have the right to boss you around . ”
Get a pair of bolt cutters and liberate that tree .

Who does more for the redwoods and society anyway -- the guy chained to a tree or the guy who founds the “ Green Travel Redwood Tree - Hug Tour Company ” and makes a million by turning redwoods into a tourist destination , a valuable resource that people will pay just to go look at ?
So make your contribution by getting rich .
Do n’t be an idealist .
3 . Get politically uninvolved !
All politics stink .
Even democracy stinks .
Imagine if our clothes were selected by the majority of shoppers , which would be teenage girls .
I ’d be standing here with my bellybutton exposed .
Imagine deciding the dinner menu by family secret ballot .
I ’ve got three kids and three dogs in my family .
We ’d be eating Froot Loops and rotten meat .
Advertisement
But let me make a distinction between politics and politicians .
Some people are under the misapprehension that all politicians stink .
Impeach George W. Bush , and everything will be fine .
Nab Ted Kennedy on a DUI , and the nation ’s problems will be solved .
But the problem is n’t politicians -- it ’s politics .
Politics wo n’t allow for the truth .
And we ca n’t blame the politicians for that .
Imagine what even a little truth would sound like on today ’s campaign trail :
“ No , I ca n’t fix public education .
The problem is n’t the teachers unions or a lack of funding for salaries , vouchers or more computer equipment
The problem is your kids ! ”
4. Forget about fairness !
Advertisement
We all get confused about the contradictory messages that life and politics send .
Life sends the message , “ I ’d better not be poor .
I ’d better get rich .
I ’d better make more money than other people . ”
Meanwhile , politics sends us the message , “ Some people make more money than others .
Some are rich while others are poor .
We ’d better close that ‘ income disparity gap . ’
It ’s not fair ! ”
Well , I am here to advocate for unfairness .
I ’ve got a 10 - year - old at home .
She ’s always saying , “ That ’s not fair . ”
When she says this , I say , “ Honey , you ’re cute .
That ’s not fair .
Your family is pretty well off .
That ’s not fair .
You were born in America .
That ’s not fair .
Darling , you had better pray to God that things do n’t start getting fair for you . ”
What we need is more income , even if it means a bigger income disparity gap .
5 . Be a religious extremist !
Advertisement
So , avoid politics if you can .
But if you absolutely cannot resist , read the Bible for political advice -- even if you ’re a Buddhist , atheist or whatever .
Do n’t get me wrong , I am not one of those people who believes that God is involved in politics .
On the contrary .
Observe politics in this country .
Observe politics around the world .
Observe politics through history .
Does it look like God ’s involved ?
The Bible is very clear about one thing : Using politics to create fairness is a sin .
Observe the Tenth Commandment .
The first nine commandments concern theological principles and social law :
Thou shalt not make graven images , steal , kill , et cetera .
Fair enough .
But then there ’s the tenth : “ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’s house .
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is thy neighbor ’s . ”
Here are God ’s basic rules about how we should live , a brief list of sacred obligations and solemn moral precepts .
And , right at the end of it we read , “ Do n’t envy your buddy because he has an ox or a donkey . ”
Why did that make the top 10 ?
Why would God , with just 10 things to tell Moses , include jealousy about livestock ?
Well , think about how important this commandment is to a community , to a nation , to a democracy .
If you want a mule , if you want a pot roast , if you want a cleaning lady , do n’t whine about what the people across the street have .
Get rich and get your own .

Now , one last thing :
6 . Do n’t listen to your elders !
After all , if the old person standing up here actually knew anything worth telling , he ’d be charging you for it .
We have n't seen it yet , but it looks like a modern classic .
1 The Nightmare of Edgar Allan Poe ( 2001 ) , Starring Michael Jackson
Edgar Allan
Poe 's gloomy ass pretty much invented American horror .
His life story is filled with the kind of drunken , drug - crazed insanity that was made for the cinema .
Sure , most of that craziness was completely made up by one Rufus Wilmot Griswold ( Poe 's bitter enemy in life and official biographer in death ) , but that 's no reason to let the truth spoil a kick - ass story .

What Went Wrong ?
This might surprise you , but we 're actually not going to talk any shit about the talk of casting Michael Jackson .
It 's a horror project and Michael Jackson is fucking terrifying .
It 's like chocolate and peanut butter meeting up for the first time or something .
Whatever you do , do n't imagine those two fucking
So , what could go wrong ?
Well , they could have hired William Malone ( Fear Dot Com , Creature ) to direct .
They could have gotten the script from some guy named Philip Levins ( nine episodes of Smallville , including one where , we are not fucking kidding , Superman 's dad is wrongly accused of shooting Lex Luthor 's dad , which we guess must be what started that whole crazy feud between the two of them ) .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That 's exactly what they did .
This would have been pretty much the worst horror movie ever .
What Went Right ?
Michael Jackson , probably .
Jackson had kind of a string of these canceled projects .
Over the years , there were plans for him to play the lead in a musical version of Peter Pan , a film version of the Phantom of the Opera musical , and some kind of werewolf movie that may or may not have been a musical .
Now , we can't say for sure what it was that killed these projects , but imagine that you 're in a meeting with the King of Pop , ironing out the details of a major film .
How long do you think it would take for you to realize that " meeting " is just a euphemism for " I 'm trapped in this room with a fucking lunatic ? "
Until he started humping your leg ?
A few minutes after that , maybe ?

What You Can Watch Instead :
We 'd love to say that it 's the biopic Poe , written and directed by Sylvester Stallone and starring Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings , but that one has n't been shot yet , and we can't help thinking that the project is destined to show up in a list not unlike this one some day .
No , instead , we 've got some dippy direct - to - video thing called The Death of Poe :

Welcome to your annual performance review .
In the next 90 minutes we will :
Review your performance over the last 12 months
Follow up on the goals from last year ’s review
Set new goals for your professional development and career
Handle any problems you might have had in the last year
Fill out this 8 - page form required by HR
Coach you to better performance
Get your totally open and honest feedback to my leadership
And of course , we will both pretend that the results of this little chat will not in any way influence the salary adjustments coming up in two months .
Now … any questions ?
It seems that no one likes performance reviews .
Joel Spolsky , the CEO of Fog Creek Software certainly does n’t :
At two of the companies I ’ve worked for , the most stressful time of year was the twice - yearly performance review period .
For some reason , the Juno HR department and the Microsoft HR department must have copied their performance review system out of the same Dilbertesque management book , because both programs worked exactly the same way .
First , you gave “ anonymous ” upward reviews for your direct manager ( as if that could be done in an honest way ) .
Then , you filled out optional “ self - evaluation ” forms , which your manager “ took into account ” in preparing your performance review .
Finally , you got a numerical score , in lots of non-scalar categories like “ works well with others ” , from 1 - 5 , where the only possible scores were actually 3 or 4 .
Managers submitted bonus recommendations upwards , which were completely ignored and everybody received bonuses that were almost completely random .
The system never took into account the fact that people have different and unique talents , all of which are needed for a team to work well .
( source )
Almost every medium - sized or large company does performance reviews .
Everybody does it – and I think it ’s time to stop !
Performance reviews are fundamentally broken .
Managers hate them and fear them and resent the drain on their time .
Employees often leave reviews demotivated , cynical and with no clear idea of how well they ’re doing and how to improve :
Research into British workers found a quarter of respondents thought managers simply regarded the reviews as a “ tick - box ” exercise , while one in five accused their bosses of not even thinking about the appraisal until they were in the room .
Almost half ( 44 per cent ) did not think their boss was honest during the process , 29 per cent thought they were pointless , and a fifth felt they had had an unfair appraisal , according to the YouGov poll of 3000 workers .
Only a fifth believed their manager would always act on what came up during the review and 20 per cent said their boss never bothered to follow up any concerns raised .
( source )
There is a lot of advice out there on how to fix performance reviews but in my opinion , performance reviews would still be worse than uselss , even if we could fix everything that is currently wrong about them and the very fact that companies fell the need to have them , shows that something is seriously broken in our workplaces .
Here ’s why performance reviews and appraisals are such a waste of time and why our workplaces would be better off without them .
1 : Everybody hates them
Managers actually cite performance appraisals or annual reviews as one of their most disliked tasks ( source ) and as we saw above , employees dislike and distrust the process too .
Performance reviews are supposed to be about giving people feedback on their past performance and setting goals for the future .
This is impossible in a format that people dislike this intensely .
Studies show that if you ’re in a bad mood ( and lots of people are during their review meetings ) , you ’re not open to criticism and suggestions .
You ’re also almost certainly not in the mood to make big plans for your future growth and development
2 : They try to do too much
Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins in their 2000 book called “ Abolishing Performance Appraisals : Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead ” argue that employee reviews take on too many tasks at once .
They ’re about communications , feedback , coaching , promotion , compensation and legal documentation .
Good luck doing all of that in an hour or two !
3 : They become an excuse for not talking for the rest of the year
“ Yeah , I know that Johnson in accounting is lagging a little and seems dissatisfied , but his performance review is coming up in 4 months – we ’ll handle it then . ”
No .
No , no , no !
In fact , If you have good , open , honest communication between managers and employees , if people constantly know what they do well end where they can improve then you have no need for a formal review process .
4 : They are too structured and formal
Many companies have noticed that formal reviews are not working and the response , overwhelmingly , has been to formalize them more .
There are now more questionnaires to fill out before , during and after for both employees and managers .
More boxes to tick .
More ratings on a 1 - 5 scale More time spent preparing .
But here ’s the thing :
This actually detracts from the value of the conversation you will have .
The more you structure the conversation , the less likelihood that you will actually get to talk about what ’s important .
The more boxes to tick , the more likely it is that it will get treated as an exercise in “ filling in the blanks . ”
5 : They focus too much on the quantifiable
Joel Spolsky has another good example :
… one friend of mine was a cheerful catalyst , a bouncy cruise director who motivated everyone else when the going got tough .
He was the glue that held his team together .
But he tended to get negative reviews , because his manager did n’t understand his contribution .
Many of the most valuable and important things we contribute to the workplace do not fit into those little check boxes .
If a manager does n’t understand this during the year , he will most certainly not get it in the performance review .
6 : They may not be formally connected with promotions and salary negotiations – in reality everyone knows they are
A lot of companies have noticed that performance reviews go even worse when they also double as negotiations about salaries and promotions .
Consequently they have separated these two processes and will first have appraisals and then later on salary negotiations .
Riiiiiight .
Does anyone expect this to work ?
Will managers forget everything they said in the appraisal when setting salaries later on ?
Will employees fall for this and be more honest , rather than try to make themselves look good ?
Of course not .
But trying to pretend that ’s the way it works just adds another layer of deception to the whole sorry mess .
7 : No one says what they really think
Managers can hold back from offering negative feedback because they fear conflict .
Employees often do n’t offer honest criticism of managers and workplaces out of a fear of offending and the knowledge that , regardless of formal policies , the content of this talk will affect your salary .
In short , everyone is on the defensive from the beginning .
8 : They take a LOT of time
Everybody ’s busy these days , and on top of your regular tasks , once a year you have to find time to prepare for , execute and follow up on the performance reviews .
To make matters worse , very few companies factor in this time in peoples ’ schedules and give them a lighter workload during those weeks .
This means that rather than doing it right , many people focus on doing it fast and just getting it over with , making the whole process worse than useless .
9 : They become a crutch for bad managers
If you ’re not capable of giving your employees regular , specific , timely and relevant feedback ( good and bad ) – you should not be a manager at all .
And formal performance reviews are not the solution !
The managers who actually do manage to give worthwhile performance reviews are invariably also those who do n’t need to have them because they already excel at providing regular , constructive feedback .
What to do instead
A 2006 Harvard Business Review article talks about how to fix employee reviews by doing things like :
Have them more often than annually
Make their purpose clear
Give continuous feedback
Add forced ranking of employees ( worst idea ever ! )
But I think the solution is a lot simpler : lose ’em .
Stop having formal employee reviews , whether annual , semi-annual or quarterly .
They ’re not only a waste of time , they ’re actively harmful to motivation and happiness at work .
As Peter Block says in the foreword to the Abolishing Performance Appraisals book mentioned above :
“ If the appraisal process is so useful , we should consider using it in our personal lives .
Would we say to our spouse , significant other or intimate friend , ‘ Dear , it is time for your annual performance appraisal .
For the sake of our relationship and the well - being of the family unit , I want you to prepare for a discussion of your strengths and weaknesses and the ways you have fallen short of your goals for the year .
” ‘ Also , honey , I would like for you to define some stretch goals for the coming year . ’
( source )
Good luck with that :o )
Your take
What do you think ?
Do you know of companies that have abolished performance reviews ?
Do you know of any that have them and do them well ?
What happened at your last performance review ?
Please write a comment , I ’d really like to know .

A sheriff in the Hudson River Valley near Albany , New York , about to go into the hills in the fall of 1839 to collect back rents from tenants on the enormous Rensselaer estate , was handed a letter :
... the tenants have organized themselves into a body , and resolved not to pay any more rent until they can be redressed of their grievances .
. . .
The tenants now assume the right of doing to their landlord as he has for a long time done with them , viz : as they please .
You need not think this to be children 's play ... . if you come out in your official capacity ... I would not pledge for your safe return .
... A Tenant .
When a deputy arrived in the farming area with writs demanding the rent , farmers suddenly appeared , assembled by the blowing of tin horns .
They seized his writs and burned them .
That December , a sheriff and a mounted posse of five hundred rode into the farm country , but found themselves in the midst of shrieking tin horns , eighteen hundred farmers blocking their path , six hundred more blocking their rear , all mounted , armed with pitchforks and clubs .
The sheriff and his posse turned back , the rear guard parting to let them through .
This was the start of the Anti-Renter movement in the Hudson Valley , described by Henry Christman in Tin Horns and Calico .
It was a protest against the patroonship system , which went back to the 1600s when the Dutch ruled New York , a system where ( as Christman describes it ) " a few families , intricately intermarried , controlled the destinies of three hundred thousand people and ruled in almost kingly splendor near two million acres of land . "
The tenants paid taxes and rents .
The largest manor was owned by the Rensselaer family , which ruled over about eighty thousand tenants and had accumulated a fortune of $ 41 million .
The landowner , as one sympathizer of the tenants put it , could " swill his wine , loll on his cushions , fill his life with society , food , and culture , and ride his barouche and five saddle horses along the beautiful river valley and up to the backdrop of the mountain . "
By the summer of 1839 , the tenants were holding their first mass meeting .
The economic crisis of 1837 had filled the area with unemployed seeking land , on top of the layoffs accompanying the completion of the Erie Canal , after the first wave of railroad building ended .
That summer the tenants resolved : " We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses . "
Certain men in the farm country became leaders and organizers : Smith Boughton , a country doctor on horseback ; Ainge Devyr , a revolutionary Irishman .
Devyr had seen monopoly of land and industry bring misery to the slumdwellers of London , Liverpool , and Glasgow , had agitated for change , had been arrested for sedition , and fled to America .
He was invited to address a Fourth of July rally of farmers in Rensselaerville , where he warned his listeners : " If you permit unprincipled and ambitious men to monopolize the soil , they will become masters of the country in the certain order of cause and effect .... "
Thousands of farmers in Rensselaer country were organized into Anti-Rent associations to prevent the landlords from evicting .
They agreed on calico Indian costumes , symbol of the Boston Tea Party and recalling original ownership of the soil .
The tin horn represented an Indian call to arms .
Soon ten thousand men were trained and ready .
Organizing went on in county after county , in dozens of towns along the Hudson .
Handbills appeared :
ATTENTION
ANTI - RENTERS ! AWAKE ! AROUSE !...
Strike till the last armed foe expires ,
Strike for your altars and your fires -
Strike for the green graves of your sires ,
God and your happy homes !
Sheriffs and deputy sheriffs trying to serve writs on farmers were surrounded by calico - clad riders who had been summoned by tin horns sounding in the countryside - then tarred and feathered .
The New York Herald , once sympathetic , now deplored " the insurrectionary spirit of the mountaineers . "
One of the most hated elements of the lease gave the landlord the right to the timber on all the farms .
A man sent onto a tenant 's land to gather wood for the landlord was killed .
Tension rose .
A farm boy was killed mysteriously , no one knew by whom , but Dr. Boughton was jailed .
The governor ordered artillerymen into action , and a company of cavalry came up from New York City .
Petitions for an antirent bill , signed by 25,000 tenants , were put before the legislature in 1845 .
The bill was defeated .
A kind of guerrilla war resumed in the country , between bands of " Indians " and sheriffs ' posses .
Boughton was kept in jail seven months , four and a half months of that in heavy irons , before being released on bail .
Fourth of July meetings in 1845 attended by thousands of farmers pledged continued resistance .
When a deputy sheriff tried to sell the livestock of a farmer named Moses Earle , who owed $ 60 rent on 160 stony acres , there was a fight , and the deputy was killed .
Similar attempts to sell livestock for rent payments were thwarted , again and again .
The governor sent three hundred troops in , declaring a state of rebellion existed , and soon almost a hundred Anti-Renters were in jail .
Smith Boughton was brought to trial .
He was charged with taking papers from a sheriff but declared by the judge to have in fact committed " high treason , rebellion against your government , and armed insurrection " and sentenced to life imprisonment .
Those " Indians " found to be armed and disguised at Moses Earle 's farm , where the deputy had been killed , were declared by the judge to be guilty of murder , and the jury was so instructed .
All were found guilty , and the judge sentenced four to life imprisonment and two to be hanged .
Two of the leaders were told to write letters urging the Anti-Renters to disband , as their only chance to escape heavy sentences .
They wrote the letters .
The power of the law thus crushed the Anti-Rent movement .
It was intended to make clear that farmers could not win by fighting - that they must confine their efforts to voting , to acceptable methods of reform .
In 1845 , the Anti-Renters elected fourteen members to the state legislature .
Governor Silas
Wright now commuted to life imprisonment the two death sentences and asked the legislature to give relief to the tenants , to end the feudal system in the Hudson Valley .
Proposals to break up the huge estates on the death of the owners were defeated , but the legislature voted to make illegal the selling of tenant property for nonpayment of rent .
A constitutional convention that year outlawed new feudal leases .
The next governor , elected in 1846 with Anti-Rent support , had promised to pardon the Anti-Rent prisoners , and he did .
Throngs of farmers greeted them on their release .
Court decisions in the 1850s began to limit the worst features of the manorial system , without changing the fundamentals of landlord - tenant relations .
Sporadic farmer resistance to the collection of back rents continued into the 1860s .
As late as 1869 , bands of " Indians " were still assembling to thwart sheriffs acting for a rich valley landowner named Walter Church .
In the early 1880s a deputy sheriff trying to dispossess a farmer on behalf of Church was killed by shotgun fire .
By this time most leases had passed into the hands of the farmers .
In three of the main Anti-Rent counties , of twelve thousand farmers , only two thousand remained under lease .
The farmers had fought , been crushed by the law , their struggle diverted into voting , and the system stabilized by enlarging the class of small landowners , leaving the basic structure of rich and poor intact .
It was a common sequence in American history .
Around the time of the Anti-Renter movement in New York , there was excitement in Rhode Island over Dorr 's Rebellion .
As Marvin Gettleman points out in The Dorr Rebellion , it was both a movement for electoral reform and an example of radical insurgency .
It was prompted by the Rhode Island charter 's rule that only owners of land could vote .
As more people left the farm for the city , as immigrants came to work in the mills , the disfranchised grew .
Seth Luther , self - educated carpenter in Providence and spokesman for working people , wrote in 1833 the " Address on the Right of Free Suffrage , " denouncing the monopoly of political power by " the mushroom lordlings , sprigs of nobility . . . small potato aristocrats " of Rhode Island .
He urged non-cooperation with the government , refusing to pay taxes or to serve in the militia .
Why , he asked , should twelve thousand working people in Rhode Island without the vote submit to five thousand who had land and could vote ?
Thomas Dorr , a lawyer from a well - to - do family , became a leader of the suffrage movement .
Working people formed the Rhode Island Suffrage Association , and in the spring of 1841 thousands paraded in Providence carrying banners and signs for electoral reform .
Going outside the legal system , they organized their own " People 's Convention " and drafted a new constitution without property qualifications for voting .
In early 1842 , they invited votes on the constitution ; fourteen thousand voted for it , including about five thousand with property - therefore a majority even of those legally entitled to vote by the charter .
In April they held an unofficial election , in which Dorr ran unopposed for governor , and six thousand people voted for him .
The governor of Rhode Island in the meantime got the promise of President John Tyler that in the case of rebellion federal troops would be sent .
There was a clause in the U.S. Constitution to meet just that kind of situation , providing for federal intervention to quell local insurrections on request of a state government .
Ignoring this , on May 3 , 1842 , the Dorr forces held an inauguration with a great parade of artisans , shopkeepers , mechanics , and militia marching through Providence .
The newly elected People 's Legislature was convened .
Dorr led a fiasco of an attack on the state arsenal , his cannon misfiring .
Dorr 's arrest was ordered by the regular governor , and he went into hiding outside the state , trying to raise military support .
Despite the protests of Dorr and a few others , the " People 's Constitution " kept the word " white " in its clause designating voters .
Angry Rhode Island blacks now joined the militia units of the Law and Order coalition , which promised that a new constitutional convention would give them the right to vote .
When Dorr returned to Rhode Island , he found several hundred of his followers , mostly working people , willing to fight for the People 's Constitution , but there were thousands in the regular militia on the side of the state .
The rebellion disintegrated and Dorr again fled Rhode Island .
Martial law was declared .
One rebel soldier , captured , was blindfolded and put before a firing squad , which fired with blank bullets .
A hundred other militia were taken prisoner .
One of them described their being bound by ropes into platoons of eight , marched on foot 16 miles to Providence , " threatened and pricked by the bayonet if we lagged from fatigue , the rope severely chafing our arms ; the skin off mine .
. . . no water till we reached Greenville ... no food until the next day .... and , after being exhibited , were put into the State prison . "
A new constitution offered some reform .
It still gave overrepresentation to the rural areas , limited the vote to property owners or those who paid a one - dollar poll tax , and would let naturalized citizens vote only if they had $ 134 in real estate .
In the elections of early 1843 , the Law and Order group , opposed by former Dorrites , used intimidation of state militia , of employees by employers , of tenants by landlords , to get out their vote .
It lost in the industrial towns , but got the vote of the agrarian areas , and won all major offices .
Dorr returned to Rhode Island in the fall of 1843 .
He was arrested on the streets of Providence and tried for treason .
The jury , instructed by the judge to ignore all political arguments and consider only whether Dorr had committed certain overt acts ( which he never denied committing ) , found him guilty , whereupon the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor .
He spent twenty months in jail , and then a newly elected Law and Order governor , anxious to end Dorr 's martyrdom , pardoned him .
Armed force had failed , the ballot had failed , the courts had taken the side of the conservatives .
The Dorr movement now went to the U.S. Supreme Court , via a trespass suit by Martin Luther against Law and Order militiamen , charging that the People 's Government was the legitimate government in Rhode Island in 1842 .
Daniel Webster argued against the Dorrites .
If people could claim a constitutional right to overthrow an existing government , Webster said , there would be no more law and no more government ; there would be anarchy .
In its decision , the Supreme Court established ( Luther v. Borden , 1849 ) a long - lasting doctrine : it would not interfere in certain " political " questions , to be left to executive and legislature .
The decision reinforced the essentially conservative nature of the Supreme Court : that on critical issues - war and revolution - it would defer to the President and Congress .
The stories of the Anti-Renter movement and Dorr 's Rebellion are not usually found in textbooks on United States history .
In these books , given to millions of young Americans , there is little on class struggle in the nineteenth century .
The period before and after the Civil War is filled with politics , elections , slavery , and the race question .
Even where specialized books on the Jacksonian period deal with labor and economic issues they center on the presidency , and thus perpetuate the traditional dependency on heroic leaders rather than people 's struggles .
Andrew Jackson said he spoke for " the humble members of society - the farmer , mechanics and laborers ... . "
He certainly did not speak for the Indians being pushed off their lands , or slaves .
But the tensions aroused by the developing factory system , the growing immigration , required that the government develop a mass base of support among whites .
" Jacksonian Democracy " did just that .
Politics in this period of the 1830s and 1840s , according to Douglas Miller , a specialist in the Jacksonian period ( The Birth of Modern America ) , " had become increasingly centered around creating a popular image and flattering the common man . "
Miller is dubious , however , about the accuracy of that phrase " Jacksonian Democracy " :
Parades , picnics , and campaigns of personal slander characterized Jacksonian politicking .
But , although both parties aimed their rhetoric at the people and mouthed the sacred shibboleths of democracy , this did not mean that the common man ruled America .
The professional politicians corning to the fore in the twenties and thirties , though sometimes self - made , were seldom ordinary .
Both major parties were controlled largely by men of wealth and ambition .
Lawyers , newspaper editors , merchants , industrialists , large landowners , and speculators dominated the Democrats as well as the Whigs .
Jackson was the first President to master the liberal rhetoric - to speak for the common man .
This was a necessity for political victory when the vote was being demanded - as in Rhode Island - by more and more people , and state legislatures were loosening voting restrictions .
As another Jacksonian scholar , Robert Remini ( The Age of Jackson ) , says , after studying electoral figures for 1828 and 1832 :
Jackson himself enjoyed widespread support that ranged across all classes and sections of the country .
He attracted farmers , mechanics , laborers , professionals and even businessmen .
And all this without Jackson being clearly pro- or antilabor , pro- or antibusiness , pro- or antilower , middle or upper class .
It has been demonstrated that he was a strikebreaker [ Jackson sent troops to control rebellious workers on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ] , yet at different times ... he and the Democrats received the backing of organized labor .
It was the new politics of ambiguity - speaking for the lower and middle classes to get their support in times of rapid growth and potential turmoil .
The two - party system came into its own in this time .
To give people a choice between two different parties and allow them , in a period of rebellion , to choose the slightly more democratic one was an ingenious mode of control .
Like so much in the American system , it was not devilishly contrived by some master plotters ; it developed naturally out of the needs of the situation .
Remini compares the Jacksonian Democrat Martin Van Buren , who succeeded Jackson as President , with the Austrian conservative statesman Metternich : " Like Metternich , who was seeking to thwart revolutionary discontent in Europe , Van Buren and similar politicians were attempting to banish political disorder from the United States by a balance of power achieved through two well - organized and active parties . "
The Jacksonian idea was to achieve stability and control by winning to the Democratic party " the middling interest , and especially ... the substantial yeomanry of the country " by " prudent , judicious , well - considered reform . "
That is , reform that would not yield too much .
These were the words of Robert Rantoul , a reformer , corporation lawyer , and Jacksonian Democrat .
It was a forecast of the successful appeal of the Democratic party - and at times the Republican party - in the twentieth century .
Such new forms of political control were needed in the turbulence of growth , the possibility of rebellion .
Now there were canals , railroads , the telegraph .
In 1790 , fewer than a million Americans lived in cities ; in 1840 the figure was 11 million .
New York had 130,000 people in 1820 , a million by 1860 .
And while the traveler Alexis de Tocqueville had expressed astonishment at " the general equality of condition among the people , " he was not very good at numbers , his friend Beaumont said .
And his observation was not in accord with the facts , according to Edward Pessen , a historian of Jacksonian society ( Jacksonian America ) .
In Philadelphia , working - class families lived fifty - five to a tenement , usually one room per family , with no garbage removal , no toilets , no fresh air or water .
There was fresh water newly pumped from the Schuylkill River , but it was going to the homes of the rich .
In New York you could see the poor lying in the streets with the garbage .
There were no sewers in the slums , and filthy water drained into yards and alleys , into the cellars where the poorest of the poor lived , bringing with it a typhoid epidemic in 1837 , typhus in 1842 .
In the cholera epidemic of 1832 , the rich fled the city ; the poor stayed and died .
These poor could not be counted on as political allies of the government .
But they were there - like slaves , or Indians - invisible ordinarily , a menace if they rose .
There were more solid citizens , however , who might give steady support to the system - paid - paid workers , landowning farmers .
Also , there was the new urban white - collar worker , born in the rising commerce of the time , described by Thomas Cochran and William Miller ( The Age of Enterprise ) :
Dressed in drab alpaca , hunched over a high desk , this new worker credited and debited , indexed and filed , wrote and stamped invoices , acceptances , bills of lading , receipts .
Adequately paid , he had some extra money and leisure time .
He patronized sporting events and theaters , savings banks and insurance companies .
He read Day 's New York Sun or Bennett 's Herald - the " penny press " supported by advertising , filled with police reports , crime stories , etiquette advice for the rising bourgeoisie ... .
This was the advance guard of a growing class of white - collar workers and professionals in America who would be wooed enough and paid enough to consider themselves members of the bourgeois class , and to give support to that class in times of crisis .
The opening of the West was being helped by mechanization of the farm .
Iron plows cut plowing time in half ; by the 1850s John Deere Company was turning out ten thousand plows a year .
Cyrus McCormick was making a thousand mechanical reapers a year in his factory in Chicago .
A man with a sickle could cut half an acre of wheat in a day ; with a reaper he could cut 10 acres .
Turnpikes , canals , and railroads were bringing more people west , more products east , and it became important to keep that new West , tumultuous and unpredictable , under control .
When colleges were established out West , eastern businessmen , as Cochran and Miller say , were " determined from the start to control western education . "
Edward Everett , the Massachusetts politician and orator , spoke in 1833 on behalf of giving financial aid to western colleges :
Let no Boston capitalist , then , let no man , who has a large stake in New England .. . think that he is called upon to exercise his liberality at a distance , toward those in whom he has no concern .
...
They ask you to give security to your own property , by diffusing the means of light and truth throughout the region , where so much of the power to preserve or to shake it resides .
. . .
The capitalists of the East were conscious of the need for this " security to your own property . "
As technology developed , more capital was needed , more risks had to be taken , and a big investment needed stability .
In an economic system not rationally planned for human need , but developing fitfully , chaotically out of the profit motive , there seemed to be no way to avoid recurrent booms and slumps .
There was a slump in 1837 , another in 1853 .
One way to achieve stability was to decrease competition , organize the businesses , move toward monopoly .
In the mid-1850s , price agreements and mergers became frequent : the New York Central Railroad was a merger of many railroads .
The American Brass Association was formed " to meet ruinous competition , " it said .
The Hampton County Cotton Spinners Association was organized to control prices , and so was the American Iron Association .
Another way to minimize risks was to make sure the government played its traditional role , going back to Alexander Hamilton and the first Congress , of helping the business interests .
State legislatures gave charters to corporations giving them legal rights to conduct business , raise money - at first special charters , then general charters , so that any business meeting certain requirements could incorporate .
Between 1790 and 1860 , 2,300 corporations were chartered .
Railroad men traveled to Washington and to state capitals armed with money , shares of stock , free railroad passes .
Between 1850 and 1857 they got 25 million acres of public land , free of charge , and millions of dollars in bonds - loans - from the state legislatures .
In Wisconsin in 1856 , the LaCrosse and Milwaukee Railroad got a million acres free by distributing about $ 900,000 in stocks and bonds to fifty - nine assemblymen , thirteen senators , the , governor .
Two years later the railroad was bankrupt and the bonds were worthless .
In the East , mill owners had become powerful , and organized .
By 1850 , fifteen Boston families called the " Associates " controlled 20 percent of the cotton spindleage in the United States , 39 percent of insurance capital in Massachusetts , 40 percent of banking resources in Boston .
In the schoolbooks , those years are filled with the controversy over slavery , but on the eve of the Civil War it was money and profit , not the movement against slavery , that was uppermost in the priorities of the men who ran the country .
As Cochran and Miller put it :
Webster was the hero of the North - not Emerson , Parker , Garrison , or Phillips ; Webster the tariff man , the land speculator , the corporation lawyer , politician for the Boston Associates , inheritor of Hamilton 's coronet .
" The great object of government " said he " is the protection of property at home , and respect and renown abroad . "
For these he preached union ; for these he surrendered the fugitive slave .
They describe the Boston rich :
Living sumptuously on Beacon Hill , admired by their neighbors for their philanthropy and their patronage of art and culture , these men traded in State Street while overseers ran their factories , managers directed their railroads , agents sold their water power and real estate .
They were absentee landlords in the most complete sense .
Uncontaminated by the diseases of the factory town , they were also protected from hearing the complaints of their workers or suffering mental depression from dismal and squalid surroundings .
In the metropolis , art , literature , education , science , flowered in the Golden Day ; in the industrial towns children went to work with their fathers and mothers , schools and doctors were only promises , a bed of one 's own was a rare luxury .
Ralph Waldo Emerson described Boston in those years : " There is a certain poor - smell in all the streets , in Beacon Street and Mount Vernon , as well as in the lawyers ' offices , and the wharves , and the same meanness and sterility , and leave - all - hope - behind , as one finds in a boot manufacturer 's premises . "
The preacher Theodore Parker told his congregation : " Money is this day the strongest power of the nation . "
The attempts at political stability , at economic control , did not quite work .
The new industrialism , the crowded cities , the long hours in the factories , the sudden economic crises leading to high prices and lost jobs , the lack of food and water , the freezing winters , the hot tenements in the summer , the epidemics of disease , the deaths of children - these led to sporadic reactions from the poor .
Sometimes there were spontaneous , unorganized uprisings against the rich .
Sometimes the anger was deflected into racial hatred for blacks , religious warfare against Catholics , nativist fury against immigrants .
Sometimes it was organized into demonstrations and strikes .
" Jacksonian Democracy " had tried to create a consensus of support for the system to make it secure .
Blacks , Indians , women , and foreigners were clearly outside the consensus .
But also , white working people , in large numbers , declared themselves outside .
The full extent of the working - class consciousness of those years - as of any years - is lost in history , but fragments remain and make us wonder how much of this always existed underneath the very practical silence of working people .
In 1827 an " Address ... before the Mechanics and Working Classes ... of Philadelphia " was recorded , written by an " Unlettered Mechanic , " probably a young shoemaker , who said :
We find ourselves oppressed on every hand - we labor hard in producing all the comforts of life for the enjoyment of others , while we ourselves obtain but a scanty portion , and even that in the present state of society depends on the will of employers .
Frances Wright of Scotland , an early feminist and Utopian socialist , was invited by Philadelphia workingmen to speak on the Fourth of July 1829 to one of the first city - wide associations of labor unions in the United States .
She asked if the Revolution had been fought " to crush down the sons and daughters of your country 's industry under ... neglect , poverty , vice , starvation , and disease .... "
She wondered if the new technology was not lowering the value of human labor , making people appendages to machines , crippling the minds and bodies of child laborers .
Later that year , George Henry Evans , a printer , editor of the Workingman 's Advocate , wrote " The Working Men 's Declaration of Independence . "
Among its list of " facts " submitted to " candid and impartial " fellow citizens :
l . The laws for levying taxes are . . . operating most oppressively on one class of society ....
3 . The laws for private incorporation are all partial .
.. favoring one class of society to the expense of the other .
. ..
6 . The laws .. . have deprived nine tenths of the members of the body politics , who are not wealthy , of the equal means to enjoy " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . " ...
The lien law in favor of the landlords against tenants ... is one illustration among innumerable others .
Evans believed that " all on arriving at adult age are entitled to equal property . "
A city - wide " Trades ' Union " in Boston in 1834 , including mechanics from Charlestown and women shoe binders from Lynn , referred to the Declaration of Independence :
We hold . .. that laws which have a tendency to raise any peculiar class above their fellow citizens , by granting special privileges , are contrary to and in defiance of those primary principles ....
Our public system of Education , which so liberally endows those seminaries of learning , which ... are only accessible to the wealthy , while our common schools ... are so illy provided for ...
Thus even in childhood the poor are apt to think themselves inferior .. . .
In his book Most Uncommon Jacksonians , Edward Pessen says : " The leaders of the Jacksonian labor movement were radicals .. . .
How else describe men who believed American society to be torn with social conflict , disfigured by the misery of the masses , and dominated by a greedy elite whose power over every aspect of American life was based on private property ? "
Episodes of insurrection of that time have gone unrecorded in traditional histories .
Such was the riot in Baltimore in the summer of 1835 , when the Bank of Maryland collapsed and its depositors lost their savings .
Convinced that a great fraud had taken place , a crowd gathered and began breaking the windows of officials associated with the bank .
When the rioters destroyed a house , the militia attacked , killing some twenty people , wounding a hundred .
The next evening , other houses were attacked .
The events were reported in Niles ' Weekly Register , an important newspaper of that time :
Last night ( Sunday ) at dark , the attack was renewed upon Reverdy Johnson 's house .
There was now no opposition .
It was supposed that several thousand people were spectators of the scene .
The house was soon entered , and its furniture , a very extensive law library , and all its contents , were cast forth , a bonfire made of them in front of the house .
The whole interior of the house was torn out and cast upon the burning pile .
The marble portico in front , and a great portion of the front wall were torn down by about 11 o'clock .. ..
They proceeded to that of the mayor of the city , Jesse Hunt , esq. broke it open , took out the furniture , and burnt it before the door .
. ..
During those years , trade unions were forming .
( Philip Foner 's History of the Labor Movement in the U.S. tells the story in rich detail . )
The courts called them conspiracies to restrain trade and therefore illegal , as when in New York twenty - five members of the Union Society of Journeymen Tailors were found guilty of " conspiracy to injure trade , riot , assault , battery . "
The judge , levying fines , said : " In this favored land of law and liberty , the road to advancement is open to all ....
Every American knows that or ought to know that he has no better friend than the laws and that he needs no artificial combination for his protection .
They are of foreign origin and I am led to believe mainly upheld by foreigners . "
A handbill was then circulated throughout the city :
The Rich Against the Poor !
Judge Edwards , the tool of the aristocracy , against the people !
Mechanics and working men !
A deadly blow has been struck at your liberty !...
They have established the precedent that workingmen have no right to regulate the price of labor , or , in other words , the rich are the only judges of the wants of the poor man .
At City Hall Park , 27,000 people gathered to denounce the court decision , and elected a Committee of Correspondence which organized , three months later , a convention of Mechanics , Farmers , and Working Men , elected by farmers and working people in various towns in New York State .
The convention met in Utica , drew up a Declaration of Independence from existing political parties , and established an Equal Rights party .
Although they ran their own candidates for office , there was no great confidence in the ballot as a way of achieving change .
One of the great orators of the movement , Seth Luther , told a Fourth of July rally : " We will try the ballot box first .
If that will not effect our righteous purpose , the next and last resort is the cartridge box . "
And one sympathetic local newspaper , the Albany Microscope , warned :
Remember the regretted fate of the working - men - they were soon destroyed by hitching teams and rolling with parties .
They admitted into their ranks , broken down lawyers and politicians ....
They became perverted , and were unconsciously drawn into a vortex , from which they never escaped .
The crisis of 1837 led to rallies and meetings in many cities .
The banks had suspended specie payments - refusing to pay hard money for the bank notes they had issued .
Prices rose , and working people , already hard - pressed to buy food , found that flour that had sold at $ 5.62 a barrel was now $ 12 a barrel .
Pork went up .
Coal went up .
In Philadelphia , twenty thousand people assembled , and someone wrote to President Van Buren describing it :
This afternoon , the largest public meeting I ever saw assembled in Independence Square .
It was called by placards posted through the city yesterday and last night .
It was projected and carried on entirely by the working classes ; without consultation or cooperation with any of those who usually take the lead in such matters .
The officers and speakers were of those classes ....
It was directed against the banks .
In New York , members of the Equal Rights party ( often called the Locofocos ) announced a meeting : " Bread , Meat , Rent , and Fuel !
Their prices must come down !
The people will meet in the Park , rain or shine , at 4 o'clock , P.M. on Monday afternoon ....
All friends of humanity determined to resist monopolists and extortioners are invited to attend . "
The Commercial Register , a New York newspaper , reported on the meeting and what followed :
At 4 o'clock , a concourse of several thousands had convened in front of the City Hall .. ..
One of these orators ... is reported to have expressly directed the popular vengeance against Mr. EH
Hart , who is one of our most extensive flour dealers on commission .
" Fellow citizens ! " he exclaimed , " Mr. Hart has now 53,000 barrels of flour in his store ; let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel , and if he does not take it ... "
A large body of the meeting moved off in the direction of Mr. Hart 's store . . . the middle door had been forced , and some twenty or thirty barrels of flour or more , rolled into the streets , and the heads staved in .
At this point of time , Mr. Hart himself arrived on the ground , with a posse of officers from the police .
The officers were assailed by a portion of the mob in Dey Street , their staves wrested from them , and shivered to pieces .
.. .
Barrels of flour , by dozens , fifties and hundreds were tumbled into the street from the doors , and thrown in rapid succession from the windows ... .
About one thousand bushels of wheat , and four or five hundred barrels of flour , were thus wantonly and foolishly as well as wickedly destroyed .
The most active of the destructionists were foreigners - indeed the greater part of the assemblage was of exotic origin , but there were probably five hundred or a thousand others , standing by and abetting their incendiary labors .
Amidst the falling and bursting of the barrels and sacks of wheat , numbers of women were engaged , like the crones who strip the dead in battle , filling the boxes and baskets with which they were provided , and their aprons , with flour , and making off with it ....
Night had now closed upon the scene , but the work of destruction did not cease until strong bodies of police arrived , followed , soon afterward , by detachments of troops .. . .
This was the Flour Riot of 1837 .
During the crisis of that year , 50,000 persons ( one - third of the working class ) were without work in New York City alone , and 200,000 ( of a population of 500,000 ) were living , as one observer put it , " in utter and hopeless distress . "
There is no complete record of the meetings , riots , actions , organized and disorganized , violent and nonviolent , which took place in the mid-nineteenth century , as the country grew , as the cities became crowded , with working conditions bad , living conditions intolerable , with the economy in the hands of bankers , speculators , landlords , merchants .
In 1835 , fifty different trades organized unions in Philadelphia , and there was a successful general strike of laborers , factory workers , hook - binders , jewelers , coal heavers , butchers , cabinet workers - for the ten - hour day .
Soon there were ten - hour laws in Pennsylvania and other states , but they provided that employers could have employees sign contracts for longer hours .
The law at this time was developing a strong defense of contracts ; it was pretended that work contracts were voluntary agreements between equals .
Weavers in Philadelphia in the early 1840s - mostly Irish immigrants working at home for employers - struck for higher wages , attacked the homes of those refusing to strike , and destroyed their work .
A sheriffs posse tried to arrest some strikers , but it was broken up by four hundred weavers armed with muskets and sticks .
Soon , however , antagonism developed between these Irish Catholic weavers and native - born Protestant skilled workers over issues of religion .
In May 1844 there were Protestant - Catholic riots in Kensington , a suburb of Philadelphia ; nativist ( anti-immigrant ) rioters destroyed the weavers ' neighborhoods and attacked a Catholic church .
Middle - class politicians soon led each group into a different political party ( the nativists into the American Republican party , the Irish into the Democratic party ) , party politics and religion now substituting for class conflict .
The result of all this , says David Montgomery , historian of the Kensington Riots , was the fragmentation of the Philadelphia working class .
It " thereby created for historians the illusion of a society lacking in class conflict , " while in reality the class conflicts of nineteenth - century America " were as fierce as any known to the industrial world . "
The immigrants from Ireland , fleeing starvation there when the potato crop failed , were coming to America now , packed into old sailing ships .
The stories of these ships differ only in detail from the accounts of the ships that earlier brought black slaves and later German , Italian , Russian immigrants .
This is a contemporary account of one ship arriving from Ireland , detained at Grosse Isle on the Canadian border :
On the 18th of May , 1847 , the " Urania " , from Cork , with several hundred immigrants on board , a large proportion of them sick and dying of the ship - fever , was put into quarantine at Grosse Isle .
This was the first of the plague - smitten ships from Ireland which that year sailed up the St. Lawrence .
But before the first week of June as many as eighty - four ships of various tonnage were driven in by an easterly wind ; and of that enormous number of vessels there was not one free from the taint of malignant typhus , the offspring of famine and of the foul ship - hold .... a tolerably quick passage occupied from six to eight weeks .
. ..
Who can imagine the horrors of even the shortest passage in an emigrant ship crowded beyond its utmost capacity of stowage with unhappy beings of all ages , with fever raging in their midst ... the crew sullen or brutal from very desperation , or paralyzed with terror of the plague - the miserable passengers unable to help themselves , or afford the least relief to each other ; one - fourth , or one - third , or one - half of the entire number in different stages of the disease ; many dying , some dead ; the fatal poison intensified by the indescribable foulness of the air breathed and rebreathed by the gasping sufferers - the wails of children , the ravings of the delirious , the cries and groans of those in mortal agony ! . .. there was no accommodation of any kind on the island . . . sheds were rapidly filled with the miserable people ... .
Hundreds were literally flung on the beach , left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land how they could ... .
Many of these ... gasped out their last breath on that fatal shore , not able to drag themselves from the slime in which they lay .
...
It was not until the 1st of November that the quarantine of Grosse Isle was closed .
Upon that barren isle as many as 10,000 of the Irish race were consigned to the grave - pit . . ..
How could these new Irish immigrants , themselves poor and despised , become sympathizers with the black slave , who was becoming more and more the center of attention , the subject of agitation in the country ?
Indeed , most working - class activists at this time ignored the plight of blacks .
Ely Moore , a New York trade union leader elected to Congress , argued in the House of Representatives against receiving abolitionist petitions .
Racist hostility became an easy substitute for class frustration .
On the other hand , a white shoemaker wrote in 1848 in the Awl , the newspaper of Lynn shoe factory workers :
... we are nothing but a standing army that keeps three million of our brethren in bondage .. . .
Living under the shade of Bunker Hill monument , demanding in the name of humanity , our right , and withholding those rights from others because their skin is black !
Is it any wonder that God in his righteous anger has punished us by forcing us to drink the bitter cup of degradation .
The anger of the city poor often expressed itself in futile violence over nationality or religion .
In New York in 1849 a mob , largely Irish ; stormed the fashionable Astor Place Opera House , where an English actor , William Charles Macready , was playing Macbeth , in competition with an American actor , Edwin Forrest , who was acting the same role in another production .
The crowd , shouting " Burn the damn den of aristocracy , " charged , throwing bricks .
The militia were called out , and in the violence that followed about two hundred people were killed or wounded .
Another economic crisis came in 1857 .
The boom in railroads and manufacturing , the surge of immigration , the increased speculation in stocks and bonds , the stealing , corruption , manipulation , led to wild expansion and then crash .
By October of that year , 200,000 were unemployed , and thousands of recent immigrants crowded into the eastern ports , hoping to work their way back to Europe .
The New York Times reported : " Every ship for Liverpool now has all the passengers she can carry , and multitudes are applying to work their passage if they have no money to pay for it . "
In Newark , New Jersey , a rally of several thousand demanded the city give work to the unemployed .
And in New York , fifteen thousand people met at Tompkins Square in downtown Manhattan .
From there they marched to Wall Street and paraded around the Stock Exchange shouting : " We want work ! "
That summer , riots occurred in the slum areas of New York .
A mob of five hundred attacked the police one day with pistols and bricks .
There were parades of the unemployed , demanding bread and work , looting shops .
In November , a crowd occupied City Hall , and the U.S. marines were brought in to drive them out .
Of the country 's work force of 6 million in 1850 , half a million were women : 330,000 worked as domestics ; 55,000 were teachers .
Of the 181,000 women in factories , half worked in textile mills .
They organized .
Women struck by themselves for the first time in 1825 .
They were the United Tailoresses of New York , demanding higher wages .
In 1828 , the first strike of mill women on their own took place in Dover , New Hampshire , when several hundred women paraded with banners and flags .
They shot off gunpowder , in protest against new factory rules , which charged fines for coming late , forbade talking on the job , and required church attendance .
They were forced to return to the mill , their demands unmet , and their leaders were fired and blacklisted .
In Exeter , New Hampshire , women mill workers went on strike ( " turned out , " in the language of that day ) because the overseer was setting the clocks back to get more time from them .
Their strike succeeded in exacting a promise from the company that the overseers would set their watches right .
The " Lowell system , " in which young girls would go to work in the mills and live in dormitories supervised by matrons , at first seemed beneficent , sociable , a welcome escape from household drudgery or domestic service .
Lowell , Massachusetts , was the first town created for the textile mill industry ; it was named after the wealthy and influential Lowell family .
But the dormitories became prisonlike , controlled by rules and regulations .
The supper ( served after the women had risen at four in the morning and worked until seven thirty in the evening ) often consisted merely of bread and gravy .
So the Lowell girls organized .
They started their own newspapers .
They protested against the weaving rooms , which were poorly lit , badly ventilated , impossibly hot in the summer , damp and cold in the winter .
In 1834 , a cut in wages led the Lowell women to strike , proclaiming : " Union is power .
Our present object is to have union and exertion , and we remain in possession of our own unquestionable rights .
. . . "
But the threat of hiring others to replace them brought them back to work at reduced wages ( the leaders were fired ) .
The young women , determined to do better next time , organized a Factory Girls ' Association , and 1,500 went on strike in 1836 against a raise in boardinghouse charges .
Harriet Hanson was an eleven - year - old girl working in the mill .
She later recalled :
I worked in a lower room where I had heard the proposed strike fully , if not vehemently , discussed .
I had been an ardent listener to what was said against this attempt at " oppression " on the part of the corporation , and naturally I took sides with the strikers .
When the day came on which the girls were to turn out , those in the upper rooms started first , and so many of them left that our mill was at once shut down .
Then , when the girls in my room stood irresolute , uncertain what to do ... I , who began to think they would not go out , after all their talk , became impatient , and started on ahead , saying , with childish bravado , " I do n't care what you do , I am going to turn out , whether anyone else does or not , " and I marched out , and was followed by the others .
As I looked back at the long line that followed me , I was more proud than I have ever been since .
. . .
The strikers marched through the streets of Lowell , singing .
They held out a month , but then their money ran out , they were evicted from the boardinghouses , and many of them went back to work .
The leaders were fired , including Harriet Hanson 's widowed mother , a matron in the boardinghouse , who was blamed for her child 's going out on strike .
Resistance continued .
One mill in Lowell , Herbert Gutman reports , discharged twenty - eight women for such reasons as " misconduct , " " disobedience , " " impudence , " " levity , " and " mutiny . "
Meanwhile , the girls tried to hold on to thoughts about fresh air , the country , a less harried way of life .
One of them recalled : " I never cared much for machinery .
I could not see into their complications or feel interested in them .
...
In sweet June weather I would lean far out of the window , and try not to hear the unceasing clash of sound inside . "
In New Hampshire , five hundred men and women petitioned the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company not to cut down an elm tree to make space for another mill .
They said it was " a beautiful and goodly tree , " representing a time " when the yell of the red man and the scream of the eagle were alone heard on the hanks of the Merrimack , instead of two giant edifices filled with the buzz of busy and well - remunerated industry . "
In 1835 , twenty mills went on strike to reduce the workday from thirteen and a half hours to eleven hours , to get cash wages instead of company scrip , and to end fines for lateness .
Fifteen hundred children and parents went out on strike , and it lasted six weeks .
Strikebreakers were brought in , and some workers went back to work , but the strikers did win a twelve - hour day and nine hours on Saturday .
That year and the next , there were 140 strikes in the eastern part of the United States .
The crisis that followed the 1837 panic stimulated the formation in 1845 of the Female Labor Reform Association in Lowell , which sent thousands of petitions to the Massachusetts legislature asking for a ten - hour day .
Finally , the legislature decided to hold public hearings , the first investigation of labor conditions by any governmental body in the country .
Eliza Hemingway told the committee of the air thick with smoke from oil lamps burning before sunup and after sundown .
Judith Payne told of her sickness due to the work in the mills .
But after the committee visited the mills - for which the company prepared by a cleanup job - it reported : " Your committee returned fully satisfied that the order , decorum , and general appearance of things in and around the mills could not be improved by any suggestion of theirs or by any act of the legislature . "
The report was denounced by the Female Labor Reform Association , and they worked successfully for the committee chairman 's defeat at the next election , though they could not vote .
But not much was done to change conditions in the mills .
In the late 1840s , the New England farm women who worked in the mills began to leave them , as more and more Irish immigrants took their place .
Company towns now grew up around mills in Rhode Island , Connecticut , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , using immigrant workers who signed contracts pledging everyone in the family to work for a year .
They lived in slum tenements owned by the company , were paid in scrip , which they could use only at company stores , and were evicted if their work was unsatisfactory .
In Paterson , New Jersey , the first of a series of mill strikes was started by children .
When the company suddenly put off their dinner hour from noon to 1:00 P.M. , the children marched off the job , their parents cheering them on .
They were joined by other working people in the town - carpenters , masons , machinists - who turned the strike into a ten - hour - day struggle .
After a week , however , with the threat of bringing in militia , the children returned to work , and their leaders were fired .
Soon after , trying to prevent more trouble , the company restored the noon dinner hour .
It was the shoemakers of Lynn , Massachusetts , a factory town northeast of Boston , who started the largest strike to take place in the United States before the Civil War .
Lynn had pioneered in the use of sewing machines in factories , replacing shoemaker artisans .
The factory workers in Lynn , who began to organize in the 1830s , later started a militant newspaper , the Awl .
In 1844 , four years before Marx and Engels 's Communist Manifesto appeared , the Awl wrote :
The division of society into the producing and the non-producing classes , and the fact of the unequal distribution of value between the two , introduces us at once to another distinction - that of capital and labor ... . labor now becomes a commodity ....
Antagonism and opposition of interest is introduced in the community ; capital and labor stand opposed .
The economic crisis of 1857 brought the shoe business to a halt , and the workers of Lynn lost their jobs .
There was already anger at machine - stitching replacing shoemakers .
Prices were up , wages were repeatedly cut , and by the fall of 1859 men were earning $ 3 a week and women were earning $ 1 a week , working sixteen hours a day .
In early 1860 , a mass meeting of the newly formed Mechanics Association demanded higher wages .
When the manufacturers refused to meet with their committees , the workers called a strike for Washington 's Birthday .
That morning three thousand shoemakers met in the Lyceum Hall in Lynn and set up committees of 100 to post the names of scabs , to guard against violence , to make sure shoes would not be sent out to be finished elsewhere .
In a few days , shoeworkers throughout New England joined the strike - in Natick , Newburyport , Haverhill , Marblehead , and other Massachusetts towns , as well as towns in New Hampshire and Maine .
In a week , strikes had begun in all the shoe towns of New England , with Mechanics Associations in twenty - five towns and twenty thousand shoe - workers on strike .
Newspapers called it " The Revolution at the North , " " The Rebellion Among the Workmen of New England , " " Beginning of the Conflict Between Capital and Labor . "
One thousand women and five thousand men marched through the streets of Lynn in a blizzard , carrying banners and American flags .
Women shoebinders and stitchers joined the strike and held their own mass meeting .
A New York Herald reporter wrote of them : " They assail the bosses in a style which reminds one of the amiable females who participated in the first French Revolution . "
A huge Ladies ' Procession was organized , the women marching through streets high with snowdrifts , carrying signs : " American Ladies Will Not Be Slaves . . .
Weak in Physical Strength but Strong in Moral Courage , We Dare Battle for the Right , Shoulder to Shoulder with our Fathers , Husbands , and Brothers . "
Ten days after that , a procession often thousand striking workers , including delegations from Salem , Marblehead , and other towns , men and women , marched through Lynn , in what was the greatest demonstration of labor to take place in New England up to that time .
Police from Boston and militia were sent in to make sure strikers did not interfere with shipments of shoes to be finished out of the state .
The strike processions went on , while city grocers and provisions dealers provided food for the strikers .
The strike continued through March with morale high , but by April it was losing force .
The manufacturers offered higher wages to bring the strikers back into the factories , but without recognizing the unions , so that workers still had to face the employer as individuals .
Most of the shoeworkers were native - born Americans , Alan Dawley says in his study of the Lynn strike ( Class and Community ) .
They did not accept the social and political order that kept them in poverty , however much it was praised in American schools , churches , newspapers .
In Lynn , he says , " articulate , activist Irish shoe and leather workers joined Yankees in flatly rejecting the myth of success .
Irish and Yankee workers jointly ... looked for labor candidates when they went to the polls , and resisted strikebreaking by local police . "
Trying to understand why this fierce class spirit did not lead to independent revolutionary political action , Dawley concludes that the main reason is that electoral politics drained the energies of the resisters into the channels of the system .
Dawley disputes some historians who have said the high rate of mobility of workers prevented them from organizing in revolutionary ways .
He says that while there was a high turnover in Lynn too , this " masked the existence of a virtually permanent minority who played the key role in organizing discontent . "
He also suggests that mobility helps people see that others are in similar conditions .
He thinks the struggle of European workers for political democracy , even while they sought economic equality , made them class - conscious .
American workers , however , had already gained political democracy by the 1830s , and so their economic battles could be taken over by political parties that blurred class lines .
Even this might not have stopped labor militancy and the rise of class consciousness , Dawley says , if not for the fact that " an entire generation was sidetracked in the 1860 's because of the Civil War . "
Northern wage earners who rallied to the Union cause became allied with their employers .
National issues took over from class issues : " At a time when scores of industrial communities like Lynn were seething with resistance to industrialism , national politics were preoccupied with the issues of war and reconstruction . "
And on these issues the political parties took positions , offered choices , obscured the fact that the political system itself and the wealthy classes it represented were responsible for the problems they now offered to solve .
Class - consciousness was overwhelmed during the Civil War , both North and South , by military and political unity in the crisis of war .
That unity was weaned by rhetoric and enforced by arms .
It was a war proclaimed as a war for liberty , but working people would be attacked by soldiers if they dared to strike , Indians would be massacred in Colorado by the U.S. army , and those daring to criticize Lincoln 's policies would be put in jail without trial - perhaps thirty thousand political prisoners .
Still , there were signs in both sections of dissent from that unity - anger of poor against rich , rebellion against the dominant political and economic forces .
In the North , the war brought high prices for food and the necessities of life .
Prices of milk , eggs , cheese were up 60 to 100 percent for families that had not been able to pay the old prices .
One historian ( Emerson Fite , Social and Industrial Conditions in the North During the Civil War ) described the war situation : " Employers were wont to appropriate to themselves all or nearly all of the profits accruing from the higher prices , without being willing to grant to the employees a fair share of these profits through the medium of higher wages . "
There were strikes all over the country during the war .
The Springfield Republican in 1863 said that " the workmen of almost every branch of trade have had their strikes within the last few months , " and the San Francisco Evening Bulletin said " striking for higher wages is now the rage among the working people of San Francisco . "
Unions were being formed as a result of these strikes .
Philadelphia shoemakers in 1863 announced that high prices made organization imperative .
The headline in Fincher 's Trades ' Review of November 21 , 1863 , " THE REVOLUTION IN NEW YORK , " was an exaggeration , but its list of labor activities was impressive evidence of the hidden resentments of the poor during the war :
The upheaval of the laboring masses in New York has startled the capitalists of that city and vicinity .. . .
The machinists are making a hold stand ... .
We publish their appeal in another column .
The City Railroad employees struck for higher wages , and made the whole population , for a few days , " ride on Shank 's mare . " ...
The house painters of Brooklyn have taken steps to counteract the attempt of the bosses to reduce their wages .
The house carpenters , we are informed , are pretty well " out of the woods " and their demands are generally complied with .
The safe - makers have obtained an increase of wages , and are now at work .
The lithographic printers are making efforts to secure better pay for their labor .
The workmen on the iron clads are yet holding out against the contractors .
...
The window shade painters have obtained an advance of 25 percent .
The horse shoers are fortifying themselves against the evils of money and trade fluctuations .
The sash and blind - makers are organized and ask their employers for 25 percent additional .
The sugar packers are remodelling their list of prices .
The glass cutters demand 15 percent to present wages .
Imperfect as we confess our list to be , there is enough to convince the reader that the social revolution now working its way through the land must succeed , if workingmen are only true to each other .
The stage drivers , to the number of 800 , are on a strike .. . .
The workingmen of Boston are not behind .... in addition to the strike at the Charlestown Navy Yard .
.. .
The riggers are on a strike .
.. .
At this writing it is rumored , says the Boston Post , that a general strike is contemplated among the workmen in the iron establishments at South Boston , and other parts of the city .
The war brought many women into shops and factories , often over the objections of men who saw them driving wage scales down .
In New York City , girls sewed umbrellas from six in the morning to midnight , earning $ 3 a week , from which employers deducted the cost of needles and thread .
Girls who made cotton shirts received twenty - four cents for a twelve - hour day .
In late 1863 , New York working women held a mass meeting to find a solution to their problems .
A Working Women 's Protective Union was formed , and there was a strike of women umbrella workers in New York and Brooklyn .
In Providence , Rhode Island , a Ladies Cigar Makers Union was organized .
All together , by 1864 , about 200,000 workers , men and women , were in trade unions , forming national unions in some of the trades , putting out labor newspapers .
Union troops were used to break strikes .
Federal soldiers were sent to Cold Springs , New York , to end a strike at a gun works where workers wanted a wage increase .
Striking machinists and tailors in St. Louis were forced back to work by the army .
In Tennessee , a Union general arrested and sent out of the state two hundred striking mechanics .
When engineers on the Reading Railroad struck , troops broke that strike , as they did with miners in Tioga County , Pennsylvania .
White workers of the North were not enthusiastic about a war which seemed to be fought for the black slave , or for the capitalist , for anyone but them .
They worked in semislave conditions themselves .
They thought the war was profiting the new class of millionaires .
They saw defective guns sold to the army by contractors , sand sold as sugar , rye sold as coffee , shop sweepings made into clothing and blankets , paper - soled shoes produced for soldiers at the front , navy ships made of rotting timbers , soldiers ' uniforms that fell apart in the rain .
The Irish working people of New York , recent immigrants , poor , looked upon with contempt by native Americans , could hardly find sympathy for the black population of the city who competed with them for jobs as longshoremen , barbers , waiters , domestic servants .
Blacks , pushed out of these jobs , often were used to break strikes .
Then came the war , the draft , the chance of death .
And the Conscription Act of 1863 provided that the rich could avoid military service : they could pay $ 300 or buy a substitute .
In the summer of 1863 , a " Song of the Conscripts " was circulated by the thousands in New York and other cities .
One stanza :
We 're coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more
We leave our homes and firesides with bleeding hearts and sore
Since poverty has been our crime , we bow to thy decree ;
We are the poor and have no wealth to purchase liberty .
When recruiting for the army began in July 1863 , a mob in New York wrecked the main recruiting station .
Then , for three days , crowds of white workers marched through the city , destroying buildings , factories , streetcar lines , homes .
The draft riots were complex - antiblack , antirich , anti- Republican .
From an assault on draft headquarters , the rioters went on to attacks on wealthy homes , then to the murder of blacks .
They marched through the streets , forcing factories to close , recruiting more members of the mob .
They set the city 's colored orphan asylum on fire .
They shot , burned , and hanged blacks they found in the streets .
Many people were thrown into the rivers to drown .
On the fourth day , Union troops returning from the Battle of Gettysburg came into the city and stopped the rioting .
Perhaps four hundred people were killed .
No exact figures have ever been given , but the number of lives lost was greater than in any other incident of domestic violence in American history .
Joel Tyler Headley ( The Great Riots of New York ) gave a graphic day - by - day description of what happened :
Second Day .... the fire - bells continually ringing increased the terror that every hour became more widespread .
Especially was this true of the negro population .
...
At one time there lay at the corner of Twenty - seventh Street and Seventh Avenue the dead body of a negro , stripped nearly naked , and around it a collection of Irishmen , absolutely dancing or shouting like wild Indians ....
A negro barber 's shop was next attacked , and the torch applied to it .
A negro lodging house in the same street next received the visit of these furies , and was soon a mass of ruins .
Old men , seventy years of age , and young children , too young to comprehend what it all meant , were cruelly beaten and killed ....
There were antidraft riots - not so prolonged or bloody - in other northern cities : Newark , Troy , Boston , Toledo , Evansville .
In Boston the dead were Irish workers attacking an armory , who were fired on by soldiers .
In the South , beneath the apparent unity of the white Confederacy , there was also conflict .
Most whites - two - thirds of them - did not own slaves .
A few thousand families made up the plantation elite .
The Federal Census of 1850 showed that a thousand southern families at the top of the economy received about $ 50 million a year income , while all the other families , about 660,000 , received about $ 60 million a year .
Millions of southern whites were poor farmers , living in shacks or abandoned outhouses , cultivating land so bad the plantation owners had abandoned it .
Just before the Civil War , in Jackson , Mississippi , slaves working in a cotton factory received twenty cents a day for board , and white workers at the same factory received thirty cents .
A newspaper in North Carolina in August 1855 spoke of " hundreds of thousands of working class families existing upon half - starvation from year to year . "
Behind the rebel battle yells and the legendary spirit of the Confederate army , there was much reluctance to fight .
A sympathetic historian of the South , E. Merton Coulter , asked : " Why did the Confederacy fail ?
The forces leading to defeat were many but they may be summed up in this one fact :
The people did not will hard enough and long enough to win . "
Not money or soldiers , but will power and morale were decisive .
The conscription law of the Confederacy too provided that the rich could avoid service .
Did Confederate soldiers begin to suspect they were fighting for the privileges of an elite they could never belong to ?
In April 1863 , there was a bread riot in Richmond .
That summer , draft riots occurred in various southern cities .
In September , a bread riot in Mobile , Alabama .
Georgia Lee Tatum , in her study Disloyalty in the Confederacy , writes : " Before the end of the war , there was much disaffection in every state , and many of the disloyal had formed into bands - in some states into well - organized , active societies . "
The Civil War was one of the first instances in the world of modern warfare : deadly artillery shells , Gatling guns , bayonet charges - combining the indiscriminate killing of mechanized war with hand - to - hand combat .
The nightmare scenes could not adequately be described except in a novel like Stephen Crane 's The Red Badge of Courage .
In one charge before Petersburg , Virginia , a regiment of 850 Maine soldiers lost 632 men in half an hour .
It was a vast butchery , 623,000 dead on both sides , and 471,000 wounded , over a million dead and wounded in a country whose population was 30 million .
No wonder that desertions grew among southern soldiers as the war went on .
As for the Union army , by the end of the war , 200,000 had deserted .
Still , 600,000 had volunteered for the Confederacy in 1861 , and many in the Union army were volunteers .
The psychology of patriotism , the lure of adventure , the aura of moral crusade created by political leaders , worked effectively to dim class resentments against the rich and powerful , and turn much of the anger against " the enemy . "
As Edmund Wilson put it in Patriotic Gore ( written after World War II ) :
We have seen , in our most recent wars , how a divided and arguing public opinion may be converted overnight into a national near - unanimity , an obedient flood of energy which will carry the young to destruction and overpower any effort to stem it .
The unanimity of men at war is like that of a school of fish , which will swerve , simultaneously and apparently without leadership , when the shadow of an enemy appears , or like a sky darkening flight of grass - hoppers , which , also all compelled by one impulse , will descend to consume the crops .
Under the deafening noise of the war , Congress was passing and Lincoln was signing into law a whole series of acts to give business interests what they wanted , and what the agrarian South had blocked before secession .
The Republican platform of 1860 had been a clear appeal to businessmen .
Now Congress in 1861 passed the Morrill Tariff .
This made foreign goods more expensive , allowed American manufacturers to raise their prices , and forced American consumers to pay more .
The following year a Homestead Act was passed .
It gave 160 acres of western land , unoccupied and publicly owned , to anyone who would cultivate it for five years .
Anyone willing to pay $ 1.25 an acre could buy a homestead .
Few ordinary people had the $ 200 necessary to do this ; speculators moved in and bought up much of the land .
Homestead land added up to 50 million acres .
But during the Civil War , over 100 million acres were given by Congress and the President to various railroads , free of charge .
Congress also set up a national bank , putting the government into partnership with the banking interests , guaranteeing their profits .
With strikes spreading , employers pressed Congress for help .
The Contract Labor Law of 1864 made it possible for companies to sign contracts with foreign workers whenever the workers pledged to give twelve months of their wages to pay the cost of emigration .
This gave the employers during the Civil war not only very cheap labor , but strikebreakers .
More important , perhaps , than the federal laws passed by Congress for the benefit of the rich were the day - to - day operations of local and state laws for the benefit of landlords and merchants .
Gustavus Myers , in his History of the Great American Fortunes , comments on this in discussing the growth of the Astor family 's fortune , much of it out of the rents of New York tenements :
Is it not murder when , compelled by want , people are forced to fester in squalid , germ - filled tenements , where the sunlight never enters and where disease finds a prolific breeding - place ?
Untold thousands went to their deaths in these unspeakable places .
Yet , so far as the Law was concerned , the rents collected by the Astors , as well as by other landlords , were honestly made .
The whole institution of Law saw nothing out of the way in these conditions , and very significantly so , because , to repeat over and over again , Law did not represent the ethics or ideals of advanced humanity ; it exactly reflected , as a pool reflects the sky , the demands and self - interest of the growing propertied classes ... .
In the thirty years leading up to the Civil War , the law was increasingly interpreted in the courts to suit the capitalist development of the country .
Studying this , Morton Horwitz ( The Transformation of American Law ) points out that the English commonlaw was no longer holy when it stood in the way of business growth .
Mill owners were given the legal right to destroy other people 's property by flood to carry on their business .
The law of " eminent domain " was used to take farmers ' land and give it to canal companies or railroad companies as subsidies .
Judgments for damages against businessmen were taken out of the hands of juries , which were unpredictable , and given to judges .
Private settlement of disputes by arbitration was replaced by court settlements , creating more dependence on lawyers , and the legal profession gained in importance .
The ancient idea of a fair price for goods gave way in the courts to the idea of caveat emptor ( let the buyer beware ) , thus throwing generations of consumers from that time on to the mercy of businessmen .
That contract law was intended to discriminate against working people and for business is shown by Horwitz in the following example of the early nineteenth century : the courts said that if a worker signed a contract to work for a year , and left before the year was up , he was not entitled to any wages , even for the time he had worked .
But the courts at the same time said that if a building business broke a contract , it was entitled to be paid for whatever had been done up to that point .
The pretense of the law was that a worker and a railroad made a contract with equal bargaining power .
Thus , a Massachusetts judge decided an injured worker did not deserve compensation , because , by signing the contract , he was agreeing to take certain risks .
" The circle was completed ; the law had come simply to ratify those forms of inequality that the market system produced . "
It was a time when the law did not even pretend to protect working people - as it would in the next century .
Health and safety laws were either nonexistent or unenforced .
In Lawrence , Massachusetts , in 1860 , on a winter day , the Pemberton Mill collapsed , with nine hundred workers inside , mostly women .
Eighty - eight died , and although there was evidence that the structure had never been adequate to support the heavy machinery inside , and that this was known to the construction engineer , a jury found " no evidence of criminal intent . "
Horwitz sums up what happened in the courts of law by the time of the Civil War :
By the middle of the nineteenth century the legal system had been reshaped to the advantage of men of commerce and industry at the expense of farmers , workers , consumers , and other less powerful groups within the society .
... it actively promoted a legal redistribution of wealth against the weakest groups in the society .
In premodern times , the maldistribution of wealth was accomplished by simple force .
In modern times , exploitation is disguised - it is accomplished by law , which has the look of neutrality and fairness .
By the time of the Civil War , modernization was well under way in the United States .
With the war over , the urgency of national unity slackened , and ordinary people could turn more to their daily lives , their problems of survival .
The disbanded armies now were in the streets , looking for work .
In June 1865 , Fincher 's Trades ' Review reported : " As was to be expected , the returned soldiers are flooding the streets already , unable to find employment . "
The cities to which the soldiers returned were death traps of typhus , tuberculosis , hunger , and fire .
In New York , 100,000 people lived in the cellars of the slums ; 12,000 women worked in houses of prostitution to keep from starving ; the garbage , lying 2 feet deep in the streets , was alive with rats .
In Philadelphia , while the rich got fresh water from the Schuylkill River , everyone else drank from the Delaware , into which 13 million gallons of sewage were dumped every day .
In the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 , the tenements fell so fast , one after another , that people said it sounded like an earthquake .
A movement for the eight - hour day began among working people after the war , helped by the formation of the first national federation of unions , the National Labor Union .
A three - month strike of 100,000 workers in New York won the eight - hour day , and at a victory celebration in June 1872 , 150,000 workers paraded through the city .
The New York Times wondered what proportion of the strikers were " thoroughly American . "
Women , brought into industry during the war , organized unions : cigarmakers , tailoresses , umbrella sewers , capmakers , printers , laundresses , shoeworkers .
They formed the Daughters of St , Crispin , and succeeded in getting the Cigarmakers Union and the National Typographical Union to admit women for the first time .
A woman named Gussie Lewis of New York became corresponding secretary of the Typographers ' Union .
But the cigarmakers and typographers were only two of the thirty - odd national unions , and the general attitude toward women was one of exclusion .
In 1869 , the collar laundresses of Troy , New York , whose work involved standing " over the wash tub and over the ironing table with furnaces on either side , the thermometer averaging 100 degrees , for wages averaging $ 2.00 and $ 3.00 a week " ( according to a contemporary account ) , went on strike .
Their leader was Kate Mullaney , second vice - president of the National Labor Union .
Seven thousand people came to a rally to support them , and the women organized a cooperative collar and cuff factory to provide work and keep the strike going .
But as time went on , outside support dwindled .
The employers began making a paper collar , requiring fewer laundresses .
The strike failed .
The dangers of mill work intensified efforts to organize .
Work often went on around the clock .
At a mill in Providence , Rhode Island , fire broke out one night in 1866 .
There was panic among the six hundred workers , mostly women , and many jumped to their deaths from upper - story windows .
In Fall River , Massachusetts , women weavers formed a union independent of the men weavers .
They refused to take a 10 percent wage cut that the men had accepted , struck against three nulls , won the men 's support , and brought to a halt 3,500 looms and 156,000 spindles , with 3,200 workers on strike .
But their children needed food ; they had to return to work , signing an " iron - clad oath " ( later called a " yellow - dog contract " ) not to join a union .
Black workers at this time found the National Labor Union reluctant to organize them .
So they formed their own unions and carried on their own strikes - like the levee workers in Mobile , Alabama , in 1867 , Negro longshoremen in Charleston , dockworkers in Savannah .
This probably stimulated the National Labor Union , at its 1869 convention , to resolve to organize women and Negroes , declaring that it recognized " neither color nor sex on the question of the rights of labor . "
A journalist wrote about the remarkable signs of racial unity at this convention :
When a native Mississippian and an ex-confederate officer , in addressing a convention , refers to a colored delegate who has preceded him as " the gentleman from Georgia " .. . when an ardent and Democratic partisan ( from New York at that ) declares with a rich Irish brogue that he asks for himself no privilege as a mechanic or as a citizen that he is not willing to concede to every other man , white or black ... then one may indeed be warranted in asserting that time works curious changes .. ..
Most unions , however , still kept Negroes out , or asked them to form their own locals .
The National Labor Union began to expend more and more of its energy on political issues , especially currency reform , a demand for the issuance of paper money : Greenbacks .
As it became less an organizer of labor struggles , and more a lobbyist with Congress , concerned with voting , it lost vitality .
An observer of the labor scene , F. A. Sorge , wrote in 1870 to Karl Marx in England : " The National Labor Union , which had such brilliant prospects in the beginning of its career , was poisoned by Greenbackism and is slowly but surely dying . "
Perhaps unions could not easily see the limits to legislative reform in an age where such reform laws were being passed for the first time , and hopes were high .
The Pennsylvania legislature in 1869 passed a mine safety act providing for the " regulation and ventilation of mines , and for the protection of the lives of the miners . "
Only after a hundred years of continuing accidents in those mines would it be understood how insufficient those words were - except as a device to calm anger among miners .
In 1873 , another economic crisis devastated the nation .
It was the closing of the banking house of Jay Cooke - the banker who during the war had made $ 3 million a year in commissions alone for selling government bonds - that started the wave of panic .
While President Grant slept in Cooke 's Philadelphia mansion on September 18 , 1873 , the banker rode downtown to lock the door on his bank .
Now people could not pay loans on mortgages : five thousand businesses closed and put their workers on the street .
It was more than Jay Cooke .
The crisis was built into a system which was chaotic in its nature , in which only the very rich were secure .
It was a system of periodic crisis - 1837 , 1857 , 1873 ( and later : 1893 , 1907 , 1919 , 1929 ) - that wiped out small businesses and brought cold , hunger , and death to working people while the fortunes of the Astors , Vanderbilts , Rockefellers , Morgans , kept growing through war and peace , crisis and recovery .
During the 1873 crisis , Carnegie was capturing the steel market , Rockefeller was wiping out his competitors in oil .
" LABOR DEPRESSION IN BROOKLYN " was the headline in the New York Herald in November 1873 .
It listed closings and layoffs : a felt - skirt factory , a picture - frame factory , a glass - cutting establishment , a steelworks factory .
And women 's trades : milliners , dressmakers , shoe - binders .
The depression continued through the 1870s .
During the first three months of 1874 , ninety thousand workers , almost half of them women , had to sleep in police stations in New York .
They were known as " revolvers " because they were limited to one or two days a month in any one police station , and so had to keep moving .
All over the country , people were evicted from their homes .
Many roamed the cities looking for food .
Desperate workers tried to get to Europe or to South America .
In 1878 , the SS Metropolis , filled with laborers , left the United States for South America and sank with all aboard .
The New York Tribune reported : " One hour after the news that the ship had gone down arrived in Philadelphia , the office of Messrs .
Collins was besieged by hundreds of hunger - bitten , decent men , begging for the places of the drowned laborers . "
Mass meeting and demonstrations of the unemployed took place all over the country .
Unemployed councils were set up .
A meeting in New York at Cooper Institute in late 1873 , organized by trade unions and the American seed on of the First International ( founded in 1864 in Europe by Marx and others ) , drew a huge crowd , overflowing into the streets .
The meeting asked that before bills became law they should be approved by a public vote , that no individual should own more than $ 30,000 ; they asked for an eight - hour day .
Also :
Whereas , we are industrious , law - abiding citizens , who had paid all taxes and given support and allegiance to the government , Resolved , that we will in this time of need supply ourselves and our families with proper food and shelter and we will send our bills to the City treasury , to be liquidated , until we shall obtain work ... .
In Chicago , twenty thousand unemployed marched through the streets to City Hall asking " bread for the needy , clothing for the naked , and houses for the homeless . "
Actions like this resulted in some relief for about ten thousand families .
In January 1874 , in New York City , a huge parade of workers , kept by the police from approaching City Hall , went to Tompkins Square , and there were told by the police they could n't have the meeting .
They stayed , and the police attacked .
One newspaper reported :
Police clubs rose and fell .
Women and children ran screaming in all directions .
Many of them were trampled underfoot in the stampede for the gates .
In the street bystanders were ridden down and mercilessly clubbed by mounted officers .
Strikes were called in the textile mills of Fall River , Massachusetts .
In the anthracite coal district of Pennsylvania , there was the " long strike , " where Irish members of a society called the Ancient Order of Hibernians were accused of acts of violence , mostly on the testimony of a detective planted among the miners .
These were the " Molly Maguires . "
They were tried and found guilty .
Philip Foner believes , after a study of the evidence , that they were framed because they were labor organizers .
He quotes the sympathetic Irish World , which called them " intelligent men whose direction gave strength to the resistance of the miners to the inhuman reduction of their wages . "
And he points to the Miners ' Journal , put out by the coal mine owners , which referred to the executed men this way : " What did they do ?
Whenever prices of labor did not suit them they organized and proclaimed a strike . "
All together , nineteen were executed , according to Anthony Bimba ( The Molly Maguires ) .
There were scattered protests from workingmen 's organizations , but no mass movement that could stop the executions .
It was a time when employers brought in recent immigrants - desperate for work , different from the strikers in language and culture - to break strikes .
Italians were imported into the bituminous coal area around Pittsburgh in 1874 to replace striking miners .
This led to the killing of three Italians , to trials in which jurors of the community exonerated the strikers , and bitter feelings between Italians and other organized workers .
The centennial year of 1876 - one hundred years after the Declaration of Independence - brought forth a number of new declarations ( reproduced by Philip Foner in We the Other People ) .
Whites and blacks , separately , expressed their disillusionment .
A " Negro Declaration of Independence " denounced the Republican party on which they had once depended to gain full freedom , and proposed independent political action by colored voters .
And the Workingmen 's party of Illinois , at a July 4 celebration organized by German socialists in Chicago , said in its Declaration of Independence :
The present system has enabled capitalists to make laws in their own interests to the injury and oppression of the workers .
It has made the name Democracy , for which our forefathers fought and died , a mockery and a shadow , by giving to property an unproportionate amount of representation and control over Legislation .
It has enabled capitalists ... to secure government aid , inland grants and money loans , to selfish railroad corporations , who , by monopolizing the means of transportation are enabled to swindle both the producer and the consumer .. ..
It has presented to the world the absurd spectacle of a deadly civil war for the abolition of negro slavery while the majority of the white population , those who have created all the wealth of the nation , are compelled to suffer under a bondage infinitely more galling and humiliating .
. ..
It has allowed the capitalists , as a class , to appropriate annually 5/6 of the entire production of the country .
. . .
It has therefore prevented mankind from fulfilling their natural destinies on earth - crushed out ambition , prevented marriages or caused false and unnatural ones - has shortened human life , destroyed morals and fostered crime , corrupted judges , ministers , and statesmen , shattered confidence , love and honor among men , and made life a selfish , merciless struggle for existence instead of a noble and generous struggle for perfection , in which equal advantages should be given to all , and human lives relieved from an unnatural and degrading competition for bread .. ..
We , therefore , the representatives of the workers of Chicago , in mass meeting assembled , do solemnly publish and declare .. .
That we are absolved from all allegiance to the existing political parties of this country , and that as free and independent producers we shall endeavor to acquire the full power to make our own laws , manage our own production , and govern ourselves , acknowledging no rights without duties , no duties without rights .
And for the support of this declaration , with a firm reliance on the assistance and cooperation of all workingmen , we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our means , and our sacred honor .
In the year 1877 , the country was in the depths of the Depression .
That summer , in the hot cities where poor families lived in cellars and drank infested water , the children became sick in large numbers .
The New York Times wrote : " ... already the cry of the dying children begins to be heard .
...
Soon , to judge from the past , there will be a thousand deaths of infants per week in the city . "
That first week in July , in Baltimore , where all liquid sewage ran through the streets , 139 babies died .
That year there came a series of tumultuous strikes by railroad workers in a dozen cities ; they shook the nation as no labor conflict in its history had done .
It began with wage cuts on railroad after railroad , in tense situations of already low wages ( $ 1.75 a day for brakemen working twelve hours ) , scheming and profiteering by the railroad companies , deaths and injuries among the workers - loss of hands , feet , fingers , the crushing of men between cars .
At the Baltimore & Ohio station in Martinsburg , West Virginia , workers determined to fight the wage cut went on strike , uncoupled the engines , ran them into the roundhouse , and announced no more trains would leave Martinsburg until the 10 percent cut was canceled .
A crowd of support gathered , too many for the local police to disperse .
B. & O. officials asked the governor for military protection , and he sent in militia .
A train tried to get through , protected by the militia , and a striker , trying to derail it , exchanged gunfire with a militiaman attempting to stop him .
The striker was shot in his thigh and his arm .
His arm was amputated later that day , and nine days later he died .
Six hundred freight trains now jammed the yards at Martinsburg .
The West Virginia governor applied to newly elected President Rutherford Hayes for federal troops , saying the state militia was insufficient .
In fact , the militia was not totally reliable , being composed of many railroad workers .
Much of the U.S. army was tied up in Indian battles in the West .
Congress had not appropriated money for the army yet , but J. P. Morgan , August Belmont , and other bankers now offered to lend money to pay army officers ( but no enlisted men ) .
Federal troops arrived in Martinsburg , and the freight cars began to move .
In Baltimore , a crowd of thousands sympathetic to the railroad strikers surrounded the armory of the National Guard , which had been called out by the governor at the request of the B. & O. Railroad .
The crowd hurled rocks , and the soldiers came out , firing .
The streets now became the scene of a moving , bloody battle .
When the evening was over , ten men or boys were dead , more badly wounded , one soldier wounded .
Half of the 120 troops quit and the rest went on to the train depot , where a crowd of two hundred smashed the engine of a passenger train , tore up tracks , and engaged the militia again in a running battle .
By now , fifteen thousand people surrounded the depot .
Soon , three passenger cars , the station platform , and a locomotive were on fire .
The governor asked for federal troops , and Hayes responded .
Five hundred soldiers arrived and Baltimore quieted down .
The rebellion of the railroad workers now spread .
Joseph Dacus , then editor of the St. Louis Republican , reported :
Strikes were occurring almost every hour .
The great State of Pennsylvania was in an uproar ; New Jersey was afflicted by a paralyzing dread ; New York was mustering an army of militia ; Ohio was shaken from Lake Erie to the Ohio River ; Indiana rested in a dreadful suspense .
Illinois , and especially its great metropolis , Chicago , apparently hung on the verge of a vortex of confusion and tumult .
St. Louis had already felt the effect of the premonitory shocks of the uprising .
. . .
The strike spread to Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Railroad .
Again , it happened outside the regular union , pent - up anger exploding without plan .
Robert Bruce , historian of the 1877 strikes , writes ( 1877 : Year of Violence ) about a flagman named Gus Harris .
Harris refused to go out on a " double - header , " a train with two locomotives carrying a double length of cars , to which railroaders had objected because it required fewer workers and made the brakemen's work more dangerous :
The decision was his own , not part of a concerted plan or a general understanding .
Had he lain awake that past night , listening to the rain , asking himself if he dared quit , wondering if anyone would join him , weighing the chances ?
Or had he simply risen to a breakfast that did not fill him , seen his children go off shabby and half - fed , walked brooding through the damp morning and then yielded impulsively to stored - up rage ?
When Harris said he would not go , the rest of the crew refused too .
The strikers now multiplied , joined by young boys and men from the mills and factories ( Pittsburgh had 33 iron mills , 73 glass factories , 29 oil refineries , 158 coal mines ) .
The freight trains stopped moving out of the city .
The Trainman 's Union had not organized this , but it moved to take hold , called a meeting , invited " all workingmen to make common cause with their brethren on the railroad . "
Railroad and local officials decided that the Pittsburgh militia would not kill their fellow townsmen , and urged that Philadelphia troops be called in .
By now two thousand cars were idle in Pittsburgh .
The Philadelphia troops came and began to clear the track .
Rocks flew .
Gunfire was exchanged between crowd and troops .
At least ten people were killed , all workingmen , most of them not railroaders .
Now the whole city rose in anger .
A crowd surrounded the troops , who moved into a roundhouse .
Railroad cars were set afire , buildings began to burn , and finally the roundhouse itself , the troops marching out of it to safety .
There was more gunfire , the Union Depot was set afire , thousands looted the freight cars .
A huge grain elevator and a small section of the city went up in flames .
In a few days , twenty - four people had been killed ( including four soldiers ) .
Seventy - nine buildings had been burned to the ground .
Something like a general strike was developing in Pittsburgh : mill workers , car workers , miners , laborers , and the employees at the Carnegie steel plant .
The entire National Guard of Pennsylvania , nine thousand men , was called out .
But many of the companies could n't move as strikers in other towns held up traffic .
In Lebanon , Pennsylvania , one National Guard company mutinied and marched through an excited town .
In Altoona , troops surrounded by rioters , immobilized by sabotaged engines , surrendered , stacked arms , fraternized with the crowd , and then were allowed to go home , to the accompaniment of singing by a quartet in an all - Negro militia company .
In Harrisburg , the state capital , as at so many places , teenagers made up a large part of the crowd , which included some Negroes .
Philadelphia militia , on their way home from Altoona , shook hands with the crowd , gave up their guns , marched like captives through the streets , were fed at a hotel and sent home .
The crowd agreed to the mayor 's request to deposit the surrendered guns at the city hall .
Factories and shops were idle .
After some looting , citizens ' patrols kept order in the streets through the night .
Where strikers did not manage to take control , as in Pottsville , Pennsylvania , it may well have been because of disunity .
The spokesman of the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company in that town wrote : " The men have no organization , and there is too much race jealousy existing among them to permit them to form one . "
In Reading , Pennsylvania , there was no such problem - 90 percent were native - born , the rest mostly German .
There , the railroad was two months behind in paying wages , and a branch of the Trainman 's Union was organized .
Two thousand people gathered , while men who had blackened their faces with coal dust set about methodically tearing up tracks , jamming switches , derailing cars , setting fire to cabooses and also to a railroad bridge .
A National Guard company arrived , fresh from duty at the execution of the Molly Maguires .
The crowd threw stones , fired pistols .
The soldiers fired into the crowd .
" Six men lay dead in the twilight , " Bruce reports , " a fireman and an engineer formerly employed in the Reading , a carpenter , a huckster , a rolling - mill worker , a laborer ....
A policeman and another man lay at the point of death . "
Five of the wounded died .
The crowd grew angrier , more menacing .
A contingent of soldiers announced it would not fire , one soldier saying he would rather put a bullet through the president of Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron .
The 16th Regiment of the Morristown volunteers stacked its arms .
Some militia threw their guns away and gave their ammunition to the crowd .
When the Guardsmen left for home , federal troops arrived and took control , and local police began making arrests .
Meanwhile the leaders of the big railway brotherhoods , the Order of Railway Conductors , the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , the Brotherhood of Engineers , disavowed the strike .
There was talk in the press of " communistic ideas . . . widely entertained ... by the workmen employed in mines and factories and by the railroads . "
In fact , there was a very active Workingmen 's party in Chicago , with several thousand members , most of them immigrants from Germany and Bohemia .
It was connected with the First International in Europe .
In the midst of the railroad strikes , that summer of 1877 , it called a rally .
Six thousand people came and demanded nationalization of the railroads .
Albert Parsons gave a fiery speech .
He was from Alabama , had fought in the Confederacy during the Civil War , married a brown - skinned woman of Spanish and Indian blood , worked as a typesetter , and was one of the best English - speaking orators the Workingmen 's party had .
The next day , a crowd of young people , not especially connected with the rally of the evening before , began moving through the railroad yards , closed down the freights , went to the factories , called out the mill workers , the stockyard workers , the crewmen on the Lake Michigan ships , closed down the brickyards and lumberyards .
That day also , Albert Parsons was fired from his job with the Chicago Times and declared blacklisted .
The police attacked the crowds .
The press reported : " The sound of clubs falling on skulls was sickening for the first minute , until one grew accustomed to it .
A rioter dropped at every whack , it seemed , for the ground was covered with them . "
Two companies of U.S. infantry arrived , joining National Guardsmen and Civil War veterans .
Police fired into a surging crowd , and three men were killed .
The next day , an armed crowd of five thousand fought the police .
The police fired again and again , and when it was over , and the dead were counted , they were , as usual , workingmen and boys , eighteen of them , their skulls smashed by clubs , their vital organs pierced by gunfire .
The one city where the Workingmen 's party clearly led the rebellion was St. Louis , a city of flour mills , foundries , packing houses , machine shops , breweries , and railroads .
Here , as elsewhere , there were wage cuts on the railroads .
And here there were perhaps a thousand members of the Workingmen 's party , many of them bakers , coopers , cabinetmakers , cigarmakers , brewery workers .
The party was organized in four sections , by nationality : German , English , French , Bohemian .
All four sections took a ferry across the Mississippi to join a mass meeting of railroad men in East St. Louis .
One of their speakers told the meeting : " All you have to do , gentlemen , for you have the numbers , is to unite on one idea - that the workingmen shall rule the country .
What man makes , belongs to him , and the workingmen made this country . "
Railroaders in East St. Louis declared themselves on strike .
The mayor of East St. Louis was a European immigrant , himself an active revolutionist as a youth , and railroad men's votes dominated the city .
In St. Louis , itself , the Workingmen 's party called an open - air mass meeting to which five thousand people came .
The party was clearly in the leadership of the strike .
Speakers , excited by the crowd , became more militant : " . . . capital has changed liberty into serfdom , and we must fight or die . "
They called for nationalization of the railroads , mines , and all industry .
At another huge meeting of the Workingmen 's party a black man spoke for those w
U.S. Pushed Allies on Iraq , Diplomat Writes
UNITED NATIONS —
In the months leading up to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration threatened trade reprisals against friendly countries who withheld their support , spied on its allies , and pressed for the recall of U.N. envoys that resisted U.S. pressure to endorse the war , according to an upcoming book by a top Chilean diplomat .
The rough - and - tumble diplomatic strategy has generated lasting “ bitterness ” and “ deep mistrust ” in Washington ’s relations with allies in Europe , Latin America and elsewhere , Heraldo Munoz , Chile ’s ambassador to the United Nations , writes in his book “ A Solitary War : A Diplomat ’s Chronicle of the Iraq War and Its Lessons , ” set for publication next month .
“ In the aftermath of the invasion , allies loyal to the United States were rejected , mocked and even punished ” for their refusal to back a U.N. resolution authorizing military action against Saddam Hussein ’s government , Munoz writes .
The evidence that Bush was lying when he said on 3/08/03 , “ We are doing everything we can to avoid war in Iraq ” just keeps piling up .
What he was actually doing was preparing for the occupation of Iraq regardless and was all too willing to act like a weasel to get as many nations as possible to surrender their sovereign conscience to the U.S. Obviously a tactic we Americans would resent were the tables turned .
As early as 2002 Bush knew that Iraq ’s WMD were more myth then reality , Bush knew Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction
On Sept. 18 , 2002 , CIA director George Tenet briefed President Bush in the Oval Office on top - secret intelligence that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction , according to two former senior CIA officers .
Bush dismissed as worthless this information from the Iraqi foreign minister , a member of Saddam ’s inner circle , although it turned out to be accurate in every detail .
Tenet never brought it up again .
Nor was the intelligence included in the National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002 , which stated categorically that Iraq possessed WMD .
No one in Congress was aware of the secret intelligence that Saddam had no WMD as the House of Representatives and the Senate voted , a week after the submission of the NIE , on the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq .
The information , moreover , was not circulated within the CIA among those agents involved in operations to prove whether Saddam had WMD .
That NIE ( National Intelligence Estimate ) was supposed to according to CIA policy , a non-political document .
In fact it did not suggest any political or military actions per se , but because it lacked any input from those that dissent from the views that the Whitehouse wanted to hear it ended up being one of the most politically partisan documents of our time .
It was n’t a national security document as much as justification for shoving a partisan political agenda down America ’s throat in the name of boogie man politics .
Were there any footnotes in the Iraq NIE ?
In one , the State Department ’s INR bureau dissented from the intelligence community ’s majority view that Baghdad was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program , saying there was not enough evidence to reach that conclusion .
In particular , it raised doubts about whether a large shipment of aluminum tubes sought by Iraq was intended for centrifuges to enrich nuclear fuel , as asserted by other agencies .
In another footnote , the U.S. Air Force ’s director for intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance questioned whether the unmanned aerial vehicles being developed by Iraq were “ probably ” intended to deliver biological agents .
Instead , he said that would be an unlikely mission for such aircraft .
This footnote was left out of the declassified version .
[ ] … some Senate Democrats say there was pressure .
John D. Rockefeller ( W. Va. ) , vice chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee , said July 9 that while policy - makers did not appear to have directly intervened in the NIE writing process , the NIE was assembled in a general “ environment of intense pressure ” that encouraged caveat - free assertions about Iraq ’s WMD .
By October 2002 , when the NIE was released , “ the most senior officials in the Bush administration had already forcefully and repeatedly stated their conclusions [ that Iraq had WMD ] publicly , ” Rockefeller said .
In August 2002 , Vice President Dick Cheney , in a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , said , “ Simply stated , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction . ”
“ No doubt ” ?
UNMOVIC and the IAEA – accurately assessed the state of Iraq ’s weapons programmes in 2002 - 2003
IAEA director Mohamed ElBaradei told the United Nations in March 2003 that his teams did not find evidence that Iraq had resumed nuclear activity or attempted to import uranium or centrifuge parts , and that in general Iraq ’s nuclear infrastructure had deteriorated .
Kay ’s latest statements confirm the IAEA ’s assessment .
UN inspections and sanctions , together with US airstrikes , had effectively destroyed most of Iraq ’s programmes after 1991 .
In addition , UN inspectors appear to have provided the bulk of US on - the - ground intelligence prior to 1998 .
You still see this in forums across the net , Bush relied on the same intelligence that Bill Clinton did .
This claim is always made with out the slightest bit of embarrassment by the commenter .
Partly true , Bush issued to the public , in the form of the unclassified summary of the NIE stale leftover intelligence from prior to 1998 to make his case for putting our troops in the line of fire in 2003 .
So much for Republicans as the Grand Mullahs of National Security .
The administration made the claim , successfully linked in the publics mind to this day that Saddam was going to had off nukes or sarin filled missiles to terrorists groups , yet never produced – let me repeat that – never produced any intelligence to back up that egregiously wild claim .
I was a John Edwards supporter , but have since tried to stay out of the fray .
There are several posts in which I ’ve defended Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama against unfair attacks , but that is not the same as an endorsement .
It is disheartening to see some of the back and forth between Clinton and Obama supporters .
Especially the crazy declaration that if HC or BO does n’t win the nomination they ’re voting for McCain .
Josh Marshall sums things up as regards that attitude very well , Goodbye , Cruel Ballot Box
Clearly though there are some people who really do mean it .
A very small fraction I think , but there nonetheless .
And there ’s really no better example of emotional infantilism that some people bring to the political process .
One can see it in a case like 1968 perhaps or other years where real and important differences separated the candidates — or in cases where the differences between the parties on key issues were not so great .
But that simply is not the case this year .
As much as the two campaign have sought to highlight the differences , the two candidates ’ positions on almost every issue is extremely close .
And the differences that do exist pale into insignificance when compared to Sen. McCain’s .
That ’s not to say that these small differences are reasons to choose one of the candidates over the other .
But to threaten either to sit the election or vote for McCain or vote for Nader if your candidate does n’t win the nomination shows as clearly as anything that one ’s ego - investment in one ’s candidate far outstrips one ’s interest in public policy and governance .
If this really is one ’s position after calm second - thought , I see no other way to describe it .
In my own words , grow the f**k up .
Instead of saying that ’ll you ’ll vote for McCain why not just say screw America , if I do n’t get what I want I ’m taking my ball and bat and going home .
I sympathize up to a point .
Ideals are great and each side is damn sure their ’s are better , truer and have more nutritional value per serving , but this is the real world of real choices and the always inevitable compromise .
Related to the current mini-crisis between candidates , Why am I so afraid that the Democratic Party is shooting itself in the foot ?

A zebra ’s stripes , a seashell ’s spirals , a butterfly ’s wings : these are all examples of patterns in nature .
The formation of patterns is a puzzle for mathematicians and biologists alike .
How does the delicate design of a butterfly ’s wings come from a single fertilized egg ?
How does pattern emerge out of no pattern ?
Using computer models and live cells , researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered a specific pattern that can direct cell movement and may help us understand how metastatic cancer cells move .
“ Pattern formation is a classic problem in embryology , ” says Denise Montell , Ph.D. , a professor of biological chemistry at Hopkins .
“ At some point , cells in an embryo must separate into those that will become heart cells , liver cells , blood cells and so on .
Although this has been studied for years , there is still a lot we do n’t understand . ”
As an example of pattern formation , the researchers studied the process of how about six cells in the fruit fly distinguish themselves from neighboring cells and move from one location in the ovary to another during egg development .
“ In order for this cell migration to happen , you have to have cells that go and cells that stay , ” says Montell .
“ There must be a clear distinction — a separation between different types of cells , which on the surface look the same . ”
Previous work identified a specific signal necessary for getting these fly egg cells to move ; the problem is that this signal is “ graded . ”
Like drops of ink spreading out on wet paper , this signal travels in between surrounding cells , gradually fading away as it moves outwards .
But clear lines are required for pattern formation — there is no grey area between a zebra ’s black and white stripes , between heart and liver cells and , in this case , between migrating cells and those that stay put .
How are graded signals converted to a clear move or stay signal ?
By examining flies containing mutations in different genes , the researchers discovered that one gene in particular , called apontic , is important for converting a graded signal .
“ When apontic is mutated , the distinction between migrating and nonmigrating cells is fuzzy , ” says Michelle Starz - Gaiano , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral fellow in biological chemistry .
“ In these mutants , we see a lot of cases where migrating cells do not properly detach from their neighbors but instead drag them along as they move away . ”
This showed that the graded signal alone was not sufficient to kick - start the proper number of cells , but instead needed help from apontic .
Once the team discovered that apontic is important for getting these cells to move , they set out to figure out how apontic works .
Collaborating with mathematician Hans Meinhardt , Ph.D. , a professor emeritus at the Max Planck Institute in Germany , they designed a computer model that could simulate how graded signals are converted to commands that tell cells to move or to stay .
By making certain assumptions about each gene and assigning functions to each protein , the team built a simple circuit that can predict a cell ’s behavior using the graded signal , apontic , and another previously discovered protein called slbo ( pronounced “ slow - bo ” ) .
The computer model shows that in a cell , the graded signal turns on both apontic and slbo .
But apontic and slbo work against and battle each other : when one gains a slight advantage , the other weakens , which in turn causes the first to gain an even bigger advantage .
This continues until one dominates in each cell .
If slbo wins , the cell moves but if apontic wins , the cell stays put ; thus a clear separation between move or stay is achieved .
“ Not only is this a new solution to the problem of how to create a pattern out of no pattern , but we have also discovered that apontic is a new regulator of cell migration , ” says Montell .
Cell migration likely underlies the spreading of cancer cells beyond an original tumor to other areas of the body .
Understanding and therefore being able to manipulate the cell migration pathway could potentially prevent the development of these new tumors .
At this stage , Montell says , “ it ’s more about just understanding what the positive and negative regulators of cell migration are . ”
The research was funded by the American Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health .
This study was published in the May 13 issue of Developmental Cell .
Authors on the paper are Starz - Gaiano , Mariana Melani , Xiaobo Wang , and Montell , all of Hopkins ; and Hans Meinhardt of the Max - Planck - Institut , Tübingen , Germany .
Waltzing microbots are all the rage at Duke University .
Researchers there today said they made microrobots shaped something like a spatula but with dimensions measuring just microns , or millionths of a meter pirouette to the music of a Strauss waltz on a dance floor just 1 millimeter across .
In another sequence , the devices pivot in a precise fashion whenever their boom - like steering arms are drawn down to the surface by an electric charge .
This response resembles the way dirt bikers turn by extending a boot heel , researchers said .
The researchers said they have also been able to get five of the devices to group - maneuver in cooperation under the same control system .
Known as microelectromechanical system ( MEMS ) microrobots , the devices are of suitable scale for Lilliputian tasks such as moving around the interiors of laboratories - on - a - chip .
They are almost 100 times smaller than any previous robotic designs of their kind and weigh even less , researchers noted .
" Initially , we wanted to build something like a car that could drive around at the microscopic scale , " said Bruce Donald , a Duke professor of computer science and biochemistry .
" Now what we 've been able to do is create the first microscopic traffic jam . "
Propelling themselves across such surfaces in an inchworm - like fashion impelled by a " scratch - drive " motion actuator , the microrobots advance in steps only 10 to 20 billionths of a meter each , but repeated as often as 20,000 times a second .
The microrobots can be so small because they are not encumbered by leash - like tethers attached to an external control system .
Built with microchip fabrication techniques , they are each designed to respond differently to the same single " global control signal " as voltages charge and discharge on their working parts .
In their new reports , the team shows that five of the microrobots can be made to advance , turn and circle together in pre-planned ways when each is built with slightly different dimensions and stiffness , researchers said .
Following a choreography mapped out with the aid of mathematics , the microdevices ultimately assemble into group micro-huddles that could set the stage for something more elaborate .
Donald said it took him and various colleagues from 1997 to 2002 to create a microrobot that can operate without a tether , three more years to make the devices steer under global control , and another three to independently maneuver more than one at a time .

Today Barack Obama picked up three newspaper endorsements in Indiana and one in North Carolina ahead of Tuesday ’s primaries .
Here are some highlights from each endorsement .
In Muncie , The Star Press said , “ Obama has breathed new life into the Democratic party , helping to rebuild it into a 50 - state party through his appeal to important and previously disaffected young voters .
Youth are the future of our country , but both parties have either ignored or been unable to reach them for generations .
The fact that many are paying attention now , thanks to Obama , bodes well for the future . ”
The editorial board of the Gary Post - Tribune wrote , “ Barack Obama has taken the crusade for change a step further , calling for a change in the politics and policies of Washington and the country as a whole .
We recommend a vote for Obama because he potentially represents more of what is new than Hillary Clinton , who is part of the inside crowd in Washington . ”

In delivering their endorsement the Louisville Courier - Journal concluded , “ Sen . Obama ’s relentless focus on change , and the hordes of new voters he draws to the polls , would make it hard for his victory to be read as anything other than a mandate for changing how Washington works .
Sen .
Clinton actually has engaged in more collaborative efforts with Republicans than she is given credit for .
But she is battle - scarred , widely viewed as divisive and , we believe , would face a harder time enacting her program . ”
In North Carolina , The Charlotte Observer also endorsed Obama , “ Nominating Sen . Obama would send a powerful message to the world .
He ’s the son of a white mother from Kansas and an absent father from Kenya .
His personal story would make it plain that America is changing for the better .
His appreciation of the need for international cooperation is a welcome change from the Bush administration ’s know - it - all , go - it - alone tendencies . ”
I think all of these endorsements are a very good sign for the Obama campaign especially Indiana where the race looks as close as it gets .
We all know that no matter what the numbers say , if Obama wins both states on Tuesday , this race is over .
With Clinton opening a campaign office in Lexington , KY , it is clear that no matter what she is in it until June , but two more Obama wins means that it wo n’t matter if she is there or not .

Detectives acted on intelligence that youngsters used internet site Bebo to arrange a series of confrontations involving rival groups across Derby between November and January , Derbyshire Police said today .
The detained youths , aged 14 and 15 , were questioned by officers this week about the fights and their postings on the web , the force said .
They have been released on police bail , but five will face final warnings and be made to sign acceptable behaviour contracts , said a force spokesman .
The spokesman said : " We have taken what we think is early preventative action before it gets serious .
" Some people think the internet is private but it 's a public place and if they are posting messages which could lead to disorder then that 's something we will take a keen interest in . "
No one was seriously injured in the incidents but police warned parents to be aware of what their children are looking at on their computers .
Bebo has agreed to take the material relating to the fights in Derby off its site .
Born in Durban and the author of a forthcoming book on Wentworth in Durban , Peter Mckenzie was a co-founder of the photo collective Afrapix agency under the auspices of the South African Council of Churches and the chief photographer for Drum magazine until the late 1980s before going freelance .
He was also the co-ordinator and facilitator of the photojournalism department at the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism from 1996 to 1999 .
Mckenzie has published and exhibited both in South Africa and internationally , and is recognised as one of South Africa 's greatest photographers .
Below , McKenzie provides a commentary on aesthetics and representation strategies for popular movements committed to social justice .
Pre-post : A trajectory in South African photography
By Peter Mckenzie , Sean O’ Toole and Jo Ractliffe
Sean :
Very often in discussions of contemporary South African photography , and I would say I ’m a guilty culprit here too , commentators have tended to speak of the 1990s signalling a break in continuity .
After decades of socially committed photography , Drum magazine in the 1950s and early 1960s , and more pointedly the socially committed vision of the Afrapix collective in the 1980s , it seems that after Mandela ’s release and the transition to a non-racial democracy photography splintered .
At least so goes the master narrative .
Or will history , which is good at flattening things , simply define the 1990s as the identity decade ?
Jo : I remember in the mid 1990s there was much debate about the ``crisis in photography '' , that with the advent of democracy , photographers ``lost '' their subject .
But I think it was more intricate than that and something that faced all visual artists at the time , not only photographers .
Certainly , our world opened up – and not only politically .
We began to think differently about ourselves , our past and how it had been narrated .
There was a new complexity to image making ; an investigation into other themes , modes and languages , as well as more self - reflexivity in the work of that time , all of which previously had not seemed possible – and this links to your point about the 1990s being the ``identity decade ' ' .
Also , prior to democracy and particularly during the 1980s , there was a strong sense of ``collectivity '' in the way artists and photographers positioned themselves and how they worked ; the imperatives were clear - cut and unambiguous – as was the language of image making .
And photography was the domain of social documentary .
There was little ambivalence about this ; it was a ``weapon of the struggle ' ' and its business was advocacy – exposing the evils of apartheid .
And there were other new things in the 1990s .
We became part of an international art world and this expanded the field ; remember the 1995 and 1997 Johannesburg Biennales and the surge of photography and video that followed ?
Suddenly , or so it seemed , photography had entered the realm of art .
I think that moment had quite a profound affect on photography here and sometimes I wonder whether the splintering you speak of was n’t perhaps more an anxiety that photography might lose its coherence , the distinctiveness of its project and simply be absorbed into the broader practice of contemporary art – because that ’s really what changed here then .
If you consider photography during the apartheid years , its efficacy and its power was largely tied up in its deliverance of an unequivocal and ( seemingly ) unmediated ``truth '' ; we could ``rely '' on the image and we understood our world as much in terms of the conventions of social documentary -- its explicit black and white clarity -- as we did through its subjects .
Peter : I think to say that after 1994 photography ``splintered '' is to imply that there was some kind of cohesiveness in what photographers were doing and saying during the apartheid years .
I ’m thinking more of the 1970s and 1980s here .
At the one extreme there were those , mostly white photographers , who were at apartheid ’s technical colleges , universities , art schools , alongside those who were members of the almost exclusively white Professional Photographers of South Africa organisation unaffected or unconcerned about the issues of the day .
On the other hand , the socially engaged , ``committed '' photographers , professionals and free - lancers were a fairly disparate lot too .
There were the shooters like the Bang - Bang Club , locals working for the ``wires ' ' and the South African media , the Drum photographers and those working in progressive structures like Afrapix and others .
The result was a very diverse picture or photograph of the country as these photographers brought their own aims , objectives and professional imperatives to the situation , some ardently in search of the Pulitzer - winning photo of the man or woman with the burning tire around their necks .
Consequently , there were to consumers of these images both locally and internationally , confusing truths about the realties of the struggle for democracy and freedom .
The photographs were mostly sensational , voyeuristic and dehumanising and soon after its inception Afrapix made a conscious decision to show the more humane side of struggle , the resilience of revolution and the dignity of organisation and resistance .
Jo : I think the subject , given all these factors , was not as clearly defined as we would like to think and that the complexity of photographs made during this period has not been fully explored .
But maybe the notion of subject during that time and now links these two eras .
That after the exploratory 1990s , the ``identity decade ' ' or parade , we are today being challenged by similar issues as those in our past and to comment and reflect on them in new , effective and accessible ways .
Besides identity , the 1990s was also a period where photography delved into the fabric of society in more detail and nuance than was allowed in the past when physical access was difficult both due to angry and frustrated communities and a security apparatus that was suspicious of anyone with a camera .
The work of the 1990s was also portrayed in much more personal ways examining post - apartheid phenomena like truth and reconciliation , diversity , rainbow - nationalism , post - apartheid trauma and the transformation project .
Obviously these newfound themes or subjects called for new visual languages , perspectives and conceptual approaches .
Sean : Perhaps to expand on the previous question , histories of South African photography often tend to highlight the social and political content at the expense , I would argue , of a wider picture .
Perhaps this is unavoidable , and one that is justified given our history .
But , and here is my argument , the history of South African photography is about more than social and political pictures .
Early on in his career David Goldblatt made fashion pictures for Tatler , in the 1980s he was making portraits for Leadership magazine .
Point being , there have always been a number of ``other '' photographies happening in tandem with image making concerned with social and political contexts .
Billy Monk , Paratus , Scope magazine , South African photo comics , studio and street portraiture , for example .
Jo : I ’m reminded of something Susan Sontag said about photography in South Africa when she visited here a few years ago .
Her observation was that photography is highly politicised here , in complex ways and not simply in terms of a political subject , but in how the subject is politicised .
I would agree ; our framing of things , the way we represent things – even the representation – is politicised .
So when thinking about photography that has been ‘ more than ’ the socio- political , I ’m not entirely sure a ``wider picture ' ' would n’t still be connected .
Because ``political '' does n’t necessarily entail advocacy , photographers whose work engaged with the ``state of things ' ' , but was circulated in other contexts , outside of the press and other progressive media , could still be considered political .
And even if you take this further , to work where the intention was not socio-political commentary , the political is still embedded in our reception , the way we understand how things mean .
But to get back to ``other photographies '' , we should be clear about what we ’re looking at – you mention Scope magazine !
And how could Paratus , a military publication , not be political ?
But regarding David , I think there ’s a difference between work that defines a photographer ’s practice and work that earns a living .
And while David ’s Tatler work may be illuminating in retrospect , it ’s not the stuff of his career .
Leadership too , although many of those portraits have weight beyond their ``bread and butter '' origins , but I suspect they would still be seen as political pictures , or at least in that register .
Billy
Monk is a better example but there we only have the works , we know little about the motives behind their making .
One could argue there ’s nothing overtly ``political '' in them , but they do reflect a particular South African subculture , at a particular time in our history and it is precisely because of that , what they add to the ``wider picture ' ' , that they take on socio-political connotations .
That ’s partly the thing about photographs ; their meaning is not fixed , nor is it located inherently within them .
They reflect different things over time and as their contexts shift and other interests are brought to bear upon them , they mean new things .
There are other examples , private images , that acquire political resonance as they find their way into the public archive – think of the studio portraits in Santu Mofokeng ’s Black Photo Album , the snapshot of Brett Murray as a boy , covered in boot polish and dressed up as a Zulu warrior , or the home movie clips in Penny Siopis ’ My Lovely Day .
The point I ’m making is that things are charged here ; our positioning and the things we make figure in political terms , whether so intended or not .
Peter : The ``wider picture '' or ``other photographies '' was not an option for some photographers , the crop was tight .
Even the ``bread and butter '' jobs that were done were gleaned from the progressive organisations that had the budgets to pay for photographs .
And resources like equipment and film were scarce , every roll had to matter .
At the 1982 Culture and Resistance Festival in Gaberone , Botswana , which convened to examine themes of ``Art for Social Development ' ' and ``Culture as a Weapon '' , the role of photography was further compromised .
We went to the festival as photographers and returned as cultural workers with a directive that the struggle for liberation demanded action beyond just photography .
Consequently photographers became involved in other facets of the struggle ; community mobilisation , advocacy , protest meetings , funeral organisers , underground couriers and sometimes were detained for their efforts .
In retrospect this was positive in many ways , not least because we were a bit arrogant about the importance of our role as those who decided what the face of struggle looked like , that we were doing work that had the same degree of persuasiveness as Sam Nzima ’s photograph of the mortally wounded Hector Peterson .
So being a worker brought some sobering perspective .
Yes , I ’m sure there were ``other photographies '' , done even by the most committed , but their significance was lost in the pursuit of more pressing imperatives .
Post - apartheid photography strove to escape from the confining realities of the past .
It was as if photographers , like all South Africans , wanted to distance themselves as quickly as possible from the ``fist in the air '' type image .
Collective strategies were replaced by the individual and the novelty of self .
The irony was that much of the stronger work being done in the 1990s was by those who belonged to the social documentary traditions of the past .
It was as if those photographers were now freed up explore subjects , insights and perspectives that they had self - censored in the past .
The shift being that it was now possible to explore life , to know it , to record the fabric of current experience and invest it with meaning .
So it ’s this type of continuity that I think is important today , this newness and keen observation of the ordinary , the head and the heart in a harmonious duet .
Some contemporary South African photography has run ahead of itself , not stopping to assess its effectiveness , clarity of vision and relationship with the realities that face the country .
Jo : Sean , I think Peter ’s comment about ``more pressing imperatives '' addresses why certain practices were overlooked .
But to throw something else in here , I do n’t think this was simply about political relevance .
Because why has Drum endured so in our imagination ?
It ’s not just that it reflected its time and pioneered the work of black photographers .
It ’s equally because its photography was distinctive .
So when considering ``other photographies '' , the question remains , how would these figure ?
For instance , your examples of Scope , Paratus and photo - comics ; are they compelling in photographic terms , or is their value as artefact , what they reflect of South African culture ?
Sean : Peter , two questions based on your response .
It is well known that at the 1982 Culture and Resistance Festival in Gaberone yourself and David Goldblatt had a disagreement over the very issue of , as you put it , ``action beyond just photography ' ' .
Can you revisit this moment and its significance ?
Secondly , and opening things up to Jo here , you talk of the post - apartheid moment freeing you ( photographers collectively ) to ``explore subjects , insights and perspectives that they had self - censored in the past ' ' .
Can you talk a bit about this self - censorship ?
My question here is partly informed by something JM Coetzee noted in a review of Mona de Beer ’s photo book , A Vision of the Past : `` Is it enough to reproduce an era ’s representation of itself without at the very least indicating the boundaries the era drew around that self - representation – without , in other words , indicating what was censored from the public image ? ''
Peter : I really do n’t remember the detail of my disagreement with David and I ’m surprised that it ’s well known , so I wo n’t comment , save to say that photographers were n’t immune to the tensions between black and white people and it took a long time , white or black , to establish one ’s bona fides , to be seen to be different from the press pack and to identify with the struggle .
So we shot our fists into the air when the Amandlas rang out and downed cameras to toyi - toyi afterwards .
I think more than a consciously determined self - censorship , it was about being subject and sensitive to the disposition of the times and acting in sympathy , according to your convictions .
Jo : I think my circumstances were unlike Peter ’s ; I did n’t feel the same pressures or restrictions that ``professional activist '' photographers would have , although my activities and the work I was making were seen as political .
But I did n’t ‘ fit ’ social documentary .
Partly , it was how I worked photographically - images that engaged with the constructs of photography and the real as much as they did the subject .
And that separated me from many other photographers ( then I was called an artist ; it ’s only recently , I ’ve noticed , that people are calling me a photographer ) .
But it did give me more autonomy .
Looking back , the personal has always been embedded in my work even if it was n’t brought to the fore as such .
So regarding self - censorship , while I certainly felt the need for my work to be socially and politically engaged , to have ``relevance ' ' beyond the personal , it was as much an internal compulsion as it might have been an external obligation .
Sean : Picking up on something
Jo said about pre-1994 photography , the belief that surrounded its ``deliverance of an unequivocal and ( seemingly ) unmediated `truth ''' ; is it not possible that SA photography is still burdened by this assumption ?
I raise this specifically in relation to the numerous travelling group shows , in which photography is reduced ( not always ) to a sort of picture postcard view from elsewhere – the emphasis is still on visible depiction of otherness .
( One could argue that Snap Judgments , for example , fulfilled as well as wonderfully debunked this demand of the West to see ``how it is over there ''. )
I am also interested to gauge from both of you how input from foreign observers has influenced your thinking around South African photography .
After all , both of you are well travelled and now partake in a global discourse of photography .
Peter : Maybe , as a friend suggested to me , the ``truth '' that motivated apartheid photography has today become subjective ``truths '' , like the ruling [ African national Congress ] party ’s rhetoric of ` `A better life for all ' ' .
So if we ’re clear that these days our photography comes from a place of honesty then the question could be what motivates our ideas or the conceptual framework from which we create ?
If it ’s personal or introspective , it raises the question about where the impetus or genesis of the concept lies or originates .
The sources of ideas for creative output in South Africa are as diverse as the variety of lived experiences in this enigmatic country .
But more important is the confluence of conviction about the role or place of art today and how the profound affect of our recent traumatic history influences this process .
Visually we live with the past .
The landscapes , both physical and social , are daily reminders of the challenges facing us .
The things that touch and move us on an everyday basis cannot be ignored and attempts to do this merely diminish the effect of our work to the point that it seems to be coming from another place , an attempt to extricate ourselves from our realities and pander to the demands of the gallery and criteria that are informed by sometimes questionable agendas .
This utopian idea of creativity free of responsibility falters in the face of the social ills that slam us in the face whenever we see kids sniffing glue at traffic lights alongside anxious baby - toting mothers .
Do scenarios like this not affect who we are , what we do and how we create ?
Once you ’ve seen it can you ``unsee '' it ?
Sometimes it seems that artists have bought into the government rhetoric of success and smugness about South Africa , that we are free to pursue our individual and mostly selfish notions of where conceptual thought comes from , free from morality , accountability and the vision of what an equitable society could and should be .
We ’ve succumbed to the powers that determine what art is , mainly because they have decided what ``sells ' ' and shunned a sense of purpose because it does n’t .
Jo :
We were very invested in the idea of photographic ``truth '' during apartheid .
Given the structural violence of the system , it ’s secrecy and lies , photography had to convey a clear , direct message , one that was n’t further complicated or undermined by questions about representation and the subject .
And as much as we may still be invested in what Susan Sontag called the ``concerns of ‘ concerned ’ photography ' ' , I think there ’s a very different inflection to the work made now .
But the link you make between the ‘ burden of truth ’ and otherness is interesting .
It seems we still have quite a strong sense of being different , collectively , as a nation – a sense of our own specialness .
This may have something to do with years of isolation , but we ’re quite resistant to views from the outside ; we ’re very particular about how we are represented , how we explain ourselves for the world and the image of South Africa that ’s created .
I would n’t equate this with the obligations of apartheid photography though , but it may suggest a censure of another kind .
I take your point about the ``postcard view from elsewhere ' ' but I think we might also collude in this to some degree ; we resist what the prefix ``South African '' implies , but we also insist on our distinctiveness , which in turn , could be seen to entrench our position of otherness , whatever the curators ’ interests may be .
But I would n’t put Snap Judgments into your ``picture postcard '' category .
What struck me about that exhibition was precisely the opposite ; it ’s actually quite hard to find ``Africa ' ' in that show , certainly if you ’re looking something that would reflect anything of the myth or stereotype .
What did emerge , for me at least , is the impossibility of defining ``Africa '' in either photographic or other terms .
My own experience in the international arena has been a somewhat contradictory one .
For most of the 1990s ( especially with those early survey shows ) , the general response to my work was that it lacked a ``uniquely South African '' trait , while at the same time being ``too South African '' , too specific in the framing of things , to relate in a global context , which was interesting , if not a little frustrating at times .
But it did indicate something of what was desirable in terms of ``South African '' for a foreign audience then and the irony is that recently there ’s been international interest in many of those earlier works .
I think our interface with the international art world has ultimately been beneficial ; apart from the obvious opportunities of exhibitions , exchanges and debates , it ’s important to see how our work is received in other contexts and it opens the space for a different set of relations , to discover perhaps that we are less different than we might think .

A new paper published appearing Thursday in the prestigious scientific journal Nature presents the worst - case scenario for runaway climate change that could leave the Earth entirely ice - free within a generation .
If global temperatures continue to rise , massive amounts of methane gas could be released from the 10,000 gigaton reserves of frozen methane that are currently locked in the world 's deep oceans and permafrost .
Passing this climate tipping point would result in global warming that would be far worse and more rapid than scientists ' current estimates .
The new paper suggests that exactly this type of cascading release of methane reserves rapidly warmed the Earth 635 million years ago , replacing an
Ice Age with a period of tropical heat .
The study 's lead author suggests it could happen again , and fast – not over thousands or millions of years , but possibly within a century .
" This is a major concern because it ’s possible that only a little warming can unleash this trapped methane , " Martin Kennedy , a professor at UC Riverside , said in a release .
" Unzippering the methane reservoir could potentially warm the Earth tens of degrees , and the mechanism could be geologically very rapid . "
Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas .
And the frozen reserve is twice as large , by volume , as the world 's known fossil fuel reserves .
Climate projections , like those produced by the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , usually look like smooth lines moving up steadily along with carbon dioxide levels , which is a reflection of the linear mathematical models that underpin the graphs .
But Kennedy and other geologists , while accepting the importance of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions , say that standard climate models can't account for massive climate changes that occur within decades .
" None of this stuff is linear .
It 's non-linear , " Kennedy said .
Kennedy 's work in Nature examined a rapid period of deglaciation that occurred 635 million years ago looking for the " trigger " to the explosion of warming across the globe that occurred .
In his study 's scenario , methane frozen with water in what 's known as a " clathrate " ( or gas hydrate ) became destabilized at lower latitudes and began to release methane gas .
The warming induced by this gas started a cascade of clathrate destabilization running up toward the poles , acting as a runaway feedback mechanism that rapidly changed the earth 's climate from glacial to tropical .
Kennedy chose the period known as the Marinoan deglaciation because he sees parallels from that distant event with the rapid rise in temperatures the Earth is now experiencing due to increased so - called radiative forcing from higher levels of greenhouse gases .
" What 's going to happen if we double or triple CO2 levels ? " he said .
In our world now , clathrates exist in Arctic permafrost and in the ocean near the continents .
The professor worries that rising CO2 levels could drive enough warming to destabilize the Earth 's clathrate reserves .
Based on his analysis of the geological record , that could lead to climate change that is more rapid than most scientists imagine and that would prove difficult for humanity to cope with .
" If the Earth is going to move to a new state , it will do it very rapidly , " Kennedy said .
Other geologists share his worry .
Jim Kennett , a professor of geology and paleobiology at UC Santa Barbara , said that finding climate triggers and tipping points had become the most important scientific problem of our time .
" Martin Kennedy 's work is really important and I think he's on the right track , " Kennett said .
Kennett , like Kennedy , argues that the release of methane from clathrates is the only possible trigger for massive climate change over the course of mere decades .
But not all scientists accept that methane ice is a major threat to the climate .
Larry Smith , a professor in UCLA 's department of earth and space sciences , said that earlier research had allayed many of the fears that methane clathrates would destabilize and release their methane .
" The requirements to destabilize the clathrates did n't seem realistic under likely future scenarios , " Smith said .
David Archer , a University of Chicago geosciences professor , argued in a paper ( . pdf ) last year that methane release appears likely to be " chronic rather than catastrophic " and only on the scale of human fossil - fuel combustion .
Many scientists believe that a variety of other factors , like changes in the albedo ( reflectivity ) of the Earth could account for the massive , quick climate changes that have occurred through history .
Determining which theory is correct could have a major impact on both research priorities and policy decisions .
If Kennedy is right , then rising temperatures in the northern latitudes where permafrost exists would be a very bad sign for the earth 's climate .
Indeed , Larry Smith , an expert in permafrost , noted that permafrost temperatures are continuing to rise across the Northern Hemisphere .
That led the UN to warn earlier this year that clathrates are a major climate wild card .
Last month , Russian scientists presented evidence that the destabilization of hydrates is already occurring in the Arctic Ocean .
Still , the lack of good data on the amount of methane entering the atmosphere from warming permafrost and ocean sources prevents the sort of quantification that drives governments to take notice and change course .
" Methane seeping from permafrost is something that 's occurring , " Kennedy said .
" The challenge with it today is that we can't measure it , so we 're just blithely ignoring it . "

We Americans tend to have short memories when it comes to economic problems ( among other things ) , so it 's probably worth taking an occasional look backwards to illuminate the present .
On Nov. 1 last year , a group called Securing America 's Future Energy ran a game - playing
exercise with nine mucky - mucks like former Treasury Secretary Robert E.Rubin , prize - winning author and consultant Daniel Yergin , former deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Gen. ( Ret. ) John P. Abizaid .
The goal : to dramatize the risks of a price shock if some unexpected event threatened world oil supplies .
The scenario : unrest rocks Azerbaijan and an explosion cuts off a million - barrel - a - day pipeline .
The scenario was called " Shockwave " and
it envisioned an urgent meeting of the National Security Council to deal with the " crisis . "
And what was the price of oil during this hypothetical crisis ?
$ 115 a barrel - slightly less than the current price .
That brings to mind one lesson and one question .

One of the most impressive hacks I 've ever read about has to be the Black Sunday kill .
Since the original 2001 Slashdot article I read on this is 99.9 % quote , I 'm going to do the same .
I can see why they quoted so extensively ; it'd be difficult to improve on the unusually succinct , well written summary provided by Pat from Belch :
One of the original smart cards , entitled ' H ' cards for Hughes , had design flaws which were discovered by the hacking community .
These flaws enabled the extremely bright hacking community to reverse engineer their design , and to create smart card writers .
The writers enabled the hackers to read and write to the smart card , and allowed them to change their subscription model to receive all the channels .
Since the technology of satellite television is broadcast only , meaning you cannot send information TO the satellite , the system requires a phone line to communicate with DirecTV .
The hackers could re-write their smart cards and receive all the channels , and unplug their phone lines leaving no way for DirecTV to track the abuse .
DirecTV had built a mechanism into their system that allowed the updating of these smart cards through the satellite stream .
Every receiver was designed to ' apply ' these updates when it received them to the cards .
DirecTV applied updates that looked for hacked cards , and then attempted to destroy the cards by writing updates that disabled them .
The hacking community replied with yet another piece of hardware , an ' unlooper , ' that repaired the damage .
The hacker community then designed software that trojanized the card , and removed the capability of the receivers to update the card .
DirecTV could only send updates to the cards , and then require the updates be present in order to receive video .
Each month or so , DirecTV would send an update .
10 or 15 minutes later , the hacking community would update the software to work around the latest fixes .
This was the status quo for almost two years .
' H' cards regularly sold on eBay for over $ 400.00 .
It was apparent that DirecTV had lost this battle , relegating DirecTV to hunting down Web sites that discussed their product and using their legal team to sue and intimidate them into submission .
Four months ago , however , DirecTV began sending several updates at a time , breaking their pattern .
While the hacking community was able to bypass these batches , they did not understand the reasoning behind them .
Never before had DirecTV sent 4 and 5 updates at a time , yet alone send these batches every week .
Many postulated they were simply trying to annoy the community into submission .
The updates contained useless pieces of computer code that were then required to be present on the card in order to receive the transmission .
The hacking community accommodated this in their software , applying these updates in their hacking software .
Not until the final batch of updates were sent through the stream did the hacking community understand DirecTV .
Like a final piece of a puzzle allowing the entire picture , the final updates made all the useless bits of computer code join into a dynamic program , existing on the card itself .
This dynamic program changed the entire way the older technology worked .
In a masterful , planned , and orchestrated manner , DirecTV had updated the old and ailing technology .
The hacking community responded , but cautiously , understanding that this new ability for DirecTV to apply more advanced logic in the receiver was a dangerous new weapon .
It was still possible to bypass the protections and receive the programming , but DirecTV had not pulled the trigger of this new weapon .
Last Sunday night , at 8:30 pm est , DirecTV fired their new gun .
One week before the Super Bowl , DirecTV launched a series of attacks against the hackers of their product .
DirecTV sent programmatic code in the stream , using their new dynamic code ally , that hunted down hacked smart cards and destroyed them .
The IRC DirecTV channels overflowed with thousands of people who had lost the ability to watch their stolen TV .
The hacking community by and large lost not only their ability to watch TV , but the cards themselves were likely permanently destroyed .
Some estimate that in one evening , 100,000 smart cards were destroyed , removing 98 % of the hacking communities ' ability to steal their signal .
To add a little pizzazz to the operation , DirecTV personally " signed " the anti-hacker attack .
The first 8 computer bytes of all hacked cards were rewritten to read " GAME OVER " .
Nobody knew how the satellite companies had suddenly developed such smarts .
Until now .
A recent Wired article exposes Christopher Tarnovsky as the mind behind the epic Black Sunday Hack .
Among the countermeasures he says he created was one known among pirates as the " Black Sunday " kill -- an elaborate scheme that destroyed tens of thousands of pirate DirecTV cards a week before Super Bowl Sunday in 2001 .
Instead of being delivered all at once like other measures , the Black Sunday attack code was sent to pirate cards in about five dozen parts over the course of two months , like a tank transported piece by piece to a battlefield to be assembled in the field .
" They never expected us to do this , " Tarnovsky says .
The kill did n't last long before pirates found a way to jump - start the cards .
But it holds an enduring position in pirate lore ; for the first time , they could see a cunning mind at work on the other side .
It 's fascinating to finally hear the Black Sunday kill described so intimately from the inside .
It 's a gripping tale of high stakes programming , a life of electronic warfare with millions of dollars at risk on both sides .
I 've never been a satellite television subscriber , but apparently the war rages on even today -- at least according to the Wikipedia entry on pirate decryption .
Douglas Adams und Infocom Florian Sander
Die Geschichte hinter dem nie veröffentlichten zweiten Anhalter - Spiel
In den 80er Jahren kamen zwei Legenden zusammen : Autor Douglas Adams und Spielefirma Infocom .
Das Textadventure zu „ Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis “ wurde zu einem riesigen Erfolg , doch die Fortsetzung schaffte es nie bis zur Veröffentlichung .
Anlässlich einiger 20 Jahre alten internen Infocom - E- Mails haben sich ehemalige Infocom - Angestellte und externe Mitarbeiter nun zu der Geschichte hinter „ Restaurant “ und seinem Vorgänger geäußert .
Kultautor Douglas Adams und die Textadventure - Pioniere von Infocom landeten mit dem ersten Spiel zu „ Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis “ einen Riesenerfolg .
Es wurde eines der bekanntesten Textadventures überhaupt und Interessierte können es noch heute online spielen .
( Außerdem war es auch eines der bösartigsten Spiele , da man relativ zu Beginn des Spiels etwas vergessen konnte , was einen endlose Stunden erfolgreichen Spielens später in eine rettungslose Sackgasse führte . )
Dank des umwerfenden Erfolges von „ Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy “ wurde schnell beschlossen noch eine Fortsetzung des Spiels zu veröffentlichen .
Doch die Fans warteten vergebens , die Arbeiten wurden nie fertig gestellt .
Jetzt , ca. 20 Jahre später , ist von dieser Geschichte nicht mehr viel übrig .
Douglas Adams ist tot , Infocom gibt es nicht mehr und auch das gesamte Genre der Textadventures ist ( fast ) untergegangen .
Doch ein kontroverser Blog - Artikel hat kürzlich wieder ein kleines Fenster in die Vergangenheit geöffnet .
Jemand hat „ die Infocom - Platte “ in die Finger bekommen - eine Festplatte voll mit internen Infocom - Daten und E - Mails , die irgendwie den Untergang und Ausverkauf von Infocom überstanden hat .
Andy Baio , Autor des besagten Artikels , hat sich durch die E - Mails gewühlt und einige davon veröffentlicht .
Sie zeichnen ein relativ zerstrittenes Bild von Infocom und involvierten Partnern – wahrscheinlich zu Unrecht .
Michael Bywater , ein externer Autor in dem Projekt , setzt die E - Mails etwas in Kontext :
“ Ich betone noch mal : Jeder war auf der gleichen Seite .
Das Geschrei , das Andy Baio – aus dem Zusammenhang gerissen - veröffentlicht hat , ist nicht mehr Geschrei , das man während eines Fußballspiels hören würde , wenn sich das Team darum streitet , wer wann wie wo spielen soll . “
Unabhängig vom Ursprungsartikel hat sich der Kommentarbereich als goldene Fundgrube erwiesen .
Zahlreiche ehemalige Infocom - Mitarbeiter und andere Involvierte haben sich zu Wort gemeldet .
Da sich auch zahllose Fans eingeklinkt haben und unglücklicherweise eine unnötige Schlammschlacht um die veröffentlichten E - Mails entstanden ist , kann man die Kommentare inzwischen leider kaum noch überblicken .
Am 25 .
April 2008 umfassten sie etwa 130 Seiten .
Daher hier eine Zusammenfassung , rekonstruiert aus dem Ursprungsartikel und zahllosen Kommentaren :
Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy – Teil 1
Der erste ( und schließlich einzige ) Teil des Anhalter - Spiels wurde von Douglas Adams zusammen mit dem Infocom - Programmierer Steve Meretzky geschrieben .
Dieser bekam einen erstklassigen Eindruck von Douglas Adams Talent , Arbeit auf die lange Bank zu schieben :
„ [ Douglas Adams ] erhob Verzögerung zur Kunstform .
Als wir an dem ersten Spiel arbeiteten , hatte er gerade BEGONNEN an „ Macht ’s gut , und danke für den Fisch “ zu arbeiten – und das ENDGÜLTIGE Manuskript war bereits ein Jahr überfällig . “
Diese Eigenart von Douglas Adams wird wohl auch in seiner Biographie ( geschrieben von M.J. Simpson ) deutlich .
Laut einem Kommentator wird darin unter anderem beschrieben , wie Douglas Adams von seinem Agenten in einem Hotelzimmer mehr oder weniger eingesperrt werden musste , um Verträge mit Verlagen zu erfüllen .
Auch bei dem Spiel Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy scheint Douglas Adams häufig durch Verschleppungen geglänzt zu haben , wie Steve Meretzky beschreibt :
„ Douglas verschleppte wie verrückt als er und ich das erste Spiel schrieben .
Der Unterschied [ zu späteren Projekten ] war , dass ich immer die anderen Versionen des Anhalters hatte , mit denen ich die Lücken füllen konnte , wenn Douglas es nicht tat .
( Außerdem war ich richtig gut darin , seinen Schreibstil zu imitieren .
[ In der Endphase ] meinte Douglas , dass er nicht mehr sagen könne , welche Teile er geschrieben hätte , und welche ich geschrieben hätte . ) “
So kam das erste Spiel doch noch zu einem überaus erfolgreichen Ende .
Zwischenspiel : Bureaucracy
Nach dem großen Erfolg des ersten
Teils war recht schnell klar , dass es eine Fortsetzung geben sollte .
Doch Douglas
Adams hatte erstmal genug von Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis und wollte sich lieber anderen Dingen widmen .
Infocom hätte die Fortsetzungen auch alleine machen können – der Vertrag erlaubte ihnen bis zu 6 Anhalter - Spiele mit oder ohne Douglas Adams zu produzieren – wollte aber lieber auf Douglas warten , wie es Steve Meretzky beschreibt :
„ Wir WOLLTEN , dass Douglas an dem Spiel mitarbeitet , weil es hatte einen großen PR - Wert das sagen zu können und Douglas bei den ganzen Interviews dabei haben zu können .
Und mit Douglas Mitarbeit würde es ein besseres Spiel werden .
Im ersten Teil waren alle möglichen großartigen Ideen , auf die ich niemals allein gekommen wäre : Ein Inventar - Objekt namens „ no tea “ ; eine Fehlermeldung des Spiels fällt durch ein Wurmloch und startet einen interstellaren Krieg ; und wie das Spiel einen anlügt .
Um nur ein paar zu nennen .
Restaurant wäre ohne Douglas Mitarbeit ein gutes Spiel geworden , aber nicht das bestmögliche Spiel . “
Mike Dornbrook , langjähriger Infocom - Mitarbeiter , ergänzt :
“ Wir mochten und respektierten [ Douglas Adams ] zu sehr um gegen seine Wünsche zu handeln , egal was der Vertrag erlaubte . [… ]
Obwohl er – wie er selbst zugab – der weltschlimmste Verzögerer war , fanden wir es hart zu erwägen , mit Restaurant fortzufahren , bevor er bereit war . “
Also stimmte Infocom zu , mit dem zweiten Anhalter - Spiel zu warten , bis ein anderes Spiel mit Douglas Adams fertig gestellt war : Bureaucracy .
Allerdings hatte wohl niemand geahnt , dass sich dieses über Jahre hinziehen würde .
„ Niemand kann je die Geschichte der niemals fertig gestellten Anhalter - Fortsetzung verstehen – und vor allem die verschiedenen Einstellungen der Programmierer bezüglich der Arbeit daran – ohne die Geschichte von Bureaucracy zu verstehen . “ ( Steve Meretzky )
Auch bei Bureaucracy gab es Schwierigkeiten mit Douglas Adams Neigung dazu , Dinge nicht plangemäß auf die Reihe zu bekommen .
Steve Meretzky fasst das ewige Projekt , das er auch als chinesische Wasserfolter bezeichnet , zusammen :
„ Während Douglas verzögerte kamen und gingen verschiedene Mitarbeiter – entweder weil sie des Wartens überdrüssig wurden und den Auftrag ( oder bei der Firma ) kündigten , oder weil sie anderen Projekten zugewiesen wurden , wo sie unmittelbarer nützlich sein konnten .
Zu den Programmierern , die über die Jahre hinweg Bureaucracy zugewiesen wurden , zählten Marc [ Blank ] , Tim [ Anderson ] , Jeff O’Neill , Jerry Wolper und wahrscheinlich zwei oder drei andere , die ich vergesse .
Das Spiel erschien schließlich 1987 , zwei Jahre nach dem geplanten Termin , und selbst das geschah nur , weil Michael Bywater einsprang und für den noch immer aufschiebenden Douglas aushalf . “
Da mehr als 10 Co-Autoren in Bureaucracy involviert waren , stand auf dem Cover schließlich „ Douglas Adams und die Mitarbeiter von Infocom “ .
Restaurant / Milliways / H2
Mit dieser Vorgeschichte war kaum ein Programmierer dazu zu gewinnen , die Realisierung der Fortsetzung des Anhalter - Spiels ( intern meist kurz Restaurant oder noch kürzer H2 genannt ) auf sich zu nehmen .
Jeder hatte Angst , wieder in einem ähnlichen Schlamassel wie Bureaucracy zu landen und sich mit ständig wechselnden Autoren herumschlagen zu müssen .
1987 wurde Michael Bywater angeheuert um die Geschichte zu schreiben .
So wirklich erfolgreich verlief dies jedoch nicht , wie er selbst beschreibt :
„ Es war Urlaubszeit und der Mann , mit dem ich zusammenarbeiten sollte , hatte einen lang - gebuchten Urlaub kurz nachdem ich eintraf .
Das ‚ Wunder ’ , das erwartet wurde sollte es denn ein Wunder geben , war , dass ich in einer sehr kurzen Zeit und ohne in irgendeiner Art Programmierer zu sein , ZIL sprechen können sollte .
Dies , wie man sich vorstellen kann , ist nicht passiert und wir haben keinen anderen Weg gefunden um das Problem zu lösen . “
Später wurde von der Geschäftsleitung überlegt , H2 von einer anderen Firma , aber unter dem Infocom - Banner entwickeln zu lassen : Magnetic Scrolls in England .
In den veröffentlichten E - Mails sehen die Infocom - Mitarbeiter das recht kritisch .
Sie befürchten einen Image - Verlust für Infocom und fehlende kreative Kontrolle .
Trotzdem hatten die beiden Firmen aber offensichtlich einen tiefen Respekt für einander .
David Lebling kommentiert beispielsweise :
„ [ Magnetic Scrolls ] waren großartige Leute , mit exzellenter Technologie und Ideen ; sie waren der Wettbewerber , vor dem wir den meisten Respekt hatten . “
Ähnlich sieht das Anita Sinclair , Mitgründerin von Magnetic Scrolls :
„ Wir haben Infocom wirklich wirklich wirklich gemocht .
Wir mochten sie als Menschen .
Wir mochten sie als Spieleentwickler .
Wir mochten sie als Ingenieure .
Wir wollten mit ihnen zusammenarbeiten , weil wir dachten , es würde Spaß machen .
Wir dachten sie würden genauso denken – und hatten nie einen Grund daran zu zweifeln . “
Infocom - intern fanden sich schließlich doch noch Freiwillige , nämlich Steve Meretzky und Dave Lebling , um Restaurant bei Infocom realisieren zu können .
Doch weder sie noch Magnetic Scrolls kamen schließlich dazu .
Die Geschichte von H2 endet mit der von Infocom – im Mai 1989 , als das Büro in Cambridge von Activision geschlossen und über die Hälfte der Mitarbeiter entlassen wurden .
Rückblickend sehen einige der ehemaligen Infocom - Mitarbeiter den Hauptgrund für den Untergang von H2 im der mangelnden Fähigkeit Infocoms , sinnvolle Teams zu bilden .
Tim Anderson , einer der Entwickler , fasst dies so zusammen :
„ Generell hat Infocom niemals Zusammenarbeit gemeistert , insbesondere mit externen Autoren . [ … ]
Es ist sehr schwer einen guten Programmierer zu finden , der auch ein guter fantasievoller Autor ist ( nicht böse gemeint , Jungs ) ; uns wäre es besser ergangen , wenn wir effektive Unterstützung für ein Modell gehabt hätten , in dem ein Game Designer Ideen , Text und Design entwickelt und die Programmierung von Leuten gehandhabt wird , die primär darin wirklich gut sind . “
David Lebling stimmt zu :
„ Tim trifft , wie so oft , den Nagel auf den Kopf : Infocom hat Zusammenarbeit niemals gemeistert . [ … ] unser Modell für Zusammenarbeit waren diese langen Nächte am MIT , als Zork zuerst geschrieben wurde , während Autor / Entwickler - Teams ein besseres Modell gewesen wären . “
Restaurant ist aber nicht nur diesem Problem zum Opfer gefallen .
Es war wohl die Kombination aus nicht gemeisterter Zusammenarbeit und Douglas Adams aufschiebendem Talent , die H2 so lange verzögerten , bis es Infocom letztlich nicht mehr gab und das Spiel so nie realisiert wurde .
„ Rückblickend hätten wir 1985 ohne Douglas mit der Fortsetzung beginnen sollen , anstatt abzuwarten und zu hoffen , er käme über seine „ Ich bin es leid an Anhalter - Zeug zu arbeiten “ - Periode hinweg . “ ( Steve Meretzky )
Mehr über Douglas Adams
Aus den Kommentaren kann man bereits erkennen , dass Douglas Adams Arbeitsmoral wohl nicht gerade hoch geschätzt wurde .
Mehr darüber dürfte auch in seiner Biographie zu finden sein .
Trotz dieser Probleme waren die meisten wohl doch froh , mit ihm zusammenarbeiten zu können .
Steve Meretzkys Kommentar , für wie wertvoll er Douglas Adams Beiträge gehalten hat , wurde oben bereits zitiert .
Auch Mike Dornbrook betont das gute Verhältnis noch einmal :
„ Ich denke alle , die ihn kannten , werden zustimmen : Mit Douglas verbrachte Zeit war denkwürdig .
Es machte Spaß mit ihm zusammen zu sein – er hatte eine weitreichende Neugierde , war ein fabelhafter Plauderer , ein großartiger Gastgeber , liebte gutes Essen und Wein ( wie viele von uns wurden von Douglas mit Chateau d'Yqem bekannt gemacht ? ) , und umgab sich mit einigen der interessantesten Menschen auf dem Planeten ( wo sonst hätte man Abendessen gehabt mit Terry Jones , Sir Clive Sinclair , Alan Kay , Chris Cerf , … ) . “
Vielleicht gehören also auch die Infocom - Entwickler und ihre Verbündeten zu den Menschen , die 25 .
Mai , dem alljährlichen Handtuch - Tag zum Gedenken an Douglas Adams , wieder mit einem Handtuch durch die Öffentlichkeit laufen … ( Florian Sander )
A Houston oil company has agreed to shut down its offshore oil production off Santa Barbara County decades early in exchange for approval this year to drill into untapped undersea reserves and cash in on the nation ’s record oil prices .
To sweeten the deal , Plains Exploration & Production Co. -- known as PXP -- also has agreed to donate about 200 acres of oceanview property along the sparsely populated Gaviota coast and an additional 3,700 acres in Santa Barbara ’s premier wine - growing region for public parkland .
It would withdraw a proposed housing development on that land and pay millions to fund projects that offset carbon dioxide emissions , such as low - emission public buses .
The unprecedented deal , announced Thursday by PXP and its fiercest environmental opponents , was designed to make a long - stalled drilling proposal more palatable to county and state officials in an area where a 1969 oil spill helped launch the modern environmental movement in California .
“ It ’s hard for me to imagine that they wo n’t approve this , ” said Linda Krop , chief counsel of the Santa Barbara - based Environmental Defense Center .
Negotiations among these adversaries , she said , resulted in more concessions from PXP than any state or local agency could ever muster .
Advertisement
Steve Rusch , a PXP vice president , said the company was willing to make concessions because it wanted to do more than simply neutralize offshore oil ’s traditional opponents -- it wanted to enlist their support .
Since the 1980s , most offshore oil development in California has been met with fierce opposition , including protracted litigation , congressional moratoriums and bureaucratic delays .
So beginning later this month , Krop and her clients will support PXP in its petition to use “ slant drilling ” from one of its four offshore platforms to tap into an undersea oil field , the Tranquillon Ridge , that could yield as much as 200 million barrels of oil and 50 billion cubic feet of natural gas .
It will be the first time in 39 years that one group , Get Oil Out , or GOO , has supported oil drilling .
The group was formed by Santa Barbara County residents horrified by the gooey crude that coated their beaches after the 1969 offshore platform blowout .
Abe Powell , president of GOO , said it took “ blood , sweat and tears ” for his board members to abandon their historic role .

“ Once we realized that we had put together a good deal for the community , we got it together , ” he said .
PXP wants to drill 22 wells using slant - drilling technology from platform Irene , which is 4.7 miles from shore , outside the three - mile limit of state waters .
These wells would burrow on average 3,000 to 5,000 feet into the seafloor and reach as far as five miles from the platform to tap the reserves beneath submerged state lands .
Existing pipelines from platform
Irene would transport the oil to processing facilities onshore , greatly reducing the risk of problems .
The agreement must win approval from county officials , the State Lands Commission , the California Coastal Commission and the federal Minerals Management Service , part of the Department of the Interior .
It ’s a deal Rusch hopes will fall quickly into place so the company can begin sinking wells before the end of the year .

“ There ’s an urgency to get on it as fast as possible , ” Rusch said , noting the surge in oil imports and the agreed - upon 14 - year deadline for abandoning PXP ’s operations .
In the highly speculative oil business , he said , PXP could drain this field in eight years or leave the oil in place .
Right now , he said , it ’s hard to tell .
“ We hope to get as much as we can out of it . ”
Light , sweet crude for May delivery fell 45 cents to $ 110.42 in electronic trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That ’s about four times the price of crude when Santa Barbara County rejected a similar drilling proposal from Nuevo Energy Co. in 2002 .
Environmental groups opposed the project , arguing that it would extend the life of offshore oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel , which are rarely disassembled .
Nuevo , like many oil companies , grew frustrated with its inability to develop offshore energy and sold platform Irene , its onshore oil processing facilities and its offshore lease to PXP in 2004 .
PXP had already acquired three other platforms off Point Arguello from Chevron and Texaco in 1999 .

When Rusch learned that the objections to slant drilling focused on extending the life of offshore platforms , he approached Krop with the idea of setting a deadline to pull out .
The sides spent months hammering out the details , including how to make such an agreement enforceable .
Under the terms , PXP would shut down its three platforms off Point Arguello by 2017 , as well as its Gaviota gas processing plant .
Five years later , platform Irene would also be closed , and removal would begin .
PXP has forged a separate agreement with the Trust for Public Land , a nonprofit land conservancy , that would help convert the donated acreage into parkland .
The trust has spent the last dozen years trying to preserve sections of the Gaviota coast , a 40 - mile stretch of pristine beaches , dramatic bluffs and terraced grasslands that marks the end of hundreds of miles of virtually uninterrupted sprawl extending from San Diego .
Under the agreement , PXP in the next two years would give the trust two large parcels , or about 148 acres , near Gaviota State Park .
Advertisement
It also would transfer to the trust about 1,000 acres north of Lompoc in La Purisima Hills and withdraw a proposal to develop a 1,100 - home subdivision there .
After wrapping up oil production off Point Arguello in 2017 , PXP would begin to restore an additional 56 acres on the Gaviota coast now used as a gas processing plant , and eventually turn that over to the trust .
It would also hand over 2,727 acres surrounding its oil production facilities near Lompoc after closing them in 2022 .
All told , the donated land would total 3,931 acres .

The industrial facilities , which can be seen on the drive up scenic U.S. 101 just before the highway veers inland , have long been an eyesore in an otherwise unobstructed coastal view , said Steve Dunn , president of the Citizens Planning Assn. of Santa Barbara .
“ The Gaviota facility was built in the early 20th century , ” he said .
“ Now we have an end date and plan to return it to a natural state .
The Lompoc facility has been a thorn in our side and we look forward to that facility ’s end date .
These are really big deals for us . ”
Debra Geiler , the trust ’s Southern California director , said the total value of the donated land could range from $ 50 million to more than $ 100 million .
More important , she said , the parcels are strategically located in a patchwork of private properties between public beaches and parks .
Advertisement
“ This is one of the West ’s most threatened landscapes , ” Geiler said .
“ It ’s a particularly important landscape because of the nature of the geography , ” a place where the coastline shifts direction to east - west and warm and cold ocean currents collide , helping create a climate that supports an unusual diversity of wildlife .
Rep. Lois Capps , a Democrat who represents Santa Barbara in Congress , praised the “ unique partnership ” that has taken steps toward “ ending a significant amount of oil and gas drilling along the Central Coast . ”
Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , a member of the State Land Commission , called it “ a very complex and far - reaching agreement that would end oil drilling off the north Santa Barbara coast . ”

A snake measuring over 1.83 m ( 6ft ) was today found curled up in a toilet bowl in a 10th floor flat , in northern Australia .
It is not known how long the black - headed python had been traveling through the sewage pipes before deciding to take a break in an apartment block in Darwin , Northern Territory .
Snake - catcher Chris Peberdy , who was called to rescue the reptile , told the Northern Territory News that it was likely to have been an escaped pet .
" When I saw it I was pretty shocked .
It 's one thing in the territory to have a green frog in the toilet , but not a six - foot python , '' he said .
" It would certainly scare you if it came up from the depths of the toilet . ''
Peberdy said the non-poisonous snake , which was " as thick as someone 's wrist " , could only have got into the room through the sewer pipes .
" I had to give him a good wash as he was wet and a bit smelly , '' said the snake expert .
Although the python was not poisonous , Peberdy warned the incident could have had an unhappy ending .
" This could have ended in disaster .
Someone could have had a heart attack if they came across it , or the snake could have been killed and chopped up into little pieces . ''
Susan LeFevre was a Michigan teenager when she was arrested in 1974 for selling relatively small amounts of heroin to an undercover officer .
At the request of her conservative family , she pleaded guilty and hoped for mercy , but was instead sentenced to 20 years in prison despite having no previous record .
With the help of family members , she bolted from prison in 1976 and fled to California , where she started a new life with a new identity .
Last week , thanks to an anonymous tip to the Michigan Department of Corrections , she was tracked down and arrested in San Diego , where she had lived a quiet upper middle - class life and raised three children with her husband of 23 years .
Now , Michigan wants her back to do the rest of her sentence .
The case of LeFevre , now known as Marie Walsh , is putting the issues of crime and punishment and redemption and forgiveness , not to mention harsh drug sentencing , in the national spotlight .
While the nation debates her fate , LeFevre sits in a California jail cell awaiting extradition to her home state .
" It 's been a secret no one knew for so long , and now everyone knows , " LeFevre told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday at Las Colinas Detention Facility in Santee , a San Diego suburb .
" I hope there 's some mercy . "
There sure was n't any mercy when she copped a plea in Michigan more than 30 years ago .
She plea bargained in a bid for a lenient sentence , or even probation .
Instead she was sentenced to the maximum 10 to 20 years .
" I kept thinking it had to be a mistake .
I was supposed to have probation , " LeFevre said .
And it does n't sound like Michigan is feeling any more forgiving now than it was back when Gerald Ford was president .
" Just because she escaped and evaded capture for 30 years does n't mean your prison sentence is negated , " said Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Russ Marlan .
She would have to do at least nine years to satisfy her sentence , he said .
That his wife has turned out to be a fugitive from justice means little to Alan Walsh , who never knew about LeFevre 's secret past .
" I 've known my wife , Marie , for 23 years , " he said in a statement .
" She is a person of the highest integrity and compassion .
During that time she 's been nothing but a caring and wonderful wife and mother .
She has raised three beautiful children and worked hard to build a good life for them , and has dedicated her life to their well - being .
Her family is now threatened to be destroyed . "
Barring a refusal by the state of California to extradite her back to Michigan , which is highly unlikely , LeFevre 's only hope would appear to be a commutation of her sentence .
Otherwise , she will become just one more drug war prisoner in Michigan 's prisons overflowing with drug war prisoners .

TB is not ' last century 's disease ' , the WHO warns
In a survey of over 90,000 TB patients in 81 countries , the WHO found that levels of multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) TB were far higher then expected .
The survey also found cases of extensively drug resistant TB which is virtually untreatable in 45 countries .
The findings have taken the organisation by surprise .
MDR - TB is resistant to at least the two most powerful anti-TB drugs , isoniazid and rifampicin .
As a result patients do not respond to the standard six month treatment and have to take more expensive - and more toxic - drugs for up to two years .
It is especially prevalent in the former Soviet Union : in Azerbaijan 's capital , Baku , almost a quarter of all new TB cases are multi-drug resistant .
Money ' well spent '
The new survey also reveals that the virtually untreatable form of TB is now present in dozens of countries .
MDR -TB AMONG TB CASES Baku , Azerbaijan : 22.3 % Moldova : 19.4 % Donetsk , Ukraine : 16 % Tomsk Oblast , Russia : 15 % Tashkent , Uzbekistan : 14.8 %
The figures may well be higher : many African states do not have the diagnostic tools to identify the disease , so the exact level of this often fatal form of TB remains unknown .
The WHO is calling for a major expansion in TB surveillance for treatment programmes for drug resistant tuberculosis to be scaled up .
The $ 5bn needed would be money well spent , says the WHO .
TB , it notes , is not " last century 's disease " .
There were nine million new cases in 2006 alone , of which 1.7 m died .
And neither is it confined to poor countries .
In parts of east London , rates of TB are higher then in some developing nations .
Dr Mario Raviglione , director of the WHO Stop TB Department , said : " TB drug resistance needs a frontal assault .
" If countries and the international community fail to address it aggressively now we will lose this battle .
" In addition to specifically confronting drug - resistant TB and saving lives , programmes worldwide must immediately improve their performance in diagnosing all TB cases rapidly and treating them until cured , which is the best way to prevent the development of drug resistance . "
The report also found a link between HIV infection and MDR - TB .
Surveys in Latvia and Ukraine found nearly twice the level of MDR - TB among TB patients living with HIV compared with patients without HIV .

Faltering British efforts to tackle Afghanistan 's poppy crop have found an unlikely ally – in the weather .
Freak weather linked to global warming is expected to reduce parts of the country 's opium harvest drastically .
Scientists believe freezing winter temperatures followed by late rains and a possible drought may cut this year 's yields , with some farmers losing half of their crop .
The fierce winter cold – which claimed hundreds of lives across Afghanistan – is thought to have stopped millions of poppy seeds from germinating .
Late rains have then stunted many of the plants that survived .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One expert said : " It was too cold in some areas for the seeds to come alive .
Between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the seeds may not have germinated . "
Survey teams are busy scouring the country 's poppy fields to get precise data on this season 's plants .
Privately , UN officials and European diplomats predict a drop in yields .
Poppies are more resistant to drought than food crops , but a nationwide water shortage at a key stage in the plants ' life cycle is expected to stunt the size of the opium bulbs .
Farmers harvest the sap from the bulbs .
" The more water , the more opium , " said the head of the UN environment programme , Asif Zaidi .
" This year was exceptionally cold , followed by low rainfall .
Some of the crop will be destroyed .
But what extent we do n't yet know . "
Poppy cultivation increased from just 8,000 hectares in 2001 , the last year of the Taliban regime , to a " frightening " 192,000 hectares last year , according to the UN , despite British - led efforts to crack down on the illicit crop .
Last year , Afghanistan produced a record 93 per cent of the world 's poppy harvest .
The industry is worth at least £ 2bn , almost half of Afghanistan 's GDP .
The poppy farmers worst affected are those who planted in November , after the cold spell set in .
That includes half of Helmand 's poppy farmers and a third of growers nationwide .
Afghanistan 's dry climate is especially susceptible to climate change , Mr Zaidi said .
" Minor climatic changes result in major impacts , " he added .
" There are definitely changes taking place in Afghanistan . "

Water creatures caught stealing DNA
Tiny freshwater organisms that have a sex - free lifestyle , may have survived so well because they steal genes from other creatures , US scientists report .
Researchers from the Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , have found genes from bacteria , fungi and even plants incorporated into the DNA of bdelloid rotifers - minuscule animals that appear to have given up sex 40 million years ago .
Their report appears in this week 's edition of Science .
Sex is used by most life forms as a way of coping with changing circumstances , by allowing organisms to develop useful new genes and ditch harmful , mutated ones .
The resilience of bdelloid and their sex - free lifestyle has stumped scientists .
The team , headed by Professor Matthew Meselson , looked at the DNA of bdelloid rotifers to see how they manage to survive and evolve .
It appears they overcome this hurdle by stealing DNA from our organisms .
" Our result shows that genes can enter the genomes of bdelloids in a manner fundamentally different from that which , in other animals , results from the mating of males and females , " says Meselson .
" We found many genes that appear to have originated in bacteria , fungi , and plants . "
Resilient creatures
The translucent , waterborne creatures , which range in size from 0.1 to 1 millimetres long , lay eggs , but all their offspring are female .
The researchers believe that when bdelloids dry out , they fracture their genetic material and rupture cellular membranes .
When they rehydrate , they rebuild their genomes and their membranes , incorporating shreds of genetic material from other bdelloids and unrelated species in their vicinity .
" These fascinating animals not only have relaxed the barriers to incorporation of foreign genetic material , but , more surprisingly , they even managed to keep some of these alien genes functional , " report co-author Dr Irina Arkhipova says .
According to the researchers , the next step is to determine whether bdelloid genomes also contain homologous genes imported from other bdelloids .
Meselson and his colleagues also hope to examine whether the animals actually use any of the hundreds of snippets of foreign DNA they appear to vacuum up .
Understanding how the animals acquire and make use of these new genes could have implications for medicine .
Genetic mutations , which occur constantly in any living organism , underlie cancer , heart disease and various other diseases .
Lane Kenworthy writes :
I ’m not sure why Broda and Romalis , or Levitt and Wilkinson , think this should alter our assessment of the trend in inequality .
Do they mean to suggest that the revealed preference of the poor for cheap goods is exogenous to their income ?
In other words , people with low incomes simply like buying inexpensive lower - quality goods , and they would continue to do so even if they had the same income as the rich .
Likewise , the rich simply have a taste for better - quality but pricier goods , and they would continue to purchase them even if they suddenly became income - poor .
If this is the assumption , I guess the conclusion follows .
But I ca n’t imagine the authors , or anyone else , really believe that .
Maybe I ’m missing something , but it seems as though Kenworthy ’s response might be based on some kind of conceptual misunderstanding .
I ’m not sure that this is it , but is the idea here that there is a single , standard , uniform price index , perhaps kept in a vault in Paris next to that famous platinum - iridium bar , the standard meter ?
But there is no standard index with which to determine the one true rate of inflation , or one true rate of change in real wages , because there is no one true standard consumption basket .
It seems that Kenworthy thinks there is something suspect about looking at the typical consumption basket of people at one part of the income distribution , looking at the typical consumption basket of people at another part of the income distribution , and then determining separately the change in rate of actually experienced inflation for people at those points in the distribution .
I do n’t see how this requires any weird assumptions about the exogeneity of preferences to income .
All it requires is that we take seriously what different kinds of people tend to buy .
Think about it this way .
Suppose you ’ve got a country with only poor people and a country with only rich people .
In each country , their version of the BLS creates something like the CPI .
We find that price inflation is lower in the poor country .
Then the rich country annexes the poor country .
Does calculating separate CPIs suddenly become a kind of mistake ?
As I noted in my first post on this paper , when I talked very , very briefly to Sachs about my paper on inequality , looking at the change in price of the typical consumption baskets of the rich and poor was the one thing he suggested one might try to do to get a better sense of what ’s happening in terms of the trend in real consumption inequality .
I said I did n’t have the technical wherewithal to do that .
But Broda and Romalis do .
I ’m not convinced that they or Sachs or Levitt is confused .

It was one of the defining moments in mankind ’s history – the sense of awe , hope , humility , and a basket of other indescribable emotions can still be felt through as one takes a walk back through the event transcript :
Then Armstrong said the famous words , “ Houston , Tranquility Base here .
The Eagle has landed . ”
Shortly after landing , before preparations began for the EVA , Aldrin broadcast that : “ This is the LM pilot .
I ’d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in , whoever and wherever they may be , to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way .
He then took Communion privately .
At 2:56 UTC on July 21 , Armstrong made his descent to the Moon ’s surface and spoke his famous line “ That ’s one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind ” exactly six and a half hours after landing .
Aldrin joined him , describing the view as “ Magnificent desolation . ”

Dianne ODell Dies in Iron Lung After Power Outage
Dianne ODell in iron lung
61 - year - oldfrom Jackson , TN , has died after a power failure in the city , about 80 miles northeast of Memphis .
ODell has been in an iron lung for nearly 60 years , after being diagnosed with polio as a child .
Family members tried to get the emergency generator working to the 7 - foot - long machine .
" We did everything we could do but we could n't keep her breathing , " said brother - in - law Will Beyer .
" Dianne had gotten a lot weaker over the past several months and she just did n't have the strength to keep going . "
Emergency crews were called to the scene , but were unable to help .
Though confined to the 750 - pound machine for most of her life , Dianne was able to get a high school diploma , take college courses and write a children 's book .
MARCH 26 -- Last week 's bombshell Los Angeles Times report claiming that the 1994 shooting of Tupac Shakur in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio was carried out by associates of Sean " Diddy " Combs and that the rap impresario knew of the plot beforehand was based largely on fabricated FBI reports , The Smoking Gun has learned .
The Times appears to have been hoaxed by an imprisoned con man and accomplished document forger , an audacious swindler who has created a fantasy world in which he managed hip - hop luminaries , conducted business with Combs , Shakur , Busta Rhymes , and The Notorious B.I.G. , and even served as Combs 's trusted emissary to Death Row Records boss Marion " Suge " Knight during the outset of hostilities in the bloody East Coast - West Coast rap feud .
The con man , James Sabatino , 31 , has long sought to insinuate himself , after the fact , in a series of important hip - hop events , from Shakur 's shooting to the murder of The Notorious B.I.G..
In fact , however , Sabatino was little more than a rap devotee , a wildly impulsive , overweight white kid from Florida whose own father once described him in a letter to a federal judge as " a disturbed young man who needed attention like a drug . "
Sabatino is pictured in the above mug shot .
The Times story , which was first posted online March 17 and then appeared in the newspaper itself last Wednesday , relied on " FBI records recently obtained by The Times " and interviews with several unnamed sources in its reexamination of the November 30 , 1994 shooting of Shakur at Quad Studios near Times Square .
Included in the paper 's online package was a PDF of two key FBI interview reports cited in the 2800 - word story , which was six months in the making and written by veteran reporter Chuck Philips , who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1999 for his coverage of corruption in the entertainment industry .
In addition to the documents posted on the Times site , a third purported FBI interview report was included by Sabatino in court papers he filed four months ago in U.S. District Court in Miami .
In that civil case , Sabatino is suing Combs for $ 16 million over an alleged soured business deal from nearly a decade ago .
According to Sabatino 's complaint , which he prepared and filed himself from the Allenwood federal penitentiary in White Deer , Pennsylvania , Combs stiffed him on a $ 175,000 payment for audio and video recordings Sabatino made in 1994 of The Notorious B.I.G. ( real name : Christopher Wallace ) .
But those FBI reports , dubbed " 302s " due to the numbered government form on which they are prepared , are nowhere to be found in the bureau 's computerized Automated Case Support database , TSG has learned .
The ACS system allows investigators to search various bureau indices to determine whether particular individuals , groups , or topics have been referred to in FBI " 302 " reports or various other bureau documents .
The suspect documents contain information supposedly provided to agents in the FBI 's New York office by an unnamed " confidential source . "
The records , which Sabatino himself has distributed , conveniently contain black redaction marks covering up the name of the agent ( or agents ) who prepared the " 302s " as well as the corresponding FBI case number .
However , since the documents are filled with the names of individuals and corporations , they can be tracked within the FBI system by working backwards ( by subjects as opposed to case number or agent name ) .
And while Sabatino claims to have been provided the FBI reports during the discovery phase of a 2002 criminal case , a federal law enforcement official involved in that successful prosecution told TSG that the probe was headed by Secret Service representatives and that the FBI had no role whatsoever in the case .
The official added that , at the time , investigators " had no inkling " of Sabatino 's supposed role in the rap music world and never saw investigative reports detailing his purported involvement with hip - hop 's leading figures or its assorted bloody disputes .
Additionally , an examination of the three documents revealed that the bodies of the respective " 302s " were actually created on a typewriter ( the " frame " of the reports is consistent with an authentic " 302 " template ) .
In some instances , you can see where one letter was typed on top of an existing character , a so - called overstrike .
In an interview , Bruce Mouw , a former FBI supervisor who headed the bureau 's pursuit of John Gotti , estimated that agents ceased using typewriters about 30 years ago .
Riddled with spelling and grammatical errors , the purported " 302 " documents vary sharply from standard FBI reports in terms of phraseology and use of certain acronyms , according to several law enforcement sources who examined the documents at TSG 's request .
For example , the reports contain the acronyms " TNU , " which apparently is short for " true name unknown , " and " NFI , " short for " no further information . "
Two ex-FBI agents said that they had never seen those acronyms in bureau reports .
Both men also alerted to how the reports were dated , with month , day , and year set off with periods , instead of the customary slashes .
Most telling , though , are the obvious similarities ( type size , font , line spacing , individual character renderings ) between the purported " 302s " and certain court filings created by Sabatino while he has been incarcerated at Allenwood ( he was transferred last May from a Florida prison to the high - security penitentiary in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains ) .
As with all other Bureau of Prisons ( BoP ) facilities , Allenwood provides inmates with access to photocopying machines , office supplies , and typewriters , according to the BoP 's 2008 Legal Resource Guide .
Inmates , the guide states , are " permitted a reasonable amount of time ... to conduct their own legal research and to prepare legal documents . "
A comparison of the " 302s " and Sabatino 's own court filings shows that the authors of each set of documents share remarkably similar spelling deficiencies .
For instance , the word " making " appears as " makeing " in both the " 302s " and Sabatino 's pro se court pleadings .
Similarly , the authors also have difficulty with the word " during . "
It appears as " durring " in both sets of documents .
While a federal judge once referred to Sabatino as " articulate " and " an extraordinarily intelligent man , " spelling and grammar are not strong suits for the ninth - grade dropout .
And typewriters , of course , do not offer spell check .
After a reporter provided Philips and Marc Duvoisin , the deputy managing editor who edited the Times story , an account of TSG 's findings , Duvoisin said that the newspaper would launch its own investigation to determine if the FBI documents cited in its story are real .
In response to a TSG interview request , Sabatino wrote a March 20 letter stating that " there is a lot of lies cirulating arround right now .
But this is all going to backfire on Puff .
I know him too well . "
As a result of the Times story , Sabatino wrote that he has been " receiving letters from all over the country .
Reporters and regular people alike . "
While he offered to call a reporter and talk " off - the - record , " Sabatino had not been heard from at press time .
The " 302s " in question also carry redaction marks on a " government exhibit " sticker seen in the upper right corner of the opening pages of the three FBI reports .
On the documents filed by Sabatino in his lawsuit against Combs , the number " 3500 " remains visible on the stickers , indicating that the material was turned over during the discovery phase of a criminal trial ( " 3500 " refers to the section of the United States Code which entitles a defendant to receive prosecution records that could be used to impeach a trial witness ) .
For some reason , when the Times posted the FBI reports on its web site , the paper itself covered up the " 3500 " reference on the documents .
The first mention of the existence of the purported " 302s " came in filings Sabatino made late last year in a civil lawsuit against Combs .
According to the convict , he received the explosive " 302s " during " discovery , trial , and other proceedings " in a federal fraud prosecution brought against him in New York in August 2002 .
That case , though , never went to trial .
Sabatino pleaded guilty to two felonies in August 2003 and was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison .
While he described the contents of four separate " 302s " in his court papers , Sabatino attached only two of those reports to a November court motion .
One of those documents was posted on the Times web site , along with another report that was referred to in Sabatino 's filings , but not included as an exhibit .
So , between Sabatino and the Times , three of the four purported FBI reports have been made public ( those documents can be found here , here , and here ) .
Details from the fourth supposed " 302 , " dated July 1 , 2002 , are included in recent Sabatino court filings .
Notably , the convicted felon publicly filed the two " confidential " FBI records as exhibits to a motion seeking a court order barring Combs from distributing the documents to journalists .
The bizarre motion surfaced six weeks after Sabatino filed his original October 4 complaint , which made no mention of " 302s , " Shakur , or any confidential FBI source .
But that document does contain some of Sabatino 's traditional flights from reality .
Along with claiming that he had been promised a " creative consultant " credit on Wallace 's posthumous album " Born Again , " Sabatino charged that Combs had delayed paying off his outstanding $ 175,000 debt because , in late - 1998 , " it was reported that the Los Angeles police had named [ Sabatino ] a ' person of interest ' in the murder of Christopher Wallace , " according to a December 6 court filing .
Of course , no news reports back this claim .
Sabatino then goes on to contend that this 1998 " theory " originates from an FBI " 302 " reporting that he was to meet Wallace on the night of his murder , " but never showed up . "
This purported " 302 , " which Sabatino supposedly got in discovery , is further described by Sabatino in a court complaint : " The report goes on to say that prior to Mr. Wallace 's murder [ Sabatino ] had contact with a ' close associate ' of Marion ' Suge ' Knight , a long time suspect in the murder of Mr. Wallace . "
This story , not surprisingly , has a couple of structural deficiencies :
While the Sabatino - clipped - B.I.G. claim supposedly surfaced in 1998 when he was named a " person of interest , " the " 302 " from which he says this " theory " originated would not be generated for another four years .
Sometimes , when you 're rewriting history on the fly , it 's hard to maintain temporal continuity .
And then there 's the small matter of Sabatino 's whereabouts on March 9 , 1997 , when Wallace was gunned down while seated in a GMC Suburban outside the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles .
While he enjoys repeating the " theory " that he mysteriously bailed on a planned meeting with the rapper that fateful night , Sabatino was actually 2400 miles away from the crime scene .
He was imprisoned in Miami's Federal Detention Center , where he still had six months to serve on a two - year sentence for separate felony convictions .
It is not Bureau of Prisons policy to allow cross-country furloughs .
Even to attend the Soul Train Music Awards .
In his lawsuit against Combs , Sabatino denied prior knowledge of the plot to ambush Shakur , but added that he " does not contest that he was present at Quad Studios " on the night of the shooting .
However , in the reams of copy about the 1994 attack , Sabatino 's name has never appeared anywhere .
The first time a publication linked him to the Shakur ambush came last week in the Times , thanks to one of the FBI " 302s " obtained by the country 's fourth - largest newspaper .
The New York Police Department probe of the Quad Studios incident was headed by Detective Joseph Babnik , who worked robbery cases out of the Midtown North precinct .
In an interview , Babnik , now retired , told TSG that Sabatino 's name " does not ring a bell " and that he could not recall anyone with that surname being connected to the Shakur case .
Asked if he would have recalled a rotund white teenager being present at Quad Studios that night , Babnik said yes , adding that the only white witnesses he recalled interviewing were employed in technical capacities at the recording studio .
Shakur , who never hesitated to point fingers at those he suspected of setting up the Quad Studios shooting , never once mentioned Sabatino 's supposed role in the attack .
In a three - page " 302 " dated December 30 , 2002 , the FBI 's supposed confidential source reported first meeting Shakur through Sabatino in late - 1993 .
Sabatino , born October 24 , 1976 , would have been 16 or 17 at the time of the Shakur introduction .
The source went on to report that in February 1994 , the 17 - year - old Sabatino was rebuffed by Shakur when the teenager spoke to the performer about a " business offer . "
In short order , Sabatino and an associate devised a plan to " set up " the disrespectful Shakur , whom they decided needed to be " dealt with . "
This scenario , though preposterous on its face , was unblinkingly reported by the Times , which cited the FBI " 302s " and sources who supported the account provided by the bureau 's unnamed confidential source .
And while the Times story noted that Sabatino " declined to comment , " there can be little doubt that he was one of the unnamed sources confirming details found in the " 302 " reports ( a nifty parlor trick by the maypole around which the Quad Studios story rotates ) .
But the most curious part of the Times story , however , involves the paper 's reporting that it had learned the identity of the confidential source quoted in the " 302s " and " verified that he was at the Quad on the night of the assault . "
The report continued , " When contacted , the man said the FBI records accurately convey what happened , and what he told investigators . "
The source , the Times added , spoke on the condition of anonymity .
The " 302 " purportedly describing the behind - the - scenes machinations leading up to Shakur 's assault also includes a narrative flourish that somehow escaped prior investigative or journalistic excavation .
As has been widely reported , after Shakur was shot in the lobby of the Seventh Avenue building , he stumbled into an elevator and headed upstairs .
When the elevator doors opened on a floor where members of the Combs entourage were milling about , a bleeding Shakur exited .
Sabatino , the FBI source claimed , responded by yelling , " Get that piece of shit out of here ! "
Though the agent who authored the report ( you know , the one whose name was conveniently redacted ) actually spelled the third word in that sentence " peice . "
Coincidentally , an examination of Sabatino 's court filings shows that he , too , has a pronounced difficulty spelling words with the i-e and e-i couplings .
He and the unnamed FBI agent apparently never memorized the old " i before e except after c " mnemonic device .
Court records show that the teenage Sabatino was living with his father in Boynton Beach , Florida around the time of the November 1994 Shakur shooting .
In fact , a 1999 profile ( " Con Kid " ) of Sabatino in Miami New Times opens with a scene from early - November 1994 in Florida .
Sabatino , then 18 , is masquerading as a Sony Music executive and palling around backstage with Julio Iglesias at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts .
Another " 302 , " which Sabatino included as a motion exhibit in his Combs lawsuit , quotes the FBI 's confidential source as saying that they met Combs through Sabatino in late - 1991 .
At the time , Sabatino would have been only 14 or 15 .
Amazingly , such precociousness on his part went unremarked upon ( or unnoticed ) by the entertainment press .
And to think , just years earlier , music journalists were falling all over themselves to chronicle how Rick Rubin , a relative graybeard at 21 , was co-founding Def Jam from his room at NYU 's Weinstein dormitory .
In fact , according to a suspect December 30 , 2002 FBI report , the confidential source said that Combs even enlisted Sabatino , 18 at the time , to serve as his envoy to " broker a ' peace agreement ' " between Combs 's firm , Bad Boy Entertainment , and Suge Knight 's Death Row Records .
Sabatino , apparently the James Baker of b-boys , was sent West because , the FBI source noted , Combs felt he " would hold a little influence over Knight due to Sabatino 's father , Peter Sabatino , a/k / a Fat Pete , a member of the Colombo crime family and his relationship with a individual in Las Vegas ( NFI ) . "
After meeting with Knight in California , Sabatino reportedly told the source that the " situation " was resolved , apparently due to the teenager 's efforts .
But when problems resurfaced later , " the source stated that Sabatino told him that it was all Combs fault and that Combs did not do what he said he would . "
Here , the negligent FBI agent authoring the report made the mistake of identifying the confidential source 's gender through the careless use of the pronoun " him , " thus narrowing the field of informant possibilities by half .
As for the claim that Sabatino 's father was ( or is ) a gangster , that is directly contradicted by NYPD and FBI lists of Colombo family members , other FBI documents obtained by TSG , and law enforcement personnel interviewed for this story .
The elder Sabatino has worked as the manager of a Florida restaurant .
It was his son who gave him his button .
[ Since the early - 90s , a series of high - ranking Colombo crime family members and associates have defected and began cooperating with federal agents .
TSG has in excess of 750 pages of FBI reports of its debriefings with nine of these turncoats .
Nowhere in these documents is Sabatino or his father mentioned .
A typical report -- yes , on an authentic " 302 " with a government exhibit sticker -- can be found here .
It records an interview with former consigliere Carmine Sessa , who identifies all the family 's captains and the soldiers in their respective crews . ]
In November 2003 , when Sabatino appeared for sentencing in federal court in White Plains , N.Y. , his attorney , Mary Anne Wirth , stressed to Judge Charles Brieant that reports that the Sabatinos were somehow tied to organized crime were " utterly untrue . "
James , the lawyer added , went to great lengths to dispel this wiseguy myth for his probation officer .
While hip - hop chroniclers have never recorded Sabatino 's 1995 shuttle diplomacy on Combs 's behalf , The New York Times Magazine did report in January 1996 that Combs sent Mustafa Farrakhan to speak with Knight ( who refused to meet with the Bad Boy agent ) .
Perhaps Death Row 's boss just preferred negotiating with a 5 ' 5 " , 220 - pound Italian - American kid rather than Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan 's son .
In court papers , Sabatino has claimed that he originally shared the FBI " 302s " with Combs after receiving them during discovery , but extracted a promise that the documents would not be distributed further .
He gave Combs the records , Sabatino explained , because the FBI 's confidential source provided agents with details about the music industry power and Bad Boy Entertainment .
This was a particularly magnanimous gesture on the imprisoned Sabatino 's part since his own lawsuit claims that Combs has owed him $ 175,000 since 1998 .
But instead of keeping the " 302s " under wraps , Sabatino charged , Combs recently provided them to a " so called ' investigative reporter ' " and a businessman with whom Sabatino was negotiating a lucrative deal .
According to Sabatino 's curious reasoning , Combs gave the FBI documents to the journalist ( presumably Philips ) in a bid to focus the reporter 's attention away from him and onto Sabatino when it came to exposing criminal conduct on the pair 's part .
And Combs supposedly delivered the documents to the businessman to torpedo Sabatino 's pending $ 100,000 consulting contract .
The Times reported that Sabatino told Combs and Wallace beforehand about the plot to ambush Shakur at Quad Studios , and that talent manager Jimmy Rosemond , working with Sabatino , was an architect of the assault .
Shakur was shot several times during the 1994 attack and was robbed of his jewelry , which reportedly included a $ 40,000 gold medallion .
After the Times story was published , Combs and Rosemond issued statements attacking the paper 's reporting and vehemently denied orchestrating the attack on Shakur or knowing about it ahead of time .
It appears that the real purpose of the suspect " 302s " is to portray Sabatino as a feared hip - hop figure who muscled and conned rappers into deals .
The entertainers were drawn to him " because he is a member of La Cosa Nostra " and such Mafia ties were " glamorized in the Hip Hop world , " reported the confidential source .
The documents Sabatino supposedly did not want disseminated -- but which he himself filed publicly -- conferred upon him the kind of rap world status that he has long coveted .
Sabatino has frequently claimed to have managed a number of leading hip - hop acts , including Notorious B.I.G. , Lords of the Underground , and Heavy D and the Boyz .
Du Kelly , a member of Lords of the Underground , described Sabatino as a " scam artist " who briefly tried to befriend the group 's manager .
Kelly said that he recalled Sabatino as a " short , Caucasian , little chubby fat guy " whose " father was supposed to be Mafia or something . "
Sabatino was " just a con artist who tried to get close to artists , but he was a nobody , " said Kelly .
He added that Sabatino also tried to get near the Wu - Tang Clan , " but I heard they beat him up . "
Sabatino 's convoluted and bizarre motion to gag Combs , of course , was immediately denied .
Judge Stephen T. Brown ruled that the federal inmate 's request was moot since the " allegedly confidential documents ... are attached to this motion as exhibits . "
While the prodigious jailhouse litigant surely expected this defeat , he succeeded in drawing attention to the Combs lawsuit , the " 302s , " and , of course , himself .
But unlike Sabatino's own prior outlandish and unsupported claims about his entertainment industry resume ( he once said he regularly consulted with music industry legend Clive Davis and even co-produced Combs 's 1997 album " No Way Out " ) , the information about him in the " 302s " came with the shiny imprimatur of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its valuable confidential source , who , the documents noted , " is in a position to testify . "
And now The Los Angeles Times has added to the myth , describing " promoter James Sabatino " as a Tupac Shakur antagonist who toured with The Notorious B.I.G. and " became a fixture in Combs 's circle ... helping him stage lavish parties and land corporate sponsorships . "
*****
While Sabatino's " 302 " gambit might seem inexplicable , especially for someone already in prison ( he has a November 2012 release date ) , it appears fairly typical for a man who has spent most of his adult life behind bars and appears to have little impulse control .
His adult rap sheet includes more that a dozen convictions , beginning with a 1994 credit card collar in Virginia when he was 17 .
Back then , Sabatino was arrested for using an American Express card issued to Coca - Cola .
He quickly became adept at assuming the identities of others as he swindled all kinds of goods from marks he either sweet - talked or duped with forged documents .
And he was frequently arrested .
Alternately posing as an executive with companies like Blockbuster , Paramount Pictures , Sony Music , Warner Bros. , Viacom , and the Miami Dolphins , Sabatino conned dozens of firms out of an assortment of merchandise , including computers , pagers , phones , hotel accommodations , limousine rides , and even 262 tickets to the January 1995 Super Bowl .
He regularly passed bad checks and skipped out on bills .
The football ticket theft prompted one police official to remark , " This kid is a scammer .
He is a smooth talker and can talk you out of your clothes before you even realize it . "
In an October 2003 letter to a federal judge preparing to sentence his son on fraud and identity theft counts , Peter Sabatino recalled that James was a successful child model whose mother , an unknown B - movie actress , " projected all of her dreams of fame and fortune onto her son . "
When James was 11 , Peter wrote , the boy 's mother left home , never to come back .
" Shortly thereafter , I received a call from James ' teacher that James had told her his mother had died in a car accident .
Obviously this was n't true but was his way of resolving the matter in his head and his heart . "
From that point , James 's behavior spiraled out of control and he was " expelled from twelve different schools , parochial , private and finally public . "
At one point he even spent 30 days in a psychiatric facility .
The only thing that calmed James , his father wrote , was long hours in front of the television , where the boy would " anxiously wait for the credits and write down the names of producers , directors and others that he felt were influential in the production .
He then began to assume what he perceived was the persona of these individuals . "
Soon , James realized that , " by calling restaurants , hotels , theatres , and other businesses using their names he could go anywhere he desired , " Peter stated .
" However , these situations usually ended with me receiving a call to go to wherever he was and pay whatever bill he had run up or they would have him arrested .
Like any loving father , I would come to his rescue .
Eventually , the calls stopped . "
In late - 1997 , after finishing a two - year state sentence in Florida , Sabatino was arrested in New York City for defrauding the Marriott Marquis hotel .
While on bail , he traveled to London and got arrested again , this time for ripping off the Four Seasons hotel .
Sabatino , then 22 , had been a free man for all of four months when he was jailed in a Brixton prison .
He has been in custody ever since .
Apparently believing that he could not last six months in the harsh English prison , Sabatino hatched a plot to speed his return to America .
From a prison phone , he began calling the U.S. to make death threats against President Bill Clinton and various federal prosecutors , judges , and agents .
He even threatened to blow up the federal courthouse in Ft. Lauderdale .
The harebrained scheme , of course , backfired .
After serving his entire Brixton prison term , Sabatino was arrested for the various phone threats .
He was returned to Florida , where he immediately assaulted a federal prison guard and , as a result , was hit with a new felony indictment .
Sabatino would subsequently receive a 51 - month prison sentence covering those two cases .
Internal BoP records show that Sabatino has been a remarkably unruly inmate , having been disciplined on about 30 occasions through May 2007 .
He has often been punished for refusing to obey orders , interfering with security devices , threatening bodily harm , assault , and weapons possession .
During one fight , Sabatino stabbed another inmate with a sharpened piece of metal .
The dispute , the victim told authorities , occurred when Sabatino refused to pay off a winning numbers ticket .
In August 2002 , with Sabatino months away from being freed , Secret Service agents raided his cell at the Westchester County jail in Valhalla , N.Y..
Investigators carted away evidence showing that he had spent the prior six months using jail phones to defraud Nextel out of more than 1000 cell phones .
Sabatino worked with a raggedy group of accomplices -- most of whom he never met-- and defrauded firms of upwards of $ 1 million .
According to investigators , Sabatino , posing as different entertainment executives , called around the country and arranged to have large cell phone shipments delivered to his footmen .
His cut was less than $ 8000 , which was placed into his commissary account by a stripper / coconspirator named Marcy who visited him in jail and claimed to be his wife .
On his cell walls Sabatino kept photos of his criminal cohorts and their children .
Stacked elsewhere in the cell were his collections of Playboy and Maxim , assorted legal filings ( for both his cases and matters for which he was not a party ) , forged memos on the letterhead of businesses ensnared in his phone scam , and a signed , but otherwise blank , federal court subpoena .
Sabatino pleaded guilty in August 2003 to felony fraud and identity theft charges .
Addressing the court before his sentencing , Sabatino apologized for the illegal scheme and said , " I know this may sound strange , but there is a part of me that just does these type of things and I can't control it .
It 's like a fight within myself sometime ... I have been battling this demon for a very long time . "
He added , " I really had only one motivation for this crime , to make attention to myself and to make other people happy and for me to be the cause of that happiness . "
Presciently , Judge Brieant then remarked that Sabatino was an adult who " seems to have acted ... out of a need for attention . "
He added , " I have real concern about whether this need for attention will ever go away and therefore the impulse to commit these sorts of crimes . "
*****
As Sabatino has recently sought to place himself in the limelight via his tall rap tales , he appears to be receiving assistance from beyond Allenwood 's walls .
When he filed his legal action against Combs , an Associated Press report identified one " Renee Morrison " as the spokesperson for Sabatino 's " Florida - based company , Sound Storm Entertainment . "
According to a January letter from an Allenwood unit manager , Sabatino regularly gets in excess of $ 2000 deposited into his commissary account , a " sizable amount " for a federal inmate .
But despite being flush , he files grievances when BoP officials seek to increase the $ 25 monthly he must pay toward financial penalties levied from his most recent conviction .
Last year , he even launched a MySpace page , which is apparently run by " Rene Morrison , " who responded to an e-mail sent last week by a TSG reporter .
On his page , Sabatino writes about a new female singer , Timarie , for whom he is trying to secure a " leading major recording deal . "
He also provides some fantastical new biographical details , including the claim that he worked as a " rodie " on a New Kids on the Block world tour ( he would have been about 15 ) .
Oh , and he " befriended Mark Wahlberg and went on to help cultivate his rap career . "
And just in case his lawsuit against Combs , the phony FBI " 302s , " or last week 's Los Angeles Times story left any doubt , Sabatino is once again looking for a little attention .
The headline on his MySpace page makes that clear :
" Back In Action , " it announces .
Earth Impacts Linked to Human - Caused Climate Change
Leslie McCarthy
NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , N.Y .
A new NASA - led study shows that human - caused climate change has impacted a wide range of Earth 's natural systems , from permafrost thawing to plants blooming earlier across Europe to lakes declining in productivity in Africa .
Cynthia Rosenzweig of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Science in New York and scientists at 10 other institutions have linked physical and biological impacts since 1970 with rises in temperatures during that period .
The study , published May 15 in the journal Nature , concludes that human - caused warming is resulting in a broad range of impacts across the globe .
" This is the first study to link global temperature data sets , climate model results , and observed changes in a broad range of physical and biological systems to show the link between humans , climate , and impacts , " said Rosenzweig , lead author of the study .
Rosenzweig and colleagues also found that the link between human - caused climate change and observed impacts on Earth holds true at the scale of individual continents , particularly in North America , Europe , and Asia .
To arrive at the link , the authors built and analyzed a database of more than 29,000 data series pertaining to observed impacts on Earth 's natural systems , collected from about 80 studies each with at least 20 years of records between 1970 and 2004 .
Observed impacts included changes to physical systems , such as glaciers shrinking , permafrost melting , and lakes and rivers warming .
Impacts also included changes to biological systems , such as leaves unfolding and flowers blooming earlier in the spring , birds arriving earlier during migration periods , and ranges of plant and animal species moving toward the poles and higher in elevation .
In aquatic environments such as oceans , lakes , and rivers , plankton and fish are shifting from cold - adapted to warm - adapted communities .
The team conducted a " joint attribution " study in which they showed , first , that at the global scale , about 90 percent of observed changes in diverse physical and biological systems are consistent with warming .
Other driving forces , such as land use change from forest to agriculture , were ruled out as having significant influence on the observed impacts .
Next , the scientists conducted statistical tests and found that the spatial patterns of observed impacts closely match temperature trends across the globe , to a degree beyond what can be attributed to natural variability .
So , the team concluded that observed global - scale impacts are very likely due to human - caused warming .
" Humans are influencing climate through increasing greenhouse gas emissions and the warming is causing impacts on physical and biological systems that are now attributable at the global scale and in North America , Europe , and Asia , " said Rosenzweig .
On other continents , including Africa , South America , and Australia , documentation of observed changes in physical and biological systems is still sparse despite warming trends attributable to human causes .
The authors concluded that environmental systems on these continents need additional research , especially in tropical and subtropical areas where there is a lack of impact data and published studies .

FORT MYERS , Fla . --
Curt Schilling 's doctor insists the only way the 20 - year veteran can pitch again is through surgery on a torn shoulder tendon that resembles strands of pasta .
Boston 's team physician disagrees .
He believes the tendon is damaged , not torn , and rehabilitation gives Schilling the best chance to play this year .
" The problem has probably been building up for two years , and he just went over the red line , " Schilling 's physician , Dr. Craig Morgan , said Friday .
" Instead of being a single tendon , it 's like three pieces of spaghetti or linguine , and when that happens it 's end - stage disease in the tendon . "
A third doctor , New York Mets medical director David Altchek , agreed that the tendon was torn but said surgery would probably sideline him for the season , Morgan said .
Schilling , concerned that the Red Sox would invalidate his $ 8 million , one - year contract if he chose surgery , then agreed to rehab .
" On our conference call on Wednesday it was their strong recommendation that he go with the conservative approach , " Morgan said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Friday .
" And , furthermore , it was their strong -- how do I say this ?
-- they would not approve him having surgery , " Morgan said .
" Basically , according to the collective bargaining agreement , if they do n't approve it , they do n't have to pay him .
His contract 's null and void . "
The team declined comment Friday .
Schilling spent seven weeks on the disabled list last year with tendinitis in the shoulder .
But he passed the physical exam for the contract he agreed to on Nov. 6 .
Then , the shoulder deteriorated .
Click to viewAfter the Guardian did their own investigation into the Mac clone maker Psystar yesterday , we decided to take it a step further and see if they actually exist , in the physical sense .
How could a company so brazenly challenge Apple and have little to no record of actually being a company ?
We sent the Gizmodo army down there to get pictures of both their supposed addresses , and found that they 're as much vaporware as the Phantom Console of yore .
Read on for the details and location pictures .

First , let 's revisit what we already know .
Not only does the Miami Chamber of Commerce and BBB not know anything about any company named Psystar ( confirmed by reader Travis through his contacts in the chamber ) , the actual physical address they listed on their website actually changed halfway through the day yesterday .
What 's going on here ?
Did they all of a sudden move from a home business into a new office space ?
Nope .
Here 's the deal .
Advertisement
Reader Michael went down to their first location , address courtesy of the Guardian 's quick fingers , and saw that it was indeed a residential address .
It 's a one story house with a truck and sedan out front .
Not a business , but still holds the possibility of being a small home business .
Still , unlikely .
Why would they change their address ?
Perhaps they saw all the reaction they were getting about their Open Mac products and wanted a bigger space ?

Nope .
Reader Kahri visited their second location and saw no Psystar , but a packing supply company called " USA KOEN PACK . "
Was Psystar leasing the place ?
No .
He spoke with the manager , and they 've never heard of Psystar , and USA KOEN PACK has been at that location for the last two years .
KOEN PACK actually takes up from 10481 to 10490 , so there 's no chance of it being a mistaken address .
Update : Looks like Psystar 's changed their address once again to 10471 .

Now that we know their storefront is n't actually there , how about their online presence ?
As other readers pointed out when they tried to purchase an Open Mac for themselves , at no point was the credit card transaction secure .
Today , when you visit their store page , you get this :
Thank you for visiting Psystar .
We 're sorry but the store is temporarily down due to the fact that we are currently unable to process any credit card transactions .
Please send an e-mail to support@psystar.com with the subject line " UPDATE " so that we can update you when the store comes back online .
For customers who have already placed orders : if you received a confirmation e-mail then your item is in queue to be built and shipped .

Here 's our recommendation .
Do n't buy anything from Psystar now until we can clear this up .
We 've contacted them for more information and a review unit too see if everything they 're claiming is real .
So far , no response .
We 'll keep at it , but for now if you 're looking to get a Mac clone , you 're better off building it yourself .

Thanks to Kahri , Mike and Travis !
Update : Reader Robert did some more digging in the Florida Corporate filing office , and it seems that Psystar 's principles are Rodolfo and Roberto Pedraza , who are officers or agents on a whole crapload of companies .
Only one of these companies besides Psystar is currently active : Floridatek .
As Robert says , " These guys are obviously clowns . "
Advertisement
Update 2 : Someone just brought up the point that he could actually work at USA KOEN PACK and is just using his workplace as an address .
Interesting possibility , but somewhat unlikely .
Advertisement
Update 3 : Ha !
It looks like Psystar changed their address again .
Here are their first two : image .
Their third one is below .
Advertisement
Update 4 : They 've changed the address for a third time !
Thanks Wild Homes .
Advertisement
Update 5 : Reader Joe poked around the FloridaTek site and it seems that a bunch of links are just links to an automatic download of an executable file .
Phishing ?
Watch out .
Advertisement
Update 6 : Tom's Hardware talked to Pedraza and got a couple quotes from him .
You should hop over to see more , but they do admit that their address on the site was incorrect and they 'll correct it to the right one .
What we do n't get is why it would be incorrect 3 times in a row .
Until things clear up , our recommendation still stands .
Do n't buy anything from Psystar .
( We attempted to contact the company and have received no response to any of these allegations . )
Update 7 : They 've got a new note up now on their site explaining the reason for all the address changes .
It does n't explain why they went from their home address to 10481 , to 10471 , then finally to 10475 .
Our guy Kahri went to scope out 10471 yesterday and did n't find anything tying that address to KOEN , but did see a sign for Logistic Solutions .
Unfortunately Logistic Solutions is n't one of the registered companies these guys belong to .
Not much we can tell from this .
Kahri says :
Hey folks , I went back yesterday to check their new address 10471 ( today it 's 10475 ) .
Really whether it 's 10471 , 10481 or 10475 , it does n't mean anything because it's all the same big warehouse building which covers the block between 104th and 105th .
Advertisement
Update 8 : Reader Greg dug up this find on their current address , 10475 NW 28th Street , which was once for sale for $ 5,990,000 .
If this really is them , then they 're occupying a $ 6 million building .
Advertisement
Update 9 : Another reader went to visit 10481 , the first address listed , and found that KOEN PACK actually is n't the company there ( it 's to the left of it ) .
10481 belongs to a company called cotton images .
What 's interesting about this is that the cotton images guy actually KNOWS Rudy Peraza , and Rudy worked for them in the past .
This explains WHY Psystar used the 10481 address first ( because he worked there ) , and why he had to change the address so suddenly .
Are they really renting out 10475 , the current address ?
It 's hard to say .
ZDNet seems to have some clear pictures of that unit , but our reader below went to 10871 to scope it out .
Advertisement
I went to the 10481 address on April 16 .
Koen Pack is not at that
address , it is to the left of it .
I went inside the 10481 address and
spoke with employees of cottonimages.com
I spoke with the first employee I encountered .
I pointed out on her
browser that Psystar was listing the 10481 address on Psystar 's page
and that other people like me were sure to follow - since Psystar had
earned international press .
She seemed surprised and brought me to
" Scott " , who told me his wife owns the cottonimages.com business .
When I mentioned Rudy Peraza was listed as the Psystar owner , he told
me that Rudy used to work for him and he had nothing but praise for him
but with that name he could make a phone call .
He promptly got on the
cell phone and called someone .
When he was done on the phone , he told me that Rudy had definitely
listed the wrong address but that he had been informed by Rudy that
Rudy was going to rent the space immediately next door .
We both walked
over to 10871 next door .
We found the place closed but it was clearly
being renovated for a new tenant .
Scott seemed genuine and surprised ( annoyed ? ) to find his address
listed as Psystar's .
I suspect that is the reason Psystar 's address
changed yet again the following day .
When I asked Scott if I could give him my number to pass on to Rudy , I
was told that he could n't do that .
He said Rudy is apparently
overwhelmed by the attention and demand .
I can't fault Scott , he
does n't need additional headaches .
While I can cut a small business owner some slack , and understand what
happens when demand explodes , I 'm disappointed .
I had intented to go
their address and expected to find a small store with products to sell .
I thought I would confirm them using the well known Antec P180 case ,
and look and see what motherboard they were using .
I did not find any
of that .
Mostly , what Psystar 's owner needs to do now is make a public
statement .
In fact , a lot of them , including an interview .
He should
address the fundamental questions surrounding his business .
Miami
Herald , where are you ?
Lacking that and further transparency , this one potential customer will
stay away until I get the same level of transparency I get from any
other business I deal with .

Update 10 : Our scout Kahri says that he 's going to scout out 10475 and see if there 's any existence of Psystar being there .
He says that it 's possible Psystar has just acquired that side of the building , but has n't put up signage yet .
Check back later for pictures and info .
Update 11 : This does n't really serve any use except for curiosity 's sake , but here 's Psystar 's weblog stats .
Thanks tipster !

Update 12 : It seems like credit cards are starting to get billed ?
Reader Yariv sends in this super weird credit card statement of tons of $ 9.99 charges that supposedly add up to $ 399 .
We 're not sure about this one .
There 's nothing there that ties these charges to Psystar .
Has anyone else purchased a machine and gotten billed for it ?
Let us know .
My email 's on the left side of the page .
Hopefully we can either confirm or smash whether cards are being charged yet .
See Update 14 .

Update 13 : This is a big find .
Kahri just went down to Psystar and took this shot of their window .
This is the first indication that Psystar actually exists at that location .
Amazing !

Update 14 : Reader Derek says he did n't have any strange anomalies with his order , and was billed for the exact amount listed .
He also received a call from a 305 number ( Miami ) , that asked him if he wanted to purchase a separate OS because he ordered his machine without one .
Anyone else receive their shipping notification yet ?
Email me if you have .
Update 15 : Here 's Psystar 's official picture of their logo on the door .
Looks good !
But not open to the public .
Pickens expects the price of oil to continue rising .
" Eighty - five million barrels of oil a day is all the world can produce , and the demand is 87 million , " he said .
" It 's just that simple .
It does n't have anything to do with the value of the dollar . "
He expects the price of a barrel of oil to reach $ 150 this year , and he insists speculation has nothing to do with it .
Buying oil is draining an enormous amount of money from the United States , he says .
" We are now paying out ... an estimated $ 600 billion a year for oil , " he said .
" It 's four times the cost of the Iraqi war , and not one of the politicians running for president has anything to say about it .
I do n't know whether they do n't know it , or they do n't want to mention it . "
The Chinese government has cracked down on international media coverage of the unrest in Tibet , blocking websites and censoring the local feeds of broadcasters including BBC World and CNN .
China 's internet clampdown came over the weekend , following the outbreak of widespread unrest and violence in Tibet last week , and has hit websites including Yahoo , YouTube and Guardian.co.uk .
According to three separate reports posted on Danwei - a website specialising in the Chinese media and advertising industry - the Guardian website has been blocked , with Chinese users receiving a " connection reset " error .
YouTube and Yahoo have also been affected , Danwei has reported .
One Chinese technology blogger told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the Chinese authorities ' web censorship filtering system blocked access to particular stories .
" I am sure it is not a complete block , as the internet censorship system in China is based on a keyword filtering mechanism , " he said .
He said that web users in China would have problems accessing almost all news websites reporting on Tibet if the stories contained keywords such as " Tibet " , " violence " , " riot " and " Lhasa " .
Reports have emerged of access issues on a wide range of foreign sites .
" Different users will see different results as the filtering system does n't always detect each web page , so users may be seeing different things depending on their location , the time and the frequency they access sensitive content , " the blogger said .
A spokeswoman for BBC World said that its news coverage had been " periodically blacked out " when coverage relating to Tibet was aired .
A CNN spokeswoman also confirmed that its coverage of China had been the subject of censorship .
A blog posted by Jaime FlorCruz , the CNN Beijing bureau chief , indicates that CNN has been affected since Friday .
FlorCruz 's post added that a local media blackout has meant that only a Chinese blog and a local version of Twitter that " collected and disseminated reports from citizen reporters " in Tibet were the only online news sources accessible within the country .
The BBC and CNN are only broadcast within international hotels and diplomatic compounds in China .
A spokeswoman for BBC news online pointed out that access to the corporation 's website has already been restricted for quite some time within China .
" We understand there are reports of users being unable to access
YouTube within the People 's Republic of China , " said a spokesman for YouTube .
" We are looking into the matter , and working to ensure that the service is restored as soon as possible . "

( CNN ) --
After nearly four years of hoping , waiting and praying , an Ohio family learned Sunday their missing son died in Iraq .
A 2004 memorial at Glen Este High School in Ohio in honor of Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin .
" It hurts -- it really hurts .
You go through four years of hope , " said Carolyn Maupin , whose son , Staff Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin , was captured by insurgents in April 2004 .
" It 's like a letdown to me .
I 'm trying to get through that right now . "
His father , Keith Maupin , said military officials informed the family Sunday afternoon that the remains of the 24 - year - old Army reservist had been identified .
" Every parent knows the possibility exists that they may have to face the death of their child when they volunteer to go to war , " he said .
" However , those who are fortunate make peace with that and support their soldier , because they enlisted at their own free will . "
A Defense Department official also confirmed the identification , saying Maupin 's remains were found last week but DNA results just came in .
Coalition forces found the remains after a local Iraqi tipped them off , military officials said .
Maupin , who was 20 at the time of his capture , and another soldier , Sgt. Elmer Krause , 40 , were captured by insurgents April 9 , 2004 , after their convoy came under attack near Baghdad International Airport .
A week later , Maupin was shown on a videotape , surrounded by several armed masked men .
" My name is Keith Matthew Maupin , " he stated in the video .
" I am a soldier from the First Division .
I am married with a 10 - month - old child .
I came to liberate Iraq , but I did not come willingly because I wanted to stay with my child . "
Krause 's body was found two weeks later .
Later that summer , Al - Jazeera aired a videotape purportedly showing the execution of Maupin , but U.S. officials have n't confirmed the identity of the person on the tape .
The U.S. Army continued to promote Maupin , who was a private first class in the Army Reserves at the time of his capture , to sergeant and then staff sergeant as they searched for him .
Three U.S. troops remain missing in the five - year - old Iraq war : Pvt. Byron W. Fouty and Spc. Alex R. Jimenez have been missing since their military convoy was raided west of Mahmoudiya May 12 .
Spc. Ahmed K. Altaie disappeared October 23 , 2006 , and his status was changed to " missing - captured " nearly two months later .
The news about Maupin came Sunday as roadside bombings in northern and western Iraq killed two U.S. troops and attacks on Iraqi police and others left another 19 dead , Iraqi police and U.S. military officials reported .
One roadside bombing killed a U.S. soldier north of Baghdad , and a Marine died in another bombing in the western province of Anbar , the U.S. military headquarters there reported .
No details of the attacks were released .
The latest attacks bring the U.S. death toll in the five - year - old war to 4,009 .

All About Iraq War
Thousands of striking teachers have marched in England and Wales Nearly a third of schools in England and Wales have been disrupted , and one in 10 closed completely during the biggest teachers ' strike in 21 years .
The National Union of Teachers ( NUT ) said thousands of members had heeded its strike for a 4.1 % pay rise .
Meanwhile , thousands of civil servants also walked out , disrupting government departments and the coastguard service .
The public sector unions have not ruled out further strikes against the government 's 2 % pay target .
Up to 400,000 teachers , lecturers , civil and public servants walked out on Thursday in a one - day protest at what they said were below - inflation wage rises .
Schools , colleges , government departments and the coastguard service were all affected as members of the NUT and Public and Commercial Services union ( PCS ) stayed away .
At a rally in London , TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said that giving public sector workers below - inflation pay rises " simply was n't good enough " for a Labour government .
He said :
We need a fundamental change of direction .
If the government continues to use the public sector like a political football , I am convinced they will pay a devastating price at the general election . "
TEACHERS ' PAY £ 20,133 - starting salary ( England and Wales ) £ 34,281 - most experienced teachers ' salary ( outside London ) +£ 4,000 - additional pay for inner London teachers £ 39,525 - headteachers ' starting salary Nearly £ 100,000 - most experienced headteachers ' salary
Q&A : Public sector pay
In pictures : Teachers on streets Civil servants on strike A Treasury spokesman said the government would continue with its policy of holding public - sector pay settlements at or near to a 2 % increase .
He said Gordon Brown was determined to keep pay awards low , in the interest of controlling inflation .
The one - day teachers ' strike , which was condemned by all the main political parties , affected up to 9,500 schools .
Christine Blower , acting general secretary of the NUT , told the BBC that she could not rule out further pay strikes in the months ahead .
More than 2.5 m pupils were estimated to have been affected by Thursday 's strike - with more than a million forced to stay at home .
Many pupils are studying for GCSE examinations which start next month .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the strike had been called by a " minority " of teachers , and said it was regrettable for both pupils and parents .

Advertisement Figures provided by the Department for Children , Schools and Families indicated that 67 % of schools in England and Wales remained open on Thursday .
Twenty - one per cent of schools remained open but had some of their classes affected , and 12 % were closed altogether .
As the day of action began , teachers formed picket lines outside schools .
Many held banners aloft bearing slogans such as " Where 's the money , Darling ? " - calling on the chancellor to make more funds available for their pay award .
SCHOOLS HIT BY STRIKE South West : 254 closed or partially closed Liverpool : 187 closed , 213 partially closed London : 708 closed , 769 partially closed North East :
At least 402 closed or partially closed Wales : About 500 closed , 400 partially closed West Midlands : 200 closed , 264 partially closed Yorkshire :
At least 600 closed or partially closed In London and other cities across England and Wales , thousands of teachers and other public sector workers took part in marches and rallies .
The NUT has rejected the a three - year pay deal put forward by an independent pay review body .
The deal is worth 2.45 % this year , followed by increases of 2.3 % in the following years .
Pay battle Ministers say teachers are rewarded adequately , and that their pay has gone up by 19 % in real terms since 1997 .
During a visit to a school in Kent the schools secretary Ed Balls said : " I think parents across the country will be frustrated and angry about the strike and many teachers will have the same view - and I share their frustration . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is not a selfish request for higher wages but a need to keep teachers ' pay in line with other graduate professions Jenny , London Conservative schools spokesman Nick Gibb said it was " deeply regrettable " so many children would have their education disrupted by this strike , particularly those with important exams coming up .
Liberal Democrat school spokesman David Laws said that teachers should have a no - strike agreement .
" Given the importance of education , we should be trying to move to a presumption that teaching unions will not take strike action , " he said .

Any lingering doubts about Obama 's status as an abject puppet of Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission ended this morning when the withered mummy of imperialism himself appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe* to campaign for Obama , urged on by his own moronic daughter , Mika Brzezinski , an Obama groupie and sycophant .
Zbigniew , a low - level Polish aristocrat whose life has been devoted to hatred for Russia , lauded Obama for his 2002 speech opposing the Iraq war , saying that he himself was the source of Obama 's arguments back then - thus confirming Obama 's long - term status as his puppet , which probably began in 1981 - 1983 , when Obama was a student at Columbia University , and Zbig was directing the anti-Russian institute .
The aging revanchist showed all the misogynism of his szachta origins with a scurrilous attack on Sen.
Clinton as a mere housewife , a Mamie Eisenhower running against charismatic a JFK played by Zbig 's own Manchurian candidate , and as a woman whose foreign policy experience was worth as much as that of Zbig 's own travel agent .
Zbig , who was kept in the closet for many months during the Carter administration because of his hideous Dr. Strangelove persona , portrayed Obama as a peace candidate who wanted to end the Iraq war and usher in peace in the Middle East .
Zbig is an infamous Cold War hawk who has managed to re-invent himself in the eyes of some dupes by opposing the Iraq adventure , mainly because it is bad for imperialism .
Zbig did not mention that the reason he wants to downplay certain aspects of US aggression in the Middle East is to free up resources for use in the much bigger and more dangerous adventures which the Trilateral Commission is now directing .
Zbig is the mastermind of the Kosovo secession under KLA terrorist auspices , a gambit against Serbia and Russia to prepare a coming Operation Barbarossa II against Moscow .
With the help of his son Mark Brzezinski , another top foreign policy controller of Obama , Zbig is also behind the new Euromissiles crisis involving US ABM installations in Poland .
Zbig is the enforcer for the new CIA policy of killing Pakistanis ( as " terrorists " ) without consulting the government of that country , a nuclear power twice as big as Iran .
Most dangerous of all , Zbig is the obvious mastermind of the massive destabilization of China now ongoing , starting with the CIA / MI - 6 Tibet insurrection , which has placed the US on a collision course with China , a superpower with 1.4 billion people and thermonuclear weapons which can strike US cities , a far cry from the helpless and defenseless targets preferred by the neocons .
It is an open secret that Zbig intends to attempt a color revolution or CIA people power coup in China under the cover of the Beijing Olympics later this year .
He may also make the Taiwan crisis explode .
The dangers of these lunatic policies are infinitely worse than anything that could ever come out of the Middle East .
Senator Jay Rockefeller and Trilateral / BIlderberger boss Joseph Nye are also actively campaigning for Obama .
Nye is the theoretician of " soft power , " a new form of imperialist aggression based on economic warfare , subversion , deception , and people power coups .
They want Obama to mobilize soft power to give a face lift to US imnperialism .
Brzezinski's goal is confrontation with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the main world center for resistance to US - UK global domination .
Anti-war activists are still fixated on Iran , but not Brzezinski is not - his target is China , TWENTY times bigger than Iran , with ICBMs ready to launch , followed by Russia , the world 's biggest nuclear power .
Such confused activists need to focus on stopping the next war - the final global showdown with Pakistan , China , and Russia .
That means rejecting Brzezinski's puppet candidate Obama .

Consumers shell - shocked by ever higher records for oil and gasoline prices may have been surprised by the mild Producer Price Index ( PPI ) update recently issued .
The Labor Department reported that from March to April , wholesale prices rose only 0.2 percent , half of what the markets had been expecting .
The primary cause for this tame reading was that energy prices fell 0.2 percent , and in particular gasoline prices fell by 4.6 percent .
What , you think I misunderstood the news ?
I 'll reproduce the exact quote from the CNBC article linked above , just so you believe me :
The slower than expected overall inflation was due to falling energy prices and flat food prices , categories that boosted inflation in the previous month .
Energy fell 0.2 pct , the largest drop since December , while food was unchanged in the month .
Within the energy sector , gasoline fell 4.6 pct , the largest drop since December .
This struck me as odd .
It reminds of a line from Chico Marx : " Who are you going to believe , me or your own eyes ? "
I do a lot of work in energy economics , and so I follow oil and gas prices fairly closely .
Despite the official figures , I was pretty sure gasoline prices went up from March to April ; they certainly did n't fall 4.6 percent !
I had to get to the bottom of this mystery .
First Stop , EIA
The first thing I did was check the price history at the Energy Information Administration .
Yes , this is a government entity , but I 've met some of their current analysts , and they are just the sort of retentive geeks you want crunching boring but important numbers .
( If any are reading , I hope they realize that is a compliment . )
Lo and behold , the EIA table shows that the lowest average weekly gasoline price in April was higher than all of the weekly averages in March .
Clearly gasoline was more expensive in April than in March , just as I ( and every motorist in the country ) would have guessed .
Hmm .
To Every Price , There Is a Season
After asking some colleagues and nosing around , I hit upon the answer .
No , we were n't living in 1984 , you see , it was that the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( which calculates CPI and PPI ) had made a seasonal adjustment to the raw gasoline prices that people actually paid and that the EIA recorded .
As a different CNBC article explains :
Typically , gasoline prices rise sharply in April as the arrival of warmer weather encourages people to drive more .
The government data is adjusted to reflect that pattern so that it can highlight variations from the trend .
Because gas prices did not rise as much last month as they typically do in April , the seasonal adjustment showed that prices fell .
Now before we see whether this can explain the anomaly , a brief digression :
The paragraph quoted above is a bit too simplistic .
To correctly make a seasonal adjustment , one does n't simply look at how much prices typically rise from the prior month to the month in question .
This rule might make sense if annual prices were constant , but with a backdrop of ever higher prices year after year , the rule is n't quite right .
For example , suppose that , each and every month , the price of a widget always rises by 0.3 percent , year in and year out .
According to the explanation given in the CNBC article , one might think then that if we look at widget prices last month and see that ( as usual ) they rose exactly 0.3 percent , then we would conclude , " Ah , that 's normal ; they always do that from March to April .
So really widget prices were flat . "
But to reason in this fashion would be wrong , of course , because we would reach the same conclusion for every month , and end up thinking widgets had stayed the same price throughout the year .
( In other words , every month we would say , " Oh , that 0.3 percent rise is just due to the change in month ; it did that this time last year , as well . " )
Yet in reality , widget prices would be about 3.7 percent higher after a twelve - month cycle , so clearly we would n't want to seasonally adjust all the price hikes away .
The correct way to do seasonal adjustments is actually rather complicated , and different econometricians could use different approaches .
( For example , how far back do you go ?
Do you look at the change in gasoline prices from March to April 1924 to help interpret the monthly rise in 2008 ? )
I 'm not faulting the CNBC writer for the explanation given above — notice that I 'm not trying to give a better description — but I still thought it worth mentioning that the analysis was n't quite right .
So Is the Mystery Solved ?
Now at this point , I put down my Guy Fawkes mask and bulletproof vest .
My government had n't lied to me after all .
Phew !
But still something bothered me .
That original article said gasoline prices had fallen by 4.6 percent , when in reality they went up by a decent amount .
And we know that crude prices are surging up at record - breaking levels .
Could seasonal adjustments really explain all that away ?
To shed light on this question , I went back to the EIA data sets .
Rather than weekly averages , this time I pulled up monthly averages , going back as far as they had them ( August 1990 ) .
I constructed a new table ( shown below ) , which lists April - over - March gas price increases from 1991 through 2008 .
I then added a column showing the average April - over - March increase for the entire time span from a given year up through 2007 .
Finally , I added a back - of - the - envelope " seasonally adjusted " column , which took the 2008 value for April over March — 6.6 percent — and then subtracted the relevant monthly average for the periods of different lengths .
Year April / Mar Increase Over Prior x Years … … Period Average " Seasonally Adjusted " Chg 1991 3.5 % 17 5.2 % 1.4 % 1992 3.8 % 16 5.3 % 1.3 % 1993 2.5 % 15 5.3 % 1.2 % 1994 1.9 % 14 5.6 % 1.0 % 1995 3.6 % 13 5.8 % 0.8 % 1996 8.3 % 12 6.0 % 0.6 % 1997 - 0.5 % 11 5.8 % 0.8 % 1998 1.3 % 10 6.4 % 0.1 % 1999 15.2 % 9 7.0 % - 0.4 % 2000 - 3.4 % 8 6.0 % 0.6 % 2001 10.1 % 7 7.3 % - 0.7 % 2002 11.8 % 6 6.9 % - 0.3 % 2003 - 6.1 % 5 5.9 % 0.7 % 2004 3.6 % 4 8.9 % - 2.3 % 2005 7.9 % 3 10.7 % - 4.1 % 2006 13.1 % 2 12.0 % - 5.4 % 2007 11.0 % 1 11.0 % - 4.4 % 2008 6.6 %
Before proceeding , let 's make sure we understand what the table is saying .
In 1996 , for example , gasoline prices in April were 8.3 percent higher than in March of that year .
In contrast , in the year 2000 , gasoline prices in April were actually 3.4 percent lower than the month before .
( These numbers are shown in the second column . )
For another factoid , the table 's middle columns show us that over the 17 years from 1991 through 2007 , the ( arithmetic ) average price increase from March to April was 5.2 percent .
However , in recent years the April - over - March increases have been much steeper , and that 's why if we look back less distantly into the past , our average will go up .
For example , if we only use a three - year average , we would say that from March to April , gasoline prices historically go up 10.7 percent .
Finally , the last column in the table simply takes the 2008 increase of 6.6 percent , and subtracts the period average for every year taken as the starting point of the period .
For example , if we look back eleven years , we see that on average gas prices go up 5.8 percent from March to April .
Since they went up 6.6 percent this year , we would say that — based on the previous eleven - year history — the crude seasonally adjusted price hike this year should have been +0.8 percent , because gas prices increased more this April than they usually do .
Now that we understand how the table works , we get to the fun part .
Recall that the second CNBC article said that prices typically rise in April , and because this year 's rise was below normal , the BLS reported a seasonally adjusted drop .
Well , in the middle columns I have colored a year gray if the period average starting at that year is lower than the 2008 value .
As you can see , if the BLS used a five - year window , the ( crude ) seasonally adjusted increase should have been positive , not negative .
Indeed , only if the BLS used a window of the previous 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , or 9 years , would the sign of its seasonal adjustment have been correct .
For any other period length — including the nice round ones of five years and ten years — the 2008 increase is higher than the historical average .
Yet it gets worse .
The BLS did n't simply report that gas prices fell , once adjusted .
No , the BLS said they fell by 4.6 percent .
So in the final column , I have colored green the one year for which the ( makeshift ) seasonally adjusted figure is lower than a 4.6 percent drop .
In other words , if I adopt the crude technique suggested by the CNBC article , the only way I can generate a seasonally adjusted drop of at least 4.6 percent for 2008 , is if I choose 2006 and 2007 as what happens in " typical " years .
If I choose any other period length , then I will get a seasonally adjusted change that is greater than the BLS number .
What If We Don't Use a Crude Measure ?
As I explained earlier , the proper way to perform seasonal adjustments really is n't what the CNBC article claimed , and yet that 's the crude method I used for the table above .
So it 's possible that the BLS came up with its figure of minus 4.6 percent through a perfectly legitimate method .
I tried to find a methodological essay on their site , but the best I came up with ( due to a tip from a colleague ) was a link to their latest model , which was far from edifying .
I had an intuition that perhaps the increases earlier in 2008 were very large , so that the model expected 2008 on the whole to have a large increase , making the actual April increase comparatively modest .
But that theory did n't work either , since the March - over - January increase in 2007 was far higher than in 2008 .
At this point I abandoned my quest to understand the official BLS number .
Conclusion
People have a right to be cynical about the government 's official price inflation numbers .
As others have downright mocked , it is crazy to report on " core " inflation , as if the impact of soaring food and energy prices can safely be neglected .
In my experience , the government ( at least the US government ) does n't actually lie in its periodic reports , because it does n't need to : when it comes to models in the social sciences , there are all sorts of dials one can turn to get just about any result desired .
What really bothers me in this whole episode is that the press is so sloppy .
I do n't expect the average business reporter to pontificate on the evils of fiat money — of course not .
But the CNBC story I cited originally reported things that were false .
It was not true that " gasoline fell 4.6 percent " in April .
No , the correct thing to say would have been , " After making a seasonal adjustment , the BLS reported that gasoline prices fell … "
The government wants to shape perceptions in order to minimize dissatisfaction with its irresponsible monetary and fiscal policies .
When the financial press goes along and parrots statements that are obviously false , it fails in its duty to its readers .
The existence of the so - called torture memos in the DOJ and now the revelation of torture sessions by the highest officers of the executive branch of our government establish with practical certainty ( most likely , I would say , beyond a reasonable doubt ) that serious crimes may have been committed .
Moreover , under our existing domestic laws , the Geneva Conventions and other applicable international law , as well as under well established relevant case law and other precedents , there can hardly be any dispute that these crimes , if proven , will likely rise to the level of war crimes or the so - called crimes against humanity .
Thus , it is obvious that our government will not have the moral authority to initiate or even request any investigation and prosecution of war criminals in other countries in an international forum or in our court , unless we investigate and prosecute our own government officials who have committed the same or similar crimes .
First , however , it is certain that our own executive branch will not conduct any meaningful investigation and prosecution of these crimes on its own .
It is doubtful that the next administration , even if the Democratic candidate wins , will be able to conduct such investigation unless forced to do so through the legal apparatus of the government initiated by Congressional hearings .
Second , the records to date make it clear that Congress is not likely to initiate any meaningful investigation or hearings unless enough members of the Congress feel strong pressure to do so .
The 2006 election apparently did not make the Democrats feel enough pressure to do anything meaningful about the Iraq war or the many alleged illegal acts of the Bush administration , as the first thing Nancy Pelosi , as Speaker of the House , gratuitously declared was that the impeachment of Bush was " off the table . "
Therefore , only an incessant and concentrated coverage of the issue by the press can generate the kind of public pressure to force Congress to act , so as to restore the moral authority of our government .
Pressure generated by grassroots movements certainly will be helpful and has been forthcoming quite loudly through the blogosphere and the like .
In the final analysis , however , only the powerful press has enough voice and resources to make a real difference .
No doubt , this is precisely why our Founding Fathers thought that freedom of the press was fundamental to our democracy .
By Terry Townsend
A talk to the Climate Change Social Change Conference held in Sydney from April 11 to 13 , 2008 , organised by Green Left Weekly .
For more articles , audio and video from the conference , click here .
April 13 , 2008 -- I ’m sure everybody here is aware of the basic facts of global warming and the likely consequences if rapid and serious action is not taken .
There is virtually unanimous agreement among scientists and activists , and increasingly among millions of ordinary people , about the degree of the problem and the time frame we have to make fundamental changes to address it .
The main “ solutions ” being offered by the capitalist class , its politicians and the corporate - dominated mass media — and endorsed by some key peak environmental organisations — are consciously designed to shift the responsibility for , and the major costs of , addressing global warming away from the most polluting corporations and to preserve the basic structure and mechanisms of Western capitalist economies .
They are also designed to delay the necessary political , economic and social changes for as long as possible , and to keep them to the minimum that are compatible ( in their assessment ) with both the survival of capitalist society and ameliorating the worst of climate change .
This is why major - party politicians and the corporate media — and again unfortunately some peak environment groups – do not place serious demands on big business , but endorse — even celebrate — big business ’ preferred measures of emissions trading , “ green ” taxes , carbon offsetting projects in the Third World and capitalism - friendly publicly subsidised techno - fixes such as so - called clean coal and agro -fuels .
These false “ solutions ” are not only inadequate , they are counterproductive .
However , since other speakers and workshops will be focusing on those , I ’ll concentrate on another of the establishment ’s favoured — and ultimately also counterproductive — “ solution ” — one that is intertwined with the others .
The push for all individuals to voluntarily consume a little less , and “ buy green ” whenever they can .
That the answer to global warming is for all of “ us ” — consumers , workers , residents , pensioners — to voluntarily change our wasteful behaviour .
Despite its benign aura of commonsense advice , this is a massive ideological campaign to drive home to “ us ” that it is ordinary working people who are ultimately to blame for climate change , and that it is “ us who must pay for its solution .
It is part of the ruling class ’ overall offensive to shift the blame and cost of addressing global warming away from itself and its intrinsically environmentally destructive economic and social system .
As one commentator aptly noted in the usually system - friendly Grist e-zine “ every time an activist or politician hectors the public to voluntarily reach for a new [ fluro ] bulb or spend extra on a Prius , Exxon Mobil heaves a big sigh of relief , ” because it diverts people ’s attention from what is really necessary to address the crisis , and from who is really responsible .
Death by a thousand tips
Another radical commentator , George Marshall , has described this ideological offensive as “ death [ by ] a thousand tips . ”
He is referring to the literally tens of thousands of newspaper articles and web pages that , after having outlined the severe crisis we face and the sharply diminishing time society has to respond , direct the reader to a snappy , upbeat sidebar or list entitled “ 10 easy tips to save the planet ” or some variation thereof .
The same sort of lists have been the core of government - sponsored campaigns across the globe , including Australia .
Standard items include “ change your light globes , ” “ turn off unnecessary lights , ” “ do n’t leave your appliances on stand - by , ” “ adjust your thermostats , ” recycle , compost , drive a fuel - efficient car , or drive less .
Yet extremely rarely do these helpful hints mention political action , let alone make concrete demands on governments or business .
On the odd occasion they do , it is vague and tokenistic – and tacked onto the end of the list .
Of course , there is a place for action by individuals , and it should not be discouraged .
It does make sense in terms of saving energy and water , reducing waste and saving money .
Educating and facilitating such behaviour on a mass scale is a significant part of what is needed to halt global warming .
But such suggestions should not be counterposed to , or used to drown out calls for , the urgent need for mass political action to force the necessary cuts to emission demanded by the science .
And they should not be cynically presented , as they are by the corporate media and capitalist politicians , as the way to save the planet .
In Britain , the government spent £ 22 million on a “ Do your bit ” campaign and had to admit that it produced no measurable change in personal habits .
A poll in 2007 indicated that this campaign had miseducated people , with more than 40 % saying that recycling household waste — which would result in a relatively small reduction of emissions — was the most important thing they could do .
Only 10 % nominated the far more effective regular use of public transport .
That £ 22 million would have been better spent to organize a movement to demand an end to the massive and wasteful packaging and advertising industries , or the mass expansion of public transport .
In Ireland , faced with greenhouse gas emissions that have increased 25 % since 1990 , the government ’s response was to launch a multimillion euro “ The Power on One ” campaign , which provides — yes , you guessed it — “ 10 top tips ” to “ make a difference . ”
Among the revolutionary actions suggested were : do n’t overfill your kettle , but fill your dishwasher before use , and unplug your mobile phone charger .
As George Marshall quips , all “ that sounds much nicer than curtailing road building or industrial growth .
They are not called `easy tips ’ for nothing . ”
On October 15 , the UN Environment Program organised a “ Blog Action Day ” in which some 15,000 blog sites offered more “ tips ” to web surfers , from the inevitable changing light globes to one of Copyblogger .
com ’s “ tiny actions [ that ] can save the world ” : quit your job requiring a long commute and start up a home - based business !
Copyblogger ’s not alone in making “ tips ” that are simply beyond the means of most debt - strapped working people in these days of widespread “ mortgage stress ” and rising interest rates .
Common “ tips ” include buying more expensive hybrid cars and building architect - designed “ carbon neutral ” houses .
Blaming working people
All such campaigns are premised on blaming working people for global warming .
But as Dave Holmes , a veteran Australian socialist , points out in Green Left Weekly , what real choice to do the mass of ordinary people have :
“ the source of our current crisis is quite specific : it is the operations of modern capitalism .
The drive for profits by the giant corporations has been relentless and has been pursued in complete disregard of any impact on the environment .
“ The fundamental conditions under which we live — how we generate our power , how we get around , how our food is grown , etc. — are not decided by us but rather by the big corporations that control society ’s means of production .
Without the rule of corporate capital we could set in place radically different and ecologically sustainable arrangements .
“ For example , the cars which most of us use are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions …
The favouring of private motor vehicles over public transport has n’t come about because we are innately a society of petrol - heads but is a consequence of the deliberate policies of a succession of capitalist governments loyally protecting the interests of their big business masters .
The auto industry and its associated sectors make up a very large part of each national capitalist economy . ”
However well intentioned , appeals to people to change their individual habits bring trivial results when measured against the problem , and if not coupled to the much more urgent task of politically mobilizing to demand serious government action to immediately reduce and rapidly halt greenhouse gas emissions , it derails mass concern about global warming from taking a political road .
The Earth Hour greenwash
It also sells the damaging lie that “ clean , ” “ green , ” “ natural ” and “ organic ” commodities are the answer , when they are fundamentally no better for the planet than any other over - produced commodities under capitalism .
It plays into the hands of the mega - financed “ Greenwashing ” by corporations and governments of an unsustainable economic system .
If anything sums up this sort of operation , it was the massively publicized “ Earth Hour ” on March 29 .
The brainchild in 2007 of the World Wildlife Fund , Fairfax newspapers and the Leo Burnett advertising agency , Earth Hour declares on its website : “ Created to take a stand against the greatest threat our planet has ever faced , Earth Hour uses the simple action of turning off the lights for one hour to deliver a powerful message about the need for action on global warming . ”
But you will search in vain for any demands for political action , just boilerplate “ tips . ”
It states :
“ Earth Hour is the highlight of a major campaign to encourage businesses , communities and individuals to take the simple steps needed to cut their emissions on an ongoing basis .
It is about simple changes that will collectively make a difference — from businesses turning off their lights when their offices are empty to households turning off appliances rather than leaving them on standby . ”
There was more of the same in the 40 - page , full - colour Earth Hour Magazine that was distributed “ free ” ( free that is if you do n’t consider the small forest and who knows how many tonnes of CO2 that were expended in its production and distribution ) with the approximate 211,000 copies of the Sydney Morning Herald on March 17 .
Only one article , by Tim Flannery , made any serious attempt to point out the vested interests that need to be tackled and raised the issues of inadequate public transport , stopping new coal plants and setting adequate emission - reduction targets by 2050 .
But his contribution was buried under an avalanche of yet more regurgitated “ tips , ” feel - good stories and gumph such as this :
“ Many governments and communities have already made big changes to reduce emissions .
The use of solar and wind power is on the increase .
Other renewable energy sources are being investigated .
Millions of dollars are being spent exploring ways to bury carbon dioxide or to produce cleaner coal .
But more needs to be done and politicians need to be brave enough to make tough decisions .
If those politicians know that a couple of million people in their homeland have joined Earth Hour , they can be confident that the people will support the hard decisions and will applaud leaders who have the will to act . ”
Do n’t expect Fairfax to support “ hard decisions ” that impact on the big end of town , though .
“ Hard decisions ” is code for making you and me pay higher bills .
The supplement was festooned with full - page ads by electricity suppliers such as EnergyAustralia , Integral Energy and Country Energy — the ones that hawk all that coal power — car companies such as Toyota , Fiat and Hyundai ( Volvo waited for 8 - page post - Earth Hour “ Souvenir edition ” Sydney Morning Herald ) , and even Cascade beer ( 100 % Carbon Offset ! ) .
Corporate and government “ greenwashing ” was the central goal of the pre-hour hullabaloo .
For all the talk of millions of Australians taking part , almost the sole yardstick of the night ’s success was on corporate office blocks and huge neon advertising signs in the CBD switching off .
The participation of major publicly owned landmarks is really what made the impact .
Which begs the question , why are n’t all these lights and signs switched off every night ?
Fossil fuel giant AGL loaned the giant WWF - logoed hot air balloon , which sailed over several capital cities beforehand , producing an estimated 378 kilograms of CO2 an hour .
That ’s the same AGL that is a shareholder in Victoria ’s largest brown coal mine .
Richard Branson gave his grin of approval , ever keen to “ offset ” the impact of his fleet of 38 747s .
BP — the world ’s third largest global energy company — also promised to turn off all its “ non-essential lighting . ”
Let ’s not mention that BP was named one of the “ ten worst corporations ” in both 2001 and 2005 based on its environmental and human rights records .
Or that it is busy trying to mine the ultra- polluting tar sands oil in Canada .
McDonald ’s turned off it Golden Arches for an hour nationally !
So the literally millions on tonnes of useless packaging produced by this lot , not to mention the clearing of Amazonian rainforest for beef for Maccas , is forgiven .
Not surprisingly , Channel Nine ’s support did not extend to urging people to switch of the tellie or to refusing to air the ads of CO2 polluters .
Behind the scenes , advertising industry magazine Campaign Brief in league with the SMH offered an incentive to copywriters who “ demonstrate the most effective and / or inspirational way to leverage Earth Hour 2008 ” — two return trips to Cannes in France !
And last but certainly not least , the eco-friendly Department of Defence signed up to participate in Earth Hour .
Federal Labor defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon announced : “ Defence takes its obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions seriously and will have over 1330 buildings across Australia participating in Earth Hour . ”
The minister of war also reported that the department had launched the Combat Climate Change initiative ( clever pun ) to provide information and “ tips ” to defence staff in the “ workplace ” and home to reduce energy use .
Here ’s a “ tip ” Joel : get all troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan , and end all support for those wars for US imperialist control of energy sources .
In the end , despite the hype and PR , the results were hardly impressive .
In the hour , electricity consumption across whole city and the Illawarra dropped just 2 - 3 % , while in the CBD it was just over 8 % .
Nationwide figures put the drop at 3.6 % .
Based on a survey of 3000 , WWF claimed 59 % of Sydneysiders took part — a figure that does n’t gel with the marginal power drop , if simply turning off lights is the way forward .
Anyway , it seems that the WWF and Fairfax were not going to let their advertisers down and were going to declare the night a success whatever the result .
The Online Fairfax - owned Brisbane Times reported that “ Brisbane made history this evening with the city ’s first official Earth Hour going off without a hitch .
Kellie Caught , of Earth Hour organiser World Wildlife Fund , said she was thrilled with the response . ”
Only problem was , this was published on March 28 , 26 hours before Earth Hour had even taken place !
The last word on Earth Hour should go to Jimmy Yan , a member of the Glen Waverley Secondary College Eco-Committee , whose excellent critique was carried on the committee ’s blog :
“ Earth Hour rests on the assumption that the environmental movement can make any real progress without looking at the deeper social and political institutions and systems within our society that cause our environmental problems , one of them being a system that seeks to accumulate as much profit as possible for the sake of more accumulation and more competition irrespective of the human , environmental and social cost .
Our environmental problems become another commodity that is bought and sold on the market …
“ Ultimately , events like Earth Hour … rest on the idea that we can trust and work with those responsible for environmental destruction without holding them accountable for their crimes and the assumption that ordinary people are too stupid and naive to go beyond just turning off their lights for one hour . ”
Mass movement needed
We have to convince millions of people and build a mass movement for emission - reductions that genuinely address the real problem .
For Australia , that ’s at least 90 % by 2030 — not Labor ’s anaemic 60 % by 2050 .
A movement that demands that governments impose far - reaching measures that force giant industrial polluters to rapidly and massively slash their emissions , at the risk of massive fines .
And if they refuse , they should be nationalized and run in the interests of the workers and consumers .
All public subsidies and tax concessions for the giant fossil fuel industries and resource corporations — which amount to billions — should be redirected to research the development of publicly owned renewable energy sources .
We could help ordinary people implement individual actions , by supplying free or at a massive subsidy to all households solar waters heaters and water tanks .
There should be a massive reorganization of society to move away from private - car - based transportation to free and frequent mass public transport , and , redesign our cities to put people ’s homes close to work and shops .
We need to think about ways of linking these wider demands with our more immediate campaigns , for example as we fight to stop the Tasmanian pulp mill , oppose power privatization , end coal and uranium mining , and to stop the building of new freeways and toll roads , we have to also convince people that the workings of capitalism itself is both responsible for the crisis and also the main obstacle to its solution .
The real source of the problem
Through struggles for immediate and broader demands , masses of people can come to understand that the source of the problem lies with capitalism itself .
The scientific analysis of capitalism first made by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , illustrates how , despite the assertions of many environmental movement theorists over the years , Marxism not only provides essential insights into the fundamental cause of the environmental crisis , but also offers a political guide to its solution .
Capitalism ’s fundamentally anti-ecological trait is captured by Marx ’s analysis of the working of capitalism .
Capitalists buy or produce commodities only in order to sell them for a profit , and then buy or produce yet more to sell more again .
There is no end to the process .
Competition between capitalists ensures that each one must continue to increase their production of commodities and continue to expand in order to survive .
Production tends to expand exponentially until interrupted by crises ( depressions and wars ) and it is this dynamic at the very core of capitalism that places enormous , unsustainable pressure on the environment .
Capitalism is a system that pursues growth for its own sake , whatever the consequences .
This is why all schemes based on the hope of a no - growth , slow - growth or a sustainable - growth forms of capitalism are pipe dreams .
As too are strategies based on a critical mass of individual consumers deciding to go “ green ” in order to reform the system .
People are not “ consumers ” by nature .
A multi-billion - dollar capitalist industry called advertising constantly plays with our minds to convince us that happiness comes only through buying more and more “ stuff , ” to keep up with endless wasteful fads , fashions , upgrades , new models and built - in obsolescence .
The desire for destructive and / or pointless goods is manufactured along with them .
In 2008 , an estimated $ 750 billion will be spent on corporate advertising and public relations in the US alone .
In Australia , such spending is now well in excess of $ 12 billion a year .
Many in the environmental movement argue that with the right mix of taxes , incentives and regulations , everybody could be winners .
Big business would have cheaper , more efficient production techniques , and therefore be more profitable , and consumers would have more environment - friendly products and energy sources .
In a rational society , such innovations would lower the overall environmental impact of production .
Unfortunately , we do n’t live in a rational society .
Any energy and money savings made through efficiency are used to make and sell more commodities , cheaper than their competitors .
Capitalism approaches technology — in the production process or in the final product — in the same way as it does everything else .
What will generate the most profits ?
Whether it is efficient , clean , safe , environmentally benign or rational has little to do with it .
The technologies that could tackle global warming have long existed .
Even though research into them has been massively underfunded , renewable energy sources are today competitive with coal and nuclear power ( if the negative social and environmental costs are factored in ) .
Public transport systems have been around since the late 1800s .
Fundamental to capitalism ’s development has been its power to shift the cost of its ecological and social vandalism onto society as whole .
More profits can accrue if the big capitalists do n’t have to bother themselves with the elimination , neutralisation or recycling of industrial wastes .
It ’s much cheaper to pour toxic waste into the air or the nearest river .
Rather than pay for the real costs of production , society as a whole subsidizes corporate profit - making by cleaning up some of the mess or suffering the environmental and / or health costs .
Or the whole messy business can simply be exported to the Third World .
It is becoming abundantly clear that the Earth cannot sustain this system ’s plundering and poisoning without the humanity sooner or later experiencing a complete ecological catastrophe .
To have any chance of preventing this , within the 10 - to 30 - year window that we have in relation to global warming , humanity must take conscious , rational control of its interactions with the planet and its ecological processes , in ways that capitalism is inherently incapable of doing .

China has urged its citizens to be calm amid further anti-Western protests in the country , focused on French supermarket chain Carrefour .
The official Communist Party newspaper , the People 's Daily , said patriotism should be expressed rationally .
The protesters have been angered by disruption of the Olympic torch relay in Paris and London .
They also accuse the West of supporting Tibetan separatists , and the Western media of bias .
The official Xinhua news agency said more than 1,000 people carrying banners had gathered in front of a Carrefour store in the city of Xian , and there were also protests in Harbin and Jinan .
Xinhua added that police were monitoring the demonstrations in the three cities , which remained peaceful .
Beijing does not want to see any escalation in the protests
The protests came after Saturday saw hundreds of people demonstrating in cities including Beijing , Wuhan , Hefei , Kunming , and Qingdao - often outside Carrefour stores .
Protesters denounced French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's refusal to confirm whether he would attend the opening ceremony of the Games .
Carrefour has restated its support for Beijing 's hosting of the Olympics this August , and denies the accusations by some protesters that it backs the campaign for Tibetan independence .
The front - page Sunday editorial in the People 's Daily called on Chinese people to cherish patriotism " while expressing it in a rational way " .
It said : " As citizens , we have the responsibility to express our patriotic enthusiasm calmly and rationally and express patriotic aspiration in an orderly and legal manner .
" The more complicated the international situation is , the more calmness , wisdom and unity need to be shown by the Chinese people . "
The BBC's Daniel Griffiths in Beijing says this is a clear sign that the Chinese government does not want to see any escalation in the protests .
Scuffles Saturday 's pro-Beijing protests were not confined to China .
In Paris , several thousand protesters gathered in the Place de la Republique , many wearing T - shirts bearing the slogan " Let 's make the Olympics a bridge , not a wall " .
Meanwhile , more than 1,300 protesters gathered outside BBC buildings in the British cities of London and Manchester to protest against alleged bias in the coverage of Western media .
Campaigners for Tibetan independence have used the Olympic torch relay in several cities around the world to stage public protests against Chinese rule in Tibet .
Scuffles between torch bearers and protesters in cities including London and Paris have forced host nations to mount tight security operations to protect the torch on its journey .

Scott 's Wine Making Site About this Site Like you I am a lover of wine .
I developed my interest in wine in university when my friends would host wine and cheese parties , which were not only fun because of the new people I met but also because of all of the different types of wine I was exposed to .
Easiest Way To Calculate The Alcohol Content Of Your Wine
Easiest Way To Calculate The Alcohol Content Of Your Wine Did you know that you can easily calculate the alcohol content of your beer or wine if you know your specific gravity ( S.G. ) readings at the beginning and end of the beer / wine making process ?
Hydrometer
To calculate the approximate value of the alcohol content in your beer / wine use the following formula : Approximate Alcohol Content ( % ) = Starting S.G. - Ending S.G. ÷ 0.0074
For example : Starting SG = 1.090 Ending SG = 0.995 % Alcohol = 1.090 - 0.995 = 12.84 ÷ 0.0074 >
You can therefore say that the approximate alcohol content of this batch of wine is 12.84 %
Note :
This method assumes that difference in specific gravity is solely due to the conversion of sugar into alcohol To Learn More About HomeMade Wine click here Copyright © 2008 Scott 's Wine Making Blog

For my B - day in November she got me this beautiful
' Spring Blossom Fairy ' .
I was still 5 then and still like TOYs !
( " 5 " , since I only count decades these days ! )
It was one of those amazing things where you go in a shop with a lot of dolls and gift stuff , and all of a sudden there 's one that 's just looking right at you and makes you smile .
I never bought it , but Dorothy went back for it later in secret .
Well seasons do pass quickly when you 're having such a bright time as this .
Here 's a few seasonal shots , one from Christmas at Disney , a New Years club photo , and one from Easter .
There will be more over time .
You can see that Dorothy decided to cut her hair with bangs again here .
I understand , as I too have always subscribed to the ' Big Bangs Theory " of CUTENESS !
We 're always looking to find more fun combinations for us to wear together .
A good place to start , of course , are the thrift stores .
You never know when you 're going to find the start of an adorably sweet looking outfit !
One day we found this awesome teal satin dress at one of those stores .
It was WAY WAY longer when we got it , so the first order of business was to hem it up to be more childlike .
We call this one her Alice in Wonderland dress .
( Later , we added a stiff and short white petticoat to wear under it , which really made it ' poof ' out ) .
So with that and me in my ' baby blue boi ' variation , we now have a great set of matching outfits to wear to go dancing in !
Speaking of dancing , some of you , I 'm sure , recognize this unmistakable brick background .
It 's the ' Castle ' , one of my favorite clubs of all time , in Ybor City , Tampa .
Here 's a few more of us in that outfit combination .
Some say we look like Little Bo Peeps .
Of course for me , it 's little ' BOI ' peep .
見積書 を手書きする 会社での定型のお仕事のひとつに、見積書の作成というものがあると思う。 お客さんからもらった要望に対して、プランや料金を提示するこの見積書。会社のフォーマットに従って印刷したものを、そのままお客さんに渡すことも多い。 でも、見積書ってほんとはお品書きなんじゃないか、と思った。料理屋さんのお品書きをみならえば、もうちょっと違った見積書が作れるんじゃないか。 （text by 三土たつお ）
見積書はこういうのです いきなり「見積書」とかいう言葉がでてきて、学生の方とかには何のことかと思わせてしまったかもしれない。大丈夫です。説明します。
以下は、よくあるフォーマットで作った架空の見積書。ああこんな感じなんだと思いながらご覧ください。
よくある風の見積 書
ストーリーはこう。 デイリーポータ ルZ商事に勤めるあなたが、 「出会わない系」という新しいコンセプトのウェブサイトを企画して、そのシステムの作成を「三土システム開発」に依頼した。それに対して、いくらいくらです、という返事（＝上の見積書）が返ってきた。そんなところを想像してください。
ふつうの見積書は事務的だ 日常生活で一番近いのは、レストランのメニュー表だと思う。「システム開発」というコース料理があって、その中の各料理と値段が示してあって、ぜひお召し上がりください、とうやうやしく差し出すのが、見積書なのに違いない。
でもそれにしちゃあ、上の見積書はどうだろう。無機的で事務的で、なんというかお客さんに対するおもてなしの心が伝わってこないように思うのだ。

Gather ‘ round , everybody .
I have an epic tale to tell .
It ’s the story of how Fake Luxury Conquered The World .
There are heroes , and villains , and sweeping vistas , and if we do n’t exactly have a princess cooped up in a tower , we might have a few sexually liberated young women in airbrush - mural vans .
Interested ?
Follow along with me as we return to the dark days of the early Seventies …
Our story begins with another story .
More properly , it ’s a legend .
Nobody ’s sure whether it ’s true or not , but if it ai n’t true , it ought to be .
The legend says that once upon a time there was a General Motors .
This General Motors , GM for short , had a car and a brand for every need , along the plan developed by the great Alfred Sloan prior to the Second World War .
There were Chevrolets for regular folk , Pontiacs for the cautious old people ( and , thanks to John Z. Delorean ’s development of the 1964 GTO , for angry young people as well ) , Buicks and Oldsmobiles for doctors and successful businessmen , and Cadillacs at the very top , for the most successful men in the land .
Yes , I said “ men ” , because this story happened in the time before Nicky Hilton showed that women could run a business just as well as men could .
Since the men at the very top levels of the various GM divisions were all very successful men by definition , they all drove Cadillacs , even though they were in the business of making cars which were definitely not Cadillacs .
This led to a rather curious situation , because it meant that most of the people at the top of the various GM divisions had no first - hand experience with their own vehicles , but nobody wanted to rock the boat , and that ’s the way it stayed , all through the Korean War , and the Fifties , and the Kennedy assassination , and the beginnings of the Vietnam War .
It would have stayed that way forever , but one day a mysterious yet important man at GM had a mysterious yet important idea : Executives should drive cars from their own division !
Seems like a good idea , does n’t it ?
If you are the business of designing , building , and selling Pontiacs , should n’t you drive a Pontiac , or perhaps even – as crazy as this sounds – a Pontiac competitor ?
And yet it took a long campaign by a very determined fellow to make it happen .
His name is lost to history ; if you know who it was , write me and let me know .
Whoever he was , though , he knew what buttons to push , and he knew how to make his idea a reality .
Given the atmosphere at the time inside GM , which John Z. would later go on to skewer in his book On A Clear Day You Can See General Motors , I can only guess that he had Max Mosley - style photos of quite a few important folks , and he used ‘em to overcome the objections .
The interior of a 1968 Cadillac : luxury defined .
As they say in the Army , remember this material , because you will see it again .

And so , some time around 1970 , the word went out that , from then on , all GM executives would drive cars from their own brand .
I can only imagine that there were a lot of angry faces at the dinner tables of Oakland County when it all went down .
Imagine , for a moment , that you are a Vice President at the Chevrolet Division of General Motors .
As a GM executive , you lead an unbelievably pampered life .
It ’s been years since you purchased a car from a dealer , or vacuumed out your carpets , or even pumped your own gas .
Instead , you have a top - of - the - line Cadillac Fleetwood Sixty Special or something similar , which is cleaned , serviced , and fueled during the day while you are working .
In the evenings , you put on a dinner jacket , festoon your handsome , socially active wife with expensive jewels , and drive your brand - new Cadillac to posh dinner parties ; on the weekends , you glide to church with your perfect children , a shining example of the American dream …
… until one day , at the end of work , when your valet arrives with , not your normal Fleetwood , but a f*** ing Chevy Impala !
An Impala !
The “ full - sized ” car driven by pipefitters , plumbers , Catholics , and recent immigrants !
The official car of poor people !
And everybody at that night ’s dinner party sees you step out of a car universally driven by losers !
Remember , folks , this was back in the early Seventies , before foreign cars had conquered the world .
It was an era where the Sloan - created GM hierarchy was as natural as breathing – an era when the gas station attendant could guess everything from your annual income to your graduating rank at university simply by reading the script on your front fender .
Cadillac to Chevrolet – there could be no more humiliating disaster for one ’s prestige !
Think of how a Flying Spur owner would feel if he found a Kia Optima in his parking space , and you ’re right there with Mr. Chevrolet Executive as his new Impala rolls up .
And that ’s not the only thing that ’s rolling up – the hero of our tale soon finds something out which he may have known intellectually but not fully understood .
The windows in a Chevy roll up !
By hand !
There are no power windows in a basic early - Seventies Chevrolet .
A standard Chevrolet does not have a vinyl accent roof , wire wheel hubcaps , leather upholstery , a soft - touch trunk closer , or a “ Twilight Sentinel ” automatic headlamp system .
It ’s a basic car designed to compete on price .
It ’s not a case of Mr. Exec ’s car not having all the options – it ’s a case of there being no options to have .
Chevrolet was n’t allowed to have equipment that would step on Oldsmobile ’s toes .
Not that Mr. Chevy Exec ’s neighbor , Mr. Olds Exec , is feeling much better about his situation .
Sure , he ’s not driving a Chevrolet , but neither is he driving his old Cadillac .
He ’s still driving a mid-range car despite being an executive , still short on equipment , still woefully lacking in prestige .
To put it back in a modern perspective , he ’s got a Lexus instead of a Kia – but who wants to replace a Bentley with a Lexus ?
He ’s angry , his wife is angry , and his relatives are whispering that perhaps he ’s been “ moved aside ” at work .
The combined angst in the thickly carpeted halls of GM ’s executive levels would have been enough to turn everyone emo , if only they had known what “ emo ” was .
Instead , being men of action , the off - brand GM execs swung into just that – action .
If the Buick man could n’t have a Cadillac – and he could n’t , at least not now – there was nothing to stop him from building his own Cadillac .
Why not build a Buick with a Cadillac ’s level of equipment and poshness ?
And so the Buick Electra 225 – the famed “ deuce - and - a- quarter ” – became available with a “ Park Avenue ” trim level .
That ’s right !
Park Avenue !
Suck on that , Mr. Cadillac Executive !
The Park Avenue had everything a Cadillac had , from a monster chrome grille to – do n’t tell anybody – the infamous Twilight Sentinel .
Before long , our self - satisfied Buick exec was rolling up to church in style … only to see that his friendly rival from Oldsmobile had arrived in a Ninety - Eight “ Regency ” , named after the famous hotel on … well , on Park Avenue !
The “ Regency ” was to the Ninety - Eight what the “ Park Avenue ” was to the Electra .
And no sooner does Mr. Buick recover from the shock than the man from Pontiac arrives in the new “ Gran Ville ” !
It ’s just as chrome - laden and luxed - up as a “ Regency ” is !
And as the three men stare at each other in the church parking lot – shocked beyond belief that the “ other guys ” had also managed to create ersatz Cadillacs from their brand ’s full - size cars – what do they see coming down the road ?
It ’s a bright - grille , vinyl - roofed Chevrolet “ Caprice Classic ” !
Can you believe it ?
Even the man from Chevy managed to build himself a Cadillac !
The Caprice Classic even had its own badge – which looked kind of like a Cadillac badge redrawn by a fellow high on LSD and limited to one color of paint .
And thus the tableau was complete ; denied their own Cadillacs , each division had managed to create a Fakeillac to serve in place of the Standard of the World .
A late - Seventies Caprice Classic interior .
Gosh , where ’d they get the idea ?
Click for Larger Image
Meanwhile , the men from each division ’s marketing office were sweating bullets , having received strong orders to make sure the new chrome boats sold in volumes sufficient to justify their existence .
For the Buick and Oldsmobile people , it was n’t too tough ; there were plenty of people out there successful enough to buy a Cadillac but afraid of the social implications .
For Pontiac and Chevy it was much tougher , and the way it was done helped bring about the eventual collapse of GM ’s carefully orchestrated brand hierarchy .
The ads for the Caprice hinted – just barely suggested – that the Caprice was pretty much the same as a Cadillac , and people listened .
They did n’t buy Caprices – virtually nobody did – but they did understand something : that luxury was n’t just for rich people any more , and that Cadillacs could n’t be all that special , if you could get all the Cadillac stuff on a Chevy .
At the same time as the fellows from Pontiac and Chevrolet were busy designing new variants of tufted - pillow seats and woodgrain shift knobs , the EPA and the insurance companies were busy nailing the coffin shut on the musclecar era .
Big power was all gone .
I ’ll tell you a secret , though : all of those Hemis , Six -Packs , and SS396es mostly existed in the imagination anyway .
The man on the street could n’t really afford ‘em , so he ended up buying a cheaper model with a detuned small - block V8 and a few racy stripes , and that ’s what really sold in the Sixties .
When that tumultuous decade came to a close , the average buyer was ready to relax in a genuinely comfortable car – and thanks to their new obsession with affordable luxury , GM , and their perennial imitators at Ford and Chrysler , found themselves ready to provide it .
What ’s the definition of luxury ?
That ’s a tough question , and one which keeps a lot of people very well - employed , but I would suggest that luxury is simply something beyond what the common man can afford .
So what do we make of the 1975 - 1985 era , where every car from the monstrous Cadillac Fleetwood to the compact X - body Buick Skylark , advertised as “ the little limousine ” , could be had with puffy velour seats , cruise control , power accessories , and a vinyl top ?
Let ’s call it Fake Luxury – luxury for everybody , which by definition is not luxury at all .
When every car on your street has wire - wheel hubcaps , there ’s nothing luxurious about ‘ em .
And when a Buick Skylark can be equipped the same way as a Cadillac de Ville , people are going to start to wonder whether it ’s worth buying a de Ville , and that started a long downward spiral for Cadillac .
The Buick Skylark was the “ little limousine ” , sporting a very Cadillac - esque set of seats .

By 1981 , ten long years after that original , mysterious decision at GM , Fake Luxury had taken complete and utter control of the market , to the point where a “ personal luxury car ” , the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme , was moving over half a million units a year and regularly winning the title of America ’s Best - Selling Car .
The man on the street no longer wanted rally stripes and a Positraction diff ; he wanted a Landau top and faux - woodgrain door pulls .
It took a practiced eye to tell the difference between the Caprice Classic , Park Avenue , Ninety - Eight Regency , and Fleetwood Brougham , as they were all vaguely prestigious - looking boxes that looked more like each other than anything else .
Every GM brand sold a full line of cars .
The Sloan hierarchy had been destroyed .
When a yacht - esque Olds Ninety - Eight Regency met a tiny Cadillac Cimarron in the church parking lot , who was the more successful owner ?
Was it better to have a Caprice Classic Brougham than a basic Caddy de Ville ?
For that matter , where did the Ford LTD Crown Victoria stand in relation to the base Lincoln Continental ?
At the time , it did n’t seem important .
All that mattered was moving the metal , and that was being done tolerably well even in light of rising fuel prices and the aftereffects of Jimmy Carter and his “ malaise ” economy .
There was plenty of alarm about “ foreign cars ” , but they did n’t account for all that much of the market .
In ’81 , GM still held nearly a sixty percent share of the US auto market , which meant that in reality it was mostly competing with itself .
The Park Avenue was a dead ringer for the Cadillac … including the fins .

1981 .
I remember it well .
It was in 1981 that Honda finished the expansion of its Marysville plant .
For the first time , a “ Japanese ” car – the 1982 Accord – would be built on American soil .
The unbelievable success of the Accord and its successors would trigger a firestorm of change in the auto industry that would eventually result in Toyota ’s becoming the largest automaker in the world , but for the purposes of this story , there was another 1981 introduction which deserves attention : the 1982 BMW 528e .
With that new “ E28 ” model , BMW would soon write a success story of its own , one which would end with the death of Fake Luxury and the introduction of Rich Corinthian Swaybars – and that , my friends , is a tale for another time .
The effects of heavy drinking may last days Binge drinking teenagers are still at risk of absent - mindedness and forgetfulness days later , a study says .
A team from Northumbria and Keele universities compared 26 binge drinkers with 34 non-bingers in memory tests , and found the drinkers fared worse .
They told the British Psychological Society conference that binge drinking could be harming developing brains .
A spokesman for the charity Addaction said drinking at dangerous levels was putting some young people at risk .
There is evidence that excess alcohol and binge drinking in particular damages parts of the brain that underpin everyday memory
Dr Thomas Heffernan , University of Northumbria
Binge drinking is already known to affect people 's memories of past events .
In this study , the scientists looked at students aged 17 to 19 - a period when the brain is still developing .
Binge drinking was defined as at least eight units a session for a man and six for a woman once or twice a week .
The researchers said the binge drinkers studied consumed , on average , 30 units in just two sessions .
' Storing up problems '
The teenagers were tested three or four days after their last drinking session , so that their bodies would be free of alcohol .
They were asked to answer questions about how often they forgot to carry out tasks they intended to do , such as meeting with friends .
They were shown a video clip of a shopping trip after being given a couple of minutes to memorise a set of tasks prompted by various cues in the film , such as remembering to text a friend at a certain shop , or to check their bank accounts after seeing a person sitting on a bench .
A small group of young people is drinking earlier in life and at dangerously high levels
Addaction spokesman Dr Thomas Heffernan , from the University of Northumbria and who led the study , said : " We found no differences between binge drinkers and non -binge drinkers in the self - reporting questionnaires , but when it came to the video the binge drinkers recalled significantly less than the non -binge drinkers .
" Although from their own reports they appeared to have good memories , they did n't perform as well in the video test .
" The binge drinkers recalled up to a third less of the items , a significant difference . "
He said it was possible that the pre-frontal cortex or hippocampus regions of the brain were being impaired .
Dr Heffernan added : " There is evidence that excess alcohol and binge drinking in particular damages parts of the brain that underpin everyday memory .
" Not only may these teenagers be harming their memory , if their brains are still developing they could be storing up problems for the future . "
A spokesman for the charity Addaction said : " While official figures show fewer young people are drinking overall , a small group of young people is drinking earlier in life and at dangerously high levels .
" Many of these young people are still at primary school and are drinking more than twice the recommended limit for adult women , with uncertain consequences for their future development . "

Cerrar brechas a la transmisión de la COVID - 19 en el país continúa siendo un reto permanente en medio del nuevo brote de la epidemia , que en los últimos 15 días ha provocado el contagio de 798 personas .
Ante ese escenario , resulta cada vez de mayor urgencia potenciar las pesquisas activas en las comunidades y el estudio profundo de quienes han estado relacionados con pacientes confirmados , así como sus contactos .
SANTIAGO , Chile 
When military forces loyal to Gen. Augusto Pinochet staged a coup here in September 1973 , they made a surprising discovery .
Salvador Allende ’s Socialist government had quietly embarked on a novel experiment to manage Chile ’s economy using a clunky mainframe computer and a network of telex machines .
The project , called Cybersyn , was the brainchild of A. Stafford Beer , a visionary Briton who employed his “ cybernetic ” concepts to help Mr. Allende find an alternative to the planned economies of Cuba and the Soviet Union .
After the coup it became the subject of intense military scrutiny .
In developing Cybersyn , Mr. Beer changed the lives of the bright young Chileans he worked with here .
Some 35 years later , this little - known feature of Mr. Allende ’s abortive Socialist transformation was remembered in an exhibit in a museum beneath La Moneda , the presidential palace .
A Star Trek - like chair with controls in the armrests was a replica of those in a prototype operations room .
Mr. Beer planned for the room to receive computer reports based on data flowing from telex machines connected to factories up and down this 2,700 - mile - long country .
Managers were to sit in seven of the contoured chairs and make critical decisions about the reports displayed on projection screens .
Researchers at Mattel Children 's Hospital UCLA have found that low - dose antidepressant therapy can significantly improve the overall quality of life for adolescents suffering from irritable bowel syndrome , or IBS .
The syndrome affects 6 percent of middle school students and 14 percent of high school kids in the United States .
The study , published in the May issue of the peer - reviewed Journal of Pediatrics , is the first of its kind to look at the effects of amitriptyline , a tricyclic antidepressant , in the pediatric IBS population , researchers said .
The research was conducted between 2002 and 2005 and involved 33 newly diagnosed IBS patients , including 24 girls , between the ages of 12 and 18 .
Irritable bowel syndrome causes discomfort in the abdomen , along with diarrhea , constipation or both .
Currently , there is no cure , and treatments only lessen the symptoms .
" While research has shown that amitriptyline is effective for adults with IBS , only peppermint oil has been studied in children with this disorder in a double - blind , placebo - controlled fashion , " said Dr. Ron J. Bahar , assistant clinical professor of pediatric gastroenterology at Mattel Children 's Hospital UCLA and lead author of the study .
" Our results show that amitriptyline significantly improves overall quality - of - life measurements in adolescents and should be a therapeutic option for these patients .
We were actually surprised to reach our conclusion with a relatively small number of subjects . "
The 13 - week study consisted of three phases : two weeks of enrollment and symptom scoring , eight weeks of therapy with amitriptyline or a placebo , and three weeks of post - medication " washout " and symptom scoring .
advertisement
Patients were randomized in a double - blinded fashion to receive the antidepressant or a placebo and were surveyed at two , six , 10 and 13 weeks using a symptom checklist , a pain - rating scale , a pain intensity and frequency scale , and an IBS quality - of - life questionnaire .
The results showed that patients receiving amitriptyline were more likely to experience :
An improvement in overall quality of life at six , 10 and 13 weeks .
A reduction in IBS - associated diarrhea at six and 10 weeks .
A reduction in pain near the belly button at 10 weeks .
A reduction in pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen at six , 10 and 13 weeks .
Bahar said that more than half of eligible patients , or their parents or guardians , refused to enroll in the study because they were uncomfortable with using an antidepressant medication of any kind , citing negative reports in the media about their side effects and the Food and Drug Administration 's formal 2004 " black box " warnings regarding the increased potential for suicide in children using antidepressants .
" However , the dose of AMI ( amitriptyline ) used in this study , as well as IBS treatment for adults , is far less than the dose to treat depression , " Bahar said .
" At these low levels , it could be considered a remedy to treat neuropathic pain associated with chronic pain symptoms , rather than an antidepressant or psychotropic medication . "
The next stage of research will look at the long - term follow - up of these patients to determine who will continue to stay well on the medication , whose symptoms resolve spontaneously and what other medications can be used as an alternative to amitriptyline for adolescents with IBS .
The research was funded by James L. Brooks and the Diane Brooks Medical Research Foundation of the California Community Foundation , and by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca .
Other study authors included Dr. Brynie S. Collins , Dr. Barry Steinmetz and Dr. Marvin Ament .
' Even the British were not this brutal '
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder watches as protesters from the Gujjar tribe in India block roads into the Indian capital , Delhi , as part of their demands to be included in affirmative action quotas for education and state jobs .
A huge security operation has been mounted
" Stop killing innocent Gujjars , " shout a group of a few hundred protesters squatting in the middle of a key highway leading into Delhi from the eastern state of Uttar Pradesh .
The eight - lane expressway , a major entry point into the capital and used by tens of thousands of commuters every day , is completely empty .
A row of policemen , batons and shields on hand , watch from a distance as the protesters burn an effigy of the chief minister of Rajasthan , Vasundhara Raje , and then lay about it with sticks .
Emotions are particularly high after a Rajasthan government crackdown on similar protests in the state last weekend .
' Violated ' " Forty of our comrades were killed , taking bullets in the head .
Even the British were not this brutal when we were fighting for our independence , " says the leader of the protesters , Joginder Singh Awana .
The protests have not been easy for police to disperse " The entire Gujjar community is angry .
We will not leave from here until our demands are met , " he adds .
" When a terrorist is killed by the police , the courts and human rights groups are all over the place , ordering an investigation and saying their rights have been violated , " says one of the protesters .
" When us Gujjars go on protest to demand what is our right , the police open fire and no one says anything .
What do you expect us to do ? "
Some of the protesters head off for a nearby market .
Sticks in hand they warn shopkeepers to pull down their shutters .
" Close all the shops .
Nothing will stay open today , " they shout .
Cat and mouse From early on Thursday , the police and security forces have been on high alert across the National Capital Region , making up Delhi and its suburbs .
There is particular concern at the upscale suburb of Gurgaon south - west of Delhi , home to many IT companies and international businesses .
Traffic is especially thin on National Highway 8 , which leads into Gurgaon from Rajasthan and onwards to Delhi past the international airport .
Many commuters and travellers have stayed home after advisories published in the daily newspapers , asking them to check with the police about the state of the roads before venturing out .
Across town in the south - east lies the Badarpur border , one of the busiest crossings into Delhi .
It lies on the highway connecting Delhi to Agra , home to the Taj Mahal .
It is also used by trucks bringing in supplies to Delhi .
The Gujjars say they have suffered years of discrimination Between Badarpur and Gurgaon are several villages with large Gujjar populations .
The police have been busy at night - stopping anyone from leaving the villages and in some instances , detaining community leaders .
Still , some protesters manage to sneak out .
It 's a cat and mouse game .
" We are expecting several hundred demonstrators to gather here shortly , " says police official Balwant Singh at the helm of a police team at Badarpur .
" But we are prepared for them , " he says jerking his head in the direction of his men .
All of them are kitted out with riot gear .
Significantly , very few of them are armed .
" Our orders are to allow the protests to go ahead and then we will ask them to leave , " says one policeman on the condition he not be named .
" We may have to use some force but there will be no firing , no use of arms . "
Clearly the government is anxious to avoid a repeat of last weekend 's violence in Rajasthan .
But the protesters are a determined lot , so even if there 's no violence in Delhi , the outcome elsewhere might be quite different .

Parents around the world must have thought their university - aged children had lost their senses in 1968 .
Spurning the benefits that two decades of post - war prosperity had brought , students went on strike , organized sit-ins and seemed bent on tearing down the old , conformist order and modelling a radical new world .
That was the summer when the idealistic Kenneth Everett Stone , a student activist , strode to the podium at Convocation Hall , accepted his honours Bachelor of Arts degree and , in a stunning act of protest , ripped his diploma in two .
He had a moment at the microphone .
" Fellow niggers " the 21 - year - old shouted in front of other University of Toronto graduates , professors and his uncomprehending parents .
" Look what Mr. Charlie 's done to your minds . "
( Mr. Charlie was a disparaging reference to white people . )
His education emphasized " marks , plagiarism and obedience , " he said .
He had hoped for collegiality and bracing debates with professors , but what he got instead was rote learning .
" This piece of paper is meaningless , " he declared .
Some stood and applauded in agreement .
Others shouted him down .
Emoke Szathmary , who also graduated that day , remembers how she felt as a 22 - year - old who had worked hard to put herself through university .
" I was amazed that he did it and further amazed that he did n't seem to think there was any quality in his education , that it was something shoddy , " she says from Winnipeg , where she is the president of the University of Manitoba .
" In those years you had to scramble for every nickel – if it was not worthwhile , I wondered , why did he stick around for four years ? "
Bob Bossin , another graduate and co-founder of the folk group Stringband , recalls worrying about Stone while admiring his " great little piece of political theatre .
" It was a way of saying the emperor has no clothes and that the system is vulnerable , do n't fall for it . "
Bossin deliberated but ultimately chose not to join Stone and tear up his degree that day .
" The ceremony was not so much for me , but for my mom – my dad was already dead – and my aunt .
I did n't feel like flipping them the bird . "
With convocation ceremonies beginning this week at U of T , it seemed appropriate to check in on Stone 40 years later .
He sits beside his wife , Kay , in their Hamilton kitchen while two of his four adult children listen to this story , which was front - page news in some Toronto newspapers .
The close - knit family lives in a small house built in 1914 on what was a gladiola farm and is now engulfed by the city .
" I was an angry young person , " says the 61 - year - old , his hair thin and his beard grey .
" The administration refused to acknowledge that students had a role to play in the planning of the university .
" But my thinking was n't fully developed , " continues Stone , who majored in political science and economics at Innis College .
" I 'd worked every summer , I 'd paid for it , and university was not what I 'd expected – a dream world , talking to the professors .
It was unrealistic . "
After all these years , Stone is still glad he did what he did .
Though for stronger impact , he says , he should have organized a band of students to tear up their diplomas with him or some other group action .
" I guess it was a sign I 'd be an iconoclast .
I already knew I 'd be opposition to the status quo . "
And he 's still angry .
His life has been a continuum – of carrying placards at protests , agitating for change and writing letters to the editor .
His boots have pounded the sidewalk in campaigns against racism and apartheid .
He was a leader in a local California - grape boycott and has housed Central American refugees .
Stone was a founding member of the Hamilton Association of Concerned Jewish Canadians to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza .
He also launched a suit against Chris Stockwell for a $ 3,000 bar tab the former Ontario energy minister and his staffers billed to taxpayers .
" He has never sold out , " says his friend Jim Zimmerman , now a book editor , who applauded him that day in Convocation Hall and later went to console Stone 's mother at home .
" He 's still working for social change . "
Although Stone 's first wife was also an activist , he says his political activity put a strain on the marriage .
" She got tired and resentful and we went our separate ways , " he recalls .
During the seven - year partnership they had Danny , now 32 , and Jessica , 30 .
Stone met Kay , with whom he has two children , through union work .
" He just stood out , " says the 54 - year - old nurse .
" It was more than just the issues of the local ; he had a bigger picture .
An injustice to one was an injustice to all . "
After getting his B.A. , Stone went to work for the Ontario Union of Students and , later , a fertilizer factory .
Then he drove a truck for Canada Post in Hamilton for 22 years , before moving on to a temporary position as grievance officer for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers .
Stone made an unsuccessful bid to be a Hamilton alderman in 1988 .
Two years later he returned to the University of Toronto for teacher training and made the dean 's list upon graduation .
He went on to earn a master 's degree in political science from McMaster .
There were lean years when he was a supply teacher with a hefty student loan and supporting Kay and his children on $ 18,000 a year .
He 's a full - time teacher now , outside of Hamilton .
" Because of my outspoken views , " he says , " I 've had to work in places where my activism is n't known . "
Stone does make time for the arts .
He 's currently reading The Hanging of Angélique , an exposé of slavery in Canada by Afua Cooper .
" I was astonished by the revelation that Jewish merchants were responsible for about 200 years of developing and expanding the slave trade in black Africans , " he says .
He and Kay have season tickets to Opera Hamilton .
And Stone is a folksinger .
" He does n't just go to the picket line – he writes the songs for it , too , " says Peter Shebib , a retired steelworker .
" He should have gotten a lot further in the union and politics – he's too honest and outspoken about the real issues ...
They like get - along folks . "
Stone and his family live modestly .
Their house needs painting .
There 's a 1965 Buick Skylark convertible in the garage , and Stone drives a ' 93 Saturn .
But he does n't regret a life that 's been marked by financial insecurity .
" I do n't really care about the money , " he says .
" My only regret is that I did n't make it into politics .
I think I could have contributed quite a bit . "

What makes him mad now ?
" George Bush 's war of terror against Arabs and Muslims , into which our own prime minister bought lock , stock and barrel .
We 're paying for a losing counterinsurgency war in Afghanistan , where our troops control the ground they are standing on for a moment . "
He berates Bush , ( Defence Minister ) Peter MacKay and ( Liberal Leader ) Stéphane Dion , saying they clamour for humanitarian interventions in Sudan 's Darfur region while creating humanitarian crises in Afghanistan and elsewhere .
After an interview , he sends an email saying : " I did n't get an opportunity to say anything about a spinoff effect of Bush 's war of terror " – the racial profiling of Arabs and Muslims in Canada , and the RCMP and CSIS " hatching of phony plots . "
" I think he 's angry at people who do n't think for themselves and are led like sheep , " says son Danny , an environmental technologist .
Stone grew up on Old Park Rd. in Forest Hill , one of four children of a building contractor .
He helped out his dad in the summer .
He was valedictorian at his Hebrew school at Beth Shalom Synagogue and dreamed of a career in politics .
He went on to Innis College at the University of Toronto .
The college was founded in 1964 to accommodate the baby boomers swelling university enrolment .
Unlike the traditional colleges at U of T , which were based on religious affiliation , Innis shaped its own personality .
" It evolved into a left - wing , socially conscious college embracing the spirit of change and dissent that was emerging in the late Sixties , " says Roger Riendeau , currently vice - principal of Innis .
" It seemed to attract those kinds of students . "
Someone at the time called Innis the " critical edge of the university . "
For students like Stone , the civil rights activists who came to Canada from sit-ins in Mississippi and hung around the common room , were galvanizing .
" It was a time of intellectual ferment , " he says .
" We were not accepting what we were being told ...
You could put out a leaflet at 9 a.m. and have an anti-war rally of 600 people at noon . "
He pauses .
" Now it takes a month .
In Hamilton you 'll get 125 people out . "
Stone , who became president of the Innis College Student Society , pushed hard to win the first student representation on the college council , which at that time was made up entirely of faculty and staff .
By 1969 , Innis was offering courses on cinema , urban studies , the environment and Canadian culture and society , all of which evolved into U of T's first interdisciplinary programs .
" I learned more about politics from the fight for student power than I ever could learn from books and in the classroom , " he says .
He admits to having made a mistake at convocation , but not the one you 'd think .
" I did n't tell my parents to stay away , " he says , holding his head in his hands .
" What a faux pas .
They were so proud .
And they were inconsolable . "
" Bubbe still holds it against you , " says Danny , referring to his paternal grandmother , Janet .
His brother , Brendan , 24 , who sat on their dad 's shoulders through anti-free trade demonstrations , will start a PhD in social and political thought at York University .
( Stone 's daughter Jessica works in health care in Australia , while Siobhan , 19 , attends the University of Guelph . )
Stone 's 93 - year - old widowed mother now lives in Baycrest Hospital .
" My son has a very brilliant mind , he 's very clever , " she says .
" But when he tore up his diploma I felt very badly .
I was very embarrassed .
I thought everyone was looking at me . "
To this day , she does n't understand why .
" He was always very loving and considerate of others and wanted to help everybody .
If he had not torn up his diploma , he may have been prime minister ... "
And she still can't accept that he believed in and initiated his act of protest .
" He did it because his friends dared him to . "
So Stone was more than happy to learn four years ago that Innis College was going to honour him as one of 40 outstanding " Innisians " being singled out for its its 40th anniversary .
Some alumni objected to his inclusion and urged vice - principal Riendeau to reconsider .
" I insisted he be recognized , " he says .
" I thought Ken reflected the spirit of Innis College ...
His defiant act was a principled statement . "

When smoked , crystal meth rapidly achieves high concentrations in the brain without the burdens of the intravenous route .
Kish reviews the actions of methamphetamine and explains the potential role of dopamine in methamphetamine craving .
The author states that there is no medication approved for the treatment of relapses of methamphetamine addiction , but potential therapeutic agents targeted to dopamine and non-dopamine systems are in clinical testing .
" Research into the pharmacologic treatment of methamphetamine addiction has largely been limited to studies in animals , " states Kish .
" Although animal studies are essential to the development of new medications , given the public health importance of this worldwide problem and the existence of potential drug targets , it is obvious that the very slow pace of clinical testing of new therapies in methamphetamine addiction needs to be accelerated . "
Prevention , treatment , enforcement and harm reduction form the 4 pillars of the York Region 's strategy to combat methamphetamine .
In their article , Cronkwright , Kirkos and colleagues recognize that criminal behavior is only one element in the production and use of methamphetamine , and they identify elected officials , school boards , the courts , at - risk communities and private industry as key stakeholders in the strategy .
When a star runs out of thermonuclear fuel and exits the main sequence , it has a limited number of options for what to do .
Depending on its mass , it could end lives as a white dwarf , a neutron star , a black hole , or it could go supernova on its way to one of those ending states .
A large fraction of stars will end their life as a white dwarf , so when a new type of white dwarf is discovered it can reveal more about what happens at the end of a star 's life on the main sequence .
Published in today 's issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters , a trio of astronomers from the University of Texas Austin reported on the discovery of a new type of white dwarf .
When a star ends as a white dwarf , it is classified by the type of material in its outer most shell .
The majority of white dwarfs , about 80 percent according to the article , have an outermost gas shell that consists of hydrogen .
The remaining 20 percent have had their shell of hydrogen stripped away for some reason , and have a outer layer of helium .
Last year , a new discovery reported that astronomers found a third type of white dwarf , a " hot carbon white dwarf . "
It is theorized that these carbon white dwarfs are the heaviest white dwarfs , they are believed to be just slightly too small to go out with a bang as a supernova .

Along with the discovery of carbon white dwarfs , it was calculated that pulsations could occur in these stars .
With the belief that these newly discovered types of stars should pulsate , their light output should be variable — changing in relation to the pulsations .
Using the Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory , the astronomers started a systematic search for one of these pulsating stars .
About 800 light - years away from Earth , the team found SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 .
This pulsating white dwarf lives in the constellation Ursa Major — about ten degrees east northeast of Mizar , the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper .
Its intensity fluctuated by about two percent over a period of eight minutes .
This find becomes important , according to the astronomers , because it can reveal some of the internal dynamics of the star and what happens at this stage of a star 's life .
The astronomers speculate that the pulsations are a result of ionized carbon cooling down as it becomes neutral carbon in the star 's atmosphere .
The authors state that other causes may be responsible for the observed behavior .
Further study , and the discovery of more stars of this type will help confirm or deny any current hypotheses .

LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama is distancing himself from expectations he would meet Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and taking a more cautious stand on talking to other U.S. adversaries .
With criticism from Republicans turning harsher as Obama moves closer to winning the Democratic nomination battle against rival Hillary Clinton , the Illinois senator has shifted -- but not abandoned -- his position .
Sen. John McCain , the Republicans ’ presumptive nominee for the November election , has expressed outrage that Obama would talk to Ahmadinejad , whose country does not recognize Israel and who has branded the Jewish state a “ stinking corpse . ”
“ There ’s definitely been an adjustment in what was initially a pretty categorical position , ” said Ross Baker , a political scientist a Rutgers University .
“ As ( Obama ) has gone around the country campaigning , he has realized he ’s had to fine - tune his position . ”
In a CNN presidential candidates debate in July 2007 , Obama was asked if he would be willing “ without precondition ” to meet with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea during the first year of his administration .
“ I would , ” Obama said .
“ And the reason is this , that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous . ”

CAREFUL PREPARATIONS
That put him at odds not only with Republicans but with Clinton , who said she would pursue more engagement with foes like Iran but not promise a top - level meeting immediately .
Obama later said that though he would not set preconditions on meetings , there would be careful preparations .
He calls President George W. Bush ’s approach “ cowboy diplomacy ” and links McCain to the president ’s foreign policy stance .
But as Republicans have painted him as someone who would be willing to “ cozy up ” to foes like Ahmadinejad , Cuban leader Raul Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , Obama and his advisers have emphasized preparation would precede any meeting with leaders of adversarial countries .
Obama said on Monday he would not guarantee a meeting with Ahmadinejad , since Iran is holding a presidential election in 2009 .
“ There ’s no reason why we would necessarily meet with Ahmadinejad before we know that he was actually in power .
He ’s not the most powerful person in Iran , ” Obama told reporters .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Under Iran ’s system of clerical rule , the Islamic Republic ’s religious establishment has final say in all state matters .
The Bush administration ’s stance on Iran was there would be no meetings unless Tehran agreed to suspend its nuclear enrichment program , Obama said .
“ Since presumably that is a major topic of conversation , what that really means is we ’re not going to talk to Iran , and that ’s the policy that they ’ve initiated , ” he said .
Preparations , by contrast , mean making sure that meetings begin “ with low - level diplomatic engagement and that there ’s a clear agenda so that any meetings would be constructive . ”
He also stressed a meeting does n’t guarantee concessions .
In a speech on Latin America last week , Obama said he would be willing to talk to Castro ’s communist government but “ at a time and place of my choosing ” and “ only when we have an opportunity to advance the interests of the United States . ”
The McCain campaign accuses Obama of backtracking and says that shows he lacks judgment on foreign policy matters .
Baker of Rutgers University said Obama ’s shift makes sense politically .
A meeting with Ahmadinejad would be unacceptable to Jewish voters whom Obama wants to court .
Promising unconditionally talks with Raul Castro might be unpalatable to Cuban - American voters , he said .
“ There are mid-course corrections in every campaign , ” Baker said .
“ It ’s better for him to make that course correction now than later in the campaign . ”

BBC News , Denver
In a downtown loft apartment in Denver , Colorado , a group of 30 - something women is having a party .
They joke easily with each other about men , cats and botox .
It 's more Sex and the City than Psycho , but party organiser Dana Shafman would have them believe they could easily be victims of violent crime .
She runs a company that sells Tasers , the electric stun guns used by security forces around the world .
In Colorado and other US states , it 's legal for ordinary people to own them .
Dana 's marketing them to women as the ideal personal protection device .
" I 've been to everyone 's Avon - type tupperware - style parties , purse parties , clothing parties , boutique parties and I felt like why not have a self - defence party ?
Why not have a Taser party , because without self - defence you wo n't have any of the other stuff . "
' Take it to the gym '
She gives a presentation , including worrying crime figures for Denver .
This is an unusual party , to say the least - there 's food , but no alcohol , and much of the time is spent listening to disturbing statistics
But she also goes on to show off the different colours that are available ( bright red , soft pink and electric blue are all on display ) and the fashionable accessories you can buy , including a carrying pouch made of fake leopard - print fur .
" I sometimes carry mine with me like this to the gym , " Dana says .
You can order your Taser at this party .
It 'll cost you US $ 350 to buy ( about £ 180 ) , and you 'll have to pass a background criminal record check first .
Dana says she sold two Tasers in the six months before she started the parties .
Now it 's one a day .
This is an unusual party , to say the least .
There 's food , but no alcohol , and much of the time is spent listening to disturbing statistics .
' Deaths in custody '
The lone male party guest is Kevin Sailor , an off - duty police officer , brought in to demonstrate how a Taser works .
The latest models are designed to appeal to women Like many a partygoer who does n't really know anyone , he spends much of the time on his own , slightly awkwardly standing with his ( soft ) drink .
But he holds court later , when explaining the device and how best to use it .
He 's a firm believer that Tasers are not permanently harmful - but civil liberties groups voice concerns over this .
The American Civil Liberties Union argues there have been a number of deaths in custody , following Taser use by security officials .
They want the devices more strongly regulated and oppose proliferation among civilians .
But when I ask Kevin Sailor if he thinks America would be a safer place if everyone owned a Taser , he says : " Everybody that 's a law - abiding citizen .
Obviously cirminals or convicted felons , no I do n't want them to be armed with one . "
He talks of levelling the playing field , and the party guests listen patiently and ask questions , but really they are just waiting to get their hands on a Taser and have a go .
Dana talks them through how to hold one , load it and fire it and then it 's their turn .
By the way , they 're aiming at a target pinned to a cork board , not each other .
' It kinda scared me '
The first guest steps up , fires and runs to other side of the room , smiling , pleased with herself .
Everyone else claps .
The metal - coated paper target lights up as the current surges through it .
" Do n't touch the wires , " warns Dana , " they 're live . "
Later she shows everyone the vicious metal barbs : " They 're even harder to pull out ! " she announces .
The next guest , Amanda Moseley , puts her baby daughter in another room , then takes her turn .
She fires , squeals and says : " It kinda scared me . "
Later she tells me she would consider buying one , because guns " are not really [ her ] thing " .
Growing phenomenon Veronica
Sword looks pretty excited to have a go .
" If it was n't in a party atmosphere , I probably would n't have ended up learning about Tasers , " she reveals .
Lena Guare , whose apartment this is , takes her turn and says : " I thought there would be more of a kick to it , because I 've shot guns before , but No , it was cool . "
She tells me she would consider buying one , because it might make her feel safer , especially when she goes running alone .
Parties like this are a growing phenomenon .
While national security is an important issue in the US presidential race , local elections in America are often fought on the question of personal safety - numbers of police officers , how they are armed and how secure people feel in their neighbourhoods .
In a country with about one gun for every adult , Tasers are sometimes touted as a less dangerous alternative .
While some criticise parties like this Denver soiree for putting more weapons on the streets , several people here , tonight at least , seem convinced it's an effective way to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms .

Take a closer look at the all - new 2020 Mazda CX - 30 .
It 's a right - sized SUV that 's built to make you feel alive .
SAN FRANCISCO 
Tech companies and retailers are offering more financing options to business customers as the credit crunch spurs demand for the programs .
Office Depot ( ODP ) later this year will begin renting computers and office equipment valued at $ 500 to $ 10,000 .
Microsoft's ( MSFT ) financing arm plans to lend about $ 1.25 billion to customers , up from $ 780 million last year .
And Ingram Micro ( IM ) , a big reseller of tech gear to businesses , is offering no -money - down software purchases and other options .
More could be on the horizon .
Dell ( DELL ) spent $ 306 million in December to bring its financing operation completely in - house .
" I see a growing interest ( in financing ) , " says tech analyst Spencer Richardson at researcher AMI - Partners .
About 17 % of U.S. businesses with more than 250 employees purchased tech products through vendor financing in 2007 , up from 5 % in 2006 , Richardson says .
Credit and leases are popular because they help sell more products while allowing customers to get gear without big cash outlays .
Now the trend is accelerating as businesses become more cash - strapped and reasonably priced bank loans and credit cards are harder to find , Richardson says .
Costs vary , but vendor loans sometimes have lower interest rates .
Chief information officers " are squeezed , " says Gary Beach , publisher of CIO magazine .
" Financing deals are certainly more attractive . "
At IBM ( IBM ) , one of the biggest money lenders , customers asking about financing " dramatically increased " in the past six months , general manager John Callies says .
IBM has n't changed its credit qualifications in response to the economic shift .
Yet it extended $ 30.5 billion in commercial leases and loans in 2007 , up from $ 28.0 billion in 2006 .
Financing can become a liability if too many customers default .
That happened during the dot - com bust of 2001 .
Other problems can crop up , too .
Dell and its outsourcing partner were sued last year by the New York attorney general over alleged predatory lending .
IBM , Ingram Micro and others say they 're carefully evaluating customers .
" So far , so good , " says Ross Crane , CFO of Ingram Micro 's North American division .
" We 're still seeing very healthy credit conditions in the ( business - to - business ) market . "
Customers are also watching out for bad deals , Beach says .
But that 's not stopping the financing wave .
MasterIT , a 20 - person firm near Memphis , sells tech products to other businesses and also offers an all - leasing package .
About a third of MasterIT 's customers used to take the leasing deal , but now half do , CEO J. Michael Drake says .
" People are being affected by $ 4 gasoline , the subprime market and the general cloud that hangs over the economy , " he says .

While Industry Minister Jim Prentice and Canadian officials continue to remain mum about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a report out of the U.S. suggests that there is considerable reason for public concern .
Congress Daily ( sub req ) quotes a high - level official from the USTR as indicating that the talks are gaining steam , with a binding international agreement likely by the end of the year .
The USTR official continued by noting that the treaty will focus on international cooperation , enforcement practices , and a legal framework .
The article confirms that the USTR comments are consistent with the document leaked last week that has led to front page headlines in Canada .
This suggests that the two - part Prentice plan is rapidly coming together – a Canadian DMCA could be introduced next week , while by the end of the year Canada may have agreed to an international treaty that mandates new levels of surveillance for ISPs and border guards .
The effect of these reforms will dramatically reshape Canadian law with Prentice and Prime Minister Stephen Harper rolling out the red carpet for President George Bush 's demands and leaving Canadians wondering how their consumer , property , and privacy rights suddenly disappeared .
Palestinian medical sources in the central Gaza Strip town of Deir Elbalah , announced that a five - year - old child was killed on Sunday by Israeli army gunfire in the central Gaza Strip refugee camp of aL - Buraij .
Abdullah Bahar , 5 , arrived as a dead body at the Shuhada aL - Aqsa hospital in Deir Ealbalah , as he sustained several shrapnel into various parts of his head and body , the sources said .
The medics confirmed that four other inhabitants were also injured by the Israeli army fire .
Witnesses said that an Israeli army force , made up of a column of tanks , incurred today afternoon to the east of aL - Buraij refugee camp , just close to the Gaza - Israel border line .
Witnesses added that the incurring force opened heavy fire at Palestinian - inhabited houses in the area , before it rolled back to positions inside the Israeli borders .
Recently , the Israeli army has intensified small - scale ground offensives on different parts of the border lines with the Gaza Strip , claiming last week alone the lives of four Palestinians , at least .
Microsoft and Novell announced yesterday that they are intensifying their joint effort to persuade Chinese IT executives to pay for their software , specifically through the much maligned marketing relationship that finds Redmond beating its deafening drum for the SUSE Linux Enterprise distribution controlled by its onetime bitter , now compliant rival .
The press release issued by the two companies focuses of a trio of Chinese companies -- People 's Insurance , The Dairy Farm Company and Dawning Information Industry -- that have agreed to pony up for SUSE support through Microsoft .
" It 's very encouraging to see that our business and technical collaboration continues to resonate with customers around the globe , " said Ron Hovsepian , president and CEO of Novell .
" Both Novell and Microsoft are committed to furthering this alliance , and we could n't be happier with the results to date .
PICC , Dairy Farm and Dawning exemplify the benefits our strengthened alliance provides for the international IT community . "
" We recognize that our customers want to use Microsoft products in heterogeneous environments , and therefore we are pleased to offer this option to meet customer needs in one of the leading global markets , " said Ya - Qin Zang , Microsoft corporate vice president and chairman of Microsoft China .
" We are very pleased with the initial response in the Chinese market to our joint offerings for IP peace of mind and technology interoperability in such areas as virtualization and high - performance computing . "
That " peace of mind " business can be taken any number of different ways .
Microsoft , of course , is not in this to sell SUSE Linux or to advance the cause of open source .
From this morning 's Boston Globe :
Al Gillen , software analyst at IDC Corp. in Framingham , said that Microsoft wants businesses to pay for software , even if it 's Linux instead of Windows .
" From Microsoft 's point of view , nonpaid Linux is a bad thing , " he said , " because it implies that there 's no value to the operating system , regardless of what operating system it is . "
Persuading companies to pay for Linux turns it into a commercial product , like Windows .
That makes it easier for Microsoft to compete against Novell .
" Over time , of course , Microsoft is going to try to move those customers off of Linux and onto Windows , " Gillen said .
In the meantime , memory of the Novell that used to be continues to fade with each passing day , witness the appearance of NetWare on this ignominious list of " 5 IT skills that wo n't boost your salary . "

In brief comments on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania , former President Clinton said that his fundraising relationship with a Chinese company involved in Internet censorship did not pose a potential conflict of interest for his wife ’s presidential campaign .
Even though the Chinese Web firm , Alibaba Inc. , recently carried a government - issued Internet “ wanted notice ” urging the arrest of Tibetan protesters , he said that he backed Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s tough words on China .
“ I support the Dalai Lama and I support Hillary ’s position , ” he said in remarks posted online today by the New York Observer .
He made the comments Sunday during a campaign event for his wife in Bloomsburg , Pa .
In recent weeks , Sen. Clinton has issued strong statements about mainland China ’s crackdown in Tibet and urged President Bush to boycott the opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing .
She has also called for a “ dialogue ” between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama .

But her stance appears at odds with her husband ’s dealings with Alibaba and his 2005 speech at an Internet forum in Hangzhou , China .
A Times article Sunday , 1,254417.story reported that Alibaba paid for some of his expenses and donated an unspecified amount to his foundation after the speech .
Alibaba has been accused by human rights groups of cooperating with Chinese officials in their scrutiny of mainland Internet users .
Bill Clinton said Sunday that his foundation ’s 2005 donation from Alibaba played a role in his efforts to battle the AIDS virus .
“ They help me save lives in China , ” he said .
Tax filings for his AIDS foundation in 2005 do not mention Alibaba or its donation .
A foundation spokeswoman said that Alibaba ’s 2005 contribution had gone to his main foundation and not to his AIDS effort , which was later absorbed into the foundation .

The former president has relied on Chinese connections for his foundation and for lucrative speaking engagements .
In December 2004 , according to the Chicago Tribune , 0,5935166.story , he appeared at a New York launch party for Accoona , an Internet search engine .
Accoona later issued his foundation options for 200,000 shares of its stock .
Accoona ’s main partner in its Internet venture was the China Daily Information Co. , a subsidiary of China Daily , the Chinese government - published English - language newspaper .
He also visited mainland China at least four other times between 2001 and 2005 , reaping at least $ 1.25 million in speaking fees from Chinese groups .

We 'll let you read the hed again -- nope , it 's not a joke .
Apparently millions of tiny swarming ants called " crazy raspberry ants " are causing quite a ruckus down in Houston after they accidentally arrived on board a cargo ship and started busily invading homes and offices , where they are attracted to electrical equipment .
So far they 've messed up sewage pumps , cause fire alarms to go haywire , destroyed computers , and taken out at least one gas meter -- and since they 're resistant to over - the - counter ant killers and each colony has multiple queens , they 're nearly impossible to kill .
Worse , those that do die are used by the remaining ants as bridges over pesticide - treated areas .
Yep , that 's insanely creepy .
Anyone in Houston got any horror stories to share ?

In the past three weeks , the discussion about the future of airlines has shifted from possible mergers to impending bankruptcies .
Is a merger preferable to a long , fast slide toward deeper financial trouble ?
Let 's take American .
A deal has to be preferable to the difficult work of scraping a living out of the airlines ' dying business model .
American -- one of the few airlines to win kudos from analysts on its business -- has been battling rising fuel costs and an aging fleet that has been staggering around the skies for an average of 14 years .
Oil prices right now make up 40 % of American 's operating costs .
American will force travelers to pay $ 15 for the first checked bag , which would raise a paltry $ 320 million a year in extra revenue , according to Citigroup analysts .
That would n't even cover American 's first - quarter loss of $ 328 million .
That $ 320 million also is n't going to put much of a dent in American 's estimated burn of $ 2.5 billion for each of the next three years .
That 's going to eat into American 's cash balance of $ 5 billion .
Think about it : American paid $ 2.1 billion for fuel just in the first quarter .
And there 's more :
The airline is planning to cut jobs , capacity and customers .
( Yes , it 's come to cutting customers ) .
In addition , management is facing a public demonstration from the really ticked - off pilots ' union .
On American 's last conference call , CEO Gerard Arpey said he was " very mindful of that experience " of the firm 's recovery from near - bankruptcy in 2003 and 2004 .
" That is why we have , for many years , been working very hard on our capital structure and our cash balance and the pay - down of debt and putting ourselves in the best possible position to weather this kind of storm , " he said .
But financial engineering seems to have come to the end of its usefulness for American .
An analyst on the first quarter earnings call bluntly told Arpey , " the market seems to be reaching a conclusion that an AMR bankruptcy filing is increasingly , shall we say , difficult to completely rule out . "
Last week , American convinced its lenders to relax the minimum cash - flow ratio it needs to keep two credit facilities totaling $ 695 million .
Does that sound like good news ?
In addition , the industry needs capacity cuts of 20 % , J.P. Morgan analysts estimated .
That 's never been done outside of a liquidation .
But a merger also helps cut capacity .
J.P. Morgan 's Jamie Baker wrote last month , " This is how consolidation is best framed , in our view .
Not in terms of short - lived revenue synergies , but rather by what the industry saves by flying less . "

If not for the fact Bill O’Reilly is an operative , possibly for the CIA — fully in control of the corporate media by way of the CIA ’s Operation Mockingbird — we might write the “ No Spin Zone ” bully off as an ignoramus , no different than millions of people who are completely clueless about history , even relatively recent history .
After Rockefeller flunky Bill Moyers interviewed Rev. Jeremiah Wright on PBS , Bill went through the ceiling because Moyers did not confront Wright on his assertion that the United States has used the AIDS virus against the black community and the United States and al - Qaeda are “ equal partners in evil , ” both declarations sufficiently documented , especially the latter .
Rev. Wright also said the United States government sold bio and chemical weapons to Saddam Hussein .
For stating the truth , Bill O and the neocons slandered Wright as “ anti-American . ”
In response to this corporate media blitz , Obama has “ divorced ” his former preacher .
It may not be enough to save his bid for the presidency , however .
“ In fact , in fact , in fact , one of the — one of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological warfare was a non- question , because all we had to do was check the sales records .
We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people , ” Wright said during a speech at the National Press Club .
As Dr. Leonard Horowitz told Alex Jones today , the United States indeed sold biological and chemical weapons to Saddam Hussein .
But do n’t expect the corporate media to research and report this bedrock fact .
Instead , they unleash Bill O , a scurrilous ad hominem bully and sexual pervert .
Back in September , 2002 , months before the neocons used the WMD argument to pave the way to invade Iraq and kill more than a million innocent people , I researched and wrote about the fact the United States sold Saddam Hussein massive amounts of biological and chemical weapons .
In order to learn the truth , all I needed was the Google search engine , in other words the evidence is out in the open , not that we should expect the corporate media to follow up .
Here is my article , posted on the Counterpunch site :
Bush Senior : Hating Saddam , Selling Him Weapons
In an interview with CNN ’s Paula Zahn , former president George Bush spoke recently of his “ hatred ” of Saddam Hussein .
“ I hate Saddam Hussein , ” said Bush .
” I do n’t hate a lot of people .
I do n’t hate easily , but I think he ’s , as I say , his word is no good and he ’s a brute .
He ’s used poison gas on his own people .
So , there ’s nothing redeeming about this man . ”
The former president claims to hate Saddam simply because he is “ no good ” and a “ brute . ”
Zahn does not bother to probe deeper .
Paula Zahn ’s ratings are dismal these days .
Her former boss over at FOX News said , “ a dead raccoon could get higher ratings . ”
The Bush interview , obviously , is good for Zahn ’s floundering career .
As such , we should n’t expect Zahn to push Bush Senior on the particulars of his hatred .
Not these days , anyway , when the corporate media essentially plays second fiddle for the government .
Hatred in the wake of the Gulf War is not unique .
For instance , Wasli el - Ghazali , most assuredly hated Bush and America .
Ghazali was convicted back in 1994 for his role in a plot to murder George Bush the Elder during a visit to Kuwait .
“ Every Arab child is worth all of America , ” Ghazali told Robert Fisk of the Independent .
“ I am an Iraqi citizen .
Bush killed 16 members of my family . ”
In response to the failed –and some would say bogus–plot to kill Bush , Clinton fired 23 Tomahawk missiles into Baghdad on June 26 , 1993 ( more than a year before the conviction of Ghazali and his co-conspirators ) .
Seven of these “ precision guided ” missiles missed their target ( or did they ? ) and hit civilian housing , killing eight people , including the renowned artist Leila al - Attar .
Clinton later told the American people they could “ feel good ” about the attack .
No word if Clinton , like Bush , hates Saddam Hussein–or , for that matter , innocent Iraqi civilians , including artists .
Bush did not tell CNN’s Zahn if the assassination plot was the particular incident that stoked his hatred of the Iraqi dictator , nor did the anchor ask .
It is fair to conclude Bush has not always hated Saddam .
Or if he has hated Saddam all these years , he put that hatred aside in the name of statecraft .
Reagan , Bush , the Iraqi dictator , and American corporations have worked together over the years .
War and death make for good business .
It also makes for lies and deception–and possibly for less than truthful interviews .
Former Reagan official and National Security Council staffer Howard Teicher has described a less than hateful relationship between the Reagan administration and Saddam Hussein .
In 1995 , Teicher offered an affidavit in the Teledyne case , a legal sideshow to a larger scandal known as “ Iraqgate . ”
According to Teicher , he and Donald Rumsfeld traveled to Iraq to make sure the Iraqi dictator received what he needed in order to win the Iran - Iraq war–or if not win at least make sure there was a draw .
“ CIA Director Casey personally spearheaded the effort to ensure that Iraq had sufficient military weapons , ammunition and vehicles , ” Teicher swore in the affidavit .
Teicher claims the United States “ actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars of credits , by providing US military intelligence and advice to the Iraqis , and by closely monitoring third country arms sales to Iraq to make sure Iraq had the military weaponry required . ”
Reagan also sent a secret message to Saddam , which then vice president Bush delivered to Egyptian President Mubarak , and Mubarak passed on to Saddam , “ telling him that Iraq should step up its air war and bombing of Iran . ”
Reagan CIA director Casey wanted to give Saddam cluster bombs , which “ were a perfect ‘ force multiplier ’ that would allow the Iraqis to defend against the ‘ human waves ’ of Iranian attackers , ” explained the former NSC staffer .
He recorded Casey ’s comments in meeting minutes , which are now in the Ronald Reagan presidential archives in Simi Valley , California .
In 1982 , Reagan “ legalized ” direct military assistance to Iraq .
This resulted in more than a billion dollars in military related exports .
According to Kenneth R. Timmerman ( author of The Death Lobby : How the West Armed Iraq ) the US government under Reagan and Bush sold Iraq 60 Hughes MD 500 “ Defender ” helicopters , eight Bell Textron AB 212 military helicopters equipped for anti-submarine warfare , 48 Bell Textron 214 ST utility helicopters ( sold for “ recreational ” purposes ) , and US military infra-red sensors and thermal imaging scanners ( sold illegally to Iraq through a Dutch company ) .
After the Gulf War , the International Atomic Energy Agency found the following US equipment in Iraq : spectrometers , oscilloscopes , neutron initiators , high - speed switches for nuclear detonation , and other tools used to develop and manufacture nuclear weapons .
“ One entire facility , a tungsten - carbide manufacturing plant that was part of the Al Atheer complex , ” Timmerman told the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs , “ was blown up by the IAEA in April 1992 because it lay at the heart of the Iraqi clandestine nuclear weapons program , PC - 3 .
Equipment for this plant appears to have been supplied by the Latrobe , Pennsylvania manufacturer , Kennametal , and by a large number of other American companies , with financing provided by the Atlanta branch of the BNL bank . ”
BNL–or Banca Nazionale del Lavoro–provided more than $ 5 billion in unauthorized loans to Iraq , including $ 900 million guaranteed by the US government .
“ About half of the money allegedly went to finance the purchase of US farm products , including $ 900 million guaranteed by the Agriculture Department ’s Commodity Credit Corp. , but investigators said much of the rest had helped fuel Iraq ’s military buildup , ” wrote George Lardner in the Washington Post on 22 March 1992 .
Lardner and others were learning about covert and illegal arms sales to Iraq through Representative Henry B. Gonzalez , chairman of the House Banking Committee .
Gonzalez was conducting “ special orders ” –uninterrupted speeches on the House floor –detailing the criminal behavior of Reagan and Bush .
Hardly anybody paid attention , least of all Bush , who was running for a second term .
While Bush Junior declares he “ will not allow … a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very future by developing weapons of mass destruction , ” the administration of his father and Reagan , as the Gonzalez revelations demonstrate , apparently did n’t have the future of America in mind when they allowed biological and chemical weapons–as well as massive amounts of conventional military hardware –to be exported to Iraq .
They were only interested in making sure Saddam gassed as many Iranians as possible–and thus pay back the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for evicting the despised Shah Reza Pahlavi and initiating an anti-western revolution in Iran .
No doubt it irks Bush , Cheney , neocons in general , and a few multinational oil corporations that Iran is calling the shots on its oil resources .
The US Department of Commerce licensed 70 biological exports to Iraq between 1985 and 1989 , including at least 21 batches of lethal strains of anthrax .
The French newspaper Le Figaro , in an article published in 1998 , said researchers at the Rockville , Maryland lab of the American Type Culture Collection confirmed sending anthrax samples via mail order to Iraq .
After the Gulf War , Iraq made several declarations to UN weapons inspectors about how they had weaponized the anthrax sent to them by the American corporation .
In 1985 , the US Centers of Disease Control sent samples of an Israeli strain of West Nile virus to a microbiologist at the Basra University in Iraq .
In addition , Iraq received other “ various toxins and bacteria , ” including botulins and E. coli .
Corporations that have sold dual - use chemicals and biological samples to Iraq for its weapons program include : Phillips Petroleum , Unilever , Alcolac , Allied Signal , the American Type Culture Collection , and Teledyne .
Teledyne pled guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy , false statements , and violations of the Export Administration Act and the Arms Export Control Act for indirectly exporting 130 tons of zirconium to Iraq through Chilean arms manufacturer Carlos Cardoen .
The zirconium was intended for use in cluster bombs .
In defense , Teledyne argued during the trial that the CIA had authorized the shipments .
The Baltimore company Alcolac was convicted of illegally selling thiodiglycol–a chemical precursor used in the production of mustard gas–for use in Iraq ’s chemical warfare program .
When Murray Waas and Craig Unger published an article in The New Yorker about the Reagan administration and Bush ’s involvement with Saddam Hussein–a full three years before Howard Teicher ’s revelatory affidavit–they were roundly condemned and mocked by the corporate media .
Steven Emerson of the Wall Street Journal called the article a “ Byzantine conspiracy theory , ” while Michael Fumento , a syndicated columnist , said the story was “ a big fat nothing , ” baseless innuendo that “ spread like a flesh - eating bacteria into newspapers , newsmagazines , and television news throughout the country . ”
Others accused a liberal media of attempting to derail Bush ’s re-election bid .
During the election , Bill Clinton promised , if elected , he would appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate the Iraqgate scandal .
But like so many election promises Iraqgate fell off the radar screen not long after Clinton assumed office .
Worse , when former NSC staffer Howard Teicher presented his affidavit in 1995 , the Clinton Justice Department went on the offensive , accused Teicher of lying , and then promptly classified the document as a state secret .
On January 15 , 1995 , attorney general Janet Reno and deputy John Hogan released a Final Report whitewashing the entire affair .
It was hoped the whole thing would simply fade away .
Except for a few books and other “ Byzantine conspiracy theories , ” the Reagan - Bush - Iraqgate scandal has pretty much slipped from public view .
In general , the corporate media gave but cursory notice to the revelations .
“ There ’s a good reason why we in the media are so partial to a nice , torrid sex scandal , ” said Ted Koppel , as he opened a Nightline Iraqgate report in 1992 .
“ It is , among other things , so easy to explain and so easy to understand .
Nothing at all , in other words , like allegations of a government cover - up , which tend to be not at all easy to explain , and even more difficult to understand . ”
In short , according to Koppel and the corporate media , the American people do not have the intelligence to judge for themselves if their leaders are criminals .
Obviously , Monica Lewinsky is more important .
As Dubya the Junior and his coterie of chick hawks prepare to make war on a Frankenstein Bush the Senior–at least in part–created , the revelations exposed by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez and a handful of others need to be revisited within the full context of public debate .
However , considering the handmaiden role of corporate media in the dissemination of government propaganda–and its insistence upon offering vacuous interviews by the likes of Paula Zahn–chances are the American people will not be allowed to understand any time soon what the government does in their name .
Our only hope , it would seem , rests in “ Byzantine conspiracy theories . ”

England ’s absence from Euro 08 pretty much means that the 170 or so players available for selection to Fabio Capello will put their legs up this summer and relax .
But what about the fans ?
There ’s the Euro 2008 to look forward to – even if you ’re an England fan , the excruciating lack of football in the summer means that we ’ll grab on to anything , even when we have no stake in the matches being played out .

The following video helps you do just that – with barely - naked , sizzling hot women playing gorgeous one - touch football .
Everything you ’ve ever secretly imagined about playing football with women ( such as springing the offside trap , taking shots on goal from all different angles and quickly shifting from slow intricate one - touch moves to fast , long and hard and back – you know … ) comes true with this video clip …and then some .

Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe sent a new memo out to superdelegates today urging them to make their decision now , and support Barack Obama .
“ With the Clinton path to the nomination getting even narrower , we expect new and wildly creative scenarios to emerge in the coming days .
While those scenarios may be entertaining , they are not legitimate and will not be considered legitimate by this campaign or its millions of supporters , volunteers , and donors , ” Plouffe wrote .
He correctly pointed out that the Clinton campaign keeps creating an alternative reality , “ The Clinton campaign was very clear about their own strategy until the numbers become too ominous for them .
They were like a broken record , repeating ad nauseum that this nomination race is about delegates .
Now , the word delegate has disappeared from their vocabulary , in an attempt to change the rules and create an alternative reality . ”

Plouffe urged superdelegates to move from the theoretical and into reality , “ At some point – we would argue that time is now – this ceases to be a theoretical exercise about how superdelegates view electability .
The reality of the preferences in the last several weeks offer a clear guide of how strongly superdelegates feel Senator Obama will perform in November , both in building a winning campaign for the presidency as well as providing the best electoral climate across the country for all Democratic candidates . ”
Plouffe concluded by reminding superdelegates about the rules they made , “ Senator Obama , our campaign and our supporters believe pledged delegates is the most legitimate metric for determining how this race has unfolded .
It is simply the ratification of the DNC rules – your rules – which we built this campaign and our strategy around . ”
I think this is the final push to get Obama over the top .
The Obama campaign now has the results on their side .
I suspect that we wo n’t see a flood of superdelegates , but probably an increased flow towards Obama in the coming weeks .
The endorsements had already dried up for Clinton weeks ago , so I think many superdelegates are content to wait until after June 3 to make Obama the official nominee .

Mrs. Clinton showed a tendency toward an insular management style , relying on a coterie of aides who have worked for her for years , her aides and associates said .
Her choice of lieutenants , and her insistence on staying with them even when friends urged her to shake things up , was blamed by some associates for the campaign ’s woes .
Again and again , the senator was portrayed as a manager who valued loyalty and familiarity over experience and expertise .
Mrs. Clinton stood by Mr. Penn and Patti Solis Doyle , who was until last month her campaign manager , even as her campaign was at risk of letting Mr. Obama sew up the nomination .
When some of her closest supporters pressed her to replace them , arguing that the two were clearly struggling with their jobs and had become divisive figures in the campaign , she responded by saying she would “ think about it . ”
When Mrs. Clinton finally pushed out Ms. Solis Doyle , she chose Ms. Williams , like Ms. Solis Doyle , an old friend who had never before managed a presidential campaign .
Mrs. Clinton ’s ability to manage the one person with whom she spoke most often , former President Bill Clinton , was also questioned by some of her advisers and supporters .
Mr. Clinton moved in his own orbit  he heatedly argued with his wife ’s advisers who wanted to write off South Carolina , defying them to campaign there  and took no direction from the campaign about what to say or where to go , some of them said .
( Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in the South Carolina Democratic primary by nearly 29 percentage points . )
Several aides , donors and supporters , who requested anonymity to recount private conversations with the candidate , said they had warned Mrs. Clinton that her husband ’s attacks on Mr. Obama were demeaning to her and hurting her campaign .
Mrs. Clinton replied that her husband became “ carried away ” at times but that she did not see any real harm from his approach , they said .
Mrs. Clinton ’s top advisers said that while her management style might be untidy , it showed her to be comfortable with conflicting ideas among her aides .
They said she had pronounced herself “ ready to learn ” from her mistakes and was resistant to placing too much power in the hands of a single political adviser in the mold of Karl Rove in President Bush ’s two campaigns for the White House .
“ She thinks the way to manage effectively is to get a lot of smart people around who do n’t agree and let them work out their differences creatively , ” said Howard Wolfson , her communications director .
“ Let them hash through things , and as a result , you come up with the best process . ”

FOXNews Sunday host Chris Wallace is shocked ( shocked , I tell you ! ) that the GOP tactic of tying local candidates to Rev. Wright via Barack Obama could possibly be considered race - baiting .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Dean : Chris , the Republicans … for the last 30 years , the Republican ( play ) book has been to race bait and to use hate and divisiveness .
In 2006 , the American people said no to that ; I think they ’re going to say no to that in 2008 .
It is true that the economy , the war and healthcare are more important to the American people .
They are tired of the divisiveness of what the Republicans have done to them .
And that ’s why the Republicans are in trouble .
Deep trouble .
Another four years of George Bush is not what we need …
Wallace : Governor , are you suggesting that bringing up Jeremiah Wright is “ race - baiting ” and hate and divisive ?
Dean :
Yeah , I am suggesting that kind of stuff .
I think when you start bringing up candidates that have nothing to do with the issues…uh when you start bringing up things that have nothing to do with the candidate , nothing to do with the issues , that ’s race - baiting .
And that ’s exactly what it is .
Just like Willie Horton was race - baiting so many years ago .
I think we ’re going to take …we ’re going to turn the page on this stuff .
I ’ll tell you , there ’s a lot of difference between the Republicans and the Democrats on issues , but the biggest issue of all is we do n’t use this kind of stuff .
We never have used this kind of stuff and we ’re not going to start now .
America is more important than the Republican party and that ’s the lesson the voters are about to teach the Republicans .

Two years ago , we pointed to one of the more ridiculous lawsuits attempting to shift the blame and responsibility for certain actions away from those who were responsible , to those who had the money .
A 13 - year - old girl went onto MySpace , lied about her age , and struck up a relationship with an older boy .
Eventually , the two agreed to meet , and the girl says that the boy sexually assaulted her .
So , obviously , the mother of the 13 - year - old girl sued MySpace .
It seemed like such a good strategy that the boy accused of rape also considered blaming MySpace .
Of course , as you should know by now , section 230 of the CDA ( and basic common sense ) protects websites from the actions of their users .
And , in fact , that 's exactly what the judge told the woman and her daughter in tossing out the case .
Rather than understanding the law ( and basic responsibility ) , the mother of course appealed the decision , and even tried to come up with a novel argument for why this was n't about section 230 at all , by saying that the company was somehow negligent in " policing its premises . "
Luckily ( and not surprisingly ) the judge is n't buying it .
Eric Goldman lets us know that the appeals court has again sided with MySpace in pointing out that there is no liability for MySpace .
They also tried to pull in the recent ( somewhat questionable ) Roommates.com decision , which was in a different circuit and argued that Roommates.com lost safe harbors because it specifically requested illegal information ( which probably would n't even apply in this case ) .
However , since appeals are only on the facts argued in the lower court and this was an entirely new argument , the court refused to consider it .
Either way , this still seems like a case where the girl and her mother are blaming the wrong party in trying to squeeze millions of dollars out of MySpace .
The best summation of the situation probably comes from the transcript of the original trial court hearing , which the appeals court quoted :
Filed Under : liability , section 230 , sexual assault
Companies : myspace
A University of Leicester space scientist has worked out that sending texts via mobile phones works out to be far more expensive than downloading data from the Hubble Space Telescope .
Dr Nigel Bannister ’s calculations were used for the Channel 4 Dispatches programme “ The Mobile Phone Rip - Off ” .
He worked out the cost of obtaining a megabyte of data from Hubble – and compared that with the 5 p cost of sending a text .
He said : “ The bottom line is texting is at least 4 times more expensive than transmitting data from Hubble , and is likely to be substantially more than that .
“ The maximum size for a text message is 160 characters , which takes 140 bytes because there are only 7 bits per character in the text messaging system , and we assume the average price for a text message is 5 p .
There are 1,048,576 bytes in a megabyte , so that 's 1 million / 140 = 7490 text messages to transmit one megabyte .
At 5 p each , that 's £ 374.49 per MB - or about 4.4 times more expensive than the ‘ most pessimistic ’ estimate for Hubble Space Telescope transmission costs . ”
Dr Bannister said it had been difficult to work out exactly how much Hubble data transmission costs .
So he contacted NASA who gave him a firm figure of £ 8.85 per megabyte ( MB ) for the transmission of data from HST to the Earth .
“ This does n't include the cost of the ground stations and the time of the personnel along the way , but it is an unambiguous number for that part of the process .
So that 's £ 8.85 to get each MB from Hubble , to the first point of contact on the ground , but no further .
Hence we need to go a little bit further to estimate exactly how much it costs to transmit data from Hubble to the end user - i.e. to the data archive which scientists can access .
This is difficult , so I had to make some conservative assumptions . ”
Dr Bannister estimated the cost of the data from Hubble could vary between £ 8.85 and £ 85 per MB - much cheaper than the £ 374.49 per MB cost of transmitting one MB of text .
He concludes : “ Hubble is by no means a cheap mission – but the mobile phone text costs were pretty astronomical ! ”

Bush : Iraq violence is a ' very positive moment '

Print This Email This Speaking to the Times of London in an interview published Thursday , President George W. Bush declared that the latest wave of violence in Iraq yielded " a very positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that believe they are beyond the law . "
The Times headline ?
" President Bush : Iraq violence is a ' positive moment . ' "
In an interview with The Times , he backed the Iraqi Governments decision to respond forcefully  to the spiralling violence by criminal elements  and Shia extremists in Basra .
 It was a very positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that believe they are beyond the law ,  the President said .
Asked if British troops had retreated to the relative safety of the Basra airbase too hastily last year , Mr Bush said that the pullback had been based upon success in quelling violence , adding that he remained grateful for the contribution made by British Forces from day one of the war .
Mr Bush , who had spent the morning being briefed on Iraq by the Pentagon before an imminent announcement on US troop levels , said that despite substantial gains  since the US military surge began last year , much work was needed to maintain the success weve had .
The Bush Administration has a history of turning violence into " positives . "
During the 2006 war in Lebanon , for example , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared the Israeli attack as " birth pangs . "
" What we 're seeing here , in a sense , is the growing -- the birth pangs of a new Middle East and whatever we do we have to be certain that we 're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one , " Rice said .
During his interview with the Times , Bush disparaged those who want US troops to come home , and reinforced his power , saying as he has before , " I 'm commander in chief . "
He averred that decisions would not be made by those who scream the loudest in calling for troops to come home .
 I understand people here want us to leave , regardless of the situation , " he said , " but that will not happen so long as Im Commander - In - Chief . 
In just a matter of weeks since its launch , YouTorrent has become one of the most popular BitTorrent meta - search engines .
This weekend , however , it revealed a shift in strategy and it now only indexes sites that host torrent files linking to " licensed " content .
Unsurprisingly , the enormous success of the site even inspired others to start similar projects .
None of these came close to YouTorrent ‘s success , which now attracts over 10 million unique visitors a month .
YouTorrent ’s selling points are the great interface , an ad- less design , and its ability to search most of the bigger BitTorrent sites .
The latter has changed though , and this might very well be the end of YouTorrent ’s popularity .
Patrick , one of the people running YouTorrent told TorrentFreak : “ Due to the uncertain nature of the source and accuracy of the results returned by some engines , we have decided to reduce our engine selection to ones that claim the provision of licensed , certified content . ”
It does n’t stop there .
You Torrent is not only going ‘ legal ’ , but Patrick is also looking into selling the site .
“ The YouTorrent project has grown very quickly and unfortunately is not in line with the owning companies core business , ” Patrick said .
“ We have had some interest [ to buy ] from some parties .
On that basis , we have presented the site to other parties in the space to see if there is interest there also , ” he added .
It is unfortunate to see that YouTorrent has to throw in the towel only 4 months after it launched .
One thing is clear , they have n’t made any money so far , since there were n’t any ads on the site .
Selling the site could make the YouTorrent team quite a few bucks though , it almost looks like this was the plan anyway .
The new “ surge ” strategy in Iraq , led by Gen.
David Petraeus , has been heavily marketed as an example of the U.S. military ’s application of the “ lessons of history ” from previous counterinsurgencies to Iraq , foremost among them the need to win the population over from insurgents through cultivating human relationships , addressing popular grievances , and providing security .
Yet one glance at the realities on the ground in Iraq today reveals that the cornerstone of current U.S. military strategy is less about cultivating human relationships than about limiting them , primarily through concrete walls and checkpoints .
And it has been less about minimizing violence than containing Iraq ’s population and redirecting the battlefield from the streets to the skies above Iraq .
While the coffee klatches between Marine commanders and Sunni tribal sheiks may garner all the publicity , the real story on the ground in Iraq is that from Baghdad to Mosul , the U.S. military has been busy constructing scores of concrete walls and barriers between and around Iraqi neighborhoods , which it terms “ gated communities . ”
In Baghdad alone , 12 - foot - high walls now separate and surround at least 11 Sunni and Shi’ite enclaves .
Broken by narrow checkpoints where soldiers monitor traffic via newly issued ID cards , these walls have turned Baghdad into dozens of replica Green Zones , dividing neighbor from neighbor and choking off normal commerce and communications .
Similar walls are being erected in other Iraqi cities , while the entire city of Fallujah remains surrounded by a razor - wire barrier , with only one point of entry into the city .
Moreover , the U.S. military has doubled its use of unmanned aerial drones and increasingly relies upon aerial strikes to quell insurgent activities , often through bombings and targeted assassinations .
While there is no question that overall levels of violence have temporarily decreased , Iraq has become virtually caged in a carapace of concrete walls and razor wire , reinforced by an aerial occupation from the sky .
Reporting from a recent visit to the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad , the seasoned journalist Nir Rosen noted in Rolling Stone ( March 6 , 2008 ) :
“ Looming over the homes are twelve - foot - high security walls built by the Americans to separate warring factions and confine people to their own neighborhood .
Emptied and destroyed by civil war , walled off by President Bush ’s much - heralded ‘ surge , ’ Dora feels more like a desolate , post - apocalyptic maze of concrete tunnels than a living , inhabited neighborhood . ”
The Israeli Laboratory
The explosion of walls and enclaves reinforced by aerial violence across Iraq suggest that the primary counterinsurgency lessons being followed by the U.S. military in Iraq today derive less from the lessons of Lawrence of Arabia than from Israel ’s experiences in the Occupied Palestinian Territories over the past decade .
Over the past decade , Israel has developed a pacification strategy against Palestinian resistance to its military occupation by erecting separation walls and checkpoints across Palestinian territory that have enclosed Palestinians within a proliferating archipelago of ethnic enclaves to separate them from each other and from illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land .
This wall - and - enclave strategy is maintained under a blanket of aerial Israeli surveillance and deadly unmanned drones , which target the frequent airborne assassinations and strikes .
This strategy reached its apotheosis in Gaza following Israel ’s withdrawal of its soldiers and settlements in 2005 .
In Gaza , 1.5 million Palestinians are now living within an enclosed cage , while Israel controls access to the essentials of life through high - tech border terminals and unleashes “ penetration raids ” and airborne “ targeted killings ” when resistance is offered .
Iraq , it seems , is surging toward Gaza .
This fact is not missed by average Iraqis .
Visiting the Sunni bastion of Amriya in Baghdad , Nir Rosen in The Nation ( April 3 , 2008 ) recounts how his Iraqi driver pointed to a gap in the concrete walls with which the U.S. occupation forces have surrounded Amriya : “ We call it the Rafah Crossing . ”
He was referring to the one gate from besieged Gaza to Egypt that the Israeli army occasionally allows to open .
The U.S. military ’s virtual reproduction of distinctively Israeli counterinsurgency tactics in Iraq reveals that claims about applying the “ lessons of history ” of counterinsurgent warfare to Iraq are largely beside the point .
The actual application of counterinsurgency on the ground in Iraq has a distinctly Israeli DNA , born of very recent lessons from Israel ’s own urban warfare laboratory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
This should not be surprising .
The Israeli DNA in the new “ surge ” strategy is only the latest manifestation of a widely overlooked but unmistakable American predilection to increasingly draw from Israel ’s urban warfare laboratory and its flawed efforts to devise fresh tactics in the service of rebooting its own military occupation of Palestinian lands .
What we are seeing in Iraq today has much less to do with the declared shift in U.S. military doctrine than with a deeper and more far - reaching “ Israelization ” of U.S. military strategy and tactics over the past two decades that was only heightened by America ’s misadventures in the Middle East after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
In the search for new means to confront urban insurgencies in predominately Arab and Muslim lands , there has been a complex institutional and cultural harmonization between these two militaries under the banner of fighting “ the war on terror , ” though the traffic is mostly in one direction .
In light of the real lessons of counterinsurgency history , however , mimicking Israel is a recipe for failure .
The “ Israelization ” of U.S. Military Doctrine and Tactics
This “ Israelization ” of U.S. military doctrine and tactics can be traced back to the early 1990s , especially the “ Blackhawk down ” debacle of 1993 in Somalia , which led U.S. military strategists to rethink their approach to fighting urban warfare in poor Third World “ battle spaces . ”
In the following years , according to urban theorist Mike Davis in his 2004 article “ The Pentagon as Global Slum Lord , ” Israeli advisers were brought in to teach Marines , Rangers , and Navy SEALs the state - of - the - art tactics against urban insurgencies that Israel was using to ruthlessly suppress Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
This tactical “ Israelization ” of U.S. combat doctrine was accompanied by what Davis terms a deeper strategic “ Sharonization ” ( referring to Israeli militarist and later Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ) of the Pentagon ’s worldview in which U.S. military strategists began to envision the capacity of high - tech warfare to contain and possibly defeat insurgencies rooted in Third World urban environments .
Sharon is known to have kept by his bedside a well - thumbed Hebrew edition of Alistair Horne ’s A Savage War of Peace , an account of the failed French effort to defeat the Algerian insurgency against French colonial occupation .
While many viewed the French defeat as proof of the futility of military solutions to anti-colonial insurgencies , Sharon ’s belief was that Israel could learn from Algeria to get right what the French did not .
In 2001 , the journalist Robert Fisk reported , Sharon told French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in a phone conversation that the Israelis were “ like you in Algeria , ” the only difference being that “ we [ the Israelis ] will stay . ”
The “ Israelization ” of U.S. military doctrine and tactics since the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , has gone so far as to create what the Palestinian academic Marwan Bishara , writing in al - Ahram Weekly ( April - May 2002 ) , has termed a new “ strategic cult ” in which Israel ’s “ asymmetrical war ” against the Palestinians became seen as a continuation of the U.S. “ war on terrorism ” in both theory and practice .
Learning from Israel ’s experiences centered on the need for new precision weaponry and a tactical emphasis on aerial assassinations and armored bulldozers , as well as other elements of Israel ’s fighting style in the new “ asymmetrical ” and urban battle spaces .
According to the Independent ’s Justin Huggler ( March 29 , 2003 ) , Israel ’s unprecedented assault on Palestinian cities and the refugee camp in Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002 was keenly observed by foreign militaries , particularly the United States and UK as they geared up to invade and occupy Iraq .
But the most direct application of the Israeli tutorial took place in Iraq , particularly after the U.S. found itself mired in a growing insurgency in an occupied country , confronting urban guerilla warfare and suicide bombings in fall 2003 .
Having banished counterinsurgency doctrine from its own playbook after Vietnam , the Pentagon turned to Israel .
According to the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh writing in The New Yorker ( Dec. 15 , 2003 ) ,
“ One step the Pentagon took was to seek active and secret help in the war against the Iraqi insurgency from Israel , America ’s closest ally in the Middle East .
According to American and Israeli military and intelligence officials , Israeli commandos and intelligence units have been working closely with their American counterparts at the Special Forces training base at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , and in Israel to help them prepare for operations in Iraq .
Israeli commandos are expected to serve as ad - hoc advisers  again , in secret  when full - field operations begin . ”
Hence , American forces increasingly used a new set of tactics that appeared to have come straight out of the Israeli playbook from the occupied Palestinians territories , including physically enclosing villages within razor - wire fences , bulldozing homes of suspected insurgents , destroying irrigation systems and agricultural fields , taking civilian hostages , and using torture to extract intelligence .
Seymour Hersh claims that the U.S. was told it had to “ go unconventional ” like the Israelis  to use harsh tactics to counter the harsh insurgency such as deploying assassination squads .
As he summarized it : “ The American - Israeli liaison on Iraq amounts to a tutorial on how to dismantle an insurgency . ”
According to Julian Borger at the Guardian ( Dec. 9 , 2003 ) one former senior American intelligence official raised serious concerns about the dangers of adopting Israel ’s “ hunter - killer ” teams , and the political implications of such an open embrace of Israel : “ It is bonkers , insane .
Here we are  we ’re already being compared to Sharon in the Arab world and we ’ve just confirmed it by bringing in the Israelis and setting up assassination teams . ”
The “ Surge ” : Shifting Tactics in Iraq , Israeli - Style
The Israeli tutorial , as we know , was nothing less than a complete failure , as Iraq slipped into anarchy and then raging civil war in large part as a result of the destructive tactics deployed the U.S. military .
As a consequence , the failures in Iraq forced the U.S. military to reconsider the preeminence of harsh Israeli - style tactics .
And so in late 2006 , Gen. David Petraeus and his highly touted cadre of counterinsurgency ( COIN ) experts , fresh from a six - month command and staff course at Fort Leavenworth that according to the Independent ‘s Robert Fisk ( April 11 , 2007 ) included at least four senior Israeli officers , ushered in a heavily marketed new counterinsurgency strategy that reduced the reliance upon brute military force in favor of creating alliances with former insurgents , building intelligence capacity , and restoring a semblance of security for the population , particularly in Baghdad .
But it would be a mistake to read this new “ hearts and minds ” counterinsurgency strategy as a full - scale retreat from “ Israelization ” in two important respects , both of which illustrate how remarkably similar American and Israeli strategic and tactical frameworks have become at this point in time .
First , it is striking how much the new U.S. approach in Iraq mirrors Israel ’s own tactical response to its failed attempt to use harsh and brutal tactics to crush the renewed surge of Palestinian resistance between 2001 and 2004 .
In 2004 , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon unveiled a new strategy  what he termed “ disengagement ”  as a new way to “ shift the narrative . ”
This strategy included the tactical withdrawal of Israeli settlements and soldiers from the Gaza Strip to be replaced by its complete encirclement and economic strangulation , while further enclosing Palestinians in the West Bank within separation walls , barriers , and checkpoints .
Whereas the previous approach relied upon aggressive Israeli military incursions within Palestinian areas , the new strategy seeks to control Palestinians from beyond their walled - off enclosures by selectively controlling access to life essentials and relying on air strikes to quell resistance .
Similarly , in response to the chaos in Iraq and the growing popular demand for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in late 2006 , President Bush and the U.S. military adopted the “ surge ” strategy as its own way to “ change the narrative . ”
As in the Israeli case , the “ surge ” has shifted techniques of domination across Iraq from the direct application of violence against insurgents to indirect spatial incarceration , multiplying archipelagos of externally alienated and internally homogenous ethno-national enclaves through walls and checkpoints , under a blanket of aerial surveillance .
Secondly , the tactical shift toward walls , enclaves , and aerial domination is still rooted in the “ Sharonization ” of U.S. strategic doctrine mentioned earlier : that is , the belief that one can use military force to defeat an insurgency by reformulating one ’s military tactics .
Neither Israel nor the United States are willing to countenance a serious political solution to either occupation , which would entail addressing the core political issue that is driving each insurgency : ending the foreign occupation .
As it happens , Henry Kissinger is reported to have given President Bush a copy of Horne ’s A Savage War of Peace to read in the winter of 2006 , and the U.S. military frequently uses the Algerian case as one its primary lessons in most COIN training .
They appear to have learned the same faulty lessons as Sharon .
Both Israel and the U.S. are seeking to replace direct military occupation with a form of occupation management in order to preserve the fruits of their respective occupations .
Israel has simply shifted tactics to achieve its original goal of securing its illegal settlements and land confiscations in the West Bank to maintain “ greater Israel . ”
Since it is unwilling to accept a withdrawal to the 1967 borders and allow for a fully sovereign Palestinian state , its strategy is to pacify Palestinians through ever confining walls and enclaves until Palestinians accept their fate living in splintered enclaves under complete Israeli control .
Similarly , since the U.S. is unwilling to negotiate with the insurgency or consider a timetable for withdrawal , it is clear that the new counterinsurgency plan is an effort to pacify Iraq into accepting a form of “ soft partition ” into ethno- political enclaves to enable the U.S. to secure its original goals of establishing permanent military bases , securing access to Iraq ’s vast oil fields , and installing an Iraqi central government to pass laws to ensure these aims .
Like the Palestinians , Iraqis will be sequestered within walled enclaves so that the political and economic occupation can remain in place .
The Real “ Lessons of History ” for Iraq
Needless to say , all this amounts to trying to find new ways to do the impossible .
The bottom line is that both Israel and the U.S. will be losers in their quest for military solutions to fundamentally political insurgencies against a foreign military occupation .
Framing an occupation as “ liberation ” or “ counter - terrorism ” does not make it any less a foreign occupation .
One of the great ironies in all of this is the willful failure of both Israel and the United States to learn the fundamental historical lesson of the French in Algeria : that they could have negotiated a withdrawal far earlier and spared all this bloodshed and violence .
Militarily , the French army did not lose  they certainly won the Battle of Algiers and had pacified the country by late 1958 .
But the military victory was hollow .
The French achieved pacification only , which simply meant that the number of violent incidents per month was at a tolerable level .
But this came at the price of herding over a million Algerians into fortified villages , extensive torture , and millions killed .
This was a situation that could not be sustained and it unraveled as open warfare broke out between settlers and Algerians with the French army caught in the middle , battling both .
All of this looks very much like Iraq today with Americans caught between Shia and Sunni militias , battling both in an effort to achieve pacification on behalf of an ineffective puppet government associated with its occupation .
There are also obvious parallels to Israel ’s predicament in the occupied Palestinian territories .
The primary reason why the French military victory was hollow was because the French offered no political solution that met the core aspirations of Algerian nationalism , which should be clear to anyone who reads the second half of A Savage War of Peace .
They only offered a flimsy notion of “ self - determination ” and “ democracy ” that de Gaulle called “ association , ” which we recognize today as a neo -colonial relationship .
France sought to maintain extraterritorial control through military bases and dominion over Algerian oil resources , including a permanent French settler presence .
The Algerians rejected this and fought until the French were forced to leave entirely .
The parallels with U.S. plans for Iraq hardly need to be elaborated .
Instead of learning from the French experience , the U.S. has naively looked to the Israeli experience as a training manual for counterinsurgency .
The U.S. continues to be mesmerized by a mythical version of Israel that is based more on savvy marketing than demonstrated performance .
Israel ’s responses to unconventional war have never been well developed or very successful ; it was defeated by Hezbollah in South Lebanon not once but twice , and its attempt to crush the Palestinian uprising through force actually led to further suicide bombings , while its destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure has left the political field open to Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
Mimicking Israel is a recipe for failure .
Martin Van Creveld , an Israeli military historian who had lectured U.S. military officials on Israeli military strategy in late 2003 , warned in an Associated Press article ( Dec. 12 , 2003 ) that just as Israel had been unsuccessful in eliminating militant groups and suicide bombers , the United States cannot expect to be victorious in Iraq .
“ The Americans are coming here to try to mimic all kinds of techniques , but it ’s not going to do them any good , ” he reportedly warned .
“ I do n’t see how on earth they [ the U.S. ] can win .
I think this is going to end the same way Vietnam did .
They are going to flee the country hanging on the strings of helicopters . ”
Whether or not this happens will be the subject of future “ lessons of history . ”
But by following the Israeli model rather than the actual lessons of counterinsurgency history , the U.S. appears trapped by the logic of its own image co-dependency with Israel as a state now permanently at war with much of the Arab and Muslim world , with history ’s lessons decidedly not on its side .
Read correctly , A Savage War of Peace is less a user ’s manual for counterinsurgency than a warning about the futility of fighting colonial wars in the first place .

A legal brief that exempted the US military from criminal laws following the 9/11 attacks was improperly kept classified for years , the former head of the US government agency in charge of document secrecy said today .
The March 2003 brief , which allowed Pentagon interrogators to claim self - defence in sidestepping laws against torture , was made public earlier this month .
J William Leonard , who directed George Bush 's information security oversight office until last year , today told Congress that the document never should have been classified in the first place .
" To learn that such a document was classified had the same effect on me as waking up one morning and learning that after all these years , there is a ' secret ' article to the constitution that the American people do not even know about , " Leonard said .
The former classifications chief appeared at a hearing that focussed on the still - secret opinions of the office of legal counsel ( OLC ) , a little - known arm of the US justice department that provides the White House with legal advice .
The 2003 brief , written by former OLC lawyer John Yoo , lies at the centre of a furious row over the legality of violent interrogations approved by the Bush administration at Guantanamo Bay and secret " black sites " run by the CIA .
Democratic senator Russell Feingold , who chaired today 's hearing , revealed that he and some colleagues had reached a deal with Bush aides to receive limited access to secret legal briefs on interrogations .
John Elwood , an OLC lawyer who testified today , could not say whether congressmen would be able to view all the briefs they sought .
Instead , Elwood attempted to convince Feingold that Congress does not need to see OLC opinions in order to respond to them .
" Just because we do n't turn over our communications to our client [ the president ] … does n't mean you can't know what our position on the law is , " Elwood said .
He added that OLC opinions do not necessarily provide a defence against liability in court .
Such an argument could expose senior Bush aides , who relied on OLC 's advice in using brutal tactics on terrorist suspects , to civil lawsuits in coming years .
The March 2003 legal brief was made public thanks to a lawsuit filed by a non-profit activist group , the American Civil Liberties Union .
Feingold and fellow Democrats have unsuccessfully pushed for the release of a 2001 memo , cited in that brief , suspending part of the constitution during military operations after 9/11 .
While Leonard said the classification of the 2003 brief demonstrated " profound ignorance of or deep contempt for " rules on government secrecy , he said the decision might have been made to " keep it out of the hands of the military services ' legal people " .
If Yoo 's legal justifications for the use of torturous tactics were openly shared with the military , American troops would know they faced a similar risk of violent treatment if captured in Iraq or Afghanistan , Leonard said .
Leonard 's explanation tracks with the conclusions of Philippe Sands , one of Britain 's top human rights lawyers .
In his latest book , Torture Team , Sands found US military lawyers maintaining back - channel contacts with the justice department officials who crafted the 2003 brief .
Sands is slated to testify before the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives on interrogation policy next week .
In this report , I am going to present an astounding document .
You have not heard of it .
It is at the heart of the current residential real estate crisis .
It has to do with liar loans .
By now , the term “ liar loans ” is common .
Prospective house buyers provided false information to representatives of loan - initiating firms .
The loan - initiating firms knew that there were people who did this , but they winked at the practice .
Their well - compensated job was to pass on the paperwork to a government - created agency , either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , who then sold scientifically diversified packages of statistically safe mortgages to investors .
Some of these investors were hedge funds .
They in turn borrowed money from investment banks at up to 32 - to - 1 leverage ( Carlyle Capital ) to buy even more packages of statistically safe mortgages .
Everyone was happy until reality caught up with the lying borrowers , whose meager incomes did not allow them to keep paying their monthly mortgages .
The dominoes started to topple in August , 2007 .
The experts were caught flat - footed .
The mortgage interest rate re-sets will continue through 2009 .
This process is barely half over .
Meanwhile , a recession has appeared .
From start to finish , from top to bottom , the entire structure was based on lies .
It began with this one : “ I ’m from the government , and I ’m here to help you . ”
This is the third most widely believed lie in history , right after this :
And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die : For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
And this :
Of course I will still respect you as a person in the morning .
THE GREAT AMERICAN DREAM
We all remember the 1946 movie , It ’s a Wonderful Life .
It centers around one family ’s funding of the great American dream : home ownership .
We love the movie because it ’s about a man who is shown by an angel that his life really mattered .
So , our lives really matter , too .
We all like to believe that we also have a guardian angel , though perhaps not so incompetent as Clarence .
Jimmy Stewart ’s nemesis was the town ’s banker , Mr. Potter .
He was a liar and a thief , preying on sin-loving local citizens ( as we see in the sequence about Pottersville ) and the likes of the kindly but imbecilic Uncle Billy .
Potter used the fractional reserve banking system to borrow short and lend medium .
The Bedford Falls Building and Loan borrowed short and lent long .
Potter was able to survive the bank run because his bank had liquid reserves and assets it could sell .
The Building and Loan survived because George Bailey had liquid reserves — his honeymoon money — and a script writer who ended the bank run at 6 p.m. and did not let it extend to the next day , which it obviously would have done when word got out that Jimmy ’s honeymoon money was gone .
Potter was a liar : he was lent medium .
George Bailey was a much bigger liar : he was lent long .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created in 1933 by the Roosevelt Administration as part of the Glass - Steagall Act .
This bailed out the mini-liars : bankers .
The Savings and Loan oligopoly then pressured Congress to provide something similar , which Congress delivered : the Federal Savings & Loan Corporation was created by the National Housing Act of 1934 .
This bailed out the bigger liars .
The American dream was extended to the masses by means of government insurance against runs by investors — who mistakenly thought they were depositors — in Savings & Loans .
This did more to establish the economics of the carry trade — borrowing short to lend long — than anything in history .
The investment world saw the profit potential .
The carry trade has increased ever since .
But who will insure the middlemen who profit from the carry trade ?
Who has sufficient resources to bail out the profit - seeking , loss - avoiding hedge fund entrepreneurs who decided that the interest rate spread between short - term money paid to investment banks and long - term money paid by borrowers was just too tempting .
In short , who will come to the rescue of our generation of George Baileys ?
Congress ?
It did in 1986 during the S&L collapse .
But the on - budget Federal deficit is running at an estimated $ 410 billion this year .
This deficit is accelerating .
Then how about the Federal Reserve System ?
It can swap Treasury debt for not - statistically - safe - after - all mortgages , but only until it runs out of Treasury debt , about $ 800 billion to go .
Then it will have to create money .
Lots and lots of money .
LIAR , LIAR , PANTS ON FIRE
We live in the FIRE economy : finance , insurance , and real estate .
The crucial insurance today is Federal insurance — explicit , implicit , and widely assumed even when legally absent .
Big institutions are considered too big to fail , meaning too big for the government to allow to fail .
Think Bear Stearns .
So , promises made by the government serve as the ultimate back - up for the promises made by the largest carry traders .
The extent of the participation of the Federal government in the residential real estate markets can be seen in the law governing liar loans .
You need to read the following law .
I realize that no one except lawyers reads a document like this one .
It has two sentences .
One of them is 291 words long .
Only lawyers write sentences that are 291 words long .
Nevertheless , I am asking you to read it .
Here is what you should understand after you have read it .
There is hardly a nook or cranny left in the residential real estate market that is not covered by this law .
The extent of government control , which derives from government insurance of real estate lending , is enormous .
How enormous ?
Read for yourself .
Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report , or willfully overvalues any land , property or security , for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Farm Credit Administration , Federal Crop Insurance Corporation or a company the Corporation reinsures , the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration or successor agency , the Rural Development Administration or successor agency , any Farm Credit Bank , production credit association , agricultural credit association , bank for cooperatives , or any division , officer , or employee thereof , or of any regional agricultural credit corporation established pursuant to law , or a Federal land bank , a Federal land bank association , a Federal Reserve bank , a small business investment company , as defined in section 103 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 ( 15 U.S.C. 662 ) , or the Small Business Administration in connection with any provision of that Act , a Federal credit union , an insured State - chartered credit union , any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the Office of Thrift Supervision , any Federal home loan bank , the Federal Housing Finance Board , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the Resolution Trust Corporation , the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation , or the National Credit Union Administration Board , a branch or agency of a foreign bank ( as such terms are defined in paragraphs ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of section 1 ( b ) of the International Banking Act of 1978 ) , or an organization operating under section 25 or section 25 ( a ) [ 1 ] of the Federal Reserve Act , upon any application , advance , discount , purchase , purchase agreement , repurchase agreement , commitment , or loan , or any change or extension of any of the same , by renewal , deferment of action or otherwise , or the acceptance , release , or substitution of security therefor , shall be fined not more than $ 1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years , or both .
The term State - chartered credit union includes a credit union chartered under the laws of a State of the United States , the District of Columbia , or any commonwealth , territory , or possession of the United States .
Did you read it ?
If so , I hope you noticed this passage : “. . . shall be fined not more than $ 1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years , or both . ”
Here is the inescapable reality : the Federal government let the subprime disaster build up for many years .
This law was never enforced .
No one in the entire government - insured scam worried about it .
The bureaucrats were in on the deal from day one .
All of the posturing by politicians about the exploited borrowers who lost their homes — liars — and the need for new laws to be passed by Congress to prevent unscrupulous mortgage brokers — liars — from ever exploiting the poor again , and also preventing them from endangering the solvency of the nation ’s financial institutions — liars — is nothing but election - year politicking by the biggest liars of all : politicians .
Do we need more laws ?
Hardly .
A law that imposes a million - dollar fine and 30 years in jail is more than sufficient .
This law ’s stiff penalties were supposed to make people take it seriously .
But it was not taken seriously .
No one ever intended to enforce the law .
No one ever did .
It was all posturing by the politicians .
The biggest housing bubble in American history , 1995 — 2005 , took place under the watchful eyes of the entire Federal real estate bureaucracy , the bureaucracy listed by name in the law .
No one in government issued a warning .
No one in government saw the bubble coming .
No one in government identified it as a bubble .
The appraisals were made , the loans were made , the mortgages were bought and re-packaged and sold again .
The carry trade did its work .
And now there is a line in front of the banks .
No , scratch that .
There are no lines .
There are instead collapsing prices in the scientifically packaged mortgage sector because investors now see that those mortgages , rated AAA by independent firms ( it says here ) , are in fact packages of promises to pay made by liars .
Everyone knew .
This is the famous bottom line .
Everyone knew .
Nobody cared .
We live in an economy built on lies .
Everyone knows .
Almost nobody cares .
Do you care ?
If so , what have you done to protect yourself ?
WHO INSURES THE INSURERS ?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures bank accounts up to $ 100,000 .
It holds about a penny in reserve ( in T - bills ) for every dollar worth of insured deposits .
Who insures the T - bills ?
The Federal Reserve System .
Who insures the Federal Reserve System ?
No one .
It does n’t need insurance .
It can create money .
Then who insures the purchasing power of the dollar ?
The central banks of the world , which hold dollars as legal reserves for their own currencies .
What happens if they decide not to add to their holdings of dollars ?
That is the ultimate default today .
If the liars known as central bankers decide that our central bank ’s liars are no longer to be trusted , there will be a great dumping of Treasury debt .
There will be no lines in front of American banks .
There will instead be rising prices for imported goods .
There will be rising domestic interest rates because foreign central banks are not buying Treasury debt any longer .
There will be unemployment .
There will be bankruptcies .
There will be defaults .
Above all , there will be defaults .
The lies will be exposed as lies .
The promises will not be kept .
When the checks from Washington no longer buy much of anything , the great political transformation will begin .
The promises will not be fulfilled .
I assume that you know this .
The economy built on lies will fall .
So will the political order .
When will this take place ?
I do n’t know .
But we have seen it happen in our lifetime .
The Soviet Union fell in three days : August 19 — 21 , 1991 .
No one predicted this .
The best and the brightest in the West did not see it coming .
One man suspected it and did what he could to accelerate it : John Paul II .
But the politicians were universally caught flat - footed .
The USSR was $ 140 billion in debt to the West in 1991 .
The West is now in debt to Russia by $ 500 billion .
No one predicted that , either .
CHOOSE YOUR LIARS CAREFULLY
The modern economy is built on debt .
It is therefore built on promises to pay .
It is therefore built on lies .
As investors , we must look at the dominoes and try to get out from under the next one to topple .
If all of them topple , the division of labor will collapse .
Then most of us will die .
Think of a world without digital money .
The trains would stop rolling .
The trucks would stop rolling .
The government would intervene and force some deliveries , such as coal to power plants in large cities .
But the government would also have a problem : how to pay the bureaucrats and troops .
So , most of us cannot plan for a complete collapse of banking .
That would bring down Western civilization .
We have to assume that some lies will still be accepted , that some promises will be kept .
But which ones ?
I think it is wise to have reserves that are not digital .
You ca n’t eat digits .
But if your neighbors are starving , reserves wo n’t help much .
This is why you should not try to prepare for complete collapse today .
You ca n’t afford it .
I hope you have the familiar six months ’ of expenses in reserve .
You could lose your job .
If you do n’t , what about your spouse ?
Today , most American families have about 19 days ’ worth of expenses .
The chart on this decline since the year 2000 is shocking .
You must not follow the herd on this one .
CONCLUSION
The tissue of lies that held together the subprime market was believed by the best and the brightest .
They were blind to what was coming .
It has wiped out over $ 200 billion in assets .
We are assured that the worst is over .
But who assures us of this ?
Salaried reporters in a dying field : newspapers and network TV .
The ill - informed tout the liars .
We are assured that the liars know what went wrong and will not let it happen again .
Re-read the liars ’ law .
That will give you some indication of how serious the liars were .
They are no more serious today .
When they tell you the worst is over , batten down the hatches .

About 15 years from now , there will be thousands of people who have covered various parts of their bodies with tattoos that are going to feel really stupid .
It will no longer be trendy and they will spend the rest of their lives explaining why they have all - you - can - eat ink permanently branded on themselves .
" Well , we were in Cabo and I 'd had a few margaritas .
I was feeling pretty loosey - goosey , one thing led to another and well , I ended up with Calvin taking a wiz on a Florida State Seminoles logo tattooed on my forearm .
I know , it 's stupid . "
Those conversations are going to happen by the bucketful .
It 's not that I think all tattoos are in poor taste .
The practice is not for me personally , but to each his own .
In fact , not that long ago my very conservative father had a milestone birthday and got the Rampant Lion of Scotland tatted on his bicep .
It 's a small nod to the heritage that we are very proud of .
I believe my father 's tattoo was thought about for a long time .
It was not a spontaneous or booze influenced decision .
Sadly many tats are just that ; either a spur of the moment purchase or inspired by too much of a favorite tipple .
With other fads , you can participate and not make it a lifetime commitment .
You can take the double hoop earrings out pretend it never happened .
( If you still have those , you need to take them out . )
You can shave off your side - spike .
You can take off your parachute pants .
It 's a little more of a chore to remove your Dane Cook " Su - Fi " tattoo .
( Who 's going to feel more stupid down the road ;
The " Su - Fi " tattoo gang or those that have " Git - R - Done " permanently on their body ?
A tough call .
It 's a good thing that tattoos were n't as popular on the early 80's or their would be a few people with Yakov Smirnoff on their shoulder blade . )
Many will feel stupid , the owners of the following tattoos are going to feel like the southbound end of a northbound horse .
When I was looking for bad tattoos , I was shocked at what I found .
Some truly amazing stupidity .
I 'm still trying to get the image of the guy who tattooed his knob to look like a dragon out of my head .
I can't link to it for personal reasons .
It could traumatize the children .
You 'll have to find that one on your own .
How would you like to be the tattoo artist on duty when the guy comes in and says , " I have an idea for my next tattoo .
Can you make my wiener look like Smaug from The Hobbit ? "
I imagine that the guy was not scheduled to work that day but took his buddies shift so he could go to a birthday party .
He was n't supposed to be there next thing he knew , he was inking up some nut 's John Thomas .
Bad day at the office .
These are the most stupid , most clichéd ink in the book . -
First of all , you have to sit bare - assed in the tattoo parlor for an hour or more .
Your keester blowin ' in the wind while you get a four leafed clover inked on .
Not good .-
I 'm not sure how this became a mark of pride in the redneck community , but I believe it started with the Yosemite Sam mud-flaps .
Pretty sure that 's right .
I 've seen Bugs Bunny , Tweety Bird , Daffy Duck , the aforementioned Sam , Sylvester , even Foghorn Leghorn .
( Who is hilarious and has one of the best cartoon names ever . )
But it 's
Taz that shows up the most on the farmer tanned biceps .
I do n't care if your pal is a pretty good doodler and can draw the Yankees logo and a cocktail napkin .
The homemade tattoo always appears to be just that .
My cousin spent some time in Nicaragua .
He has an amazing photo with his arm around a shirtless cat that has a homemade tattoo of a huge erect penis on his chest .
You wonder who 's idea it was .
Maybe he was so drunk that his friends decided to put a wiener on him as a joke .
That 's a whole other level from the classic " Sharpie on the forehead " gag .
Let 's say you were a diehard Michael Jackson fan in the late 80's .
You had the glove , the zippered jacket , the cat eye contact lenses from " Thriller , " the lot .
You have the choreography to " Smooth Criminal " down pat .
So you get a King of Pop tattoo on your arm .
Uh oh .
He 's a child molester .
Crap .
That does n't come off .
I bet there is someone with an O.J. Simpson # 32 tat still on their calf .
You never know when a hero could fall from grace .
Also in this category is a band that 's not at least twenty years into making records .
I know a girl whose little brother had Limp Bizkit autograph his leg , then he had the tattoo artist go over them permanently .
Oops .
This would be the meat head thathas " I'm With Stupid " on his midsection with an arrow pointing down to his junk .
The use of a bellybutton for an animal 's anus .
Good one .
The worst I saw was a joker that had two fishnet stocking legs on his arm and inner torso , and his armpit hair was made to look like a woman 's pubic hair .
Sweet fancy Moses .
You may think you are clever , but it will be funny for fifteen minutes and embarrassing for life .
Really hackneyed and lame .
You 're not on fire .
You 're a lemming following the others that wear shiny pants and wife - beaters off the cliff of clichés .
This one seems to be growing in popularity .
Hardly a day goes by when I do n't see a child 's name in fancy cursive tatted on a straphanger 's neck while riding the 1 train .
It 's not a good idea unless you are a musician or professional athlete .
You are essentially cashing in your respect in society with the neck tat .
If you 're going in for a job interview and you have a skull and crossbones tattoo peeking out from your shirt collar , I 'm willing to wager you 're not getting the gig .
I firmly believe that 90 % of the tattoo removal practice 's business is from this very mistake .
The only one to pull off a fix on this one was Johnny Depp .
While engaged to Winona " I 'll Just Help Myself To These " Ryder .
Depp had " Winona Forever " on his bicep .
He later changed it to " Wino Forever . "
That is kind of funny .
Sorry ladies , this is ridiculous .
No intricate design or use of a butterfly makes it original .
It only shows you have no individual style and want to be lumped in with the club - hopping Paris Hilton wannabe's .
The lamest of the lame .
I have news for you , Chief , there is nothing " tribal " about your ink .
It was n't designed by the village elders of the Masai tribe in Africa .
It was scribbled on a legal pad by a high school dropout that goes by the handle " Fruit Loops . "
You 're a walking billboard for the unoriginal .
Every time you think it 's cool , you should remember that Nick Lachey and other boy band members have one .
I rest my case , your honor .
And finally ... The Lifetime Achievement Award For Crap Tattoos goes to ... The barbed wire band would like to thank God , the committee for voting , and Pamela Anderson .

Two primary schools have withdrawn storybooks about same - sex relationships after objections from Muslim parents .
Up to 90 gathered at the schools to complain about the books which are aimed at pupils as young as five .
One story , titled King & King , is a fairytale about a prince who turns down three princesses before marrying one of their brothers .
Scroll down for more ...
Another named And Tango Makes
Three features two male penguins who fall in love at a New York zoo .
Bristol City Council said the two schools had been using the books to ensure they complied with gay rights laws which came into force last April .
They were intended to help prevent homophobic bullying , it said .
But the council has since removed the books from Easton Primary School and Bannerman Road Community School , both in Bristol .
A book and DVD titled That 's a Family ! , which teaches children about different family set - ups including gay or lesbian parents , has also been withdrawn .
The decision was made to enable the schools to " operate safely " after parents voiced their concerns at meetings .
Around 40 are said to have gathered at Easton to speak to staff and another 50 at Bannerman Road .
Members of the Bristol Muslim Cultural Society said parents were upset at the lack of consultation over the use of the materials .
Farooq Siddique , community development officer for the society and a governor at Bannerman Road , said there were also concerns about whether the stories were appropriate for young children .
" The main issue was there was a total lack of consultation with parents , " he said .
" The schools refused to deal with the parents , and were completely authoritarian .
" The agenda was to reduce homophobic bullying and all the parents said they were not against that side of it , but families were saying to us ' our child is coming home and talking about same - sex relationships , when we have n't even talked about heterosexual relationships with them yet ' .
" They do n't do sex education until Year Six and at least there you have got the option of withdrawing the children .
" But here you do n't have that option apparently .
You can't withdraw because it is no particular lesson they are used in . "
He added : " In Islam homosexual relationships are not acceptable , as they are not in Christianity and many other religions but the main issue is that they did n't bother to consult with parents .
" The issue should have been , how do we stop bullying in general , and teaching about homosexuality can be a part of that .
" This was completely one - sided .
" Homosexuality is not a priority to parents but academic achievement is .
This just makes parents think ' What the heck is my child being taught at school ? ' . "
He said the two schools were 60 to 70 per cent Muslim but pointed out that non-Muslim parents were among those who complained .
Traditional Islamic views condemn homosexuality but there are liberal movements , such as the Al - Fatiha Foundation , which is dedicated to gay Muslims .
The schools used materials promoted by the No Outsiders project , led by academics at Sunderland University .
A spokesman for Bristol City Council said : " All Bristol schools have a legal duty to report and deal with homophobic harassment as part of the curriculum since April 2007 . "
She said the council had " temporarily withdrawn " the use of the materials in question and was liaising with various groups to " ensure that the topic can be addressed in an inclusive manner in the curriculum " .
Ben Summerskills of gay rights group Stonewall said : " The small number of parents who make a fuss will cause children to think there is something wrong . "
International flights that do n't cost a thing ?
Books or music you do n't have to pay for ?
Even companies handing out cars ?
Traditional business is based on the certainty that everything has a price .
But now US writer Chris Anderson believes we are at the dawn of a new consumerist era , governed by what he dubs ' freeconomics ' .
He talks to Stuart Jeffries
A few years ago , Ryanair 's founder Michael O'Leary told an interviewer that he had a dream .
He had already democratised air travel : " For years flying has been the preserve of rich fuckers .
Now everyone can afford to fly . "
His new ambition , he told the Financial Times in 2004 , was to give customers free tickets , perhaps even to pay them to fly .
He predicted : " In a decade or so , airlines will pay travellers to distribute people around Europe . "
But how could he make his dream of free air travel a profitable reality ?
It 's a question that takes us to the heart of a new philosophy called freeconomics that turns traditional capitalist business models on their heads .
O'Leary argued that the airline industry would have to learn from commercial TV , which allows viewers to watch for free while advertisers pay for access to them .
It would also have learn from the internet , where websites make money for delivering click - through traffic to other sites .
As you may have noticed , O'Leary is n't yet paying you to fly , not even to from Birmingham to Bratislava ( which currently costs £ 10 one way ) , but he has a few years to deliver on his prediction .
If he manages it , Ryanair will become an exponent of a revolutionary idea being developed by Chris Anderson , editor - in - chief of Wired magazine .
Anderson 's freeconomics thesis is that more and more goods and services are being provided for free and that those businesses that fail to follow suit are likely to go to the wall .
" As much as we complain about how expensive things are getting , we 're surrounded by forces that are making them cheaper , " Anderson wrote in a recent article that will form the basis of a book called Free , to be published next year .
" Forty years ago , charity was dominated by clothing drives for the poor .
Now you can get a T - shirt for less than the price of a cup of coffee , thanks to China and global sourcing .
So too for toys , gadgets and commodities of every sort .
Even cocaine has pretty much never been cheaper ( globalisation works in mysterious ways ) . "
But freeconomics is hardly a deluded eulogy to global capitalism .
Rather , Anderson 's idea is that the internet , by reducing marginal costs , encourages businesses to make their money by offering free goods or services to an extent we have not witnessed before .
And that this change in supply alters the nature of demand : free services such as Craigslist , Skype , Freeview , Wikipedia and Google have created a generation that does n't just resent paying , but expects stuff to be free .
This is the generation that , for example , paid nothing ( or next to nothing ) for Radiohead 's new album and got Prince 's last CD free with the Mail on Sunday .
This is the generation that does n't walk into HMV like losers and shell out £ 15 for a new album , but downloads it for free from one of the many ( often legally dubious ) filesharing websites .
This is the generation that saw the Arctic Monkeys rise to fame in Britain a few years ago through having their music freely distributed on the internet .
What happened was that the Sheffield - based band burned demos on to CDs to give away at gigs , but because demand for the discs outstripped supply , fans copied the CDs on to their home computers and shared the music with other fans .
The Arctic Monkeys ' fans even set up a MySpace page without the band 's knowledge .
Only later did the band sign a record deal , the historic prerequisite for pop fame .
It was sharing internet users that made Gordon Brown 's favourite band what they are .
Most importantly , this is the generation that is driving companies to turn their business models around by 180 degrees .
Only last month , it was reported that Apple was considering giving customers unlimited free access to its iTunes music library if they were willing to pay more for the iPods or iPhones that play the stuff they download .
Even though some business analysts suggested this new model would create an accounting nightmare because some customers would pay for iTunes and others would not , the fact that Apple was contemplating changing the terms of access to iTunes shows how freeconomics is giving companies the jitters .
" The internet has revolutionised economics , " says Anderson down his cellphone as he drives to work in California .
" On the web , the marginal costs of manufacturing and distribution are zero , or close to it .
This means that you can now experiment with giving away one thing to sell something else much more than you could in the pre-internet era .
Or you can experiment with third - party support , where you give away a product to sell attention to another .
The traditional model is of giving 1 % of goods away as samples in order to sell 99 % of the product ; on the web , you can give 99 % away as free samples to sell 1 % . "
You 're kidding , I say to Anderson .
And still make profit ?
" Sure .
Why not ? "
It is a dizzying inversion of economic thinking .
Anderson goes so far as to claim that Milton Friedman , the Nobel prize - winning economist , is wrong : there is such a thing as a free lunch .
And not just a free lunch , but free phone calls , free downloads , free advertisements , free newspapers .
Significantly , much of the free stuff Anderson cites is in cyberspace .
" In every industry where the product can be made into a digital file , somebody is , or is going to be , offering you that product for free because the marginal cost of doing so online is heading towards zero .
Divorce papers ?
Free. Books ?
Music ? Free . "
But not all examples of freeconomics Anderson cites are in cyberspace .
For instance , if Anderson were British , he might also cite Loot 's classified advertising and Metro 's free newspapers as part of the economy of free .
Anderson predicts that more and more free goods will become available in the next few years as businesses , catalysed by what is happening on the internet , devise hitherto unthinkable business models .
" I 've got a friend who has an electric - car business in Israel , " Anderson says .
" He is going to give away cars for free .
Imagine : free cars , right ?
But it 's not so wild .
In the US , we 're very used to getting high - end cellphones for free because the retailers make their money by other means - contracts , advertising .
And the same thing can happen with an electric car . "
But how will his friend make money ?
" He 's got you locked into a contract for the energy to run the thing .
As gas gets relatively more expensive , people will be more eager to drive electric cars .
They wo n't mind being in a contract to pay for the fuel - ie electricity - because it will be cheaper than gas . "
He offers another example : in Japan there is a university photocopying service that has two queues .
" In one , people are queueing to pay 10 cents or whatever per copy .
In the other line , it 's free .
In the second line , people are prepared to put up with having advertisements on the backside of the copy . "
Bargain - hungry Japanese devotees of freeconomics stand in the second queue .
" Friedman was wrong in two ways , " Anderson wrote challengingly in his Wired article .
" First , a free lunch does n't necessarily mean the food is being given away or that you 'll pay for it later - it could just mean someone else is picking up the tab .
Second , in the digital realm the main feedstocks of the information economy - storage , processing power and bandwidth - are getting cheaper by the day .
Two of the main scarcity functions of traditional economics are rushing headlong to zip .
It 's as if the restaurant suddenly does n't have to pay any food or labour costs for that lunch . "
But surely , I ask Anderson , Friedman was right .
If I am not picking up the tab , then someone , somewhere is .
And my fear is that it 's likely to be some poor dope who can't afford to defray the costs .
Either that , or I 'm getting personally screwed when someone dangles a freebie in front of me .
After all , a " free lunch " sign on holiday means someone is going to bore me over coffee with a timeshare pitch .
And , even online , when we receive free services , we pay in valuable time - as often as not by wading through advertising to get to the stuff we want .
" I do n't disagree , " says Anderson .
" You 're talking about externalities , which means that money is not the only scarce thing in the world , but that your time and respect are important too .
Sure there may be costs in terms of time , you may have to put up with advertising to get something for free , but I 'm talking about free money and not time .
That 's where critics of freeconomics misunderstand me .
In monetary economics , there is such a thing as a free lunch . "
Anderson is used to being misunderstood .
His last book was called The Long Tail : Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More ( 2006 ) .
There , he worked out why business such as Amazon or Netflix could make big profits not from blockbusters ( DVDs from Roland Emmerich 's fatuous cinematic oeuvre , Jordan 's novel ) but from selling hard - to - find items ( Tarkovsky DVD boxed sets , out - of - print Ivy Compton - Burnett novels ) .
" A lot of people thought The Long Tail is great because it meant blockbusters are dead .
But that is n't what I was saying .
I was saying the monopoly of the blockbuster is dead . "
But even that was good news .
High - street bookshops might not have space to stock those Compton - Burnett novels I so ardently crave , but some warehouse off the M1 near Daventry might supply my outre demand if I ordered online .
What is more , the internet could link geographically distant secondhand booksellers into one webpage .
As a result , I need not visit Hay - on - Wye to trawl secondhand book shops .
I could instead buy a book online , thereby saving me travel costs , while incurring negligible postal charges .
In so doing I would be making someone outside the book - retailing mega - chains a few bob .
Which has to be a good thing , does n't it ?
Just like Anderson 's notion of the long tail , his freeconomics thesis has been made possible by the rise of the internet .
That said , Anderson is n't so witless as to claim that free products are new .
He has a nice story about the frustrated American inventor King Gillette who , in 1895 had a eureka moment while shaving .
He was using an old - fashioned straight razor that was difficult to sharpen .
What if , Gillette thought as he struggled with his stubble , he manufactured a razor with a thin metal strip that its users could throw away when it became blunt ( of course , in 1895 the ethics of disposability were not at the forefront of an inventor 's concerns ) .
His plan hit a problem : nobody bought his disposable - blade safety razor .
So , Gillette had another brainwave : he gave away his razors with packets of gum , coffee , tea , spices and marshmallows .
The idea was that the razors were useless in themselves , but by giving them away he was creating a demand for disposable blades .
" A few billion blades later , " says Anderson , " this business model is now the foundation of entire industries : give away the cellphone , sell the monthly plan , make the videogame console cheap and sell expensive games . "
This is n't freeconomics as such ; it is called cross-subsidising .
" The old model is essentially a trick that involves moving money from one pocket to another .
The idea was that you'd get one thing for free if you bought another or a service if you bought the product . "
That old model is still with us , and growing : the prospect of free cars or free iTunes access are ideas premised on the cross-subsidy model .
Even Ryanair 's cut - price air travel is a trick of moving money from one pocket to another .
But how can a flight across the Channel be cheaper than the cab ride to your hotel ?
Ryanair cuts costs by boarding and disembarking passengers from the tarmac to cut gate fees , negotiates lower access fees with airports hungry for more traffic ( this is why , for example , if you 're flying on Ryanair to Vienna , you will land across the Austro - Slovakian border in Bratislava ) , charges for in - flight beverages , collects a share of car rentals and hotel reservations booked through its website , and charges for in - flight advertising .
It is a short step from this trick to the free Ryanair flight , Anderson argues .
Any idea how ?
" Perhaps offset their costs by in - air gambling , turning planes into flying casinos , " he suggests .
It 's just crazy enough to work .
Anderson argues that freeconomics ( his coinage riffs on the 2005 Freakonomics bestseller , in which economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen J Dubner applied economic theory to areas - sumo wrestling , drug dealing - not usually covered by traditional economists ) is different from the old cross-subsidy model .
Anderson has written : " Over the past decade , however , a different kind of free has emerged .
The new model is not based on cross-subsidies - the shifting of costs from one product to another - but on the fact that the cost of products is falling fast .
It 's as if the price of steel had dropped to close to zero that King Gillette could give away both razor and blade , and made his money on something else entirely .
( Shaving cream ? ) "
He contends that the rise of freeconomics is driven by falling web costs .
Last year , for example , Yahoo announced that its free webmail would provide unlimited storage - the price for online storage is falling to zero .
" The stunning thing , " says Anderson , " is that nobody was surprised : many had assumed unlimited free storage was already the case . "
But , surely , there are costs : surely those expensive banks of hard drives and racks of servers , cost someone , somewhere , something even if customers are getting services for free ?
Anderson does not disagree , but makes the distinction - familiar to anyone who has A - level economics - between fixed and marginal costs .
Hard drives are fixed costs , but they can serve tens of thousands of users .
The fixed costs stay the same , but the marginal costs fall all the time .
This is freeconomics ' magical secret .
" The web , " argues Anderson , " is all about scale , finding ways to attract the most users for centralised resources , spreading those costs over larger and larger audiences as the technology gets more and more capable .
It 's not about the cost of the equipment in the racks at the data centre ; it 's about what that equipment can do .
And every year , like some sort of magic clockwork , it does more and more for less and less , bringing the marginal costs of technology in the units that we individuals consume closer to zero . "
But the web is n't just about that technological magic trick .
In his new book We - think , Charles Leadbetter , a former Financial Times journalist and now a leading authority on creativity in organisations , argues that what is most unsettling and ( paradoxically ) thrilling about how the web has evolved is that so much of it is about free sharing between users .
This evolution turns traditional economics upside down .
Since the publication of Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations in 1776 , economists have insisted that private property provides the basis for capital .
And it is capital that Leadbetter calls " the elixir at the heart of capitalism , which propels its constant growth and renewal " .
Karl Marx described capital as " the hen that lays the golden eggs " .
But the web has shown us another way of laying golden eggs , as Leadbetter writes in We - think : " The web 's significance is that it makes sharing central to the dynamism of economies that have hitherto been built on private ownership .
That is why the new organisational models being generated by the web are so unsettling for traditional corporations created in an industrial model of private ownership . "
These corporations are particularly threatened by what Leadbetter calls " gift exchange " , in which ideas and services are made freely available on the web - an exchange that catalyses freeconomics .
" The web reconnects us , " writes Leadbetter , " with a different story about the rise of the west : one that gives a central role to the way ideas are aired and shared rather than focusing on how land and buildings are locked down in private property . "
How far can freeconomics go in subverting existing capitalistic models ?
" Anything that can be digitised or made in silicon can be free , " says Anderson .
True , but Hollywood has so far proved immune to freeconomics even though films can , at least in principle , be converted into digital files .
When will I be able to download the latest cinematic releases to my home computer ?
" I think Hollywood studios have another five years before this becomes an issue .
The files are larger than music files and people do n't yet have connection between their computers and big- screen TVs .
But it will happen . "
Will Hollywood survive in an age of freeconomics ?
" It might take its cue from music .
More and more music is free online , but the live experience of seeing a band play is becoming more popular and that , increasingly , is where musicians make money .
Perhaps Hollywood will have to do the same thing - make the experience of going to the movies something you pay for because you want it more than watching the same thing at home for free . "
Will Britain , the world 's second most expensive nation , become a cheaper place because of the rise of freeconomics ?
" Maybe .
Remember when there were cross-Channel ferries that were £ 1 ?
In principle , there 's no reason why there should n't be more of that in your country . "
But for some , freeconomics is , morally , a terrible thing .
One of Anderson 's leading critics , the American computer technologist Alex Iskold , says : " Just a few decades ago , people had low expectations and worked hard to make a living .
They did not know free and never expected it .
Now , the opposite trend is happening , with free becoming expected online .
Will the new generation , the one that expects something for nothing , work as hard to maintain the high standards of living that we created ? "
Iskold doubts it .
Whether freeconomics undermines such a Protestant work ethic remains to be seen , but Anderson 's idea of freeconomics offers a beautiful , if infantile , dream of a return to the Garden of Eden , where if you are hungry , you merely have to reach to the fruit - laden trees .
Similarly , it seems to confound Sigmund Freud 's reality principle .
Freud wrote that the pre-conscious baby believes in the power of its desires to become real ; the infant only has to imagine a breast or a feeding bottle , and it appears .
Only later do babies learn the disenchanting truth - which Freud called the reality principle - that to desire is not to get .
Arguably , a generation raised on the web 's free - for - all never emerges from this infantile world , never leaves Eden , and never gets taught the hard lessons of economics : namely that we need to do work to get what we want , and that there is no such thing as a free lunch .
Christian Michel , a French libertarian who runs a philosophical discussion group at London 's Institut Français and has written about the ethics of freedom , argues that such hard lessons are good , since they teach us humility .
" The fact that we need to work in order to narrow the distance between our desires and realising them means that nothing in this world comes for free .
The myth of a free lunch , whether it takes the form of ' free health care ' or ' free education ' , is the ultimate dream of the consumer society , to take and consume everything without having to give anything back .
The obligation to pay is the restraint that economics puts on human greed .
Yes , we can have everything we want , but we must accept that there is a price to pay . "
But why ?
" To produce something is to destroy human energy and nature 's resources , " argues Michel .
" This is a serious act , and one which has consequences in the whole universe .
By paying for what we have destroyed , we restore cosmic balance . "
Does freeconomics destroy the cosmic balance ?
" I doubt it , " says Anderson . "
The point about waste is a telling one , but even that 's an old idea .
Years ago there was the fear that if electricity cost nothing people would waste it .
The complaint is that the environmental impact of free goods and services would be cataclysmic .
Fair enough .
But that just means profligate consumption is based on improper accounting , not that free stuff is in itself bad . "
Is freeconomics morally corrupting ?
" Why should it be ?
Does anyone think less of Google because it 's free ?
I do n't think so . "
One last question .
Will Anderson be giving his book away for free ?
" Of course .
I do n't aim to make money from the sale of the book .
My thing is to get my ideas out there . "
Really ?
" Yeah , really .
It 's like when I was in a band ; it was never to make money - it was to get girls .
People have to recall that most books do n't make money .
In so far as I will make money from the book , it 'll probably be in terms of speaking engagements . "
In fact , when his book , Free , is published next year , it will appear in different editions , including a free ebook , and two different printed editions .
In this , he will be following the novelist Scott Sigler , whose new book , Infected , was offered online as a free pdf late last month , but only for five days .
When that period expired , Random House 's Crown imprint withdrew the free pdf and charged , as normal , for printed copies sold in bookshops - a move that exasperated critics .
Anderson is more sanguine : " The important thing is that Crown believes that free digital books can sell more hard copies .
Exactly how to do it is a work in progress , but the philosophical hurdle has now been crossed .
Now we can expect more and better experiments and less hand - wringing about free .
Which is quite an advance , any way you look at it . "
Will Anderson do something similar to Random House when his book is published ?
" We 're going to be more sophisticated , but again it 's still a work in progress .
I 'm not at all sure about time - limited free online editions .
We 're still experimenting with this , but one idea is to use the third - party model and have Microsoft , say , pick up the cost by having advertising in an edition of the book that will be distributed free .
And then there will be a hardback version too , which will be sold in regular bookstores . "
Will I have to pay for that ?
" ' Fraid so , " giggles Anderson down the phone .
Run that by me again .
A book with the word " Free " emblazoned on its cover and contents that hail a new philosophy of freeconomics is going to cost me ?
Somehow , that seems wrong .
Microsoft is launching a program to promote the use of its Windows OS in ultra low - cost PCs , one effect of which will be to limit the hardware capabilities of this type of device , IDG News Service has learned .
Microsoft plans to offer PC makers steep discounts on Windows XP Home Edition to encourage them to use that OS instead of Linux on ultra low - cost PCs ( ULPCs ) .
To be eligible , however , the PC vendors that make ULPCs must limit screen sizes to 10.2 inches and hard drives to 80G bytes , and they cannot offer touch - screen PCs .
The program is outlined in confidential documents that Microsoft sent to PC makers last month , and which were obtained by IDG News Service .
The goal apparently is to limit the hardware capabilities of ULPCs so that they do n't eat into the market for mainstream PCs running Windows Vista , something both Microsoft and the PC vendors would want to avoid .
Imposing the limitations solves a number of problems for the PC industry , said industry analyst Roger Kay , president of EndPoint Technologies Associates .
" It allows PC makers to offer a low - cost alternative , and it prevents eroding of pricing and margins in the mainstream OS market , " he said .
Microsoft declined to comment on the documents .
" We do n't speak publicly about our agreements with [ PC makers ] , " the company said in a statement via its public relations agency .
ULPCs are an emerging class of laptops that carry low price tags -- about $ 250 to $ 500 .
Early examples include the Asus Eee PC and One Laptop Per Child 's XO machine .
The systems already have limited hardware configurations .
Microsoft 's program appears designed to ensure that distinction is maintained and to prevent ULPCs from cannibalizing sales of higher - end systems , Kay said .
Twenty or more other designs are expected to enter the market over the next six months , and Microsoft expects 10 million to 13 million of the devices to sell this year , according to the documents .
IDC 's forecast is more modest :
On Thursday it said it expects ULPC sales to hit 9 million units by 2012 , up from 500,00 last year .
Microsoft notes that the OSes under consideration for the devices include Windows and Linux .
Some PC makers have expressed a preference for Linux because it helps them keep down the cost of the devices .
Microsoft says PC makers are keen to enter the market but want to keep ULPCs as a distinct category from " value " and mainstream PCs .
The company 's new program , scheduled to launch by the end of June , is designed to help make that happen .
Microsoft plans to charge PC makers US $ 26 for Windows XP Home Edition for ULPCs sold in emerging markets such as China and India , and $ 32 for those sold in developed markets , the documents show .
PC makers who are eligible for its Market Development Agreement , however , can get a discount of as much as $ 10 off those prices , the documents say .
That 's where the hardware limits come in .
Besides limits on the screens and hard drives , to be eligible , the systems can have no more than 1G byte of RAM and a single - core processor running at no more than 1GHz .
The program makes an allowance for some chips , including Via Technologies ' C7 - M processors , which run between 1.0GHz and 1.6GHz , and Intel 's upcoming Atom N270 .
By offering Windows XP Home Edition at bargain prices , Microsoft hopes to secure its place in the ULPC market and reduce the use of Linux , according to an official at one PC maker , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the program .
" [ Low - cost PC makers ] have made some good inroads with open - source , and Microsoft wants to put a stop to it , " the official said .
The official did not seem opposed to the program .
It should stimulate more competition between Windows and Linux in the ULPC market , and it could invigorate sales because consumers who want an easy - to - use PC are likely to prefer Windows , the official said .
Microsoft has said it plans to stop selling new Windows XP licenses after June 30 , but it has made exceptions , including for the use of XP Home in ULPCs .
First Battlestar Galactica was reinvented as a must - watch TV show and clever allegory for US foreign policy post - 9/11 .
Then the Doctor returned from Gallifrey to make sci- fi cool and revive mainstream family viewing .
Now Sky
One is hoping to continue the successful reinvention of the genre with a multimillion - pound remake of the 1970s British favourite Blake 's 7 .
The broadcaster yesterday announced that it had approved the development of two new scripts from the production company that holds the rights to the series .
It will hope to retain the addictive plots , realism and moral ambiguity of the original , which featured Roj Blake and his crew on the run from a totalitarian government called the Federation which rules the galaxy with an iron fist .
But it is likely that it will jettison the shaky sets and 1970s special effects which saw one of the spaceships constructed from hairdryer parts .
And there is one other conundrum for the writers to solve : the eponymous Blake died in the final episode of the original series , when he was shot by fellow crew member Avon , and the rest of the main characters appeared to perish too .
As part of a drive to invest more in homegrown drama , Sky One has ordered scripts for two 60 - minute pilot episodes .
If successful , it will be expanded into a six - part series .
The broadcaster said the show would not be a straight remake of the original but a " re-imagining " in the vein of Battlestar Galactica .
Sky said it was too early to talk about the script or casting , but commissioning editor Elaine Pyke said it was likely that Blake would be brought back as the central character .
" We 'll be going for a good , broad appeal .
I think it 's something people are waiting for .
The great thing about Blake 's 7 was the relationship between the people who were cooped up on that ship .
It 's about the characters . "
She said it would take the old version as a " jumping - off point " and seek to walk the same line as Doctor Who in satisfying the original fanbase while bringing in a new generation .
Pyke said it would employ " top , top writers " and tap into " big contemporary themes " .
Blake 's 7 was created by science fiction guru Terry Nation , who also invented the Daleks , when writing for Doctor Who and created Survivors , another fondly remembered series which is also being remade by the BBC .
The show ran from 1978 to 1981 on the BBC , following Blake 's adventures as an intergalactic freedom fighter .
A former resistance leader who is brainwashed by the government and forced to betray his comrades , he is framed and convicted on false charges before escaping from his prison ship on to an abandoned spaceship they christen the Liberator .
With five others , and onboard computer Zen , they try to strike back against the Federation and its leader , Servalan .
Although the show aired for only three years , it has lived on since with well - attended fan conventions and popular websites .
There have been rumours of an onscreen revival since producer Andrew Sewell bought the rights to the series from the estate of the late Nation , with talk of a movie version as long ago as April 2000 .
Recently the company that holds the rights , B7 Media , began producing new audio episodes which have been made available on CD and broadcast on the digital radio station BBC7 .
Sky also played a co-production role in the " re-imagining " of Battlestar Galactica , which was made by the Sci-Fi Channel in the US and premiered on Sky One in 2004 .
It has been widely praised , with Time magazine naming it the best programme on television , and has won a string of Emmys .
Moray Laing , the editor of Doctor Who Adventures magazine , said science fiction was now " mainstream " .
" With Doctor Who it was always big ideas done on a budget , and now it 's big ideas done incredibly well .
Blake 's 7 was the same .
It 's really exciting . "
He said Blake 's 7 was always " more character - led than monster - led " , with the ability for characters to teleport on to planets giving its writers freedom .
But Blake 's 7 fans will be hoping that the plans for the remake do not go the same way as the last cult series that Sky promised to resurrect .
It announced to much fanfare that it planned to remake the 1960s classic The Prisoner but pulled out after clashing with its US production partner .
ITV later said it would step in to save the project .
Backstory
Arriving nine years after the moon landing , Blake 's 7 proved an instant hit in a world still gripped with space fever .
And as Britain struggled through the winter of discontent , the series provided Monday night escapism , the troubles of the fugitive space pirates echoing tensions between government and the public .
When the BBC show burst onto screens in 1978 it became a classic , pulling in 11 million viewers .
Created by Terry Nation , inventor of Doctor Who 's nemeses the Daleks , the series ran for four years , unravelling the destinies of seven misfits thrown together by chance and forced to combat the totalitarian authorities as well as a galaxy full of other perils .
Nation originally pitched Blake 's 7 as ' The Dirty Dozen in space ' .
The final series ended with a cliffhanger - a sure - fire way to guarantee the show 's legacy among sci- fi fans : crew member Avon killed Blake , while federation troops murder the entire crew except Avon .

If you 've used Python for very long , you 've at least heard of list comprehensions .
They 're a way to fit a for loop , an if statement , and an assignment all in one line .
In other words , you can map and filter a list in one expression .
2.1.1 Mapping the List We 'll start with something really simple .
Say you 're trying to square every element in a list .
A freshly - initiated Python programmer might write code like this : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = [ ]
3 for number in numbers :
4 squares .
append ( number * number )
5 # Now , squares should have [ 1,4,9,16,25 ]
You 've effectively ' mapped ' one list to another list .
You could also use the map function , and do something like this : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = map ( lambda x : x * x , numbers )
3 # Now , squares should have [ 1,4,9,16,25 ]
This code is definitely shorter ( 1 line instead of 3 ) but it 's pretty ugly .
It 's hard to tell at a glance what the map function does ( it accepts a function and a list , and applies the function to every element of that list ) .
Plus , you have to give it a function of some sort which looks kind of messy .
If only there were a cleaner way ... perhaps a list comprehension : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = [ number * number for number in numbers ]
3 # Now , squares should have [ 1,4,9,16,25 ]
This does the exact same thing as the previous two examples , but it 's short ( unlike the first example ) and clean ( unlike the second example ) .
No one is going to have any problem determining what it does , even if they do n't know Python .
2.1.2 Filtering the List
What if you 're more interested in filtering the list ?
Say you want to remove every element with a value equal to or greater than 4 ?
( Okay , so the examples are n't very realistic .
Whatever ... )
A Python neophyte might write : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 numbers_under_4 = [ ]
3 for number in numbers :
4 if number < 4 :
5 numbers_under_4 . append ( number )
6 # Now , numbers_under_4 contains [ 1,4,9 ]
Pretty simple , right ?
But it took 4 lines , two degrees of nesting , and an append to do something completely trivial .
You could reduce the size of the code with the filter function : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 numbers_under_4 = filter ( lambda x : x < 4 , numbers )
3 # Now , numbers_under_4 contains [ 1,2,3 ]
Similar to the map function we talked about above , this reduces code size but is really ugly .
What the hell is going on ?
Like map , filter accepts a function and a list .
It evaluates for every list element and if the function evaluates to true , that list element is included in the final list .
Of course , we can do this with a list comprehension as well : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 numbers_under_4 = [ number for number in numbers if number < 4 ]
3 # Now , numbers_under_4 contains [ 1,2,3 ]
Again , using a list comprehension gives us shorter , cleaner , and easier to understand code .
2.1.3 Map and Filter at Once
Now we get to the true power of list comprehensions .
If I have n't yet convinced you that map and filter are generally a waste of your time , hopefully this will .
Say I want to map and filter a list at the same time .
In other words , I 'd like to see the square of each element in the list where said element is under 4 .
Once more , the Python neophyte way : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = [ ]
3 for number in numbers :
4 if number < 4 :
5 squares .
append ( number * number )
6 # squares is now [ 1,4,9 ]
The code is starting to expand in the horizontal direction now !
Alas , what could we possibly do to simplify the code ?
We could try using map and filter , but I do n't have a good feeling about this ... # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = map ( lambda x : x * x , filter ( lambda x : x < 4 , numbers ) )
3 # squares is now [ 1,4,9 ]
While map and filter were ugly before , now they 're just unreadable .
Obviously this is n't a good idea .
Once more , list comprehensions save the day : # 's 1 numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]
2 squares = [ number * number for number in numbers if number < 4 ]
3 # square is now [ 1,4,9 ]
This is a bit longer than the earlier list comprehension examples , but in my opinion still very readable .
It 's definitely better than a for loop or using map and filter .
As you can see , a list comprehension filters then maps .
If you absoulutely need to map then filter , things can get more complicated .
You might even have to use nested list comprehensions , the map and filter commands , or a regular old for loop , depending on what is cleanest .
That discussion , though , is outside the scope of this article .
2.1.4 Generator Expressions
There is a downside to list comprehensions : the entire list has to be stored in memory at once .
This is n't a problem for small lists like the ones in the above examples , or even of lists several orders of magnitude larger .
But eventually this becomes pretty inefficient .
Generator expressions are newish in Python 2.4 , and possibly the least publicized Cool Thing About Python ever .
As in , I just found out about them .
Generator expressions do not load the whole list into memory at once , but instead create a ' generator object ' so only one list element has to be loaded at any time .
Of course , if you actually need to use the entire list for something , this does n't really help much .
But if you 're just passing it off to something that takes any iterable object -- like a for loop -- you might as well use a generator function .
Generator expressions have the same syntax as list comprehensions , but with parentheses around the outside instead of brackets : # 's 1 numbers = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) #
Since we 're going for efficiency , I 'm using a tuple instead of a list ;)
2 squares_under_10 = ( number * number for number in numbers if number * number < 10 )
3 # squares_under_10 is now a generator object , from which each successive value can be gotten by calling .next ( )
4
5 for square in squares_under_10 :
6 print square ,
7 # prints ' 1 4 9 '
This is ever so slightly more efficient than using a list comprehension .
So , you want to use generator expressions for large numbers of items .
You want to always use list comprehensions if you need the entire list at once for some reason .
If neither of these is true , just do whatever you want .
It 's probably good practice to use generator expressions unless there 's some reason not to , but you 're not going to see any real difference in efficiency unless the list is very large .
As a final note , generator expressions only need to be surrounded by one set of parentheses .
So , if you 're calling a function with only a generator expression , you only need one set of parentheses .
This is valid Python : some_function ( item for item in list ) .
2.1.5 Nested ' for ' Statements
List comprehensions and generator expressions can be used for more than just mapping and filtering ; you can create rather complex lists of lists with them .
Not only can you map and filter , you can nest the for expressions .
A python neophyte might write something like : # 's 1 for x in ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) :
2 for y in ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) :
3 if x < y :
4 print ( x , y , x * y ) ,
5
6 # prints ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ( 0 , 2 , 0 ) ( 0 , 3 , 0 ) ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) ( 1 , 3 , 3 ) ( 2 , 3 , 6 )
You can see that this code is pretty crazy .
With a list comprehension , though , you can do this more quickly : # 's 1 print [ ( x , y , x * y ) for x in ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) for y in ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) if x < y ]
2 # prints [ ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 2 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 3 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3 , 3 ) , ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) ]
As you can see , this code iterates over four values of y , and for each of those values , iterates over four values of x and then filters and maps .
Each list item then , is itself a list of x , y , x * y .
Note that xrange ( 4 ) is a bit cleaner than ( 0,1,2,3 ) , especially for longer lists , but we have n't gotten there yet .
The debate over which bag is more environmentally friendly has recently come to an impasse .
People long assumed paper was the logical choice because the bags could be readily recycled and would naturally degrade .
Plastic , while inexpensive to manufacture and transport , will never biodegrade ( and may very well end up floating in the Pacific ocean . )
Unfortunately , paper 's benefits at the end of the line are largely outweighed by the disproportionally large amount of water and energy needed to make them in the first place .
Not to mention , both will take up landfill space if simply tossed in the trash .
Trump goes after Biden after COVID - 19 attacks : ' there 's nothing smart about you '
A graduating New York University student was ejected from his commencement at Yankee Stadium yesterday after he was caught trying to steal home .
William Lopez , 21 , of Manhasset , LI , was among 6,000 students who sat in the box seats behind home plate and along the first base and third base lines at the first graduation to take place at the House that Ruth Built .
NYU , which held its 176th commencement at the storied stadium because of construction at Washington Square Park , had a strict ground rule .
“ The students had been repeatedly advised . . . that they were strictly prohibited from being on the field , ” said NYU spokesman John Beckman .
About three - quarters of the way through the ceremony , Lopez , wearing his gown and mortarboard , leaped over the right - field fence onto the field .
He sprinted across the outfield behind second base and made it to third , as many in the crowd , which also included 20,000 guests , cheered him on .
Lopez , a Yankee and Met fan , turned for home as stadium security and NYPD cops tackled him just feet from his goal .
“ I was trying to make it to home plate , ” Lopez told The Post after he was issued a summons for trespass .
“ I wanted to do a head - first dive .
I almost made it , only 10 feet to go . ”
The Tisch School of the Arts grad said cops told him , “ You ruined your graduation , and I said , ‘ Are you kidding me ?
The crowd was cheering me on . ’ ”
Lopez ’s father , Bob Lopez , said when he saw the figure running on the field , “ My wife asked , ‘ Could that be William ? ’
I said , ‘ No .
That kid ’s an athlete . ”
His son said , “ This is the first and last graduation at Yankee Stadium .
There ’s no better stage than this . ’ ”
But Beckman said that “ the Yankees were very gracious hosts and we were grateful to be allowed to be there , and it is always disappointing to us when one member of our community thinks there ’s a special set of rules for him or her . ”

Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon says Australia 's combat role in Iraq is over , after the announcement from the Defence Force that around 550 combat troops are withdrawing from the country .
A flag - lowering ceremony has been held at Camp Terendak at the Talil Air base to signify the end of the Australian commitment there .
Mr Fitzgibbon said the withdrawal of the troops would close another chapter in Australian military history .
" Our soldiers have worked tirelessly to ensure that local people in southern Iraq have the best possible chance to move on from their suffering under Saddam 's regime and , as a government , we are extremely proud of their service , " he said in a statement .
Details of the soldiers ' return to Australia were not immediately available , but a spokesman for the minister said it would be completed by the government 's deadline of mid-2008 .
" They will be moved home over the course of the next month , " he said .
The majority of the soldiers have been serving in the Overwatch Battle Group , which has been overseeing the security of Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces .
The army team which has been training Iraqi soldiers is also coming home , but around 1,000 others will stay in Iraq in a range of non-combat roles - including the security detachment in Baghdad which protects Australia 's embassy .
A welcome parade will be held in Brisbane upon the troops ' arrival .
Australia was one of the first countries to commit troops to the Iraq war .
In addition to the combat troops , it also deployed aircraft and warships to the Gulf to protect Iraq 's offshore oil platforms .
Australia 's top military commander , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , said in February that after the troops pulled out , Australia would leave behind two maritime surveillance aircraft and a warship helping patrol the oil platforms , as well as a small force of security and headquarters liaison troops .

TEGUCIGALPA , Honduras ( CNN ) --
He 's no Julia Child , but Honduran President Manuel Zelaya showed Tuesday he can attack a cantaloupe and U.S. government claims in a single motion .
President Manuel Zelaya chews on a slice of Honduran melon to demonstrate its safety .
" It 's not in our fruit , " he said about last week 's report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that some Honduran cantaloupes may be contaminated with salmonella .
" It 's not true what they are saying .
Logically , we believe it is an error . "
Then , the 55 - year - old father of four asked the viewers of CNN en Español to indulge him as he engaged in a show - and - tell demonstration .
" Permit me a second , " he said as he stretched his left arm across the tabletop and outside the view of the camera , then pulled into view a box of fruit .
" Here I have the box of melons that we are exporting to the United States ; here are the protective bags , " he said .
Zelaya lifted a cantaloupe from the box , placed it in front of him , then grabbed a knife and a fork .
" Permit me to make a demonstration , " he said , then cut open the fruit , sliced off a chunk , put it in his mouth and chewed vigorously .
" I eat this fruit without any fear , " he said with his mouth full .
" It 's a delicious fruit .
Nothing happens to me ! "
Though the symptoms of salmonella infection -- nausea , vomiting , fever , diarrhea and abdominal cramps -- typically do not occur for several hours after eating tainted food , the point was made .
The demonstration came three days after the FDA said it had linked 50 cases of salmonella in 16 states and nine in Canada to melons from Agropecuaria Montelibana , a grower and packer in San Lorenzo , Honduras .
Though there have been no reports of fatalities , 14 people have been hospitalized in Arizona , California , Colorado , Georgia , Illinois , Missouri , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , Tennessee , Utah , Washington and Wisconsin , the FDA said .
While the company has continued exporting to Europe and Central America and has received no reports of illness , the daily export of 45 containers of melon to the United States has halted , a company official said Monday .
As a result , some 1,500 workers have been laid off , most of them single mothers , and company losses have exceeded $ 3 million , company officials said .
The FDA alert advised U.S. grocers , food - service operators and produce processors to remove from their stock any cantaloupes from the company .
The agency also recommended consumers throw away any cantaloupes determined to be from the company .

Texas congressman 's long - shot candidacy continues to have a life of its own — and he's in no rush to tamp down the enthusiasm .
Ron Paul is down but not out
Two candidates not named John McCain got a combined 219,913 votes in the Pennsylvania Republican primary Tuesday , and one of them is still in the race .
Sort of .

“ I ’m a real candidate , but I try to keep everybody living in the real world , ” Ron Paul said in an interview , alluding to the exuberance of his supporters .
Despite posting a video on his website last month conceding that he could n’t win and indicating that he was winding down his campaign , Paul continues to be a presence in the GOP contest .
He aired a radio ad before the Pennsylvania primary , is still traveling the country to appear at campaign events and , as of the end of March , had more than $ 5 million in the bank .
He got 16 percent of the vote Tuesday , which , combined with Mike Huckabee ’s vote share , meant that more than a quarter of the voters in the Keystone State ’s closed Republican primary voted for somebody other than their party ’s all - but - certain nominee .
The libertarian - leaning obstetrician - turned - congressman 's long - shot candidacy continues to take on a life of its own — and he admits he ’s in no rush to tamp down the enthusiasm .
“ There is no way I could turn it off — I went up to Penn State and had 1,500 people , ” Paul observed , still seemingly amazed at his following .
“ So it ’s just sort of going to go on . ”
The question now , however , is where those die - hards who still line highway medians with Paul 's road signs and flood Internet sites with comments will go with their vote in November .
Many , of course , will be watching Paul for a cue .
“ I ’ll be very cautious about what I do , ” he said , noting his effort to encourage his supporters to get involved with their local Republican committee .
“ If I just endorse somebody from another party and walk away , that probably would n’t go over too well . ”
But while keeping to the same mantra — “ I have no plan , no intention to do so ” —
Paul is also not completely slamming the door shut on a third - party run .
And , perhaps more worrisome for Republicans should they have a tight race with the eventual Democratic nominee , he ’s also not ruling out supporting a third - party candidate .
Asked what he would do if his supporters approached him this fall and asked him whom to support , Paul replied , “ I ’ll respond when I think I should — when we know where the ducks are lining up . ”
“ It ’s a little bit early for that .
Who are the candidates going to be ?
Not only on top of the two parties , but who will be the bottom four or five ? ”
As it stands now , Paul said : “ If I had to make that decision , I do n’t think I ’d be very enthusiastic about anybody . ”
And anyway , Paul and his much - reduced campaign — it has gone from 150 employees at its peak to about 15 staffers now — have turned their focus from November to September , and namely the Republican National Convention .
“ We believe that we ’re going to carry about 50 pledged delegates " to the convention in St. Paul , said Paul spokesman Jesse Benton .
“ A lot of people are technically pledged to other candidates but are going to be there and letting everybody know that they support Ron Paul . ”
That ’s because even though their candidate has largely returned to his day job on Capitol Hill , his supporters are flocking in droves to county and state conventions , hoping to be elected as delegates to the convention .
While they ’ll likely be stymied from having much impact on the platform , Paul supporters are hopeful their guy will secure a speaking slot — and hint that they may stage a visible distraction to McCain and the GOP if their request is not fulfilled .
“ We remain hopeful and would be honored if the RNC would extend a speaking invitation , ” Benton said .
“ If that does n’t happen , Dr. Paul will have an off - site presence and will address supporters . ”
Benton said the campaign has inquired about speaking opportunities and that those conversations are ongoing .
A convention spokesman would say only that the convention program has yet to be determined .
Benton suggested that how Paul is treated by the party at the convention and beyond may dictate what becomes of the Texas congressman ’s supporters in November .
“ If they reach out and are accepting , a lot of people are going to stay with the Republicans .
If they shun us , a lot of people will stay home , walk away or go third party , ” Benton said .
Views on where Paul ’s backers may ultimately wind up on Election Day are mixed .
One GOP strategist took Paul ’s level of support in Pennsylvania as a cautionary sign , calling it “ alarming . ”
“ There ’s enough conservatives who are not Wilsonians or Bush - ites or who have just come to the conclusion that Iraq was a mistake , ” said this conservative veteran .
Others in the party not affiliated with McCain ’s campaign predict that most of Paul ’s small - government followers will choose the least worst option in November .
“ It depends where they fall on the libertarian spectrum , ” said Dave Carney , a Republican consultant who is surrounded by such voters in New Hampshire .
Referring to Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( N.Y. ) and Barack Obama ( Ill. ) , who are still slugging it out for the Democratic nomination , he added : “ Neither Clinton nor Obama will give them much comfort . ”
Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio agrees .
“ A large portion of those Ron Paul supporters are anti-Bush , anti-war Republicans , ” he said .
“ They ’ll wind up back with McCain because , while they may disagree on the war or be mad at Bush , the prospect of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton is more frightening . ”
And , as Carney notes , there is no Paul - like third - party candidate around whom they can rally and vent their frustrations .
That may change if former Rep. Bob Barr ( R - Ga. ) gets the nomination of the Libertarian Party next month at its convention in Denver .
But since launching an exploratory committee earlier this month , Barr has raised little money and has not drawn a fraction of the online fervor that has accompanied Paul ’s bid .
And Paul does n’t seem enticed by the prospect of transferring the passion he ’s developed to his old colleague .
When reminded of Barr ’s prospective run , Paul noted other minor parties with candidates in the mix .
“ I have a lot of friends in the Green Party , ” he said .
“ Some [ of my backers ] may vote for Ralph Nader . ”
Even before endorsements are pondered and convention tactics are planned , Paul has another item on his agenda : selling a book .
“ The Revolution : A Manifesto ” is out next week , and his faithful are filing their pre-orders .
Paul describes the book as an attempt to bring into one place his unique amalgam of beliefs — from monetary policy to individual freedom to a noninterventionist foreign policy .
“ It ’s a small book , ” he said modestly of the 192 - page volume .
But there has been nothing small about the outsized following that transferred an obscure backbencher from South Texas to a campus cult hero and Internet sensation .
Recalling the May of 2007 GOP debate when he and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani scrapped in South Carolina over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and national security , Paul crowed that “ Giuliani made me a celebrity . ”
“ I ’m still doing this , " Paul pointed out , " and he ’s paying back his debt . ”
At this time last year , Sony Corp . 's PlayStation 3 videogame machine looked like a dud , outsold in the U.S. two - to - one by Microsoft Corp .'s Xbox 360 and four - to - one by Nintendo Co. 's Wii .
Now , Sony 's videogames business is back in the hunt .
The Wii still leads in sales world - wide , but the PS3 exceeded Xbox 360 sales in the critical U.S. market during the first three months of the year , helped by an improved selection of games , a 20 % price cut last fall and the lure of models with built - in Blu-ray DVD players .
Sony has also ...

On September 13th , 2007 , Azrul Hisyam Saleh sent me the above footage .
It was presented as an “ old 1924 video of supposed Pterosaur in PNG . ”
I was in no mood to rush to publish this on this blog .
But now I ’m seeing this footage crop up on creationist sites and crypto blogs .
Ugh .
So I ’ll place it here , make a brief remark , and open it to your comments .
To me it looks like someone put a painted tail ( I ca n’t see the wings move ) on an old film , maybe even one from the 1920s , of a frigate bird .
Several things hit my skeptical button on this .
No video in 1924 , so that mistake , that it is film , is understandable .
But wait , the 1925 movie The Lost World might have some copycats I ’ve not seen ?
Or as anyone knows , “ old film ” ( with a sepia look ) can be created today .
I do n’t know .
I really doubt it is a film taken on “ one of the last expeditions to Papua by the Australian Geologist Evan Richard Stanley ” that was hidden in an “ an atheist conspiracy to suppress the truth about the glory of God ’s creation , ” as one David Woetzel is saying about this footage .
I ’m not feeling very forgiving about internet and YouTube hoaxes and pranks today .

When accessibility is not your problem
These notes are derived from presentations at @media 2007 , in San Francisco on 2007.05.25 and in London on 2007.06.07 ( podcast [ MP3 ] ) .
Important note
The title of this presentation is “ When accessibility is not your problem ” – in other words , the specific limited edge cases in which you , as a content author , do not have to worry about accessibility .
I had four people in London telling me they got the impression , or feared others would get the impression , that I am claiming accessibility is not your problem .
That is nonsense , of course .
Table of contents
Notes
Our topic today is the fact that people who write “ Web content , ” or authors as they are called in the jargon , have been expected to carry nearly the full weight of Web accessibility .
If you ’re the one creating the page , you have to take care of pretty much everything – if you want that page to be accessible .
Or if you want the page to meet WCAG , which is n’t always the same thing .
Or if you want to avoid having pedants write in and criticize you for busting WCAG .
I hate it when pedants write in and do that .
Anyway , the whole idea is nonsense .
Web content does not magically transmit itself from you to a disabled person .
There are a number of intermediaries along the way .
Most of those are n’t very important , like your actual Web server .
But by far the most important intermediaries between you and whoever is visiting your site are the browser and adaptive technology .
And not your browser , either – theirs .
I ’m asking you all to sign up to a new philosophy
It ’s not even that new , but what certainly is new is the fact that I ’m calling for everyone to take a pledge of some kind .
The philosophy is really simple :
If a browser or adaptive technology can or should handle an accessibility issue , I wo n’t .
You can say this in a really crude , punchy way : “ It ’s not my problem . ”
Because sometimes it is n’t .
Font resizing
The easiest example is font resizing .
It just is n’t your problem if any visitor , with or without a disability , prefers a different font size .
It still is n’t your problem even if the visitor cannot use or read your page without a different font size .
It is n’t your problem because you do not control the font size .
You merely suggest the font size .
It ’s up to the browser and adaptive technology to decide what font size to actually display .
You find this problem expressed in a couple of ways .
And people restate the same points over and over again until it seems like they actually make sense .
They do n’t .
For example , we ’re constantly told not to use pixels as a unit to size text .
Or we ’re told that pixels are an absolute unit and you must only use relative units .
Usually we ’re told this by people who only recently found out there ’s such a thing as Firefox .
Pixels are a relative unit by spec , full stop .
You can use them if you want , full stop .
You can use any unit for any purpose .
You are merely suggesting the font size .
It ’s up to the browser or screen magnifier or whatever to pick the real size .
You usually wo n’t use px as a unit because there are really very few cases where type has to be a certain exact number of pixels in height .
Maybe the fine print at the bottom of a page that lists the copyright notice and various disclaimers , that sort of thing .
Standards - compliant authors are n’t gonna use pixels very much because the semantics of the pixel unit do n’t come up very much .
If you run into a site that uses px for a lot of text , that ’s gonna be the least of your worries .
It ’s like saying it ’s OK to use tables for layout as long as you use exactly one table .
It may be OK , and that ’s debatable , but you never find that in the wild .
You find a dozen tables for layout on one page .
You do n’t find just one table .
By the same token , you never find a really well - made site whose only flaw is the use of pixels for all its text .
Those are 1997 - era sites we ’re talking about that use tables for layout and spacer GIFs and JavaScript links and all that nonsense .
Picking on standards - compliant developers who very occasionally use the px unit avoids the real problem .
It ’s fundamentally dishonest .
The people who overuse the pixel unit are the worst authors on the Web .
Go after them instead .
There ’s a variation of the complaint about pixels :
We ’re told not to use pixels because they ca n’t be resized .
Well , they ca n’t be resized in a couple of broken browsers , IE6 and IE7 .
Yes , it really is true that they did n’t fix this bug in IE7 .
Incredible , right ?
The IE team fell down on the job there .
If you ’re using IE6 because you do n’t even know there is such a thing as a browser , let alone more than one of them , then you need to have your grandkids over so they can download Firefox and teach you how to make the fonts bigger and smaller .
If you ’re totally blind and your screen reader only works with IE6 , which is n’t true anymore , then it does n’t matter to you what size the fonts are .
You ’re blind .
If you ’re using a screen magnifier whose voice output only works with IE6 , then font size is irrelevant because it ’s a screen magnifier and its entire purpose is to blow up the type size to something you can read .
And anyway , font resizing is an issue for nondisabled people – or people who do n’t have a visual impairment , more accurately .
People with crap vision are already using a screen magnifier or a screen reader .
I dispute the idea that making your fonts even 50 % bigger is truly an accessibility issue .
I dispute that it ’s a dealbreaker for an actual person with a disability .
If they ’re that visually impaired , they ca n’t use their whole computer without help .
The fact that your copyright notice is nine pixels tall is n’t gonna be make - or - break for them .
Font size just is not your problem as an author .
We would n’t be using cascading stylesheets if we did n’t believe in the cascade .
Whoever visits your site has ultimate control over how it looks , even if they do n’t know that or they ’re using a broken browser .
If you ’re worried about text inside Flash movies , yes , it ’s a nightmare .
Why are you using Flash to deliver any kind of text that ’s smaller than a headline ?
If you ’re doing that , what business do you have criticizing other people about accessibility ?
If you are truly interested in making things better for people who need really big fonts , then you need to agitate for screen magnifiers to produce really clear text .
As far as I can tell , everything that is n’t ZoomText 9 blows up the already - drawn bitmap ; it scales the pixels you ’d be looking at if you were n’t using a magnifier .
To my knowledge , only ZoomText 9 re-polls the original outline font file and asks for a new character at something like 250 point .
You want things to improve , work on that .
Here ’s what should really be happening with font - resizers
Every browser should have buttons on its toolbars by default to make text bigger or smaller .
I see that my esteemed colleague Patrick H. Lauke agrees with me on that , based on the article he wrote for Webstandards.org .
The first time you run the browser , it should tell you about those buttons and give you the keyboard equivalents .
And you should be able to bookmark that page .
( I ’m not sure that a browser should ask you if you need “ accessibility . ”
Too many people would probably say no , or they just would n’t understand it , or they ’d just click through it without reading it , like a Windows error message . )
People who need resizable text for any reason should n’t use IE6 or IE7 .
And if they complain to you as a site developer , your advice should be to switch browsers .
If they come back and say that the IT department decided on the browser and they can’t change it , then tell them they ’ve nullified their own complaint and their real complaint is with the IT department .
department .
Your page could have a help screen like the BBC ’s , which attempts to teach people how to use their own browsers .
It might be a good idea .
But ten years into the Web , I refuse to believe that people cannot learn how to press Ctrl- plus or Ctrl - minus or hit a couple of buttons on a toolbar .
or or hit a couple of buttons on a toolbar .
Browsers should remember your text - zoom setting per page , which is what the NoSquint extension for Firefox does .
And yes , this really does mean you should never jimmy up your own font - resizer on your own Web page .
Do you jimmy up your own scrollbars , too ?
It ’s a browser problem .
You ’re a doctor , not a bricklayer .
Foreground and background colours
I read a lot of complaints about accessibility , and I hate the ones that come from critics who claim to represent people with cognitive disabilities .
Usually this means dyslexia , but not always .
Their complaints are usually half - baked , and they ’re not supported by research , and they defy the actual Web .
The groups they purportedly represent have conflicting requirements and a wide range of needs even within the same diagnosis .
And these critics are the most insistent on forcing authors to do things their way , almost to the point of calling you fascist if you disagree with them .
One thing I definitely agree with , though , is the impact of foreground and background colours .
Even if the research is inconclusive , I know from my own experience that some colour combinations are a total bitch to read .
And I ’m not dyslexic .
So of course I ’m willing to believe that colour combinations have an effect on people with various reading disorders .
The problem is you ca n’t get a straight answer about what colour combinations to use .
Or there might not be a straight answer because people with a certain condition prefer one set of colours while another group needs a different set .
Or – and this is the biggie – the colours they need conflict with your own graphic design .
Because , at root , these critics do n’t want you to have control over your own graphic design .
They want a veto over the design of your site because someone they claim to represent might show up one day and have a hard time .
They want to march you off to the Hague to face war - crimes charges for using black text on a white background .
Because they mistakenly think it ’s the author ’s responsibility .
But they do have a point .
It ’s really taxing to look at white - on - black text all day when it ’s coming from a luminous source like a glowing computer monitor .
But the alternatives ?
Using some other set of colours ?
Not your problem .
It ’s a browser problem .
Remember , if these people can’t read your site , there are other sites they ca n’t read .
Millions of them .
You simply are n’t solving their problem if you cook up a set of new colour combos just for your site .
They need accommodation across the board , not just from you .
So again , this is a case for browsers .
And it ’s somewhat easily fixed .
In Opera , you can select a so - called accessibility layout for any site .
It gives you widely - spaced black text on pale - green background .
Since there ’s some dispute as to which exact colour schemes people need , give them several
I ’m calling on the Web Standards Project to publish a library of colour schemes and typography settings that can be included in all browsers .
Some of the obvious options are :
black on green ( like Opera )
black on pale blue
black on beige
Added letterspacing might or might not be useful .
If you need that , then use CSS : letter - spacing : .1em ; .
What I ’m suggesting is that these libraries be published for universal adoption .
I want every browser and screen magnifier to have them built in .
Another thing here : Content has to fit to the window width by default .
You can override that if you want .
I think Opera has it backwards ; it permits horizontal scrollbars by default .
This is not a proposal to underline all the hyperlinks inside body copy and make them blue .
I have no opinions on the correct link styles for these colour combinations .
The Web Standards Project can work that out .
The whole topic is a nice place to begin working on browser accessibility .
You the Web author absolutely do not have to produce your own sets of colour schemes .
It is n’t your problem .
And it ’s time to really implement zoom layouts
I did n’t invent the idea , but I popularized it in an article for A List Apart .
The idea is your browser automatically converts a multicolumn page with dark text on a bright background to a single - column page with light text on a dark background .
My esteemed colleagues at Nomensa in the U.K. did a user test .
It seems that low - vision people are more or less equally happy if you convert a multi-column site to one or two columns , not just one .
The browser already knows how many columns there are on the page .
It does .
It can re-order them , sometimes badly but most of the time not .
It ’s pretty reasonable to assume that a div on the left - hand side that has a lot of links is going to be a navbar , for example , in an English - language site .
It then follows that main content is going to be in the next one or two columns , with the rightmost column reserved for extras of some kind .
Even if it ’s wrong 10 % or 20 % of the time , it ’s correct 80 % or 90 % of the time .
I no longer believe that a Web author should have to set up a zoom layout .
It ’s a browser issue and it should be built in .
Reloading images
Just a small addition : Sometimes you ’re browsing with images off , or an image does n’t load for a reason .
A browser absolutely has to have a command to reload a specific image .
Safari does n’t , for example .
Browsers should do all of the following
Tell you about font resizing when you start up the browser the first time .
Always give you buttons on a toolbar .
Teach you the keyboard equivalents .
Give you new sets of colour combinations you can use .
Always fit content to the window width by default .
Give you zoom layouts .
Because why ?
Because none of that is your problem .
Headings and links read out of context
I want everybody to take a solemn vow never to tell people to write headings or link text that make sense when pulled out of a document .
This has been a completely incorrect idea since it first came up , and not only is it dead wrong , it defies the actual Web .
The idea is that some really cool adaptive technologies , and some total dogs like Jaws , let you pull up a list of headings or a list of links .
Well , that ’s great .
And it ’s seemingly harmless .
It might even help :
You can jump to a certain heading right away , or go to a certain link , though I do n’t see how that one is really useful .
The problem is that HTML and XHTML documents are structured in a tree .
A node can have siblings or parents or children .
That ’s why you ca n’t put a heading inside a paragraph , but you can have a heading followed by a paragraph .
There ’s a reason we have six heading levels , and that reason is not just the semantics of a document , it ’s the document tree .
An h3 has to follow an h2 or another h3 .
Now , think back to the olden days .
People would mix and match heading levels because the style for headings was too big and too bold .
We told people to use CSS to regulate the style of headings and to use headings correctly .
Well , we ca n’t be a little bit pregnant :
If we ’re insisting that people use headings in the right order , we cannot also tell them to write heading text that makes sense in any order .
This is almost the stupidest advice in Web accessibility , and I do n’t know why it has n’t been killed off yet .
If I am the writer of a page – and I mean writer , not author – then I have set up my headings at certain levels in a certain order because they must have those levels and order .
It is solely my decision , not your decision and not Jaws ’s decision .
It ’s based on document semantics .
There ’s a corollary to this one .
Some pedants want every heading on a page to have different text .
And they absolutely insist , with foam pushing out of the corners of their mouths , that link text has to be different in every case .
( Oh , but you can never use two different link texts to point to the same place . )
Of course , this is nonsense , and it reveals their naïveté .
I guess they do n’t get out much and do n’t read a lot of Web sites with product comparisons .
( I cooked up an example page that reuses heading and link text for three different car models being compared . )
I ’m sorry , but there really can be identical heading text several times on a page , sometimes with exactly the same heading level .
And link text can be exactly the same , too .
I should really make a stronger point about link text .
People who hate the Web always tell us that links should be grouped in little lists at the ends of paragraphs or documents .
Because that ’s supposed to be “ accessible . ”
These people are enemies of our industry and need to be shunned .
A link is an inline element ; you can style it to work as a block - level element , like in navbars that use CSS to look like buttons or tabs , but a link is fundamentally something you insert into running text .
You the writer – again , not the author – have a reasonable expectation that people will actually read your text and understand the context of the link .
Yes , people skim through Web pages , but people have to read your text if they want to understand the link .
As writers , we are not authorizing you or Jaws to pull out our link text and remix it .
Why do n’t you rearrange the sentences , too ?
It ’s your site and you can put links wherever you want .
If somebody has some kind of expensive toy that takes your Web site and shakes it up like a pair of maracas , well , that ’s their problem , not yours .
To comply with Web standards , you have to write a well - structured document .
Your document is n’t structured anymore if you ’re encouraging people to firebomb your house and turn it into a pile of sticks .
And people who think otherwise can stick it .
Yes , the title counts as information about a link
If your browser or adaptive technology cannot display or render the title attribute of a link or of anything else , then it ’s broken .
You the author are permitted by spec to add title s to nearly anything , and in common use you will mostly find title on hyperlinks .
Of course you can use the title attribute to add more information .
If somebody comes along with a broken browser or screen reader or whatever , how is that your problem ?
If the complaint is that tooltips do n’t hold enough text and disappear too fast , well , who said that title s had to be displayed as tooltips ?
Also , what is the real problem here ?
If I misunderstand a link , I get a page I do n’t want ?
Well , quit crying to mommy :
Hit your Back button or press a key on your keyboard and you ’re back where you started from .
Really , this is hypertext , not Club Med , and things are going to go wrong now and then .
If people would limit themselves to cases where an unclear link text is really harmful , I ’d be on their side .
For example , I think that links to PDF files need to be super - explicit .
I put “ ( PDF ) ” in the link text , I start the title attribute with PDF : , and I use the correct link type , type= " application / pdf " :
< a href = " item.pdf "
title= " PDF : Fuel economy in hybrid and diesel vehicles , 2007 "
type=" application / pdf " >
a new report ( PDF )
</a>
And anyway , a device should be able to tell from the filename extension that we ’re dealing with a PDF .
Linking to something like that is really linking to non-Web content , and you have to warn people .
That sort of thing has to be crystal - clear .
Or maybe when you ’re linking to porn , or when you ’re linking to a page that automatically plays sounds or music .
Sure .
But linking to a normal Web page that somebody does n’t expect ?
Give me a break .
Abbreviations , acronyms , initialisms
I really wish people would get off our backs about these things .
First of all , nobody is ever going to be able to agree on the definitions of those terms .
But whenever there ’s an argument over definitions , what ’s really happening is an effort to redefine one concept as another concept .
Maybe people want every initialism to be called an acronym , and every acronym an abbreviation , which means that you only have to use abbr in your markup .
It does n’t matter .
In the real world , we have abbreviations , acronyms , initialisms , symbols , notations , and more .
HTML is simply inadequate to mark up everything under the sun .
HTML does n’t even have footnotes , for example .
And you ’re arguing over what ’s an acronym and what ’s an abbreviation ?
Please .
Besides , the entire discussion shows a lack of scholarship .
The people with an axe to grind can only ever come up with computer terms as examples , maybe because they ’re nerds .
But even at my local public library I was able to find reference books like The Canadian Dictionary of Abbreviations by Thérèse Dobroslaviƈ , 1994 .
As a staunch defender of Canadian English , that ’s what I ’m gonna use here .

And the WCAG requirements do not actually achieve accessibility .
You ’re supposed to specify the expansion of an abbreviation or acronym the first time it appears .
You can do it any number of ways .
But what if your abbreviation or acronym does n’t have an expansion ?
Does “ TV ” have an expansion ?
How about “ DVD ” ?
That ’s a really special case .
How about “ MP3 ” ?
What if the expansion is widely unknown and in another language , like “ i.e. , ” “ e.g. , ” or “ QED ” ?
Those do n’t really have expansions anymore .
How about “ ABS ” for anti-lock brakes ?
Should n’t that be ALB ?
No , because “ ABS ” really means Anti-Blockier System ; it ’s German .
; it ’s German .
How about “ E. coli ” or “ C. difficile ” ?
Do you really care what the “ E. ” in “ E. coli ” stands for ?
And the requirement also ignores the fact that you can jump into a document at any point .
You can easily miss the expansion that ’s farther up in the document .
If you do n’t understand an abbreviation or acronym , why is it the page author ’s responsibility to solve the problem ?
You ca n’t Google it ?
You ca n’t look it up in the dictionary ?
Who told you that you had the right to understand every paragraph , sentence , word , syllable , fragment , and letter on a page ?
Anyway , this all boils down to a failure of software : Screen readers should include well developed exception dictionaries .
But of course they do n’t .
I mean , for years they could n’t even differentiate between homographs reliably .
Those are words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently .
The big one is R - E - A - D : Is it “ reed ” or “ red ” ?
Or how about one that ’s familiar to everyone interested in accessibility , a skip - navigation link ?
If you use the link text “ Skip to content , ” be advised that some screen readers cannot even get that right .
They say “ skip to contént , ” which is n’t even English .
We work in an industry in which we expect people with disabilities to shell out hundreds of dollars for software that will just barely put them on a level playing field .
Then we find out that these screen readers cannot even read real - world text .
Maybe it would help if the developers had writers or linguists on staff .
So of course it ’s too much to ask for these products to have really good exception dictionaries .
In English , abbreviations and acronyms are usually easy enough to spot , even if you use one of the antiquated British house styles and leave periods off many abbreviations .
A lot of these things do have periods or hyphens , or they ’re written in all caps or a strange mixture of upper and lower case , and they appear in predictable patterns inside sentences .
Even some seemingly confusing uses are n’t that confusing .
Here ’s the main drag of the University of Toronto :
This is not as easy in other languages .
An example I can give you is from Italian , for a legal company designation : SpA ( Società per Azioni ) .
Sometimes you write that as S.p.A. , which helps , but other times you do n’t , and it looks like “ spa , ” except that even a program as dumb as Jaws should be able to notice the lower - case p .
( You find something vaguely similar with a British company designation , plc. )
Here ’s one from German :
GAU Größter anzunehmender Unfall ( worst - case scenario ) Gau ( county , state )
Do you think that examples like that can be handled really well by HTML markup ?
I asked developers at Freedom Scientific and GW Micro to tell me a bit more about their exception dictionaries for abbreviations and acronyms .
They did n’t .
How about VoiceOver on Mac ?
Well , it ’s a joke .
The full list of pronunciation exceptions is 802.11 b and g , two smileys , GIF , GUI , SMPTE , and SQL , for which it gives only one of two pronunciations ( “ sequel ” and not “ S - Q - L ” ) .
I do n’t have perfect advice on this topic .
I only have partial advice .
I think you should follow HTML semantics and use abbr for abbreviations and acronym for acronyms .
But you really only have to do that for items that might be mispronounced .
And I think you need to specify an expansion only if a reasonable reader wo n’t know what the short form is .
That means if your site is about public health , you do n’t have to expand “ E. coli ” or “ C. difficile . ”
I checked my own documents .
On my personal Weblog , for example , I used acronym without expansion 149 times and with expansion 93 times .
Most of the time I do n’t expand acronym .
I used abbr without expansion 46 times and with expansion 200 times .
Most of the time I do expand abbr .
I added a specific language code twice .
By the way , we ’re solving this problem properly in accessible PDF .
PDFs are binary files and can contain little databases .
In fact , PDFs really are databases .
So we ’ve decided that abbreviations and acronyms will be internally linked to little lookup tables that the user may query if they ’re confused .
That means we can disambiguate “ St. George St. ” perfectly every time .
HTML ca n’t do that .
Maybe we should stop trying so hard .
The only advice WCAG 1 has for cognitive disabilities , “ write clearly & simply ”
Let me give you one of the little catchphrases of Web accessibility .
And we really do have catchphrases .
“ We can make a Web site work with zero hearing .
We can make one work with zero vision .
We can even make a Web site work with almost zero movement .
But we ca n’t make a Web site work with zero cognition . ”
That ’s kind of unfair , right ?
It ’s an exaggeration .
Most people with disabilities using the Web do not have “ zero ” of any particular sense or ability .
We deal a lot with totally - blind people using screen readers .
Maybe too much , in fact .
But most people have at least a little of the sense or ability left over that would cause them to need accessibility in the first place .
And that is of course still true of cognitive disabilities , including dyslexia .
It is n’t true that these disabilities are always nicely isolated little deficiencies , like having a hard time reading print .
There are often other cognitive deficiencies involved , like short - term memory loss .
But when it comes to Web accessibility , we understand that having one of these learning disabilities merely means you have a learning disability , not that you ca n’t understand the topic we ’re discussing or you ca n’t do anything else in your life .
It ’s one fact about you , but not the only fact .
My problem here is that advocates for people with cognitive disabilities do n’t seem to be interested in isolating their advice the way the disabilities themselves are isolated within people .
Having a learning disability is n’t everything about you ; it ’s just one thing .
But advocates seem to think the Web is really only one big thing , and it must be completely made over to their specifications .
There seems to be an effort to apply cognitive - disability guidelines across the board .
WCAG 1 does n’t totally back that up , but the only real guideline that pertains to learning disabilities tends to be overapplied to the real Web .
WCAG Checkpoint 14.1 says “ Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site ’s content . ”
People tend to overlook the last few words there : “ appropriate for a site ’s content . ”
They tend to write E - mails to site owners complaining that the writing of the site is n’t clear and simple enough .
Or , if they ’re going beyond the WCAG guidelines , they write in to complain that there ’s too much use of allusion or sarcasm , which are hard to understand .
If you ’re advocating for increased accessibility for dyslexics or anybody else with a learning disability , then every site tends to look like a nail , and the only tool you have is a hammer .
We can ask that every picture on the Web have an alt text .
We can ask for really good Web semantics , and that includes really good forms .
We can ask for captioning and audio description on videos .
But we ca n’t ask every site to “ write clearly and simply . ”
I ’m not the first person to say this , but whenever other people bring it up , they tend to mention the original use of the Web , which was for a physics laboratory .
Or they use computer technology itself as an example .
But as with acronyms and abbreviations , that ’s too facile .
If you think that every site on the Web can be written clearly and simply , maybe you need to look at Web sites that are narrowly focussed on a limited topic .
So let ’s look at one now .
And that limited topic is gardening , which everybody who has so much as a square inch of land likes to do .
I looked at this page by the Royal Horticultural Society .
It ’s about a plant disease called sudden oak death , which sounds like a great name for a rock band .
Pathogens Phytophthora ramorum ( ramorum blight , popularly known as “ sudden oak death ” ) and P. kernoviae .
The former occurs in Europe and in western USA .
The latter is a previously unknown species occurring at only a few sites in the UK , mostly in Cornwall , where it was discovered during surveys for P. ramorum .
Neither are native to Europe or the USA but their origins are unknown .
Problem Leaf , stem and bark infections on various native and garden trees and shrubs .
Both species are frequent on rhododendrons ; viburnums are a major host of P. ramorum only .
Bark canker caused by P. ramorum was recently discovered at a single site on Quercus petraea , the first record on a native English oak .
Cankers on trees have been relatively rare and most are associated with heavy leaf infection in understorey rhododendrons .
That ’s a site about gardening .
You could clean it up a little .
You could make the references easier to follow ; you could avoid using terms like “ the former ” and “ the latter . ”
But these organisms do not have everyday names .
You would have to keep using the Latin designations just to accurately describe what ’s going on with this pathogen .
And even the common names of many plants are pretty big words – rhododendrums , viburnums .
This is a page that is probably impossible to make accessible to a wide range of people with cognitive disabilities .
There is probably nothing you can do to make it really work .
And it ’s an informational site about gardening from a society endorsed by the royal family .
You could barely come up with a more mainstream example .
And what are some other examples ?
Well , start with blogs .
We ’ve got millions of the things , and most of them are about expressing oneself .
A lot of people who are bad writers just forge on ahead and create their own blogs .
Why not ?
They can .
Everyone has a printing press now .
I ’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that , while we might insist on good HTML and proper alt texts and so on , which do n’t interfere with personal expression in any serious way , we ca n’t go around and tell blog authors that they have to write in only a certain way .
It may be true that personal blogs by their nature are inapplicable to accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities .
Not exempt , inapplicable .
They ’re just not the kinds of sites that should apply those guidelines .
How about news sites , including wire services ?
Sometimes you see the same wire story on ten different sites .
News reports are often written quite simply , but first of all , there are words in there you can’t change , like geographical names or the actual legal names of certain criminal charges .
And second of all , the sites that pick up a wire - service story may not have the right to change it substantially .
They usually have the right to make small changes , like turning Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius .
Or maybe transactional sites .
A catalogue of items may have to use the names of those items .
Or literary sites .
If you post your journalism or your fiction online , you should n’t have to rewrite it .
Those are just some examples of sites where accessibility for cognitive disabilities may be inapplicable .
The question is :
Where are they applicable ?
If the title of this presentation is “ When accessibility is not your problem , ” when is it your problem ?
I do have some ideas here .
I think official or company blogs should come under the remit of cognitive - accessibility guidelines .
Maybe not the thousands of individual blogs at Microsoft , but if your company has exactly one blog and it represents the company , not the writer , it ’s applicable .
I think that information sites of all kinds should be applicable .
And that one runs the gamut from most government sites to product pages by multinational corporations .
You should be able to look at a page that describes a lawn mower you want to buy and be able to understand all of it , or nearly all of it , even if you have trouble reading .
Every kind of mapping or directions site has to apply to these guidelines .
Your subway trip planner has to work for everybody .
A site that people with cognitive disabilities could use as a replacement for a site with a lot of text has to be applicable to the guidelines .
If you have a site that makes it easy to publish a podcast or a video , then that whole site has to be applicable .
This is a slippery slope toward making sites for disabled people super - accessible while the rest of the Web is crap , but I do n’t think we ’re going down that slope just yet .
I think if you have a Web application and you want to make it more accessible , and you make a so - called simple version as a way to do that , you should keep the so - called regular version .
That ’s because people grow more competent over time and they wo n’t always need handholding .
Even people with learning disabilities appreciate shortcuts sometimes .
Technology
I think it ’s way too hard to write clearly and simply even if you want to do it .
I think the writing tools are terrible .
Really , they ’re nonexistent .
You can learn to write just by writing , but this is the sort of thing where software should be helping you out .
And I do n’t mean the grammar checker in Microsoft Word .
You need help learning to write simply .
Plain English is harder than complicated English .
Next , if you want to use markup to make your complex writing accessible , maybe by including explanations of sarcasm and allusions , well , there ’s pretty much nothing that would help for that .
This is a perfect place for a microformat .
You could use span or a div with a certain kind of class name , like metaphor or double - meaning .
And you could style those differently if you wanted .
This is a good place for the CSS cursor styles , like cursor : help .
I think Lisa Seeman down in Israel has been talking about improving the “ authoring tools ” in this way .
We now have a way to do it pretty easily – microformats .
And it ’s been my experience that nobody knows there are screen readers specifically for people with learning disabilities .
A company that was founded by the genius who invented the reading machine , Ray Kurzweil , has a few products .
( Ray Kurzweil does n’t own the company now , and actually , the big thing he invented was optical character recognition that could read any font , not the part about reading text out loud . )
These products do a lot of useful things .
They ’ll read out words or sentences while they highlight them on the screen .
They can isolate words or sentences so you are n’t overwhelmed by the amount of text .
Browsers could be improved .
Apart from handling colour combinations for Web sites , what about the no-stylesheet view ?
What happens when you turn off CSS altogether ?
Of course that ’s a misnomer , since what you ’re really looking at is the browser ’s default CSS .
I think this sort of thing will happen more often with cognitively - disabled persons than others .
They load up your site , and they try to read it , and they sit there kind of hanging by a thread trying to understand it .
This groups is more likely to kind of give up on some sites and have to use a brute - force technique just to read it .
But the typography of default stylesheets has n’t really improved since Netscape 2.0 .
Really , with the much better fonts we ’ve got , I see no reason for everything to be Times Roman , with too much bold , not enough linespacing , and line measures as wide as the window .
That could be cleaned up almost immediately at next to no effort .
You could produce a better default stylesheet single - handedly .
And there ’s no reason why the onscreen default stylesheet has to have a bright white background .
We could go back to light grey , sort of like Netscape 0.9 .
The print stylesheet could still have no background colour specified .

In 2005 , the state of Texas passed one of the quickest bills in decades , changing the age at which young people with parental consent could legally marry from 14 to 16 .
Why the hurry ?
Warren Jeffs and the FLDS had come to town .
Hereâ€™s a quick , easy definition of the Fundamentalist Church of Latter - Day Saints : â€ œThe FLDS practice polygamy in arranged marriages , sometimes between underage girls and older men.â€ 
This is the accepted tagline used with almost no variation by AP , Reuters , the Post , the Times , Fox News … palatable .
Neutral .
Not too upsetting to hear during breakfast .
Not nearly as hard to think about as the truth , which is simple enough for even the Texas Legislature to grasp :
An underage girl is a child .
A child cannot consent to a marriage , arranged or otherwise , or to the sexual consummation of that illegal marriage , nor can her parents consent for her .
Non-consensual sex is rape .
Jeffs , his father before him and two generations of their fellow predators had created , maintained , financed and grown a system of induction centers , internment camps and breeding facilities for new victims , using religion as a cover and barbed wire , isolation and the threat of damnation as controls .
Not for years , for decades .
If prosecutable evidence was difficult to obtain , the basic tenets and practices of FLDS were no secret .
Jeffsâ€™ 2002 conviction on accomplice rape charges certainly confirmed the rumors , if confirmation were needed .
Now an entire nest of the same maggots has been exposed to view … and still the mealy - mouthed coverage of the FLDS persists , with a fresh infusion of images of prayerful , modest womanhood cruelly separated from beloved children .
When those weeping mothers in quaint cotton dresses appear on the morning shows again tomorrow , when they show the world the squeaky - clean classrooms and community kitchens of that compound in El Dorado , try to see past the home - baked bread and the tear - stained faces .
Try to see what those pathetic , brainwashed women , victims and perpetrators themselves , are truly showing all of us : the daylight side of a world of nighttime terror , the mechanics of a rape camp .
About two weeks ago , John McCain , in a high - profile speech , unveiled his response to the mortgage crisis .
Despite the seriousness of the issue , the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a classic YOYO policy : “ You ’re on your own . ”
As the New York Times noted shortly after the speech , “ The real core of his speech was his argument against government action to help dig distressed homeowners — or the country — out of the mortgage mess … .
His suggestion that federal aid might wrongly reward ‘ undeserving ’ homeowners sounded both mean - spirited and economically naive .
And then there is the double standard .
He seemed less concerned about the government helping reckless bankers , endorsing its role in preventing the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns . ”
Yesterday , in one of the quicker flip - flops in recent memory , McCain reversed course .
The Washington Post , apparently anxious to give McCain a hand , said the senator was “ refining ” and “ revising ” his plan .
That ’s enormously generous of the newspaper , but in reality , McCain ’s proposal was an embarrassing dud , so he gave up on it .
Senator John McCain , who drew criticism last month after he warned against broad government intervention to solve the deepening mortgage crisis , pivoted Thursday and called for the federal government to aid some homeowners in danger of losing their homes , by helping them to refinance and get federally guaranteed 30 - year mortgages .
“ There is nothing more important than keeping alive the American dream to own your home , and priority No. 1 is to keep well - meaning , deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure in their homes , ” Mr. McCain said in a speech on economic themes that he gave at a window company in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn .
Funny , two weeks ago he thought these same homeowners should n’t be “ rewarded ” for acting “ irresponsibly . ”
Perhaps the nation ’s callous constituency is not quite as large as the McCain campaign had hoped .
Congress returned Tuesday from a two - week spring break to find the Bush administration now willing to talk compromise on new wiretapping powers , and on amnesty for telecoms that spied on U.S. citizens .
That means an end to the drama that 's characterized the debate thus far – a closed congressional session ; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington - style floor speeches , and unrelenting , factually - challenged charges that lawmakers are blindfolding the nation 's spies .
Now negotiations over the bill will likely happen over weeks and months , behind closed doors , with the House horse - trading oversight provisions with the Senate in exchange for a compromise on total amnesty for the nation 's telecoms .
If you 've been having trouble tracking what the various surveillance bills are all about , do n't blame yourself – there 's been plenty of misinformation going around .
Here 's Wired.com 's definitive guide to the congressional surveillance debate .
Why is Congress expanding the government 's spying authority ?
After 9/11 , or possibly before , President Bush instructed the nation 's spies to begin a secret spying program that reportedly includes data - mining records of U.S. residents ' phones , travels and purchases in order to find targets to wiretap .
The administration says its warrantless eavesdropping only listened in on international phone calls and e-mails .
After The New York Times revealed a portion of the program in December 2005 , Bush eventually allowed a secret spying court to review it .
After the secret court secretly declared the program illegal , Congress legalized portions of it temporarily in the summer of 2007 .
Called the Protect America Act , the law allowed the National Security Agency to continue to wiretap inside the United States , but did not allow it to target Americans inside the country without a warrant .
Residents could still be spied on in bulk , say , by collecting every e-mail sent to or from someone outside the country , but the NSA could n't focus on an American inside the United States without a warrant .
That law expired in February after House Republicans voted down an extension , hoping to force Democrats to pass a permanent law without debate in the House .
How is Congress expanding the government 's spying authority ?
The NSA says it needs to position wiretapping facilities inside the United States because , these days , much international - to - international communication passes through telecom hubs located on U.S. soil .
While the agency could tap these communications overseas , it would be a real pain .
So the House and the Senate both passed bills that would let the NSA install wiretapping rooms in phone and internet hubs located in the United States .
This weakens the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , which largely required a special spying court to approve any intelligence gathering wiretaps inside the United States .
Under FISA , the government had to show the court that it had good reason to think the target was a terrorist or an agent of a foreign power .
If both the Senate and the House passed this , why is n't it law yet ?
The Senate bill included a controversial provision that would grant retroactive immunity to the telephone companies that allowed the NSA to illegally wiretap internet traffic and phone calls passing through their networks .
These companies are being sued in some 38 class - action lawsuits .
President Bush had decried these lawsuits as the work of greedy " class- action trial lawyers " – like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and those bloodsuckers at the ACLU .
He 's threatened to veto any bill expanding his spying powers unless it also lets the phone companies off the hook .
The House bill does not include immunity , and that 's the primary reason for the holdup .
There 's also the little matter of exclusivity .
The House bill reemphasizes that the FISA law rules how surveillance happens inside the United States .
The Senate bill does n't say that explicitly , largely because President Bush and his lawyers argue that he 's a wartime president who does n't have to follow the law .
So under the proposed new powers , any international e-mail or international phone call I make can be legally intercepted by the government ?
Yes .
But if the government decides your call has some intelligence value and writes it up in an intelligence report , they are supposed to black out your name or give you a pseudonym .
But if your name is necessary to understand the intelligence information , or an official calls up the NSA and asks for your name , they 'll identify you .
Newsweek reported that this happened to 10,000 people in the United States from January 2004 to May 2005 .
They can also use the information from your international communications to decide they need to target all of your calls and use that initial wiretap to get a more invasive one .
I saw ads saying that the Democrats want to make U.S. spies get warrants before listening in on terrorists in Pakistan phoning their comrades in Iraq , thus crippling our intelligence .
Why do Democrats hate the United States ?
The ads are false .
The secret spying court has no authority over what the NSA does overseas .
If the NSA finagled a way to wiretap entire cellphone networks in Iraq , Pakistan or Afghanistan , they are free to do so without getting a warrant .
So you may safely ignore attack ads from supposedly nonpartisan groups or columns like this one .
So what happens next ?
The Senate leadership will decide whether to accept the House bill as the place to start negotiating a compromise bill , or they could reject it .
If Bush wo n't sign spying legislation without telecom amnesty and the House wo n't do that , what then ?
The 2007 temporary expansion of spying powers known as the Protect America Act seriously degrades starting in August .
Without a bill signed into law before then , the nation 's spies will not have much in the way of blanket wiretaps inside the United States .
So if the House and Senate send Bush a bill that expands spying powers , but does not include amnesty , Bush will be forced to choose between powers that he says are necessary to prevent an attack on the country , or amnesty for the phone companies that helped him .
Bush could try to start the programs up again based on his theory of the " unitary executive , " but it 's unlikely any telecom would help out this time without a court order .
So the NSA would fall back on the long - standing FISA court to get warrants when they want to wiretap inside the United States , or figure out how to wiretap foreigners outside the county , like they used to .
__ What about the premise of the bill ?
Is it true that international communications are increasingly crossing the United States because of fiber optics ?__
That depends on how you define " increasing . "
The total number of calls and e-mails from one country to another that travel through U.S. switches is going up , since that traffic continues to grow rapidly .
But the percentage of international traffic that transits the United States is dropping year after year , as more counties wire up to one another directly .
Remember those cable cuts in January ?
Those were cables running from Europe to Asia , meaning that it 's increasingly unlikely that an e-mail or phone call from France to Japan will go through the United States .
Wo n't all this just go away if Clinton or Obama takes the presidency ?
Two words .
Clipper Chip .

Anna Berlinrut — Yesterday we ( NJ Peace Action , Paula Rogovin of the Bergen County , NJ Chapter of MFSO , and yours truly ) filed suit against George Bush in Federal Court for his unconstitutional war !
Frank Askin , our attorney with the Rutgers Constitutional Law Clinic plans to appeal our case up to the Supreme Court , if necessary .
The goal of the suit is that never again shall a president take our nation to war without a Declaration of War from the Congress .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——

From Law.com —
An anti-war activist group sued President Bush in U.S. District Court in Newark on Tuesday , seeking a declaratory judgment that the war in Iraq is illegal and unconstitutional .
The suit , New Jersey Peace Action et al. v. Bush , represented by the Constitutional Law Clinic at Rutgers University Law School - Newark , alleges that the war violates article I , section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , which assigns to Congress the authority to declare war .
Clinic director Frank Askin said the framers at the 1787 constitutional convention denied war - making powers to the president except in response to sudden attacks when Congress might not have time to react quickly .
“ The founders were very clear that only Congress could make that awesome decision , ” he said in a statement .
“ They [ members of Congress ] were not permitted to delegate that power to the president and thus be able later to disclaim responsibility for a decision gone bad . ”
The lead plaintiff in the suit , New Jersey Peace Action , is a nonprofit advocacy group that says it promotes peaceful alternatives to war .
Other plaintiffs are Paula Rogovin of Teaneck and Anna Berlinrut of Maplewood , N.J. , each of whom has a son in military service .
The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the president ’s unilateral decision to launch a full - scale invasion without congressional approval is “ capable of repetition . ”
Askin pointed to suggestions that the Bush administration is considering some type of military action against Iran because of allegations that country is attempting to build nuclear weapons .

We gave you a big list of legitimate passive income ideas , but what are some of the key success factors to build your passive income ?
The first thing you have to realize is that it is not easy , but there are key factors that will help you build successful passive income streams .
Why is it important to have passive income streams ?
Your job is not going to be there forever .
You ca n’t work forever .
And you ca n’t retire until you figure out a way to replace the income from your job .
7 Key Factors to Build Successful Passive Income Streams
1. Passion
Do what you love .
If you hate writing , do n’t start a blog or try to write for money !
When you are passionate about something , it is much easier to stick to it and become successful , because success takes time and effort , you want to enjoy what you do while you move toward your goal .
Find income ideas that are compatible with who you are , and success will inevitably follow .
2. Proficiency
Focus on what you are good at , or take the time and effort to become proficient .
You do n’t want to jump into a passive income idea like investing in real estate or stock market investing unless you have the necessary knowledge to avoid basic mistakes and do relatively well .
No , you do n’t have to be the leading expert , but you need to arm yourself with the necessary knowledge and be proficient .
This is especially true when you are leveraging expertise to make extra income .
For example , you ca n’t blog or write about a subject you do n’t know , you can not be a math tutor if you are n’t good at it , and you ca n’t sell food or recipe for money if you cannot cook !
3. Patience
Do n’t expect to see the desired results right away — e.g. , this blog was losing money for three months before I earned my first dollar .
Building passive income streams take time and effort .
For some income , you might see results right away ; for others , you might have to wait and work at it for a while .
Time is your friend when it comes to building passive income streams — start as early as you can and stay in it as long as you can .
4. Effort
Some ideas take more effort than others .
For example , investing my money in the stock market does n’t take that much effort — just contribute the money , set up my asset allocation , research mutual funds , and ETFs , invest , rebalance quarterly , and watch my money grow .
On the other hand , some income ideas take a lot of effort , especially initially .
For example , this blog consumes about 3 hours a day .
And other ideas like writing a book could take a lot of initial effort before you end up with a marketable product .
5. Persistence
Not everything you try will be successful — e.g. , my little stint with the bulk candy vending business or real estate investing using the Carlton Sheets method .
You may have to try dozens of ideas before you find the one that truly works for you .
The important thing is you do n’t give up , and you keep trying .
6. Diversify
Do n’t stop at the first thing that works .
The whole idea is to have as many passive income streams as you could .
You never know when one would dry up — e.g. , even the Niagara Falls stopped for a day !
Diversification is a great way to reduce risk , and it ’s the best insurance against losing an income stream .
7. Little by Little
The nice thing about diversifying and having a lot of income streams is that little things do add up to a lot .
Just like they said , “ A dollar here , a dollar there .
The savings add up ” — in our case , it is the income that adds up .
Bottom Line
I personally have several income streams working for me .
You can find many of these in the passive income ideas list I shared .
I can say with certainty that I have lived by these seven key success factors to get where I am today .
Building passive income streams is not something you can do overnight .
It takes a lot of time , patience , effort , and the willingness to try again and again despite failures .
The way I see it is that I am planting seeds or opening doors if you will .
Not everything I try will come to fruition , and there wo n’t be a stampede through every door I open .
But over time and across many income streams , the combined effect will snowball and become increasingly significant .
Well , there you have it — my secret recipe for building successful passive income streams .

Why Fat People Always Feel Hungry - I 've been reading a lot about diets and obesity , and I 've finally come to some conclusions which have been corroborated in Gary Taubes ' paradigm - shattering book , Good Calories , Bad Calories .
The body regulates fat metabolism very precisely in ALL people -- fat , lean , and in - between .
In a few sentences - Digestion of carbs and sugars leads to insulin secretion .
Insulin secretion tells your body to store fat in fat cells .
Insulin secretion also prevents your body from releasing fat from fat cells .
You can not lose weight ( burn fat ) with insulin in your bloodstream .
In other words - Insulin prevents your fat cells from releasing fat .
So if you reduce your blood insulin levels ( through low - carb eating ) , you enable your body to burn fat .
But if you keep insulin levels high ( through high - carb eating ) , you absolutely CANNOT burn fat .
The model 1 below explains why people get fat and why fat people constantly feel hungry .
In simple terms , when you eat , your body uses the fuel it needs , and any excess is stored as fat in fat cells .
During the time between meals , your body signals the fat cells to release its stored fat .
When your fat cells do n't respond fast enough to your body 's demand for fuel , the body tells your brain to make you feel hungry .
Hunger drives you to eat , which increases the fuel immediately available , satisfying your body 's demand .
The reason an obese person constantly feels hungry is because his fat cells are responding too slowly to his body 's demand for fuel .
When an obese person 's body is n't getting enough fuel from fat cells , the body tells his brain to feel hungry .
It can not be helped .
Put another way , even though obese people have plenty of fat reserves , they feel hungry because their fat cells wo n't release fat fast enough to satisfy their body 's fuel needs .
That inevitably leads to hunger .
They can not help but feel hungry .
Their body wants fuel , and if the fat cells can't deliver , the body will get the fuel it needs by making the person hungry .
Hunger is nothing more than a signal that your body needs fuel and that fat cells are not able to supply the fuel .
What causes the fat cells to release fat too slowly ?
Insulin resistance -
When you eat carbs , your body breaks the carbs down into glucose , which enters the bloodstream .
The glucose in the blood triggers the pancreas to secrete insulin .
Insulin tells your body 's cells ( including fat cells ) to pull glucose from the bloodstream into the cell .
When glucose is transfered into a cell , it is used for energy .
A by - product of this energy creation is a glycerol molecule .
Glycerol molecules have a special affinity for free lipid ( fat ) molecules .
In fact , free floating lipids start binding to the glycerol to create triglycerides ( each glycerol molecule binds three lipid molecules ) .
Once lipids ( fats ) are bound into triglycerides , the fat cannot leave the cell .
It 's stuck in the cell .
Effectively , the fat cell has just gotten fatter -- all due to you eating carbs .
So it 's carbs , which break down into glucose , that cause you to get fat , not the fats themselves .
If you ate only fat and your body did not secrete insulin , you would not -- could not -- get fat .
You could n't get fat because in order for a fat cell to get fatter , it needs a glycerol molecule .
Glycerol molecules are not made unless glucose is pulled into the cell .
And glucose wo n't get pulled into the cell without insulin , which wo n't be secreted by the pancreas unless the blood contains glucose derived from the carbs you eat .
Evidence for this can be found in victims of type I diabetes .
A person with type I diabetes is unable to get fat because his or her pancreas does not produce insulin .
Without insulin , a diabetic person absolutely CANNOT store fat .
Then only way a type I diabetic can store fat is by injecting insulin .
When insulin is in the bloodstream of a person ( whether diabetic or not ) , the hormones that signal fat cells to release fat WILL NOT WORK .
In fact , as long as insulin is in the bloodstream , fat cells WILL NOT RELEASE FAT .
Without fuel from fat cells , the body signals your brain to make you hungry .
Since carbs drive insulin , and insulin makes you fat , if you remove the carbs from your diet , you absolutely will lose fat .
Why ?
Because without the carbs , there is no insulin .
Without the insulin , your body CANNOT store fat .
But most important , without the insulin , fat - releasing hormones can finally do there job .
Without insulin , you fat cells can release fat .
Obese people are often insulin resistant .
That is , their cells do not respond very readily to insulin .
As a result , blood glucose level remain high , signaling the pancreas to keep pumping out insulin .
This keeps blood insulin levels chronically high in a insulin resistant person .
And since blood insulin levels are high , NONE of the fat - releasing hormones that signal fat cells to release fat will work .
In other words , an insulin resistant person CANNOT release fat from their fat cells because chronically high blood insulin levels prevent fat - releasing hormones from working .
To beat a dead horse , fat cells cannot release fat while insulin is in the bloodstream .
Fat cell size -
The amount of fat released from a fat cell ( in response to appropriate hormonal signals ) seems to be directly related to the size of the fat cell .
2
The more fat in the cell , the faster the rate of fat release .
The smaller the fat cell , the slower the rate of fat release .
This relationship creates something of a control or feedback mechanism which , along with other hormones , helps regulate a person 's stable weight .
As fat cells release fat , they become smaller .
Because they are smaller , they release less fat .
At some point , the rate is slow enough that the body is n't getting the energy it needs , so it sends a signal to make you hungry .
That point of transition where the fat cells are too small to release fat at a rate to satisfy the body 's fuel demands is a person 's stable weight .
1 The model is a gross simplification but , like a crude map , it will get you where you want to go , and provide a handy model for what 's going on and why you do , or do not , get fat .
2 As you gain weight , your fat cells do n't increase in number , they increase in size .

So , Atkins was right ?
Brent — 01 May 2008 , 07:16
Atkins was not the first to recognize that low carbs equals weight loss , but he certainly was the first to make it popular .
The point is that if you have insulin in your bloodstream , your body WILL NOT burn fat .
It 's that simple .
The easiest way to reduce insulin levels is to avoid carbs and sugars .
That 's the model that seems to work for weight loss .
That said , no long term studies have been done on such a diet 's impact on long - term health , though we do has some epidemiological evidence from various populations who eat low carb .
But epi studies can get us into trouble ( remember Hormone Replacement Therapy ) , so we need to do the controlled studies .
While there are some studies that indicate that low carb is better than high carb for losing weight , we just do n't have studies about a low carb diet 's impact on overall health and longevity .
That said , I do n't see how taking out processed carbs and sugars could be a bad thing .
Beyond that , we just do n't have the controlled studies to say .

which is also why many of the " low fat " diet products do n't work - many are high in sugar and processed sugar at that .

When I read this last year I suspected it would n't be long before I 'd be seeing something like this in today 's WaPo :
Imagine a world of streets lined with video cameras that alert authorities to any suspicious activity .
A world where police officers can read the minds of potential criminals and arrest them before they commit any crimes .
A world in which a suspect who lies under questioning gets nabbed immediately because his brain has given him away .
Though that may sound a lot like the plot of the 2002 movie " Minority Report , " starring Tom Cruise and based on a Philip K .
Dick novel , I 'm not talking about science fiction here ; it turns out we 're not so far away from that world .
But does it sound like a very safe place , or a very scary one ?
It 's a question I think we should be asking as the federal government invests millions of dollars in emerging technology aimed at detecting and decoding brain activity . [...]
Will this be enough evidence for an arrest ?
Can it be used to convict a person of intent to commit a crime ? [...]
These are just some of the questions we must ask as we balance scientific advances and the promise of enhanced safety against a loss of liberty .
And we must do it now , while our voices still matter .
In a world where private thoughts are no longer private , what will our protections be ? ...( more )
That story follows one from yesterday 's WaPo that the Bush admin is set to launch a new domestic spy program , " rebuffing challenges by House Democrats over the idea 's legal authority . "

Music Audio : Bob Dylan / The Times
They are a - Changin ’
http://sq.txdnl.com/mwt/d/i/s/e/disembedded/playlists/48421/1568085.mp3
In an exclusive interview with The Times ( U.K. ) yesterday , Bob Dylan gave a ringing endorsement to Barack Obama , the first - ever African - American presidential candidate , claiming that he is “ redefining the nature of politics from the ground up . ”
Dylan ’s 1964 song
The Times
They are a -Changin became the anthem for his generation , symbolizing the era-defining social struggle against the establishment .
Now Bob Dylan , who could justifiably claim to be the architect of Barack Obama ’s “ change ” catchphrase , has backed the Illinois senator to do for modern America what the generation before did in the 1960s .
Dylan , 67 , made his comments while being interviewed in Denmark , where he had stopped over in a hotel during a tour of Scandinavia .
Asked about his views on American politics , he said : “ Well , you know right now America is in a state of upheaval .
Poverty is demoralising .
You ca n’t expect people to have the virtue of purity when they are poor .
But we ’ve got this guy now who is redefining the nature of politics from the ground up … Barack Obama .
He ’s redefining what a politician is , so we ’ll have to see how things play out .
Am I hopeful ?
Yes , I ’m hopeful that things might change .
Some things are going to have to . ”
He added : “ You should always take the best from the past , leave the worst back there and go forward into the future . ”
Dylan ’s endorsement contains a great deal of symbolic significance .
The legendary singer - songwriter , who has an art exhibition opening in London next week , became a focal point for young people worldwide when he released the album The Times They Are a - Changin ’ , including the famous song of that name , back in 1964 .
The track , which he wrote as the social liberation of the ’60s astonished politicians and parents , included lines urging people to accept and embrace what was happening around them .
Memorable lines included : “ Come senators , congressmen , please heed the call .
Do n’t stand in the doorway , do n’t block up the hall , ” and : “ Come mothers and fathers throughout the land , and do n’t criticise what you ca n’t understand .
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command .
Your old road is rapidly agin ’ . “

Last month automaker Toyota announced a recall of 160,000 of its Prius hybrid vehicles following reports of vehicle warning lights illuminating for no reason , and cars ' gasoline engines stalling unexpectedly .
But unlike the large - scale auto recalls of years past , the root of the Prius issue was n't a hardware problem – it was a programming error in the smart car 's embedded code .
The Prius had a software bug .
With that recall , the Prius joined the ranks of the buggy computer – a club that began in 1945 when engineers found a moth in Panel F , Relay # 70 of the Harvard Mark II system .
The computer was running a test of its multiplier and adder when the engineers noticed something was wrong .
The moth was trapped , removed and taped into the computer 's logbook with the words : " first actual case of a bug being found . "
Sixty years later , computer bugs are still with us , and show no sign of going extinct .
As the line between software and hardware blurs , coding errors are increasingly playing tricks on our daily lives .
Bugs do n't just inhabit our operating systems and applications – today they lurk within our cell phones and our pacemakers , our power plants and medical equipment .
And now , in our cars .
But which are the worst ?
It 's all too easy to come up with a list of bugs that have wreaked havoc .
It 's harder to rate their severity .
Which is worse – a security vulnerability that 's exploited by a computer worm to shut down the internet for a few days or a typo that triggers a day - long crash of the nation 's phone system ?
The answer depends on whether you want to make a phone call or check your e-mail .
Many people believe the worst bugs are those that cause fatalities .
To be sure , there have n't been many , but cases like the Therac - 25 are widely seen as warnings against the widespread deployment of software in safety critical applications .
Experts who study such systems , though , warn that even though the software might kill a few people , focusing on these fatalities risks inhibiting the migration of technology into areas where smarter processing is sorely needed .
In the end , they say , the lack of software might kill more people than the inevitable bugs .
What seems certain is that bugs are here to stay .
Here , in chronological order , is the Wired News list of the 10 worst software bugs of all time … so far .
July 28 , 1962 – Mariner I space probe .
A bug in the flight software for the Mariner 1 causes the rocket to divert from its intended path on launch .
Mission control destroys the rocket over the Atlantic Ocean .
The investigation into the accident discovers that a formula written on paper in pencil was improperly transcribed into computer code , causing the computer to miscalculate the rocket 's trajectory .
1982 – Soviet gas pipeline .
Operatives working for the Central Intelligence Agency allegedly ( .pdf ) plant a bug in a Canadian computer system purchased to control the trans -Siberian gas pipeline .
The Soviets had obtained the system as part of a wide - ranging effort to covertly purchase or steal sensitive U.S. technology .
The CIA reportedly found out about the program and decided to make it backfire with equipment that would pass Soviet inspection and then fail once in operation .
The resulting event is reportedly the largest non-nuclear explosion in the planet 's history .
1985 - 1987 – Therac - 25 medical accelerator .
A radiation therapy device malfunctions and delivers lethal radiation doses at several medical facilities .
Based upon a previous design , the Therac - 25 was an " improved " therapy system that could deliver two different kinds of radiation : either a low - power electron beam ( beta particles ) or X - rays .
The Therac - 25 's X - rays were generated by smashing high - power electrons into a metal target positioned between the electron gun and the patient .
A second " improvement " was the replacement of the older Therac - 20's electromechanical safety interlocks with software control , a decision made because software was perceived to be more reliable .
What engineers did n't know was that both the 20 and the 25 were built upon an operating system that had been kludged together by a programmer with no formal training .
Because of a subtle bug called a " race condition , " a quick - fingered typist could accidentally configure the Therac - 25 so the electron beam would fire in high - power mode but with the metal X - ray target out of position .
At least five patients die ; others are seriously injured .
1988 – Buffer overflow in Berkeley Unix finger daemon .
The first internet worm ( the so - called Morris Worm ) infects between 2,000 and 6,000 computers in less than a day by taking advantage of a buffer overflow .
The specific code is a function in the standard input / output library routine called gets ( ) designed to get a line of text over the network .
Unfortunately , gets ( ) has no provision to limit its input , and an overly large input allows the worm to take over any machine to which it can connect .
Programmers respond by attempting to stamp out the gets ( ) function in working code , but they refuse to remove it from the C programming language 's standard input / output library , where it remains to this day .
1988 -1996 – Kerberos Random Number Generator .
The authors of the Kerberos security system neglect to properly " seed " the program 's random number generator with a truly random seed .
As a result , for eight years it is possible to trivially break into any computer that relies on Kerberos for authentication .
It is unknown if this bug was ever actually exploited .
January 15 , 1990 – AT&T Network Outage .
A bug in a new release of the software that controls AT&T's # 4ESS long distance switches causes these mammoth computers to crash when they receive a specific message from one of their neighboring machines – a message that the neighbors send out when they recover from a crash .
One day a switch in New York crashes and reboots , causing its neighboring switches to crash , then their neighbors ' neighbors , and so on .
Soon , 114 switches are crashing and rebooting every six seconds , leaving an estimated 60 thousand people without long distance service for nine hours .
The fix : engineers load the previous software release .
1993 – Intel Pentium floating point divide .
A silicon error causes Intel 's highly promoted Pentium chip to make mistakes when dividing floating - point numbers that occur within a specific range .
For example , dividing 4195835.0/3145727.0 yields 1.33374 instead of 1.33382 , an error of 0.006 percent .
Although the bug affects few users , it becomes a public relations nightmare .
With an estimated 3 million to 5 million defective chips in circulation , at first Intel only offers to replace Pentium chips for consumers who can prove that they need high accuracy ; eventually the company relents and agrees to replace the chips for anyone who complains .
The bug ultimately costs Intel $ 475 million .
1995/1996 – The Ping of Death .
A lack of sanity checks and error handling in the IP fragmentation reassembly code makes it possible to crash a wide variety of operating systems by sending a malformed " ping " packet from anywhere on the internet .
Most obviously affected are computers running Windows , which lock up and display the so - called " blue screen of death " when they receive these packets .
But the attack also affects many Macintosh and Unix systems as well .
June 4 , 1996 – Ariane 5 Flight 501 .
Working code for the Ariane 4 rocket is reused in the Ariane 5 , but the Ariane 5's faster engines trigger a bug in an arithmetic routine inside the rocket 's flight computer .
The error is in the code that converts a 64 - bit floating - point number to a 16 - bit signed integer .
The faster engines cause the 64 - bit numbers to be larger in the Ariane 5 than in the Ariane 4 , triggering an overflow condition that results in the flight computer crashing .
First Flight 501's backup computer crashes , followed 0.05 seconds later by a crash of the primary computer .
As a result of these crashed computers , the rocket 's primary processor overpowers the rocket 's engines and causes the rocket to disintegrate 40 seconds after launch .
November 2000 – National Cancer Institute , Panama City .
In a series of accidents , therapy planning software created by Multidata Systems International , a U.S. firm , miscalculates the proper dosage of radiation for patients undergoing radiation therapy .
Multidata 's software allows a radiation therapist to draw on a computer screen the placement of metal shields called " blocks " designed to protect healthy tissue from the radiation .
But the software will only allow technicians to use four shielding blocks , and the Panamanian doctors wish to use five .
The doctors discover that they can trick the software by drawing all five blocks as a single large block with a hole in the middle .
What the doctors do n't realize is that the Multidata software gives different answers in this configuration depending on how the hole is drawn : draw it in one direction and the correct dose is calculated , draw in another direction and the software recommends twice the necessary exposure .
At least eight patients die , while another 20 receive overdoses likely to cause significant health problems .
The physicians , who were legally required to double - check the computer 's calculations by hand , are indicted for murder .

It ’s almost the end of the semester and it ’s time to finally talk about “ what is philosophy ? ” in my classes , partly because there ’s enough sense of what students have been reading , partly because I like to get all misty - eyed and reflective by the end of the class to cover over my exhaustion from all the intellectual efforts that a 15 - week semester requires …
This is the time when someone will inevitably ask me about whether so - and - so is / was “ intentionally obtuse / difficult ” – and I will of course try my best to explain that so - and - so was dealing with complex issues or was not writing for beginners or was writing for a different type of a beginner – but every time I wonder :
What is so horribly wrong with being intentionally incomprehensible ?
I suppose one might say that there is a clear expectation of comprehension when a student comes to a philosophy class – yes , they know they will be reading some difficult texts , but the honest assumption is that if they do not get it right away and if they pay attention in class , they will eventually understand what is being said .
Their difficulty – they think – comes from their lack of skill , bad teaching , educational setting etc etc .
But it cannot possibly be the case that the difficulty might come from the author ’s intentional attempts to confuse the reader , to mislead the reader , to fool the reader .
We all share the same fundamental trust , the same attitude and thus the accusation of the “ intentional confusion ” is a damning accusion : philosophers who dare to play with their readers ’ expectation of comprehensibility are charlatants , savages , criminals who can not be trusted .
Take a look at Stanley Fish ’s recent revival of the “ theory wars ” – there ’s a strange paradoxality in the accusations of incomprehensibility : it is contemptible because it is against the very nature of human co-existence but yet it is admirable because those who “ get away with it ” can apparently continue conning everyone into believing they have genuine ideas .
It ’s the fascination with the Great Criminal .
Strangely enough , it only takes an average reader of New York Times to expose the fraud , but somehow The Academics and Co. cannot see through the bullshit .
So , what is so wrong about being intentionally incomprehensible ?
“ Everything , ” we are told .
“ It ’s weird for the sake of weird , it ’s pomo stuff , it ’s pure pretention and elitism , it ’s a misuse of public trust , it ’s philosophical uselessness and careerism … ”
This morning I was trying to explain why reading difficult philosophical texts in the introductory class could be considered in itself a philosophical activity and could teach something in itself without any reference to a particular material , a specific topic .
That talk reminded me of an old church lady I knew when I was a kid , she used to tell everyone that her favorite part of the Gospels was the genealogical opening of Matthew : “ Just reciting those names , ” she used to insist , “ gives me spiritual power , because if this is the Word of God , then everything must be beneficial . ”
I thought the lady was clearly a nutcase , I still think so , but something about her attitude was fascinating – in her belief that nothing is meaningless when it comes to a religious text , she was willing to incorporate even the smallest and less significant elements in order to support her faith , but in a strange twist she made a reading of a list of names – that all have a certain meaning and a place in the general structure of the story – into a mostly magical activity that bordered on empty recitation , a kind of an opposite of meaningful reading .
It seems to me that the question about the ultimate wrong of “ intentional incomprehensibility ” can be approached from a following angle : Intentional incomprehensibility is wrong because it is not believed to be possible .
It is in the nature of human communication to want to be understood , it is the functional element of our very humanity – anyone who tries to be incomprehensible is still assuming that very “ nature ” and is thus seen as only playing with things that are considered “ sacred ” – meaning , language , communication , reflection – these are the names we continuously recite with a kind of a pagan fervor .
One cannot be intentionally incomprehensive but only intentionally disrespectful toward the ideas of comprehension and thus within the general horizon of comprehensibility – otherwise it ’s all chaos , it ’s all dark and scary …
A controversial deal with Saudi Arabia catapulted Britain to the top of the world arms export league last year , as UK firms won a record £ 10bn in orders from overseas , official figures show .
The figure amounts to a third of all worldwide export orders for military equipment , ministers and arms companies reported .
An essentially political , government - to - government contract - the sale of 72 Eurofighter / Typhoon aircraft , for £ 4.4bn , to the Saudis - accounted for Britain 's number one position , the figures make clear .
The Ministry of Defence says the terms of the contract - called Salam , Arabic for peace - and the total expenditure involved are confidential .
But officials make it clear that when upkeep , spares and training were included , the deal could amount to £ 20 bn spread over many years .
The figures last year were also boosted by orders placed by Oman and Trinidad and Tobago for patrol boats .
The companies involved - chiefly BAE Systems and the VT Group - were praised by the trade minister , Digby Jones .
" As demonstrated by this outstanding export performance , the UK has a first - class defence industry , with some of the world 's most technologically sophisticated companies , " he said .
Traditionally , American arms companies have occupied the top spot in the global arms market , with Britain , Russia and France vying to be the runners - up .
Over the past five years the top arms exporters have been the US , with $ 63 bn worth of sales , UK ( $ 53bn ) , Russia ( $ 33bn ) , France ( $ 17bn ) and Germany and Israel ( $ 9bn each ) , according to government figures .
Analysts yesterday said that the latest figures reporting Britain 's top spot in 2007 should be treated with caution , as they represent orders and not actual deliveries of equipment .
Ron Smith , professor of applied economics at Birkbeck College , University of London , said : " Orders may not be delivered or they may be cancelled . "
He warned that statistics about arms sales were unreliable because governments and companies often did not disclose accurate figures for individual contracts .
Roy Isbister , an analyst with the campaigning group Saferworld , said : " Defence sales are notoriously lumpy .
This apparent massive increase would seem largely down to the new deal to supply aircraft to Saudi Arabia .
On this basis it is highly likely that defence orders will be seen to plummet next year .
A clear indication of the UK 's status as an arms exporter can only be gained by looking at sales over several years . "
Yesterday officials told the Guardian that the value placed on the contracts was commercially sensitive .
The arms trade is notoriously contentious .
The MoD , arms fairs , and defence attaches abroad promote British weapons exports , as does Whitehall 's defence and security organisation , successor of the defence export sales organisation , Deso .
Shortly after Labour came to power in 1997 the government drew up guidelines covering arms sales .
They should not be approved , the regulations say , if the sales risk contributing to internal oppression , external aggression , or regional tensions .
According to the latest annual report on weapons - related exports , the government in 2006 approved arms exports to 19 of the 20 countries it identified as " countries of concern " for abusing human rights .
They included Saudi Arabia , Israel , Colombia , China , and Russia .
The report also reveals that during 2006 the UK authorised the export of more than 15,000 sniper rifles to countries including Pakistan , Jordan , Turkey and Saudi Arabia , components for military aircraft and tanks for China , and heavy machine guns for Colombia .
They also included the sale of components for combat aircraft , electronic warfare equipment , helicopters , military aircraft cockpit displays , unmanned vehicles and anti-armour missiles for Israel .
Symon Hill , of the Campaign Against the Arms Trade , said : " The majority of arms exported from the UK are sold to oppressive regimes or to countries engaged in conflict .
I think that most people in the UK will not be fooled by arms companies which claim to bring great benefits to the UK economy while taking hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money every year in subsidies . "
Government officials say the export guidelines are always taken into account when arms exports are approved .
A report seven years ago by MoD and independent economists , the last published authoritative study on the subject , concluded that in the late 1990s defence exports averaged around £ 6bn a year and supported about 97,500 jobs , directly or indirectly .
It said that halving arms exports would lead to the loss of about 49,000 jobs but this would be offset by the creation over a five - year period of 67,000 new jobs in non-arms employment .
The filmmaker Spike Lee , in New York Magazine , weighs in on the presidential race :
What do you think of Obama ?
I ’m riding my man Obama .
I think he ’s a visionary .

Military night - vision equipment : Goggles :
Worn by combat troops and pilots Scopes and sights : Used for aiming weapons Cameras : Used to track enemy Source : Defense Department WASHINGTON 
Thefts and illegal exports of advanced military night - vision gear are rising sharply and U.S. officials say some of the equipment has reached enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq , where it could erode the advantage U.S. troops have in after - dark combat .
The government has prosecuted more than two dozen businesses and individuals over the past 18 months for stealing night - vision gear or skirting prohibitions on foreign sales , according to a USA TODAY review of federal documents and public records .
In at least five cases , prosecutors linked shipments to terrorist groups , such as al - Qaeda and Hezbollah .
A few others were headed to Iran and Taliban forces in Afghanistan , court records show ; several were destined for China and Japan .
" It 's extremely serious — you 're talking about adversaries of the United States getting equipment that we make to give our soldiers an advantage in the field , " says Charles Beardall , the Pentagon 's deputy inspector general for investigations .
The Pentagon joined the departments of Justice , Homeland Security , Commerce and State last year in a crackdown on illegal exports of combat - use military items and sensitive civilian goods with military uses .
Night - vision goggles , scopes and cameras used by U.S. troops account for more cases than any other technology , says Steven Pelak , Justice 's export enforcement coordinator .
TECHNOLOGY : U.S. foes seek edge in the dark Pelak and Beardall say some night - vision gear has reached enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan but wo n't discuss how much .
" Certainly night - vision goggles of some generation have been found " on foes and in weapons caches , Beardall says , but details are " very sensitive . "
The implications are serious because U.S. troops often launch riskier missions after dark to exploit their night - vision advantage .
" If you look at cases where groups like the Taliban are trying to get this stuff , that 's how they want to use it , for night operations to kill our troops , " Pelak says .
Lower - grade night - vision devices are sold commercially , but military versions are far more sensitive and can include features that identify U.S. troops by infrared tabs on their uniforms .
Sales and exports of that equipment are restricted by law .
Since 2001 , the government has charged more than 40 individuals or businesses with theft or illegal exports of night - vision technology , based on a USA TODAY review of public records and reports from Justice , Commerce and the Pentagon .
Besides the two dozen cases prosecuted since late 2006 , the newspaper also identified at least eight more under investigation .
In one case , Syed Hashmi , a U.S. citizen , awaits trial on charges that he obtained night - vision goggles and other military devices for associates who moved the equipment to al - Qaeda affiliates for use against U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
In another case , Shahrazad Mir Gholikhan , an Iranian , was sentenced this month to 29 months in prison for her role in a plot to send 3,000 night - vision systems to Iran , which the United States accuses of supplying Iraqi insurgents .

Breaking up with your wireless provider just got a bit easier – but as with the termination of any bad relationship , timing is everything .
Following a spate of announcements from Verizon , Sprint and T - Mobile earlier this year , AT&T officially began pro-rating its early termination fees on Sunday .
According to the company , instead of paying one single flat fee of $ 175 to jump ship , you 'll now be able to shave off $ 5 from that amount for every month completed of your one - or two - year contract .
" We have not yet provided specifics on our new approach , " an AT&T spokesperson said on Tuesday , " but we remain committed to the idea that wireless customers who leave their contract early should not pay a flat early - termination fee . "
Unfortunately , this new policy does not extend to those who signed up for a contract prior to May 25 , 2008 .
So why the sudden change of heart ?
According to most wireless analysts , this newfound flexibility on the part of AT&T and the rest of the industry is largely the result of a number of pending class action lawsuits , in several states , by customers who claim they were either misled or charged excessive penalty fees .
" If you take a look at what AT&T did , they basically matched Verizon 's current policy , " says Current Analysis analyst William Ho .
" You can argue that this is carriers being proactive against pending legislative penalties and the coming open access environment , but to me , this is really about staying competitive .
With everyone else agreeing to pro-rate their termination fees , AT&T did n't want to be seen as the bad guy . "
Verizon , which currently faces a $ 1 billion suit related to its early termination fee policy , is actually in the midst of proposing two separate remedies to the FCC , Congress and various other consumer groups .
The first is similar to what all major U.S. carriers are already planning on doing : pro-rating their ETFs over the course of a given contract .
The alternate option would have carriers agreeing not to charge any termination fee during the first month of a contract ; after that , all bets would be off .
Theoretically , these half - measures would give carriers some degree of wiggle room when it comes to any pending and future ETF - related lawsuits .
For years , U.S. carriers did n't seem to mind the " bad guy " label and justified early cancellation fees based on the fact that the majority of customers still purchased subsidized handsets .
Many customers rightly assume the cheap phone they get in the deal is a part of entering into a one - or two - year contract with a given carrier , but subsequently forget that breaking that contract can mean parting with a significant chunk of change .
" In essence , it 's the carrot - and - stick approach , " says Ho , " where the carrot is the subsidy and the stick is the early termination fee . "
Things are starting to change , albeit very slowly .
Currently , the ongoing ETF legal battles are being waged at the state level , but the FCC announced last week it will be holding its own hearing in mid-June to decide whether the government should in fact take over jurisdiction of the fees – the theory being that one national policy applicable to all wireless carriers would eliminate much of the confusion and lawsuits .
In the foreseeable future , you can bet on one thing :
If there 's a contract or a subsidy involved when you sign up with a new carrier , expect to get whacked with some manner of ETF should you decide to walk away early .
The only difference is it might not hurt as much as it used to .

Wartime presidential powers supersede liberties
By Frank J. Murray
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
The government arsenal to counterattack U.S. - based terrorists behind last week 's " act of war " already includes wartime powers and other Draconian tactics that unsettle civil libertarians .
If you are a Camino user , and you 've encountered WMV video or audio online in the past couple of years , you 've probably seen pages inexplicably scramble themselves as you scroll , type , or select text ( although you probably did n't realize that it was because of WMV content in another window or tab ) .
This is due to an old bug in Telestream 's Flip4 Mac plugin which , since it 's a third - party plugin , we rely on them to fix .
Six months ago , I had the opportunity to talk to a Telestream engineer about this issue .
To make sure I could describe the problem as accurately as possible I spent about an hour testing pages with WMV content and looking at what exactly happened to other tabs and windows ( that was the first time I 'd personally looked into it , since I knew that others involved with Camino had talked to Telestream and been told that it was being investigated at their end ) .
After that hour , without looking at any code or having any special knowledge beyond a basic understanding of how plugin drawing works on the Mac , it was clear how they were corrupting the graphics context : the plugin was changing the location of ( 0 , 0 ) out from under us .
I had assumed that they already knew this , and that the problem was figuring out how to fix it , but as it turned out , the step from knowing that to finding and fixing the bug in the Flip4 Mac plugin was tiny .
So I found myself wondering : if it took me an hour to do essentially all of the work necessary to get this bug fixed , just by looking at the behavior , how much time could Telestream — with access not only to their code , but to the specific changes that they made in the version that first introduced this bug — have put into investigating in the year and a half since we had been assured that they would look into it ?
If it were just that , I would write it off to a communication failure and think nothing more of it .
Perhaps it was never made clear to them just how severe the problems this bug caused were , and certainly we should have followed up with them regularly to ensure that the bug did n't fall though the cracks by accident .
The important thing was that now they had a fix in hand , and they understood the severity of the issue , so surely a fixed version would be available soon .
But here we are , six months and two releases of Flip4 Mac later , without a fix .
I was disappointed that the 2.2.0.49 release at the end of December did n't have the fix , but not too surprised ; there 's a whole release cycle to go through to get fixes out to users , and a month - long cycle is n't at all unreasonable — although it certainly suggested that they did n't take this issue as seriously as we do ( if somehow Camino were making the entire system unusable for 2 % of our users every time they launched it , and we had a fix , we 'd risk slipping a release slightly to get it in , without hesitation ) .
We followed up , just to reiterate that we viewed the fix as critical , and why : that it was not only damaging the WMV experience for hundreds of thousands of their users , but that it also crippled the entire browser for those affected , creating widespread problems for users , and offloading the large support burden of their bug onto us .
We made it clear that this was by far our most frequently reported bug .
We 've made these points to them a number of times over the past six months .
Earlier this week , there was a new Flip4Mac release ( variously labeled in the download as 2.2.0.49A , 2.2.0.49 R , and , confusingly enough , just 2.2.0.49 again ) , the second since they have had a fix .
It did n't include any release notes ( the release notes they link to are the original 2.2.0.49 notes ) , so we do n't know what they did fix , but it definitely did n't include the Camino issue .
A release process where an important fix takes more than six months to get into a release is n't plausible , so the only possible conclusion I can reach is that Telestream 's management has made the explicit decision that fixing a problem that affects every single Camino user using their product is n't even moderately important : not important enough to slip into a release that was winding down , not important enough to get its own tiny bug - fix release in a span of five months , and not even important enough to put into a release that could not realistically have been assembled until well after they had this fix .
So users continue to suffer , and we continue to shoulder the support burden and the negative publicity of their bug , because they apparently do n't think that Camino matters .
Since Telestream is choosing not to fix the bug , I 'm releasing a stop - gap fix : this tool will modify the released version of the Flip4 Mac plugin to remove the problematic code , so that it will no longer corrupt drawing throughout Camino .
I can't easily make any complex changes , so unlike a real fix to this bug it wo n't be selectively applied to Camino ; as a result , WMV content may behave differently in Firefox once you run it ( Safari uses a different plugin , so should not be affected in any way ) .
Hopefully , Telestream will reconsider the importance of this bug , and the workaround wo n't be necessary for long .

Despite Hillary Clinton ’s claims , that she is a fighter poised to fight Opec and the oil industry in your name , she is in a grand coalition with McCain to provide the oil companies with an unexpected , quite unneeded and , if I may say so , undeserved windfall in summer .
The concept of a “ gas tax holiday ” has a relaxing sound to it .
Who would n’t wa n’t to get on a holiday from the rise in gas prices .
Especially poor families are hit hard and would welcome a much needed break .
Since Senator Clinton learned in Ohio and Pennsylvania , that it is the blue collar crowd , who will provide her with the votes needed to keep her ambition alive , she is in full populism mode .
But , the gas tax holiday will only help oil companies racking up their profits yet again in summer .
Summer is the main travel season , too .
To get on your much needed real holidays , you are making the fattest corporate cats even fatter .
This plan is so obviously bull , that even Bloomberg is praising Barack Obama for his level - headed analysis .
Here is what Barack Obama said :
Whether the American public is prepared to sell their votes for an average of $ 28 remains to be seen .

Thanks to the end - of - term for many colleges and some K12 schools , brute - force attacks against SSH servers surged sharply this past weekend , according to the SANS Internet Storm Center .
The sudden jump in SSH attacks merits a re-examination of how such servers should be properly secured .
Jim Owens and Jeanna Matthews of the Department of Computer Science at Clarkson University have published a paper on the methods that such attacks frequently employ and on the best ways to defeat them .
Linux systems may be secure against the viruses and trojans that can infect Windows , but running Linux , in and of itself , provides no protection against the type of brute force assaults Owen and Matthews discuss .
The two performed their experiment by setting up three honeypots in three separate locations , with one system located on a college campus , one in a small business , and one at a residence on a traditional DSL connection .
Data from the three systems suggests that brute - force attackers often attempt to validate using " root . "
Attacks with this username accounted for 25.7 percent of the total login attempts observed .
The password chosen often matched the login ( i.e. , root / root or guest / guest ) , or was a simple derivative of the login ( Michael / Mike or William / Bill ) .
When put side by side , the list of attempted passwords for each of the three honeypots shows a surprising amount of correlation .
Twelve of the top twenty password attempts were shared between all three servers , while a further five were shared between two servers .
The high prevalence of shared passwords led the two computer scientists to conclude that the attacks were launched using a common set of at least five attack dictionaries .
As shown in the table above , some of these dictionaries include strong passwords , and the authors recommend actively considering the listings of popular attack dictionaries when selecting passwords .
SSH brute force attacks themselves have evolved considerably .
The very words " brute force " may conjure an image of a mightily thewed barbarian hacking away with an axe , but modern assaults more closely resemble the careful actions of a thief attempting to avoid detection while picking a lock .
Evidence suggests that some would - be hackers are now attacking via botnets , and they launch just a handful of login attacks per IP address in order to avoid triggering intrusion - detection software .
This new attack variant is referred to as a slow - motion brute - force attack , and researchers expect to see more of them as hackers refine the process .
If you 've got an SSH server that you want to secure from brute - force attack , Owens and Matthews recommend taking several steps .
First , all passwords should be strong , usernames should be non-obvious , and SSH logins for the root account should be disabled .
The two also recommend running the SSH server on a non-standard high port , though they recognize that this is a " security through obscurity " tactic , and they advocate the use of software capable of parsing log files and noting multiple failed login attempts .
These steps , taken in aggregate , should be sufficient to protect an SSH server , even if the number of attacks continues to rise .

The former US Democratic presidential contender , John Edwards , has endorsed Barack Obama 's bid for the White House .
Speaking alongside the senator at a rally in Michigan , Mr Edwards said Mr Obama was the one man who could make the lasting change that America needed .
John Edwards dropped out of the presidential race in January .
Correspondents say his endorsement will damage Mr Obama 's rival , Sen Hillary Clinton , despite her victory in the West Virginia primary on Tuesday .
' Bold leadership '
" The Democratic voters in America have made their choice and so have I , " John Edwards told a crowd of cheering supporters in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
" There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership ... there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America , not two - and that man is Barack Obama . "
Edwards plays kingmaker card Mr Edwards spoke about the need to help the poor and provide better health care , and announced that Mr Obama had backed his new anti-poverty initiative , which aims to reduce poverty in the United States by half within 10 years .
Earlier in the speech he paid tribute to Hillary Clinton 's tenacity , strength and determination , and said she cared deeply about the working people of America .
Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is significant , on a day when Hillary Clinton has been celebrating a big win in West Virginia which was largely down to her support among poorer white voters - a constituency with which John Edwards is most closely identified .
' Far from over ' Both Senators Obama and Clinton had been heavily courting Mr Edwards ' endorsement , as soon as he had stood down from the race in January .
But as news of the announcement broke , Mrs Clinton 's campaign team dismissed its significance .
Hillary Clinton had a big win in West Virginia on Tuesday " We respect John Edwards , but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night , this thing is far from over , " Clinton campaign chairman , Terry McAuliffe , said in a statement .
So far in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination , Mr Obama has won more of the delegates who will choose the party 's nominee at the Democratic National Convention this summer .
He has also raised more money than Mrs Clinton .
The Clinton campaign has been hoping that she could pick up more endorsements than Mr Obama from the so - called " super - delegates " , who get an automatic vote at the convention by virtue of holding a senior position in the party .
The BBC's Justin Webb says that with the high - profile endorsement of Mr Edwards , Mrs Clinton 's already difficult case has just become even trickier to make .
According to a tally by the Associated Press , Barack Obama has a total of 1,887 delegates , leaving him just 139 delegates short of the 2,026 needed to clinch the nomination , while Hillary Clinton has 1,718 delegates .

NASHVILLE  President Bush delivered a rousing defense of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on Tuesday , mixing faith and foreign policy as he told a group of Christian broadcasters that his policies in the region were predicated on the beliefs that freedom was a God - given right and “ every human being bears the image of our maker . ”
In a 42 - minute speech to the National Religious Broadcasters convention , Mr. Bush called upon European allies to step up their efforts in Afghanistan , and conceded that recent security gains in Iraq “ are tenuous , they ’re reversible and they ’re fragile . ”
Still , he insisted his troop buildup there is succeeding .
“ The decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision early in my presidency , ” Mr. Bush said , to a standing ovation .
“ It is the right decision at this point in my presidency , and it will forever be the right decision . ”
The speech , coming a week before the fifth anniversary of the American invasion of Iraq , is the first of three talks on terrorism and war policy that Mr. Bush will give before next month ’s Congressional testimony by the top American military commander in Iraq , Gen. David H. Petraeus , and the senior diplomat there , Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker .
Recently we redesigned the Dilbert.com web site and added a ton of features , such as animation , deeper archives , mash ups , and more .
The reaction from readers has been fascinating .
www.dilbert.com
Let me get this out of the way : I realize the Beta version of the web site has lots of issues .
It ’s overloaded with Flash , slower than it needs to be , and the navigation is confusing .
We ’re fixing most of that over the next few weeks .
I apologize for the inconvenience .
The fascinating thing about the responses is that it revealed three distinct types of Dilbert readers :
The first group is the ultra-techies who have an almost romantic relationship with technology .
For them , the new site felt like getting dumped by a lover .
Their high - end technology ( generally Linux ) and security settings made much of the site inconvenient .
Moreover , the use of Flash offended them on some deep emotional level .
The second group objected to the new level of color and complexity , and the associated slowness .
They like their Dilbert comics simple , fast , and in two colors .
Anything more is like putting pants on a cat .
The third group uses technology as nothing more than a tool , and subscribes to the philosophy that more free stuff is better than less free stuff .
That group has embraced the new features on the site and spiked the traffic stats .
For you first two groups , if you promise to keep it to yourselves , we created a stripped - down Dilbert page with just the comic , some text navigation , and the archive : www.dilbert.com/fast.
This alternate site is a minor secret , mentioned only here and in the text footnote to the regular site as “ Linux / Unix . ”
The main site will be getting a Flash diet that will make it speedier soon , so check back in a few weeks .
That ’s where all the fun will be .
Enjoy .

Did you know there are roughly 51,498 computer repair companies in the United States ?
If your computer has recently broken down , you will probably need to use a computer repair store .
Yet , with so many shops to choose from , selecting the right one is n’t exactly an easy task .
Below , we ’re going to explore how you can select the right computer repair shop for your needs .
If your computer is currently on its last legs , you ’ll soon discover how you can find a shop that ’ll bring it back from the brink .
Let ’s begin !
1. What Service Do You Need ?
The first step of this process is figuring out what is wrong with your computer .
For instance , is there something wrong with the screen , or do you need to fix the keyboard ?
It ’s crucial you work this out ahead of time , as some companies will provide a specialist service .
Ideally , you want to work with these companies , rather than a generic repair company that does everything and anything .
In doing so , you can ensure your computer gets the best treatment at the best price .
There ’s also a reduced chance of them making a mistake that might lead to the computer ending up in a worse condition .
At this stage , it ’s also worth noting down the brand of your computer .
Some companies specialize in repairing certain kinds of brands .
You should try to work with a company that understands your specific computer brand because , again , this will lower the odds of a mistake .
2. Should You Use a Local Company ?
When you decide to work with a computer repair store , you ’ll find that you can work with a local or online company .
One of the benefits of working with a local company is that repairs will often take a lot less time .
You wo n’t have to deal with shipping and wait around while your device is in transit .
Additionally , a local repair shop might provide a faster turnaround , as they wo n’t have as many customers compared to an online store .
Now , the downside of working with a local store is that there might be some limits to their expertise .
For instance , if something is wrong with your ‘ Macbook motherboard , ’ the odds of you finding a local expert associated with this niche can be low .
That said , most computer repair stores will know how to fix a given problem , even if it ’s relatively new to them .
Following this , you should always speak to a local repair store before you move on .
If you do this , you will learn what they ’re capable of and whether they can actually help you .
This will then prevent a scenario where you needlessly ignore a store , even though they could help you solve your tech problem .
3. Should You Use an Online Service ?
In the section above , we mentioned some of the positives and negatives associated with using an offline service .
Now let ’s look at some of the upsides and downsides in regards to using an online repair service .
One of the best things about using an online service is that you ’ll have access to niche experts .
After all , there ’s a lot of competition online , and so repair shops need a way to differentiate themselves .
They do this by offering a specialist service , and this often means they ’ll only repair a certain kind of device .
In some cases , it could also mean that they only deal with a specific type of problem .
You ’ll also find that online services tend to have a lot of customer reviews .
This is helpful , as you can use these reviews to determine if a given service is right for you , or if you need to work with someone else .
As alluded to earlier , one of the downsides of using an online service is that you ’ll have to deal with shipping .
This means that you ’ll need to sort out the packaging and you ’ll also have to wait around for a courier .
It ’s worth noting , though , that some online companies will help you with the ‘ shipping problem . ’
That ’s because some shops will send you a box that comes with pre-paid shipping labels .
You just need to put your device in the box and notify the relevant courier that the box is ready for collection .
This can help you deal with the costs of shipping , as well as the general hassle associated with this process .
4. Can You Do the Repairs Yourself ?
You also have the option of doing the repairs yourself , and this is a route that many people go down .
Now , repairing a computer on your own might sound intimidating , but the task is n’t as tricky as it sounds .
For one , there are lots of videos on YouTube that teach you how to fix a wide range of computer issues .
These videos will walk you through each step of the repair process , and you can pause or rewind them should you ever get confused .
Additionally , sourcing the parts for a particular repair is not a difficult task .
That ’s because a lot of the time , the people who make the ‘ repair videos ’ will tell you where you can buy the parts .
In some cases , the video description will even have links to the products you need for the repairs .
Do You Know How to Find a Good Computer Repair Shop ?
If your computer is n’t working the way it should , a computer repair shop can restore your computer back to its previous state .
When looking for a computer repair store , it ’s critical that you do n’t just pick the first one you come across .
If you do that , you might select the wrong store , and thus your computer might end up worse for wear .
You ’ll probably need to read about lots of stores before you find the right one for your specific situation .
However , once you find the right repair store , you ’ll be able to rely on them for years to come .

Totalization
Since the late 1970 ’s , the U.S. has established international social security agreements that coordinate the U.S. Social Security program with the comparable programs of other countries .
These international social security agreements are called “ totalization agreements ” and have two main purposes : Eliminate dual social security taxation that occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay social security taxes to both countries on the same earnings .
As a result of existing totalization agreements , U.S. workers and employers currently are saving about $ 800 million annually in foreign taxes they do not have to pay .
Help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the U.S. and another country , but who have not worked long enough in one or both countries to qualify for social security benefits .
With totalization , workers are allowed to combine work credits from both countries to become eligible for benefits .
The benefit amount paid is proportional to the amount of credits earned in the paying country .
An agreement with Mexico An agreement with Mexico would save U.S. workers and their employers about $ 140 million in Mexican social security and health insurance taxes over the first 5 years of the agreement .
An agreement would also fill the gaps in benefit protection for U.S. workers who have worked in both countries , but not long enough in one or both countries to qualify for benefits .
Mexico is the second largest trading partner with the U.S. Agreements are already in effect with Canada , the largest trading partner with the U.S. , and 19 other countries .
With Mexico , the U.S. now has signed agreements with eight of its top ten trading partners .
Many of these agreements have been in effect for nearly two decades .
The two exceptions are China and Taiwan .
By law , the U.S. could not enter into agreements with these two countries because they do not have generally applicable social security systems that pay periodic benefits or the actuarial equivalent .
Costs of an agreement with Mexico Social Security actuaries estimate that a totalization agreement with Mexico would have a negligible long - range effect on the Trust Funds .
Costs to the U.S. Social Security system are estimated to average about $ 105 million per year over the first five years .
These costs are for additional benefits to eligible U.S. and Mexican workers and reduced Social Security tax contributions under the dual taxation exemption .
To put this in perspective , in 2002 , costs to the U.S. system for the existing agreement with Canada were about $ 197 million .
Effective date of an agreement with Mexico
In the United States , once the agreement is signed , the President will submit the agreement to Congress where it must sit in review for 60 session days .
If Congress takes no action during this time , the agreement can move forward .
In Mexico , once the agreement is signed , the Mexican Senate must approve it .
Countries already having totalization agreements with the U.S. The United States currently has Social Security agreements with Canada , Chile , South Korea , Australia and most of Western Europe .

It does n't take too much advanced mathematics to note that by several historical methods for determining whether the economy is contracting or expanding , we are now in a recession .
Consider a true inflation measure of GDP , per capita measure , or the NBER methodology .
All three show economic contraction .
Let 's start with our " Reality - based " analysis :
The only conclusion an honest read of inflation produces is that both Q4 2007 and Q1 2008 were positive in nominal terms , but negative in Real terms .
Remember , the goal of GDP should be to figure out how much the economy is expanding or contracting -- not how much prices rose .
By any honest measure of inflation -- and not the 3.5 % BEA price index for gross domestic purchases -- both of the past two quarters would have been negative .
How can we have an understated inflation rate of 4 % , and a GDP Price Deflator of just 2.6 % ?
2 ) The NBER methodology :
The 2 consecutive quarters of GDP contraction is not the only metric for identifying recessions .
According to the econo - geeks at the National Bureau of Economic Research , a recession is defined as a " significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months . "
Here 's their specific language :
" Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more quarters of declining real GDP , but not all of them .
Our procedure differs from the two - quarter rule in a number of ways .
First , we consider the depth as well as the duration of the decline in economic activity .
Recall that our definition includes the phrase , " a significant decline in economic activity . "
Second , we use a broader array of indicators than just real GDP .
One reason for this is that the GDP data are subject to considerable revision .
Third , we use monthly indicators to arrive at a monthly chronology . "
Hence , if we follow what the people who actually determine what is and is n't a recession say abnout the matter , and not just limit our analysis to GDP , then its pretty clear we are now experiencing an economic contraction .
Rex Nutting reminds us that 1 ) After - tax inflation adjusted incomes have been stagnant since September ; inflation - adjusted sales have fallen at a 5.2 % annual pace in the past three months , and are essentially unchanged from six months ago ; industrial output has stalled ;
UPDATE : Rex adds that spending on services rose 3.4 % , including a 14 % rise in real spending ( seasonally adjusted ) on household heating .
It ’s quite likely that this figure does n’t accurately adjust for the rising cost of natural gas and heating oil this year .
About one - third of the total increase in GDP ( $ 17.4 billion ) was an increase in the spending on heating costs ( $ 5.5 billion ) .
Hence , even more Inflation - driven GDP .
By any reasonable measure of the NBER delineated metrics , we are already in a recession .
3 ) Per Capita Measure , favored by Merrill Lynch North American Chief Economist David Rosenberg , is to simply look to see if the economy is expanding faster than the population .
With the US population expanding by 1.0 - 1.5 % per year , it takes economic growth of at least that merely to stay in place .
Hence , Rosenberg 's claim that GDP growth on a per capita basis is actually are contracting sine Q4 2007 .

Come on Barry ... this ain't no recession !
Since we now know that no recession is in the cards , and this " economic slowdown " was V shaped , and we 're already growing again in April , The Fed can now stop ignoring one of its primary functions of Price Stability .
Heck ,
The Fed can take back all those rate cuts , and raise rates 350 bps this morning .
Right ?
The Fed better stop worrying about Wall Street , and start focusing on Main Street ... otherwise the villagers will start gathering with pitchforks and torches soon .
And yes , I 'm the Bozo now paying a C - Note to fill up my X5 in SoCal !
BTW , Am I the only one that is still shocked that the Fed signed on to the $ 10 Bear Stearns deal ?
WTF !
Wall Street pushed and they got what they wanted .
And now the deal is back stopped by the tax payer .

Jeff Atwood just wrote a nice piece on why type inference is convenient , using a C# sample :
I was absolutely thrilled to be able to refactor this code : StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder ( 256 ) ; UTF8 Encoding e = new UTF8 Encoding ( ) ; MD5CryptoServiceProvider md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider ( ) ;
Into this : var sb = new StringBuilder ( 256 ) ; var e = new UTF8Encoding ( ) ; var md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider ( ) ;
It ’s not dynamic typing , per se ; C# is still very much a statically typed language .
It ’s more of a compiler trick , a baby step toward a world of Static Typing Where Possible , and Dynamic Typing When Needed .
It ’s worth making a stronger demarcation among :
type inference , which you can do in any language
static vs. dynamic typing , which is completely orthogonal but all too often confused with inference
strong vs. weak typing , which is mostly orthogonal ( e.g. , C is statically typed because every variable has a statically known actual type , but also weakly typed because of its casts )
Above , Jeff explicitly separates inference and dynamic - ness .
Unfortunately , later on he proceeds to imply that inference is a small step toward dynamic typing , which is stylistically true in principle but might mislead some readers into thinking inference has something to do with dynamic - ness , which it does n’t .
Type Inference
Many languages , including C# ( as shown above ) and the next C++ standard ( C++0x , shown below ) , provide type inference .
C++0 x does it via the repurposed auto keyword .
For example , say you have an object m of type map < int , list < string > > , and you want to create an iterator to it :
map < int , list < string >>::iterator i = m.begin( ) ; // type is required in today ’s C++ , allowed in C++0 x auto i = m.begin ( ) ; // type can be inferred in C++0x
How many times have you said to your compiler , “ Compiler , you know the type already , why are you making me repeat it ? ! ”
Even the IDE can tell you what the type is when you hover over an expression .
Well , in C++0 x you wo n’t have to any more , which is often niftily convenient .
This gets increasingly important as we do n’t want to , or can ’t , write out the type ourselves , because we have :
types with more complicated names
types without names ( or hard - to - find names )
types held most conveniently via an indirection
In particular , consider that C++0 x lambda functions generate a function object whose type you generally can’t spell , so if you want to hold that function object and do n’t have auto then you generally have to use an indirection :
function < void( void ) > f = [ ] { DoSomething ( ) ; } ;
auto f = [ ] { DoSomething ( ) ; } ; // hold via a wrapper — requires indirection
// infer the type and bind directly
Note that the last line above is more efficient than the C equivalent using a pointer to function , because C++ lets you inline everything .
For more on this , see Item 46 in Scott Meyers ’ Effective STL on why it ’s preferable to use function objects rather than functions , because ( counterintuitively ) they ’re more efficient .
Now , though there ’s no question auto and var are great , there are some minor limitations .
In particular , you may not want the exact type , but another type that can be converted to :
map<int , list < string >>::const_iterator ci = m.begin( ) ; // ci’s type is map< int , list < string >>::const_iterator auto i = m.begin( ) ; // i’s type is map < int , list < string >>:: iterator
Widget * w = new Widget ( ) ;
const Widget* cw = new Widget ( ) ;
WidgetBase * wb = new Widget ( ) ;
shared_ptr< Widget > spw ( new Widget ( ) ) ; // w’s type is Widget *
// cw ’s type is const Widget *
// wb ’s type is WidgetBase *
// spw ’s type is shared_ptr < Widget > auto w = new Widget ( ) ; // w’s type is Widget *
So C++0 x auto ( like C# var ) only gets you the most obvious type .
Still and all , that does cover a lot of the cases .
The important thing to note in all of the above examples is that , regardless how you spell it , every variable has a clear , unambiguous , well - known and predictable static type .
C++0 x auto and C# var are purely notational conveniences that save us from having to spell it out in many cases , but the variable still has one fixed and static type .
Static and Dynamic Typing
As Jeff correctly noted in the above - quoted part , this is n’t dynamic typing , which permits the same variable to actually have different types at different points in its lifetime .
Unfortunately , he goes on to say the following that could be mistaken by some readers to imply otherwise :
You might even say implicit variable typing is a gateway drug to more dynamically typed languages .
I know Jeff knows what he ’s talking about because he said it correctly earlier in the same post , but let ’s be clear : Inference does n’t have anything to do with dynamic typing .
Jeff is just noting that inference just happens to let you declare variables in a style that can be similar to the way you do it all the time in a dynamically typed language .
( Before I could post this , I see that Lambda the Ultimate also commented on this confusion .
At least one commenter noted that this could be equally viewed as a gateway drug to statically typed languages , because you can get the notational convenience without abandoning static typing . )
Quoting from Bjarne ’s glossary :
Let ’s revisit an earlier C++ example again , which shows the difference between a variable ’s static type and dynamic type :
WidgetBase * wb = new Widget ( ) ;
if ( dynamic_cast < Widget *>( wb ) ) { … } // wb ’s static type is WidgetBase *
// cast succeeds : wb ’s dynamic type is Widget *
The static type of the variable says what interface it supports , so in this case wb allows you to access only the members of WidgetBase .
The dynamic type of the variable is what the object being pointed to right now is .
In dynamically typed languages , however , variables do n’t have a static type and you generally do n’t have to mention the type .
In many dynamic languages , you do n’t even have to declare variables .
For example :
// Python
x = 10 ;
x = “ hello , world ” ; // x’s type is int
// x’s type is str
Boost ’s variant and any
There are two popular ways to get this effect in C++ , even though the language remains statically typed .
The first is Boost variant :
// C++ using Boost
variant < int , string > x ;
x = 42 ;
x = “ hello , world ” ;
x = new Widget ( ) ; // say what types are allowed
// now x holds an int
// now x holds a string
// error , not int or string
Unlike a union , a variant can include essentially any kind of type , but you have to say what the legal types are up front .
You can even simulate getting overload resolution via boost :: apply_visitor , which is checked statically ( at compile time ) .
The second is Boost any :
// C++ using Boost
any x ;
x = 42 ;
x = “ hello , world ” ;
x = new Widget ( ) ; // now x holds an int
// now x holds a string
// now x holds a Widget *
Again unlike a union , an any can include essentially any kind of type .
Unlike variant , however , any does n’t make ( or let ) you say what the legal types are up front , which can be good or bad depending how relaxed you want your typing to be .
Also , any does n’t have a way to simulate overload resolution , and it always requires heap storage for the contained object .
Interestingly , this shows how C++ is well and firmly ( and let ’s not forget efficiently ) on the path of Static Typing Where Possible , and Dynamic Typing When Needed .
Use variant when :
You want an object that holds a value of one of a specific set of types .
You want compile - time checked visitation .
You want the efficiency of stack - based storage where possible scheme ( avoiding the overhead of dynamic allocation ) .
You can live with horrible error messages when you do n’t type it exactly right .
Use any when :

Drivers who use E - ZPass toll transponders are having their movements recorded even when driving on free public roads .
New Jersey Star - Ledger columnist Paul Mulshine confirmed that the state ’s department of transportation uses E - ZPass scanners to know when , for example , a motorist drives to the mall on Route 24 in the Short Hills area .
“ This is n’t some kind of surveillance , ” New Jersey DOT spokesman Erin Phalon told the Star - Ledger .
Instead , the official purpose of the program is counting traffic volume .
The www.njcommuter.com website keeps track of traffic volume and accidents on important routes statewide .
It is not clear whether the state has access to the identity of the motorists involved , because the New Jersey E - ZPass terms and conditions fail to disclose even the public tracking program .
“ Nor are we liable for any third party act taken by reason of your use or display of the E - ZPass tag , ” the terms and conditions state .
Toll transponder companies frequently hand over sensitive personal information regarding the movements of individual motorists in cases involving divorce and similar proceedings .

It 's time for another installment of Carsumer Advocacy .
We wo n't go into the nitty gritty details of this one , as it's spread across a 61 - page forum post on VW Vortex .
The basic gist is that a guy moved into a house in a nice neighborhood .
Said neighborhood then started a Home Owners Association with an annual fee of over $ 1,500 .
The new HOA then hired an outside contractor to police parking inside the neighborhood .
Parking passes were then required that had to be displayed within the vehicle at all times , even when parking in your own driveway (! ) .
If the loose passes ( they were n't stickers ) were n't displayed , a homeowner would get a $ 140 ticket and a couple of boots slapped on his or her wheels until the ticket was paid .
One day , forum member The A1 and A2 German forgot to hang his parking pass on the rearview mirror of his mildly tuned Audi A4 .
The boots came , but rather than acquiesce , he got some rolling jacks and wheeled his car , boots and all , back into his garage .
It 's the principal of the thing , as this guy apparently always used his parking pass and , despite the rent - a - cops knowing his vehicle , they ticketed him and gave his car the boot anyway .
Then the standoff began .
This guy was smart and called the police to make sure he was n't doing anything illegal like stealing the contractor 's boots , and when the HOA contractor 's eventually found out where their they were hiding , he was happy to let them come and retrieve their property .
The contractor now his boots back , but the man 's parking pass has been revoked and apparently his neighbors are now being terrorized by these boot police who are hell bent on revenge .

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...

When the Great War comes , said old Bismarck , it will come out of “ some damn fool thing in the Balkans . ”
On June 28 , 1914 , Gavrilo Princip shot the archduke and heir to the Austrian throne , Franz Ferdinand , in Sarajevo , setting in motion the train of events that led to the first world war .
In the spring 1999 , the United States bombed Serbia for 78 days to force its army out of that nation ’s cradle province of Kosovo .
The Serbs were fighting Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army , or KLA .
And we had no more right to bomb Belgrade than the Royal Navy would have had to bombard New York in our Civil War .
We bombed Serbia , we were told , to stop the genocide in Kosovo .
But there was no genocide .
This was propaganda .
The United Nations ’ final casualty count of Serbs and Albanians in Slobodan Milosevic ’s war did not add up to 1 percent of the dead in Mr. Lincoln ’s war .
Albanians did flee in the tens of thousands during the war .
But since that war ’s end , the Serbs of Kosovo have seen their churches and monasteries smashed and vandalized and have been ethnically cleansed in the scores of thousands from their ancestral province .
In the exodus , they have lost everything .
The remaining Serb population of 120,000 is largely confined to enclaves guarded by NATO troops .
“ At a Serb monastery in Pec , ” writes the Washington Post , “ Italian troops protect the holy site , which is surrounded by a massive new wall to shield elderly nuns from stone - throwing and other abuse by passing ethnic Albanians . ”
On Sunday , Kosovo declared independence and was recognized by the European Union and President Bush .
But this is not the end of the story .
It is only the preface to a new history of the Balkans , a region that has known too much history .
By intervening in a civil war to aid the secession of an ancient province , to create a new nation that has never before existed and , to erect it along ethnic , religious and tribal lines , we have established a dangerous precedent .
Muslim and Albanian extremists are already talking of a Greater Albania , consisting of Albania , Kosovo and the Albanian - Muslim sectors of Serbia , Montenegro and Macedonia .
If these Albanian minorities should demand the right to secede and join their kinsmen in Kosovo , on what grounds would we oppose them ?
The inviolability of borders ?
What if the Serb majority in the Mitrovica region of northern Kosovo , who reject Albanian rule , secede and call on their kinsmen in Serbia to protect them ?
Would we go to war against Serbia , once again , to maintain the territorial integrity of Kosovo , after we played the lead role in destroying the territorial integrity of Serbia ?
Inside the U.S. - sponsored Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the autonomous Serb Republic of Srpska is already talking secession and unification with Serbia .
On what grounds would we deny them ?
The U.S. war on Serbia was unconstitutional , unjust and unwise .
Congress never authorized it .
Serbia , an ally in two world wars , had never attacked us .
We made an enemy of the Serbs , and alienated Russia , to create a second Muslim state in the Balkans .
By intervening in a civil war where no vital interest was at risk , the United States , which is being denounced as loudly in Belgrade today as we are being cheered in Pristina , has acquired another dependency .
And our new allies , the KLA , have been credibly charged with human trafficking , drug dealing , atrocities and terrorism .
And the clamor for ethnic self - rule has only begun to be heard .
Rumania has refused to recognize the new Republic of Kosovo , for the best of reasons .
Bucharest rules a large Hungarian minority in Transylvania , acquired at the same Paris Peace Conference of 1919 where Croatia , Slovenia and Bosnia - Herzegovina were detached from Vienna and united with Serbia .
Abkhazia and South Ossetia , two provinces that have broken away from Georgia , are invoking the Kosovo precedent to demand recognition as independent nations .
As our NATO expansionists are anxious to bring Georgia into NATO , here is yet another occasion for a potential Washington - Moscow clash .
Spain , too , opposed the severing of Kosovo from Serbia , as Madrid faces similar demands from Basque and Catalan separatists .
The Muslim world will enthusiastically endorse the creation of a new Muslim state in Europe at the expense of Orthodox Christian Serbs .
But Turkey is also likely to re-raise the issue as to why the EU and United States do not formally recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .
Like Kosovo , it , too , is an ethnically homogeneous community that declared independence 25 years ago .
Breakaway Transneistria is seeking independence from Moldova , the nation wedged between Rumania and Ukraine , and President Putin of Russia has threatened to recognize it , Abkhazia and South Ossetia in retaliation for the West ’s recognition of Kosovo .
If Putin pauses , it will be because he recognizes that of all the nations of Europe , Russia is high among those most threatened by the serial Balkanization we may have just reignited in the Balkans .
Police were forced to bring in reinforcements to marshal the Olympic torch relay through London after a series of protests along the 31 - mile route by demonstrators angered at China 's human rights record .
More than 35 people have been arrested , all for public order offences .
Throughout the day there were incidents and flashpoints , the most serious occuring in Ladbroke Grove when a Free Tibet protester slipped through a 50 - strong pack of British police and Chinese security guards before attempting to wrestle the Olympic flame from Blue Peter TV presenter Konnie Huq .
The episode was brought to an end when the protester was bundled to the ground .
Two others were also taken away after trying to put out the flame with a fire extinguisher in Holland Park , and the procession was later forced into a temporary halt as the torch made an unscheduled switch to a bus while police pondered how to safely negotiate a crowd of protesters at Fleet Street .
The move briefly prevented further disruption but negated the spectacle , with the torch bearer completely hidden from the throngs lining the route from Wembley Stadium to Greenwich .
At several times during the day protesters threw themselves in front of the runners and there were also scuffles between police and demonstrators .
At one point , the torch procession even went the wrong way down a one - way street and was forced to turn round .
When the bus travelled along Oxford Street , human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell stopped it in its tracks by jumping into the road holding a sign saying " Free Tibet , free Hu Jia " .
" The arrest last week of human rights activist Hu Jia shows that China is not fulfilling its human rights commitments which were part of the deal for them to get the Olympics , " Mr Tatchell said .
" At the very least , world leaders should boycott the opening ceremony and athletes should wear Tibetan flags when they go on the podium to receive their medals . "
Mr Tatchell said he was detained by police but released with a warning .
Outside Downing Street , several demonstrators attempted to run towards the torch - with some trying to jump the barriers lining the pavement - as former Olympic pentathlon champion Denise Lewis took the flame .
Many were bundled to the floor by police , who were out on foot , on bicycles , and mounted on horseback .
The crowd reacted noisily , booing and whistling and shouting protests .
Thousands of peaceful protesters , many of them wearing Tibetan flags , also waved banners proclaiming " Torch of shame " , " Stop the killing in Tibet " , " No Olympic torch in Tibet " and " China talk to Dalai Lama " .
Helping to lead the chants was Buddhist monk Ngawang Khyentse , who said : " We ca n't just remain silent .
We have no other choice than to protest because there is no other voice for Tibetans inside Tibet , so we have to speak out for human rights .
We are not asking for a boycott of the games , although there are many different views .
We are asking for pressure to be put on the Chinese government to help the situation in Tibet . "
Tessa Jowell , the minister for the Olympics , said that despite the protests it would have been a " great mistake " not to have gone ahead with the relay .
She added : " I hope that the message that will go round the world is that , yes , there are many citizens of the UK who feel very strongly about China 's human rights record , there are people in the UK who feel very strongly about the importance of dialogue with the Dalai Lama , and that in the UK we cherish the right to lawful and peaceful protest which , by and large , is what we have seen today . "
Jowell 's views were echoed by Conservative leader David Cameron , who acknowledged that many people were " very unhappy " about what was happening in Tibet , but rejected calls for a boycott .
" I do n't think we are at the stage yet where we should be considering a boycott , " he said .
" I think having a policy of robust engagement with China is right . "
Earlier Britain 's greatest Olympian , the five - times rowing champion Sir Steve Redgrave , took the first leg of the relay before passing the Olympic flame to 16 - year - old schoolgirl Cheyenne Green at a frosty Wembley Stadium .
The British Olympic Association chairman , Lord Moynihan , told crowds : " The power of this Olympic torch will shine a light on the recesses of the host city and China 's record . "
However , Tom Porteous of Human Rights Watch has urged the government to do more to bring China 's human right 's record in Tibet to account .
" The prime minister should use this occasion to speak publicly about China 's Olympian abuses , " he said .
" The main thing the Olympic torch relay illuminates in Britain is the government 's lack of public strategy to address Olympic - related human rights issues in China in advance of the Beijing Games . "

Sexual coercion among animals is extremely common
An Antarctic fur seal has been observed trying to have sex with a king penguin .
The South African - based scientists who witnessed the incident say it is the most unusual case of mammal mating behaviour yet known .
The incident , which lasted for 45 minutes and was caught on camera , is reported in the Journal of Ethology .
The bizarre event took place on a beach on Marion Island , a sub-Antarctic island that is home to both fur seals and king penguins .
At first glimpse , we thought the seal was killing the penguin
Nico de Bruyn , University of Pretoria
Why the seal attempted to have sex with the penguin is unclear .
But the scientists who photographed the event speculate that it was the behaviour of a frustrated , sexually inexperienced young male seal .
Equally , it might have been an aggressive , predatory act ; or even a playful one that turned sexual .
" At first glimpse , we thought the seal was killing the penguin , " says Nico de Bruyn , of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria , South Africa .
Pinniped behaviour
The brazenness of the seal 's behaviour left those who saw it in no doubt as to what was happening .
De Bruyn and a colleague were on Trypot beach at Marion Island to study elephant seals when they noticed a young , adult male Antarctic fur seal , in good condition , attempting to copulate with an adult king penguin of unknown sex .
The 100kg seal first subdued the 15kg penguin by lying on it .
The penguin flapped its flippers and attempted to stand and escape - but to no avail .
The seal may have been frustrated in its attempts to find a partner
The seal then alternated between resting on the penguin , and thrusting its pelvis , trying to insert itself , unsuccessfully .
After 45 minutes the seal gave up , swam into the water and then completely ignored the bird it had just assaulted , the scientists report .
Why a fur seal would indulge in such extreme sexual behaviour is unclear .
Sexual coercion among animals is extremely common : males of many species often harass , coerce or force females of their own kind to mate , while animals are also known occasionally to harass sexually a member of a closely related species .
Harassment is common among pinnipeds , the group of animals that includes seals , fur seals , and sea lions ; and occasionally it happens between related species .
Male grey seals have been known to harass and mate with female harbour seals , for example , producing hybrids .
" Sexual harassment is often more commonplace in non-monogamous mating systems , and in species where males are physically much larger than the other sex and thus physically capable of coercion or harassment , " says de Bruyn .
But this is thought to be the first recorded example of a mammal trying to have sex with a member of another class of vertebrate , such as a bird , fish , reptile , or amphibian .
' Too young ' Chinstrap penguins occasionally indulge in homosexual behaviour , and adelie penguins sometimes " prostitute " themselves to get stones for nest - building ; while one in seven emperor penguins will change partners from one year to the next .
But generally , king penguins lead straightforward sex lives : males and females pair up for years on end .
Marion Island is the only place in the world where Antarctic fur seals are known to hunt king penguins on land , so the idea that the fur seal was trying to eat the object of its attention made sense .
" But then we realised that the seal 's intentions were rather more amorous . "
The researchers speculate that the male seal was too young to win access to female seals , and in a state of sexual excitement , looked elsewhere .
But the mating season was nearly over when the incident took place , leading the scientists to also wonder whether the seal 's natural predatory aggression toward the bird became redirected into sexual arousal .
Equally , the incident may have arisen because the seal was " play - mating " .
" It was most certainly a once - off and has never previously or since been recorded anywhere in the world to our knowledge , " says de Bruyn .
The penguin did not appear to have been injured by the seal , the scientists report .

What are these ?
The US military confirmed yesterday that a marine in Fallujah passed out coins with Gospel verses on them to Sunni Muslims , a military spokesman in the Iraqi city said .
The man was immediately removed from duty and reassigned .
The coins angered residents who said they felt that the American troops , whom they consider occupiers , were also acting as Christian missionaries in a predominantly Muslim nation .
" It did happen , " said Mike Isho , a spokesman for Multi- National Force West .
" It 's one guy and we 're investigating . "
The marine was passing out silver coins to residents of the Sunni Anbar province with Arabic translations of Bible verses on them .
On one side , the coin read , " Where will you spend eternity ? " and on the other , " For God so loved the world , that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish , but have eternal life .
John 3:16 " .
Following a McClatchy newspaper report about the proselytising coins , a force was sent to the western gate of Fallujah and the Marines there were searched , Isho said .
One man was found with the coins , removed from the gate and will no longer be working in predominantly Sunni Anbar province , he said .
Yesterday , the US military apologised for the incident , telling McClatchy special correspondent Jamal Naji that action would be taken following an investigation .
One marine making a mistake should n't brand the work of hundreds of marines , said Sergeant Major Neil O'Connell in western Anbar province .
He went on to tell the story of two young marines who took the blow of a truck bomb to protect Iraqi police .
" Such an action will not pass without proper punishment , " O'Connell said .
" We started a formal investigation to figure out exactly what happened . "
The correspondent was taken around the base in Fallujah and into the dining facilities to show that there 's no religious proselytising or discrimination on the military base .
A poster on a base billboard advertised Friday prayers to observant Muslims , and Iraqi employees eat in the same dining facility where leading US officers dine .
A US military spokesman said he was unsure where the silver coins came from but speculated that they may have been sent to the young Marine from outside Iraq .
" Regulations prohibit members of the coalition force from proselytising any religion , faith or practices , and our troops are trained on those guidelines before they deploy , " said Colonel Bill Buckner , a Multi-National Corps spokesman , in a statement .
For two days , residents were being handed the coins when they passed through the western gate where all residents are searched and their residence badges are checked .
Many considered the move an affront to their religion , humiliating and straining the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Iraq .
The military is sensitive about the latest religious mishap following the May 11 discovery of a Quran , the holy book of Islam , which had been used as target practice .
Iraqi police found the Quran riddled with bullets and filled with graffiti .
The US service member involved was removed from Iraq .
" This has our full attention , " said Colonel James L Welsh , the chief of staff of the Multi-National Force West in a statement .
" We deeply value our relationship with the local citizens and share their concerns over this serious incident . "
A typical summer for the average American consists of a picnic or two , some time at the beach , and of course a carnival or a food festival — especially if you are from a small town .
Usually the theme is based on that particular town 's local produce or specialty , be it peaches , asparagus , gumbo or cheese curds .
There are usually fireworks , parades , car shows , cook - offs , and maybe even a fashionable 10 K race .
But some towns add a little spice , and yes , sometimes even a little ( or big ? ) testicle .
These are the quirkiest food festivals in America .
So rev up your road trip engines , loosen your belt buckles , tuck a ( paper ) napkin in your collar and dig in !
1. Gizzard Festival : June 6 - 8 , Potterville , MI
Let 's kick things off with the Potterville Gizzard Festival , which is going on right now .
Complete with all the traditional regalia of a fine food festival — a car show , a mud derby , some fireworks and a parade — there is also the annual gizzard eating contest at Joe 's Potterville Inn .
Not for the faint of stomach , contestants have to eat two pounds of gizzards as quickly as they can .
Winners get bragging rights for the year , plus $ 100 in cold , hard cash .
Whoever said one could n't make a living eating chicken gizzards ?
And what exactly is a chicken gizzard ?
A gizzard is a secondary stomach that can be found in both birds and reptiles .
It aids in digestion by grinding food with ingested stones before returning the food to the primary stomach .
Mmmm !
Supposedly , it 's a little like chewy chicken liver and , when lightly seasoned with a little salt and pepper , can be quite nice .
If you live near Potterville and you 're equal parts hungry and brave , grab a gizzard hat and head out there this weekend .
2. RC and MoonPie Festival : June 21 , Bell Buckle , TN
You really can't get more Southern than a cold RC Cola and a freshly unwrapped MoonPie .
Add a little BBQ into the mix and you have the Bell Buckle RC and MoonPie Festival .
When a population of just over 400 swells to 15,000 for one weekend of the year you know it 's gotta be good .
And is it ever — they bake the world 's largest MoonPie !
Each year , the newly elected MoonPie King and Queen select a group of Knights for their round table .
These Knights aid in the ceremonial cutting and distributing of free pieces of the world 's largest MoonPie .
But the real draw of this festival is the " Synchronized Wading " extravaganza .
Described as " dry humor on a wet stage , " the Down Home Divas ( led by First Lady Carla Webb ) will perform " A Midsummer 's Nightmare " this year .
It will star Miss Moon Pie and feature special appearances by the Googoo cluster and a Coke .

3. Bologna : July 25 - 27 , Yale , MI
Yale bologna is said to be some of the best in the world .
A bit courser and more strongly seasoned than your typical Oscar Mayer slice , this bologna has been rumored to help people live to be 120 years old .
( We could n't find any 120 - year - old bologna enthusiasts to confirm this . )
Every year , in a single weekend , over a thousand pounds of bologna are served either fried in sandwiches , stuck between a bun as a hot dog or placed around a stick in ring form .
The Bologna Queen crown is quite prestigious in Yale .
Contestants must declare their intention to run up to six weeks in advance and be willing to raise tens of thousands of dollars for charity .
The lucky lady who captures this highly respected title receives a crown of ringed bologna and a King for her arm .
And of course , there is the outhouse race where people build a crude loo on wheels to push around town as fast as they can .
The only requirements ?
The inclusion of a Sears catalog and somebody riding inside — hopefully not because of one too many bologna sticks .
4. Testicle Festival : July 30 - Aug 3 , Rock Creek Lodge , MT
Sorry kiddies , this one is not for you .
Also known as the " Testy Festy " or the " Breasticle Festival , " this four - day drunken jamboree is filled with wet t- shirt contests , pig wrestling , stripping , mooning , bull riding , and fried bull testicle consumption .
Called " Rocky Mountain Oysters , " bull testicles are considered delicious by a select group of fine diners .
In a showcase of masculine virility , there is even a bull testicle eating contest .
Matt Powers took the title last year after consuming over 40 bull testicles in four minutes .
Mentioned in Playboy as one of the top things to do in the summer ( as long as you 're down with nudity and motorcycles ) , you should follow their advice and " come out and have a ball ! "
5. Humongous Fungus : August 7 - 10 , Crystal Falls , MI
In honor of the world 's largest — and possibly oldest — living organism , the Amirillaria Bulbosa ( aka " honey mushroom , " which spans 38 acres under an Iron County forest and may be as old as 10,000 years ) , the good people of Crystal Falls , Michigan , throw a festival every year .
People travel from all over the world to get a glimpse of this humongous fungus , but can be bitterly disappointed upon realization that it is almost completely underground .
But their disappointment does not last long .
At the festival there are fungus shirts , fungus burgers , fungus fudge , and fungus mushroom hats to assuage their grief .
And did I mention the HUMONGOUS sausage and mushroom pizza they cook every year ?
Placed over a roasting pit in a humongous pizza - roasting pan by a humongous lumber truck crane , this pizza measures over 100 square feet !

Other events include a mushroom cook - off , a strong man competition and a humongous picnic .
Plus David Letterman once mentioned the famed Humungous Fungus on one of his top ten lists .
6. Roadkill Festival : Sept 27 , Marlinton , WV
This is where it starts to get good .
With taglines like " You kill it we grill it ; featuring some of the highway 's finest " and " Eating food is more fun when you know it was hit on the run , " Marlinton , West Virginia , knows how to bring a little humor into a good food festival .
Featuring any animal often — but in this case , not actually — roadkill , contestants cook up recipes using possum , beaver , raccoon , snake , deer or armadillo .
Care to try some " Deer Smear Quesadillas " or " Bumper Bruised Barbequed Bear " ?
This is the place !
7. Turkey Testicle Festival : October 11 , Byron , IL
It must be the rhyming , because I cannot think of any other reason why there are so many testicle festivals .
This one , however , is a little more PG .
Still only for the 21 - and - over crowd ( is it necessary to be plastered when consuming fried testicles ? ) , the Turkey Testicle Festival consists of more savory activities like Karaoke , a performance by the Testilett dancers , and a fundraiser for charity that brought in over $ 25,000 last year .
Every year , over 275 lbs. of turkey testicles are consumed at Byron 's Union Street Station .
Now in its 30th year , this festival is facing an uphill battle to continue the tradition .
Last year , an underage drinker got past security , and passed out in the bathroom , prompting a police investigation .
Now the fate of this storied festival is up in the air .
How storied ?
Well , there 's a song dedicated to it .
Honorable Mentions

Just think of the possibilities " ¦
" Where are you off to ? " " I 'm going to that Dam Festival . "

This amazing X - ray picture shows the skeleton of a kitten inside a python 's stomach after being devoured in one gulp by the predator .
Eight - week - old tabby Kohl was seized by the slithering assassin while in the garden of her owner 's home in Australia 's tropical Northern Territory .
The snake was found with a " bulging belly " by 14 - year - old Taara McLaren after she ventured out to feed her pets at 7 am yesterday .
Scroll down for more ...
X-ray :
The picture clearly shows the kitten , Kohl , inside the python 's stomach
Despite Kohl having a skull three times the size of the 5ft - long python , the reptile was able to dislocate its jaw to swallow the kitten after wrapping itself around and strangling its prey .
Three other kittens from the same litter and five adult cats were unable to stop the savage attack in Darwin suburb of Tiwi .
Cat owner Asha McLaren told The Australian newspaper : " It was n't a very nice feeling to think that this happened in our back yard .
" My daughter went out to feed the cats and they normally all come running at the sound of the dish , but Kohl was missing .
" She then looked around and saw the snake .
She called out to me , saying there was a big snake and that she thought it had eaten Kohl .
" When I went out I could n't believe it .
It had a bulging belly and when we could n't find Kohl anywhere it was obvious he'd been eaten .
" It was very sad as he was my favourite .
He was just gorgeous . "

Bulging : Handler Gordon
Canning holds the snake who will take a week to digest its prey
Ms McLaren said they quickly put their other cats in the house and snake catcher Gordon Canning was called out to collect the python .
He said it was unusual for a python to target a cat , but the kitten did not have a chance against the reptile .
He said pythons usually strike at their prey and squeeze it to death before devouring it whole .
" The cat would have been suffocated within minutes , " he explained .
" The snake did well - usually it is the other way around with snakes falling victim to cats . "
Mr Canning said the snake would be kept at the Ark Animal Hospital in Yarrawonga until it digested its feed .
" At the moment it can not move very quickly so it could easily be targeted by predators , " Mr Canning said .
" Once it has finished digesting the cat , which will probably take about a week , we will release it back into the wild . "
Mr Canning urged people to be cautious in their back yards as snakes were on the move as the breeding season nears .
He has been called out to catch more than 100 snakes since becoming Darwin 's first 24 - hour snake catcher three weeks ago .
Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens has placed an the largest ever order for wind turbines : he ordered 667 wind turbines from GE , each costing $ 3 million dollars , making the total order $ 2 billion .
Picken plans to develop the worldâ€™s largest wind farm in the panhandle of Texas .
The $ 2 billion order is just one quarter of the total amount he plans to purchase .
Once built , the wind farm would have the capacity to supply power to over 1,200,000 homes in North Texas .
Each turbine can produce 1.5 megawatts of electricity .
The first phase of the project will produce 1,000 megawatts , enough energy to power 300,000 homes .
GE will begin delivering the turbines in 2010 , and current plans call for the project to start producing power in 2011 .
Ultimately , Pickenâ€™s company , Mesa Power , plans to have enough turbines to produce 4,000 megawatts of energy , the overall project is expected to cost $ 10 billion and be completed in 2014 .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Mesa Power has leased sparsely populated land in the Texas panhandle , where the wind often blows during daylight hours when energy needs are highest .
Texasâ€™ Competitive Renewable Energy Zones ( CREZ ) transmission lines will deliver what Pickens hopes will be â€œcost effective and reliable electricity generated by renewable energy power projects.â€ 
David Gracer lifts a giant water bug , places his thumbs in a pre-sliced slit in its underside , and flips off its head .
“ Smell the meat , ” he says , sniffing the decapitated creature , and the people gathered around the table willingly oblige .
Members of the New York Gastronauts , a club for adventurous eaters , they murmur appreciatively as they scoop out and swallow the grayish , slightly greasy insect flesh .
“ Perfumey , tastes like salty apples , ” one says .
“ Like a scented candle blended with an artichoke , ” another adds .
The giant water bug , or Lethocerus indicus , a three - inch - long South Asian insect that looks uncannily like a local cockroach , is just one of the items on the menu of this bug -eating bacchanal .
The Gastronauts ’ meal may seem more like a reality TV stunt than a radical environmental strategy , but Gracer is on a serious mission to shake up how we all think about our food supply .
Gracer , a self - described “ geeky poet / nature boy ” who teaches composition at a community college in Providence , Rhode Island , has made it his duty to persuade ordinary Americans to eat insects .
Gracer wants people to move away from getting their protein from traditional livestock such as cows , pigs , and chickens because raising livestock has a huge negative impact on the environment , regardless of whether the animals belong to subsistence farmers in developing countries or a Western industrial conglomerate .
A United Nations report released in 2006 calls the livestock sector “ one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems , at every scale from local to global . ”
The report notes that , among other adverse impacts , livestock production is responsible for 18 percent of global greenhouse - gas emissions .
( That ’s more than what is produced by transportation worldwide . )
And the problem is only going to grow , with global production of meat reaching 465 million tons by 2050 , double the amount produced in 2000 .
“ Americans have no idea how wasteful these large mammals are , ” Gracer says .
“ If you want to feed a lot of people , insects are the best choice in terms of getting the biggest bang for your buck . ”
Insects , he claims , are nutritious .
Although they typically contain less protein by weight than beef or chicken — 100 grams of giant water bugs or small grasshoppers , for example , have about 20 grams of protein , compared with 27 grams in the same amount of lean ground beef — they do have other benefits .
For instance , grasshoppers contain just one - third of the fat found in beef , and water bugs offer almost four times as much iron .
A 100 - gram portion of the cooked caterpillar Usata terpsichore has about 28 grams of protein .
In their dried form , as they are commonly sold in Africa , insects such as grasshoppers may contain up to 60 percent protein .
Raising insects has a low impact on the environment .
They require little water , perhaps because they obtain much of their moisture from their food .
It takes 869 gallons of water to produce a third of a pound of beef , about enough for a large hamburger .
By contrast , to supply water to a quarter pound of crickets , Gracer simply places­ a moist paper towel at the bottom of their tank and refreshes it weekly .
Insects , he says , also need less food and space than vertebrate sources of protein and therefore could replace or supplement food resources that may become scarce in the future , such as fish stocks , which a recent study indicates may collapse by 2048 .
Founded in 2005 , Gracer ’s company , a one - man operation called Sunrise Land Shrimp , educates people about insect eating , or entomophagy .
On a roughly monthly basis , Gracer will visit a high school or give a public lecture , and he recently appeared on The Colbert Report ( video ) .
Not long ago he traveled to Thailand to attend a United Nations workshop on entomophagy .
“ I would love to counteract the portrayal of entomophagy that we see on Fear Factor and Survivor , ” he says .
“ It ’s my interest to bring it out of the zone of freakdom . ”
But even Sunrise Land Shrimp does n’t sell insects — yet .
In the United States insects are generally available only as novelty foods , such as the salt - and - vinegar - flavored crickets sold by Hotlix , a California company that specializes in insect - based candies .
Outside the United States , though , in Botswana and Zimbabwe , insect gathering is becoming commercialized .
And rural villagers in southern Africa harvest caterpillars from the local mopane trees .
Traditionally , mopane caterpillars have been an important source of protein for the villagers , but more recently they have also been packaged and sold as a regional delicacy .
In fact , at least 1,400 species of insects are eaten around the world , and the practice dates back thousands of years .
However , even commercially distributed species such as the mopane caterpillar are harvested from wild insect populations , meaning that they are subject to year - to - year fluctuations and problems of overharvesting .
What is needed to stabilize the insect food supply is the development of farms .
“ I ’ve been working for a long time on trying to convince people that farming insects for the production of animal protein and other materials might be a good idea , ” says Robert Kok , chairman of the department of bioresource engineering at McGill University , near Montreal .
“ Even if they did n’t want to eat them ‘ whole hog , ’ so to say , it would be possible to extract the protein and oil from them and then manufacture food products from those components , ” Kok adds .
William White of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Agricultural Research Service in Houma , Louisiana , is skeptical that this will ever come to pass in the United States , where food tends to be overabundant rather than scarce , at least among those above the poverty line .
“ I do n’t believe that we ’ve reached the level of scarcity in our food supply , at least in Western societies , where people would be willing to incorporate insects at any level in their diet , ” White says .
“ Certainly in the United States , the [ response to ] insects almost borders on a phobia . ”
As Marion Nestle , professor of nutrition at New York University and the author of What to Eat , puts it , “ I think people would have to be desperate for food to make insects a principal part of their diet . ”
There are other obstacles too :
Some insects , such as sea shrimp , cause food allergies ; others sequester toxins from plants or may harbor pesticide residues .
Even if we do n’t all switch to Bug Burgers , Gracer and his insects are helping to change our habit of making knee - jerk decisions about what we should and should n’t be eating .
According to the latest figures from the United Nations , 854 million people around the world went hungry in 2003 .
Really thinking about our food choices could be the first step toward feeding our planet ’s ever - growing population in a sustainable manner .
Gracer continues to spend much of his spare time speaking at museums and schools about the benefits and joys of bug eating .
In the long term , though , he has grander plans :
He would like to import edible insects such as the popular mopane caterpillars or set up a commercial operation selling insects already available here , such as spicy Mexican grasshoppers , or chapulines .
He knows his mission is not an easy one ; for one thing , there is the small matter of funding .
“ If I did this for a living , my family and I would be eating bugs all the time , ” he says .
Another headline pops up : " Scientists aim to make computer that thinks like a human " .
And I think no , No , NO !
Do n't , whatever you do , do that .
Even if Ray Kurzweil is the one suggesting it 's coming .
Why do n't I like the idea of a human - like computer ?
Am I creating a silicon ceiling beneath which I 'm trying to keep our processing friends ?
Actually , no .
I just think that humans are a terrible example to follow if you want to develop something that 's conscious – which is generally what these efforts to create " human - like " systems are really about : to reach the point where the machine says " I am " , and everyone falls about , stunned .
My reasons are simple .
We do n't build skyscrapers based on the same principles as the human spine ; if we did , then they'd be constantly falling down or showing signs of significant weakness .
We do n't build transport systems that work like the human body , using muscle - like elastic bands snapping back and forth to power them .
We do n't build cameras where the wires taking the signal from the CCDs runs in front of the CCDs themselves .
Humans , though , are built like that .
The spine is well - suited for hanging a lot of organs off in a four - footed beast ; but pretty badly adapted for bipedal , upright walking , because all the stresses are put in places where , over the course of years , they 'll mess things up .
Our relatively newly acquired Achilles tendon is a significant point of weakness during running ( ask anyone who 's snapped one of theirs ) .
The retina is a model of daft design , with all the blood vessels passing in front of the rod and cone cells .
That we 're not aware of this is a tribute to the brain 's ability to filter data .
Haphazard construction
That 's the thing : evolution is a terrible designer .
What it 's good at ( supremely good , of course ) is finding what works best at a particular point in time in a particular environment .
And the same applies with the workings of the human brain .
This idea is wonderfully set out in a book called Kluge : The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind , by Gary Marcus .
He 's professor of psychology at New York university , and examines carefully how the workings of our minds – not just brains – are as evolutionarily messy as our spines , tendons and eyes .
The chapter headings give you a flavour : memory , belief , choice , language , pleasure , things fall apart ; and true wisdom .
For instance , when it comes to deciding what to do , Marcus argues that we have two systems operating in our minds : an " ancestral " system and a " deliberative " one .
We 've had the ancestral system for hundreds of millions of years , dating back before we came down from the trees ( before " we " were " we " , in fact ) .
The deliberative system requires something closer to language ; it 's younger , and it and the ancestral system frequently disagree and fight like two cats in a bag .
The older one , being better wired into our subconscious , often gets the upper hand .
Take the real example Marcus describes of a Chicago law firm which , trying to drum up business , paid for a 48 - foot three - panel billboard with " the torso of an exceptionally attractive woman , breasts all but bursting out of her lacy black bra ; the torso of a man no less handsome , shirtless , with his well - oiled muscles bulging ; and , just above the law firm 's name and contact information , a slogan containing just five words : LIFE'S SHORT - GET A DIVORCE " .
Now , divorce is expensive , emotionally damaging , time - consuming , and can take years to recover from .
Your deliberative system knows that ( or has read about it ) .
Yet you can be sure that at least some of the married people who saw that billboard heard a small internal yelp – their ancestral system saying " I 'm missing out on hot sex ! "
Both pieces of knowledge are part of your mind .
But why is the ancestral system even saying it ?
Ca n't the deliberative system hold it down ?
It turns out that no , it can't .
Marcus also has an example of incest that causes no harm but which leaves you wanting to wash your brain out and at the same time wondering why .
It 's a strange journey looking into the bizarre workings of your mind .
Irrational decisions
Similar problems circle around us every day .
It 's part of the reason why we need politicians : we need people who can find ways to use language in order to keep both our deliberative and ancestral systems feeling sated .
People ( never you or me , of course ) make irrational decisions about all sorts of things : houses , clothes , cars , beliefs , money .
Countless studies show that the human mind just does n't work in a rational manner .
Douglas Hofstadter , who is very much cleverer than anyone in pretty much any room , puts it another way : research to create computer models of the mind " helps remind me of the immense subtlety and elusiveness of the human mind " .
Well , yes , " elusiveness " is one way of putting it , I suppose .
And yet we 're keen to have computers that will mimic this ?
The thought makes me shudder .
The much - missed Douglas Adams had it absolutely right throughout The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , where his " humanised " machines always suffered terribly for their " elevation " to our level : Marvin the Paranoid Android with his brain the size of a planet , who could n't bear performing the menial tasks that his masters with their inferior intelligences demanded of him .
( It would be like us being ordered about by our dogs . )
Or the intelligent lifts – aka Happy Vertical People Transporters : " Not unnaturally , many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition become terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down , up and down , experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways , as sort of an existential protest , demanded participation in the decision making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking . "
Is that really the sort of computer you 're looking for ?
Because if it is , then I think we 've got problems far bigger than the ones that people are trying to solve with these systems .
No ; while it 's certainly interesting to ponder what might constitute machine consciousness , to try to create human - like " machine minds " is a mistake , and any attempt to reverse - engineer our jumble of evolutionary leftovers and stick it into a machine would be an act of amazing cruelty .
Apart from anything , would you really want a machine that could remember what it did a month ago , but can't remember where it put that file it saved five minutes ago ?
Or can remember that it fed the dog , but not what it had for lunch five days ago ?
Let 's get off that rollercoaster while we can .
What we really want is machines that are as unlike humans as possible .
We want them to be rational , predictable , fast .
And most of all I want them to remember where I left my keys .
Because I sure as hell can't .

Allan was given the life ban by Sheriff MacKinnon at Falkirk Sheriff Court A convicted rapist who stole underwear has been banned for life from making sexual advances towards women while under the influence of alcohol .
Andrew Allan , 34 , admitted sneaking into a woman 's bedroom on 8 May and stealing her underwear " as a trophy " .
Falkirk Sheriff Court was told Allan wanted to use the items " for sexual gratification " .
In 2003 , Allan , from Grangemouth , was given a four - year jail term for raping a woman in an Aberfoyle hotel bedroom .
The court heard that in the latest incident , Allan had crept into the home of a 38 year - old woman in Grangemouth 's Candie Crescent uninvited .
He sneaked upstairs and walked into her bedroom , where she lay sleeping .
' Threatening behaviour '
He woke her , then stole her purse and four pairs of her knickers , before sneaking out again .
He then used her Visa card to steal £ 300 from a cash machine in the town .
Aiden Higgins , prosecuting , said : " It might reasonably be inferred that the accused was selecting items which he wished to keep for himself , for sexual gratification .
" He kept them and they were recovered from his own house . "
Sheriff Neil MacKinnon imposed the chat - up ban after ruling that the theft was a crime " with a significant sexual element " .
The Sexual Offences Prevention Order prohibits Allan for life " from approaching any females who are not known to him whilst under the influence of alcohol and using sexualised and / or threatening behaviour towards them . "
It also bans him from drinking anywhere other than in his home , or being under the influence of alcohol in public .
He was also placed on probation for three years and on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a 10 pm to 7 am curfew for a year .
Allan was jailed for rape in 2003 after an attack on a sleeping women at the Covenanters '
Inn in Aberfoyle in Perthshire , where he worked as a waiter .

What are these ?
Satellite imagery obtained from NASA will help archeologist Bill Middleton peer into the ancient Mexican past .
In a novel archeological application , multi- and hyperspectral data will help build the most accurate and most detailed landscape map that exists of the southern state of Oaxaca , where the Zapotec people formed the first state - level and urban society in Mexico .
“ If you ask someone off the street about Mexican archeology , they ’ll say Aztec , Maya .
Sometimes they ’ll also say Inca , which is the wrong continent , but you ’ll almost never hear anyone talk about the Zapotecs , ” says Middleton , acting chair of the Department of Material Culture Sciences and professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Rochester Institute of Technology .
“ They had the first writing system , the first state society , the first cities .
And they controlled a fairly large territory at their Zenith — 250 B.C. to 750 A.D. ”
The process of state formation varied across the Zapotec realm .
Sometimes it involved conquest , and other times it was more economically driven .
Archeologists like Middleton are interested in different aspects of society that emerged in the process , such as social stratification and the development and intensification of agriculture and economic specialization .
Middleton ’s study will explore how the Oaxacan economy and environment changed as the Zapotec state grew and then collapsed into smaller city - states .
Funding from NASA and National Geographic will also help Middleton build a picture of how climate and vegetation patterns have changed over time .
“ For the past 4,000 years , human activities have been a factor in environmental change , ” Middleton says .
“ And there are some parts of Mesoamerica that we have pretty good evidence that the environment we see today is the catastrophic result of ancient agricultural practices . ”
Middleton will focus on two sites in the Chichicapam Valley located in between two of the major arms of the central valleys of Zapotec .
The National Geographic - funded portion of the study began last summer when he documented important archeological sites and selected candidates for excavation .
Imagery from Earth Observing 1 and Landsat satellites obtained over three years will help Middleton identify the natural resources found at archeological sites .
He will work with colleagues John Kerekes and David Messinger along with graduate student Justin Kwon in RIT ’s Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science to analyze the large amounts of data taken at different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Their own research uses similar techniques to analyze urban landscapes , and inspired Middleton to apply the technology to archeological landscapes .

“ We are excited to be collaborating with Bill in this application of remote sensing technology to archaeological study , ” says Kerekes .
“ This project shows a true strength of RIT with an environment that allows physical scientists and engineers like us to easily work together with a social scientist like Bill . ”
Adds Messinger : “ Applications of remote sensing have long been a motivating factor for our technology work in the field of remote sensing , and the chance to work closely with an end - user here at RIT is a fantastic opportunity for our students and faculty .
By learning more about how the technology can help in this application , we will be in a much better position to guide our future sensor development and algorithmic research . ”
The technology works by differentiating materials on the ground on the basis of reflected light .
Objects that look the same in visible light may have very different reflective properties when sampled across the spectrum .
“ When you put the data back together as a picture you begin to see things you could n’t see before , and you can make distinctions that to your eyes look the same , ” Middleton says .
Satellite imagery covering more than 30,000 square kilometers will help Middleton identify different plant species , environments and ecosystems , and acres of arable land or mineral resources surrounding particular sites .

“ We can start looking at the relationship between ancient cities and ancient human settlements in a way that no one has really been able to do before , ” Middleton says .
The new landscape map will also show how development has changed the region since the first survey conducted 30 years ago .
“ We will be able to compare the then - and - now images and be able to make a very good assessment of what we have lost in the past several decades as a result of development , ” Middleton says .
Another aspect of the NASA - funded project will focus on environmental change .
This part of the study , done in conjunction with colleagues at the University of Colorado at Boulder will analyze plant microfossils in sediment samples collected from a variety of locations , including areas where streams expose sediment layers 10,000 years old .
“ Roughly 10,000 years ago , Oaxaca was wetter than it is today , ” Middleton says .
“ Today it ’s classified as semi-arid , and the dominant vegetation in the valley is thorn - scrub forest .
Ten thousand years ago , it was a grassland and there were horses there . ”
Microsoft 's Windows Vista is 37 percent more secure than its Windows XP ancestor , a security vendor claimed Friday , a rate it hinted was disappointing .
Using different data collection techniques , Microsoft has recently asserted that Vista is 60 percent more secure than XP .
For every 1,000 machines running Vista , security company PC Tools counted 639 unique threats over a six - month period , said Michael Greene , the firm 's vice president of product strategy , on Friday .
" A threat is actually when [ malicious code ] has penetrated the machine , " Greene said .
" The malware has to be on the machine to be counted by our Threat Fire community . "
Vista 's number is lower than the one for Windows XP .
Users of PC Tool 's Threat Fire behavioral - based anti-malware software who run the nearly - seven - year - old XP reported 1,021 unique threats per 1,000 machines in the same six - month period .
" We wanted to find out how bulletproof Vista was , " said Greene , noting that Microsoft has claimed Vista is significantly more secure than its predecessors .
" The answer is that it is more secure than XP , but not so secure that you can give up on anti-virus and other security software . "
Ironically , the even older Windows 2000 is much more secure , by PC Tools ' statistics , than Windows XP or Vista ; Threat Fire users reported just 586 unique incidents of penetrated PCs per 1,000 machines during the six - month span .
But Greene essentially dismissed that number , or at least direct comparisons with XP or Vista .
" It 's a matter of what people are using as desktop machines , " he said , adding that since Threat Fire targets consumers and Windows 2000 is rarely run as a desktop client outside of businesses , the unique - threat - per - 1,000 does n't necessarily mean that the old OS was more secure .
Overall , Greene was disappointed in the stats for Windows .
" I did n't think the situation would be this bad in general , " he said , adding that Microsoft 's claims that Vista is substantially more secure than XP does n't jibe with the Threat Fire numbers .
" I do n't think Vista is really any more secure than XP , " he said .
" People still need to practice safe computing and need to have good security software , and keep their machines patched and up - to - date . "
Microsoft , however , has recently claimed that Vista is more secure than XP , and by a greater margin than what Greene and PC Tools allege .
According to data collected during cleansing operations of the Malicious Software Removal Tool ( MSRT ) , software that Microsoft updates monthly and feeds automatically to most Windows users , 60 % fewer Vista machines were infected by a recognizable piece of malware than PCs running XP during the second half of 2007 .
Microsoft summarized its MSRT data in a security report published about three weeks ago .
The report 's key findings , as well as the full report , can be downloaded from Microsoft 's site .
This story , " Vista Security Beats XP , Tests Find " was originally published by Computerworld .
“ There is no denying that when you get negative job numbers , realistically the economy is less strong than we had hoped it would be , ” Mr. Lazear said .
“ The question is how quickly will it pick up .
We think it will pick up  as I mentioned , we think it will pick up by the summer . ”
Few private forecasters were so buoyant .
Many firms had already concluded that a recession was under way .
Within minutes of the new report on employment , many in the dwindling pool of optimists changed their positions .
Mr. Yardeni was hardly alone .
Just one minute after the Labor Department published its report at 8:30 a.m. , JPMorgan Chase reversed its stance , declaring that a recession appeared to have begun .
Lehman Brothers switched its position as well .
Unemployment typically starts to rise only after a recession has started , and it keeps climbing for many months after the economy has hit bottom and begun to recover .
Paul Ashworth , an economist at Capital Economics , noted that private - sector payroll employment has now declined by an average of 47,000 a month  a decline that has been followed by a recession every time it has happened in the last 50 years .
In each of those recessions , Mr. Ashworth added , the job market recovered only after monthly job losses peaked at 200,000 jobs .
Ben S. Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , had already sent clear signals in recent weeks that the central bank was ready to reduce the overnight federal funds rate when policy makers meet on March 18 .
Since August , the Fed has sharply cut overnight rates five times , to 3 percent from 5.25 percent , and investors have been all but assuming that the central bank would reduce them by at least another half a percentage point , and perhaps three - quarters of a point , at the next meeting .
This contrast - enhanced image was acquired at the Phoenix landing site on Sol 4 by Phoenix 's Robotic Arm Camera ( RAC ) .
As seen in the top center , the exhaust from the descent engine has blown soil off to reveal either rock or ice , which has not yet been determined .
TUCSON , Ariz . ?
NASA ?s Phoenix Mars Lander sent back images of the blind spotunderneath it today as mission scientists gear up for the craft 's robotic armto touch the planet 's soil for the first time .
The spacecraft also encounteredits first glitch , with a short circuit in one of its instruments , missionscientists said at a briefing on Friday .
Phoenix ?
srobotic arm was maneuvered so that the camera at the end of it could image the spaceunderneath the lander , which is a blind spot for the stereo camera on topof the lander ?s deck .
The images showed some interesting tabular formations , asrobotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson , of Washtington University in St. Louis , described them .
" Wedon ? t know what they are .
They could be exposures of ice , or they could beexposures of rocks , " Arvidson said at a briefing here at the University ofArizona .
?
We 're really pushing for ice , but we don?t know if that 's the caseyet .?
The $ 420 million dollar Phoenix mission is designed todig down to the layers of water ice thought to lie just under the surfaceof the north polar region of Mars , where it landed on Sunday .
Instruments onthe spacecraft are designed to analyze soil samples to see if the ice was onceliquid and could have created a habitable zone for possible microbial life atsome point in Mars ' past .
Missioncontrollers have encountered a problem with one of these instruments , the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) that is designed to heat up soilsamples until vapors come off and then to analyze those vapors to detectthe composition of the soil .
Theglitch seems to be a short circuit in a filament in a part of the instrumentthat ionizes the vapors before they are sent to the detector , said TEGAco - investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona .
There are twofilaments in the detector however , and TEGA scientists are now investigatingwhether they can operate the instrument with just the one filament .
They willalso being sending up diagnostic instructions over the next few days .
" We 'requite optimistic that we have a workaround that will let us operate theinstrument , " Boynton said .
Meanwhile , mission scientists are also looking for more information on the soil near thelander so that they can begin digging for samples .
The first step will beimaging all three of the landers ' footpads with the robotic arm camera to makesure the craft is stable on the ground , mission scientists said .
Afterthat , mission scientists plan to perform a " soil touch , " whichinvolves moving the scoop at the end of the robotic arm and making a dent inthe soil , then turning the scoop around and imaging the dent to make sure thatcontrollers know how to reach the soil , Arvidson told SPACE.com .
Thenext step will be to do what mission scientists call a " dig and dump " where they will practice having the robotic arm scoop up the soil and dump itdown again .
Missioncontrollers are waiting to get data back from Phoenix ?s Friday night downlinkon one of the proposed ? dig and dump ?
sites to decide when and where to performthe soil touch maneuver .

Friend Connect is Google 's new offering Google has joined the drive to make the web more social by introducing tools to enable people to interact with their friends .
Friend Connect follows plans announced last week by the world 's two biggest social networking sites , MySpace and Facebook .
Data Availability and Connect let users move their personal profiles and applications to other websites .
" Social is in the air , " says Google 's director of engineering David Glazer .
During a conference call at Google 's California headquarters , Mr Glazer told reporters : " Google Friend Connect is about being the ' long tail ' of sites becoming more social . "
" Many sites are n't explicitly social and do n't necessarily want to be social networks , but they still benefit from letting their visitors interact with each other .
That used to be hard . "
Charlene Li , principal analyst at Forrester , told BBC News : " Google is tapping into the ' all things social ' heat of the moment , but it 's adding a different perspective , not as a data source and social network ' owner ' but as an enabler . "
Gamut of uses
At the heart of Google 's service is the use of Open Social which will allow third parties to build and develop applications for the site .
Social networking is going mainstream
David Glazer
Google
The company says with Friend Connect , any website owner can add a snippet of code to his or her site and get social features up and running right away without any complicated programming .
This will run the gamut from invitations to member 's gallery and from message walls to reviews .
In an example of how it will all work , Google cited fans of independent musician Ingrid Michaelson who can now connect with other fans without having to leave the site .
Visitors will be able to see comments by friends from their social networks , add music to their profiles and see who is attending concerts all at Ingrid 's website .
" Social networking is going mainstream .
It used to be proprietary , but now it 's going to be open and baked into the infrastructure of the net , not just one site or one source , " says Mr Glazer .
Walled garden MySpace was first out of the gate when it announced plans last Thursday to loosen its grip on the estimated 200 million personal profiles its users store on its site .
Data Availability will allow members to share select information with four partners , Yahoo .
PhotoBucket , Twitter and eBay .
Google does n't do anything without thinking about ... how can it benefit Google
Charlene Li
Principal analyst , Forrester Essentially the user will still be tied to MySpace which aims to put itself at the centre of the web by encouraging users to store all of their core data at the site to begin with .
One day later Facebook entered the fray with a service called Connect .
With its 70 million users worldwide , their plans differ from MySpace by allowing users to take their personal profiles to any website that wants to host them and not just the sites that have partnered up .
So what 's driving this move to dismantle the so - called " walled garden " where social networking sites have jealously guarded their users profiles ?
Charlene Li , principal analyst at Forrester told BBC
News in the end it all comes down to money .
" It 's a smart move by Google which is trying to play the role of United Nations secretary general by making sure everyone talks nicely to one another , getting the data to where they want to move it back and forward , and participate in open standards .
" Remember Google does n't do anything without thinking about , not only how can this benefit the larger community , but how can it benefit Google . "
As 99 % of sites are not currently socially enabled , Friend Connect has a big potential market in front of it and Ms Li says the route to all things profitable in this space will be through tapping into " the deep profit and user data flowing through Friend Connect . "
In other words , mining that information through advertising .
Google is being cautious about approving sites to use the new code and is creating a waiting list for requests to use Friend Connect .
It says it expects to give the go ahead to a few dozens sites in the next few days .
As to opening out to a wider audience , Google says it estimates that will happen over the coming months .
Meanwhile MySpace and Facebook anticipate rolling out their offerings over the next few weeks .

Not quite .
But close .
Addressing the United Nations on Friday , Pope Benedict XVI spoke of reducing income inequality ; of increasing international cooperation ; of respecting the law ; of having solidarity with the poor and weak ; of opposing ( unnecessary ) war ; of “ giving attention and encouragement to even the faintest sign of dialogue or desire for reconciliation ; ” of creating “ structures capable of harmonizing the day - to - day unfolding of the lives of people ; ” of the “ protection of the environment … and the climate . ”
And like Barack Obama , though many conservative Catholics are loathe to admit , the previous pope , Pope John Paul II even specifically opposed the invasion of Iraq .
In the past eight years , the Republican party has come to stand for the right of the president to torture prisoners ; for rising inequality and acceptance of corporate fraud ; for elevating the executive above the Rule of Law and the other constitutionally co-equal branches of government ; for ignoring the climate crisis ; for refusing to give aid to the poor and weak because of potential “ moral hazards ” while bailing out big corporations ; for preventive war ; for refusing to engage in dialogue with our enemies .
Pope Benedict ’s speech was a direct challenge to the worldview and policies of the Bush administration and an articulation of basic moral principles and basic responsibilities of the state .
Within these principles articulated by the pope , we can easily find the mainstream Democratic agenda , a rejection of the radical policies of George W. Bush , and more specifically , an endorsement of the school of politics that Barack Obama stands for : talking with our enemies ; avoiding unnecessary wars and violence ; respecting the Rule of Law ; reducing income inequality ; promoting access to health care ; and protecting the environment .
This is the Democratic agenda .
The Pope explained that it is the responsibility of “ every generation [ to ] engag[ e ] anew in the arduous search for the right way to order human affairs … motivated by hope . ”
I would call that a pretty good encapsulation of Obama ’s appeal – that he represents a new generation striving to find the best way to manage the world and our nation “ motivated by hope ” .
Jonah Goldberg may call it fascism ; Steve Marlsberg may call such efforts to reduce inequality and allow citizens access to basic needs Communism ; Rush Limbaugh may call efforts to focus on the real threat of Al Qaeda in the Pakistani / Afghani border “ cut-and - run . ”
But those who listened to Pope Benedict ’s address to the United Nations can see that he stands with those the so - called “ conservatives ” have labeled fascists , communists , and cowards – and the pope understood that the basic moral values he stood for are the essence of what he called “ freedom . ”

Aides to Mrs. Clinton said a transition back to Senate life was not a chief concern at the moment .
“ Senator Clinton is focused on running for president and being the nominee , ” said a spokesman , Phil Singer .
Yet even if she is once again principally the junior senator from New York , a case can be made that her campaign has strengthened her Senate hand .
She is now an even more firmly established national figure in her own right , with a defined and substantial following , one of the few in the Senate who can make that claim .
Her standing will enable her to command attention even though she might lack a clear Senate platform .
She will be sought after as a campaign resource ( and , should she choose to settle scores , can shun requests from those who did not help her ) .
“ Anyone who thinks she will return to the body in a weakened condition does not understand the nature of politics , ” said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Senator John McCain , who is proof that losing a presidential primary race is not the end and can even be the beginning .
Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , recovered from a stinging presidential primary loss in 2000 to become a Senate force by leading a bipartisan coalition able to control the balance of power on tough issues like judicial nominations .
He used his stature as a springboard back to the presidential fray .
But Mrs. Clinton ’s relatively junior status limits her options in the Senate .
She is pretty far down the ladder on her committees , denying her a chairmanship , the most potent source of influence and bargaining chips in the Senate give - and - take .
Allies have said the Senate leadership should carve out an important niche for her , but that is not easy since any position could come at the expense of a more senior member .
Top Democratic officials say the party leadership is not considering any special spot , though lawmakers would not rule out some accommodation if she sought one .
Reformers fared badly in the capital Tehran Iran 's conservatives have consolidated their victory in the country 's parliamentary elections , after taking more seats in a run-off .
Conservatives now have 69 % of all seats , reformists 16 % and independents over 14 % , the interior ministry says .
Eighty - two seats in which no candidate managed to win 25 % of the vote in last month 's first round were contested .
The first round had already given conservatives a big majority , but many are critical of President Ahmadinejad .
Many reformist candidates had been disqualified from standing in the election by the country 's non-elected Guardian Council .
Easy ride ?
If the conservatives continue to cause problems for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the new parliament , this will strengthen Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , correspondents say .
In the run up to the second round , Mr Ahmadinejad has been involved in several acrimonious exchanges with other Iranian officials .

New challenges for president Iran in facts and figures
And there has also been criticism from both reformists and conservatives about his latest cabinet reshuffle .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who is expected to run for a second term as president next year , has come under fire for pumping excessive liquidity into the economy , which has been blamed for stoking inflation .
The BBC's Pam O'Toole in Tehran says the new parliament may be more critical of Mr Ahmadinejad in the run up to the presidential elections .

The standard Plone " upgrade procedure " : / upgrade applies .
Frequently asked questions
What happened to Plone 3.1.0 ? --
Shortly after pushing out 3.1.0 , we discovered a couple of forms that were lacking authenticators for the new CSRF protection , as well as a potential startup problem on certain setups .
We decided to quickly push out an update with these fixes without officially announcing 3.1.0 to the world .
What is CSRF , and how can I protect my site ?
-- CSRF ( aka. XSRF ) stands for " Cross - Site Request Forgery " : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery, and is a class of security vulnerabilities .
For Plone 3.0 - based sites , a backport of the protection mechanism used in Plone 3.1 and later is available as " Plone Hotfix CVE-2008-0164 " :/ products/plone-hotfix/releases/CVE-2008-0164 .
If you 're running older Plone 2.x sites and are unable to upgrade - make sure to follow some simple rules , as outlined in the " security announcement for the CSRF issue " :/ about/security /advisories/cve-2008-0164 .
The CSRF vulnerability is not " remotely exploitable " as such , it requires you to do actions on sites that are sending malicious form data back to your own site .
The attack needs to be hand - crafted for each site , so this has n't been observed in the wild yet .
Still , better safe than sorry . :-)
I noticed that the Windows installer does n't use buildout yet , what gives ? --
There was n't enough time to create a buildout - based installer for Windows before Plone 3.1 shipped , so it has been postponed .
Hopefully we can give Windows users the power of buildout with Plone 3.2 .
If you want buildout on Windows right now , we suggest using Ingeniweb 's " Buildout - ready Python Installer " : http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2008/01/20/an-installer-for-a-buildout-ready-windows/ and take it from there .
On Mac OS X , we recommend installing " Xcode " : http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ and using the Unified Installer if you want a buildout - based setup .
What is buildout ?

Issue # 110 • March / April , 2008
Robert Ruark , the great American writer of the mid-Twentieth Century , was also a big game hunter .
One of his most popular books , written on the latter topic , was titled Use Enough Gun .
That has proven over the decades to be really good advice .
Single barrel / single shot shotguns like this one by New England Firearms are inexpensive and very common in backwoods homes .
Author finds 20 gauge optimum balance between recoil and shot output .
That said , there are also a lot of people who use “ too much gun . ”
One of the last century ’s top authorities on guns and hunting was Jack O’Connor , a contemporary of Ruark’s .
O’Connor was an advocate of medium - powered hunting rifles : the .30 - 06 Springfield , the 7 mm Mauser ( also known as 7X57 mm ) , and the caliber he is credited with popularizing , the .270 Winchester .
He well understood that a gun with excessive power for the task would also “ kick ” so hard that many people would n’t shoot well with it .
He wrote in 1965 in his Complete Book of Shooting , “ Men hate to admit that recoil bothers them .
Again they feel that if getting belted by some hard - kicking gun bruises them and shakes them up they are lacking in masculinity .
I have seen men who were so afraid of their magnum rifles that they closed their eyes , jerked the trigger , and could n’t hit a wash tub at 100 yards .
Yet they denied that they flinched and claimed that they were such stout fellas that they actually loved recoil . ”
O’Connor noted that too - powerful guns were a particularly bad idea for people who did n’t have a lot of size and muscle to them : kids , for instance , and females who were not athletically built .
Said O’Connor in the same book , “ Not long after we were married , my wife shot my Model 54 Winchester .270once .
She handed it back to me and announced that she would never shoot it again . ”
Mrs. O’Connor later became a noted hunter in her own right , taking big game specimens all over the world .
Her favorite hunting rifle appears to have been the milder 7 mm Mauser .
The trick is finding for each shooter the necessary balance of power and controllability .
“ Use enough gun , ” indeed .
But remember that using too much gun for the given task will quickly take you to the point of diminishing returns .
Rifles
Generations of young boys ( and girls ) have brought their first deer with the classic old .30 - 30 carbine .
As produced in the millions by Winchester ( Model ’ 94 ) and Marlin ( Model 336 ) , both are readily available with short “ youth stocks . ”
Under seven pounds in weight , they ’re less likely to physically exhaust a smaller person with a day of carrying in the woods .
Recoil is not at all bad .
20 gauge pump shotguns , both Mossberg ’s affordable Model 500 .
Left has 28 ″ barrel , 24 ″ barrel on the right .
For a flat - shooting , high velocity game rifle , it ’s hard to beat the .243 Winchester cartridge .
With a 100 grain bullet constructed for deer - size game , and delivering a velocity in the 3000 feet per second range , the .243 has adequate power for humanely transporting Bambi from field to freezer , and has extremely mild recoil .
Noted O’Connor himself , “ Today ’s .243 Winchester and ( analogous ) 6 mm Remington do very well for deer and antelope . ”
O’Connor wrote those words in 1965 , but deer and antelope anatomy have not changed appreciably in the intervening forty - plus years .
Other mild - kicking hunting rifle calibers that have proven themselves swift and humane killers of deer - size game include the .250/3000 Savage and the .257 Roberts .
However , like Mrs. O’Connor ’s 7 mm , they are not particularly popular today and you wo n’t find the wide array of good ammunition choices for them that ’s available for the super - popular .243 .
Though autoloaders , slide - action rifles , single shots , and even lever action rifles ( such as the classic Savage Model 99 and the uber - cool Winchester Model 88 ) have been produced in .243 caliber , this cartridge is predominantly found in bolt action rifles .
My personal choice would be one of the lighter specimens , such as Remington ’s Model 7 or the ultra - light Compact variation of Ruger ’s Model 77 .
These , along with the cost - effective and super - accurate Savage Models 110 and 11 , are also available with the short “ youth stocks ” for smaller statured folks .
With carefully selected , perhaps handloaded ammunition , and with equally careful marksmanship and the self - discipline to wait for the perfect firing angle , the .243 can be adequate for even larger than deer - size game .
Accomplished gun writer Mike Venturino had this to say in the October , 2007 Guns magazine about a young huntress named Morgan Wines : “ In Morgan ’s first year of hunting she bagged a pronghorn antelope buck , a whitetail buck , and not just one but two cow elk !
( The second was perfectly legal .
It was part of a depredation hunt in another part of the state . )
That would give bragging rights to a big brawny , hairy - chested macho man , but this hunting was done by a 90 pound , 12 - year - old girl wielding a Savage Model 11 Youth Model .243 . ”
Shotguns
Historically , the .410 shotgun has been a common “ starter gun ” for shooters , especially younger ones .
It is the smallest and lightest “ gauge ” available .
However , many of us think it ’s too small .
Interchangeable choke tubes , seen here at muzzle of 20 gauge shotgun , give more versatility .
These little shells just do n’t hold enough lead to always get the job done .
Personally , I see the .410 as a close - range squirrel and rabbit gun .
Noted the great Frank C. Barnes in his authoritative text Cartridges of the World , the rifled slug load in the .410 is “ not adequate for deer , ” though he believed it would get business done with a coyote or bobcat .
On the other end of the spectrum is the 12 gauge , by far the most popular backwoods home shotgun .
The reason for that popularity is its versatility : the big two and three quarter inch 12 - gauge shell holds an ounce to an ounce and a quarter of lead , and that ’s just in its standard loading , before you get into the Magnum options .
A bigger spread of birdshot gives you a better chance of cleanly killing game birds ; a bigger spread of buckshot is more devastating in the anti-personnel context ; and a bigger chunk of lead ( weighing 400 to 500 grains , at 1400 to 1600 feet per second ) is more decisive on deer and close - range bear .
However , the 12 gauge is also infamous for its recoil with anything but a light trap or skeet load .
Many a lad has been knocked on his butt firing his first 12 gauge .
In an adult lifetime of teaching police , I ’ve met a lot of macho man cops who were scared to death of the 12 gauge “ riot gun ’s ” kick , and a couple of female officers who were crippled for life by it through shoulder damage sustained from the constant hammering of intensive training fire .
A full load 12 gauge in a light pump gun kicks about like a .375 Magnum elephant rifle .
No shotgun is simpler to unload than this NEF single barrel , available in several gauges .
To split the difference , I think the best bet for a light - kicking but hard - hitting shotgun is the 20 gauge .
You can virtually duplicate 12 - gauge performance with some three - inch Magnum 20 gauge shells , but for most needs , the standard two and three - quarter inch 20 gauge shell will get the job done .
In a standard rifled slug load for deer , the 20 gauge ’s projectile is approximately .62 caliber , weighs five - eighths of an ounce , and runs at a speed of 1400 foot - seconds or greater .
That ’s roughly the equivalent of two .44 Magnums at once .
Will it transform Bambi swiftly into venison ?
Oh , yes .
In a buckshot load , the standard for 20 gauge is # 3 buck , which consists of twenty pellets , each a quarter inch in diameter .
Among common 12 - gauge shells , the closest would be the so called “ urban police load , ” # 4 buck .
This consists of 27 pellets , each .23 caliber .
Velocity is roughly the same , whether twelve or twenty gauge .
For home defense purposes , let ’s say two evil twin men are kicking down the front door , announcing their intent to murder every man , woman , and child in the house .
Spouse A fires a round of 12 - gauge # 4 buckshot and sends 27 .23 ” diameter pellets into the chest of the first evil twin .
Spouse B unleashes a single round of 20 gauge # 3 buckshot , blasting 20 .25 ″ diameter pellets at approximately the same velocity into the thorax of the second evil twin , with all the projectiles penetrating to approximately the same depth .
Who ’s going to know the difference ?
Only the medical examiner , and then only after he meticulously counts the white spots on the X - rays , or tallies the number of pellets removed from each corpse .
Author pops a shell into a .410 single barrel .
He considers that round too underpowered to be useful for much .
Birdshot ?
Only in long range waterfowl hunting does the 20 gauge seem to really give away much to the bigger 12 , and then it is largely because non-lead pellets required for lo , these many years to keep lead out of the wetlands are not very efficient penetrators .
This means that with , say , steel shot , reduced momentum and reduced penetration need to be made up for with more pellets striking the bird .
For upland game such as pheasant or partridge , or for hunting small game such as wild rabbits for the family stewpot , shotgun authority Francis E. Sell proved in the 1950s that the 20 gauge loses precious little compared to the 12 gauge , and there is the three - inch Magnum 20 gauge shell available for those who want a bit more punch .
Lighter and much faster to handle than most 12 - bores , the 20 improves wing - shooting skill for a great many people .
My significant other , a tough little critter who stands barely five feet tall , refuses to shoot my 12 gauges anymore , but is hell on wheels with her Remington 1100 Youth Model 20 gauge semiautomatic .
If the user (s ) can benefit from a lighter , easier - to - carry gun that kicks less , the 20 gauge makes huge sense .
In similar size shotguns , its recoil will be barely over half that of the 12 gauge .
The 20 is available in all action types : semiautomatic and pump , side by side double barrel or over and under , and low - price bolt actions and single shots .
Handguns
Here , choice depends more on purpose than anything else .
A hunting handgun intended for deer - size game wants to be either a large caliber such as a . 44 Special or .45 Colt , or a fast - moving Magnum such as a .357 , minimum .
It is generally accepted that the 9 mm Luger cartridge in a semi-automatic pistol or the .38 Special cartridge in a revolver is about the minimum for defense against feral human beings , while both are on the light side for humanely , ethically harvesting deer - size animals .
I ’ve owned , shot , and enjoyed such monster guns as the Smith & Wesson .500 Magnum and .460 , and still love to shoot my J.D. Jones custom built .375 JDJ single shot , created from a Thompson / Center pistol .
About three shots from the latter will give me my monthly recoil requirement , however , and a handgun with the potency of a high - powered rifle is not something I need every day .
In defensive handguns , medium calibers will suffice with the right ammo and good hits .
There are 60 timed ‘ combat match ’ shots on each of these targets .
Left , former Midwest Regional Champion ( Stock Service Pistol ) Dave Maglio with Glock 9 mm ; right , former Midwest Regional Champion ( Stock Service Revolver ) Mas Ayoob with S&W .38 Special .
If attack by a maddened steer or an angry horse is part of the handgun ’s mission profile , you do indeed want a “ horse pistol , ” and I ’d choose a powerful sidearm with a deep - driving bullet .
Not for nothing did cowboys , who risked exactly this situation every day , always prefer large caliber guns .
A compact .44 Magnum revolver would serve well here , or as a daily carry gun for anyone whose homestead was in large bear country .
For the backwoods person who does not have these particular threats , and keeps a handgun for protection against feral dogs or feral humans , the 9 mm or .38 Special can be adequate , and their famously light recoil makes them easy for smaller folks to shoot , or folks who are new to the gun and just a little bit intimidated by the whole thing .
Anything distinctly smaller such as the .380 Auto pistol caliber , which is literally a “ 9 mm Short ” too often fails to make the cut .
I ’ve run across shooting after shooting where the defender shot a violent aggressor with a .380 and did little to immediately stop his depredations .
A good hollow point load in 9 mm or .38 Special will , historically , end lethal assaults more quickly .
Frankly , another good choice is the all - American .45 automatic .
It has been a famous “ man-stopper ” in world wars and domestic gunfights alike , and with deep - penetrating 230 grain full metal jacket ammunition , can penetrate deeply enough to drop large animals .
A friend of mine in Africa , game ranger Phil Honeyborne , carried a Colt .45 automatic loaded with nine rounds of “ hardball ” ammo because it was the best medicine he could come up with to cure surprise lion or leopard attacks when he was caught without his rifle .
With proper training , little kids and the most petite females can be taught to handle the recoil of the semi-automatic .45 caliber pistol .
. 22s
The .22 is the ubiquitous rural home working gun .
At close range under controlled conditions ( i.e. , a securely tethered or closely confined animal ) it can be used to begin the slaughter process on cattle and large hogs .
It is when the critter breaks loose , and a perfect brain shot
Today ’s premium ammunition makes the mild - kicking .243 Winchester a more useful ‘ deer and down ’ rifle than ever .
can no longer be guaranteed , that it becomes altogether too feeble for the task .
While poachers have been known to kill jacklighted deer with .22s , and the occasional desperate Inuit has been known to slay the largest of bears with a .22 bullet placed with perfect precision , no person who was both sane and gun-savvy would recommend the .22 for anything much bigger than a fox .
The .22 is at its best on rabbits and squirrels , and of course , on the shooting range .
One of Savage Arms ’ most popular firearms over the decades has been the Model 24 .
This “ combination gun ” was extremely handy , because its top barrel was chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge and its bottom barrel for the .410 shotgun shell .
However , this was a low - powered combination .
The concept became much more useful when Savage started chambering the top barrel for the .30 - 30 Winchester rifle cartridge , and the bottom barrel for the 20 gauge shotgun shell .
The cheapest firearm to shoot with factory ammunition , with mild muzzle blast and almost non-existent recoil , the .22 is one of our “ funnest ” guns and , for many things , among the most useful .
However , it is sadly lacking in power when any aggressive living thing of any substantial size has to be neutralized by gunfire .
The bottom line
This is why the typical rural family who ’ve lived that life for a while will have a .22 , and a shotgun , and a rifle chambered for a caliber powerful enough for deer - size game at a minimum .
This is why when outdoor sports magazines do surveys on the hunters who read their periodicals , they learn that their average reader owns around seven firearms .
It is why serious hunters own more than that : one tailors the tool to the task , and the person who hunts different kinds of game in different settings will need that many more of those tools .
If you have to choose one “ deer rifle ” and one shotgun , you can do very well with a .243 and a 20 gauge , and with a 9 mm pistol or .38 Special revolver for personal defense , for that matter .
Someone may say to you , “ Why do n’t you use something more powerful ? ”
If that happens , it ’s perfectly correct for you to smile just the least bit smugly and answer , “ Everything in moderation . ”

Call me a conspiracy theorist .
But when Donald Rumsfeld spoke , in late 2006 , to the pentagon propagandists the NY Times recently exposed , he , in opining the loss of both houses of congress to the Democrats , suggested that “ the US could benefit from another terrorist attack , ” Jason Linkin of the Huffington post reports .
“ As documented by Newsvine , it all went down at a valedictory luncheon Rumsfeld hosted for those analysts on December 12 , 2006 .
Many of the " message force multipliers " named in the original New York Times piece were in attendance , including David L. Grange , Donald W. Sheppard , James Marks , Rick Francona , Wayne Downing , and Robert H. Scales , Jr. They were treated to an extraordinary conversation ( Newsvine has highlights , the hour - long clip of which can be found here ) with Rumsfeld , that included many jaw - dropping moments , such as Rumsfeld admitting that in Iraq , the U.S. " ca n’t lose militarily , but …ca n’t win by military means alone , " an agreement that Iraq could use a Syngman Rhee - type dictator ( because that ’s what democracy smells like ! ) , and a lengthy passage where Rumsfeld jokingly offers a bottle of champagne to anyone who could kill Moqtada al Sadr .
You sure do n’t see too many people joking on al Sadr these days !
“ But by far the most extraordinary part of this luncheon is the antipathy the gathered members exhibit toward the American people for having the temerity to vote the Democrats back into power .
When Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong bemoans the lack of " sympathetic ears " on Capitol Hill , Rumsfeld offers that the American people lack " the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats . "
What ’s to be done ?
According to Rumsfeld , " The correction for that , I suppose , is [ another ] attack . "
Now this is just factual information .
Why do I start this article by saying , “ call me a conspiracy theorist ? ”
Because this slips too easily off Rumsfeld ’s reptilian tongue .
Too easily because perhaps it ’s not at all a new idea .
Perhaps it is an idea that , for him , for all the propagandist sell - out generals , this is not new , that is actually , already tried and true .
One of the oft cited premises of the 9/1 Truth movement is that the attack on the towers was the pearl harbor - like event that the neocons anticipated would be necessary to move the US to embrace the aggressive militaristic tactics manifested in Iraq .
Here , we have Rumsfeld casually joking about it — not a smoking gun , but , perhaps , a clear “ tell ” in poker parlance , indicating ready ability to think in these terms .
The hour - long audio clip was found as part of a data dump done by the pentagon , in response the NY Times Freedom of Information Act request .
The Huffingtonpost article reports ,
" Less than a week ago , the Department of Defense did a document dump on their program to use retired military analysts as surrogates on network and cable news to pimp the administration line on the Iraq War – something we now know they did on at least 4,500 occasions .
Over at TalkingPoints Memo , a thread has been opened for those who want to sift through the material and highlight key discoveries .
" So far , dedicated TPM readers have unearthed a number of noteworthy finds , of which this audio recording of this luncheon is perhaps the most astounding . "
My guess is that this document dump might be a rich source of hard date for those interested in pursuing 9/11 truth .

Note :
This guide has fewer step - by - step instructions .
Supercannon II is a more advanced water gun .
Building Supercannon
II usually requires some sort of previous experience with PVC , so I 'll assume my readers are familiar with PVC .
If you are not , please read some of the tutorials in my air pressure homemade water gun guide to learn a thing or two .
I do not explain everything in detail here and if this is your first attempt , you will miss important details about cutting / preparing PVC pipe , solvent welding , and safety in the APH guide .
Supercannon II is not intended to be shot at people or used in water wars .
Unless your friends want to be shot with something with power equivalent to a small fire truck , do n't use Supercannon II in a water war at full pressure with the full sized nozzle .
Even if you build Supercannon II properly such that it has no risk of bursting , you still have the risk of the stream causing damage to someone or some property in some way .
Large streams can cause blindness and internal bruising .
Supercannon II is not meant to be shot at people ever .
If you choose to ignore this warning , you do so at your own risk .
Supercannon II is the most powerful homemade water gun made yet .
It boasts unparalleled range and water output on the same scale as a fire hose .
Supercannon II performs nearly exactly like a fire hose .
Supercannon II was designed to improve upon the original Supercannon , which did not work very well .
The main difference between the two is the Supercannon II uses a piston , while the original Supercannon used a tube that went to the bottom of a PVC chamber .
The piston or tube were necessary because the air always floats on top of the water , so to fire a water gun at an angle without either solution , only compressed air would shoot from the gun .
The original Supercannon had leaks and unusual problems with getting the water out the tube , so that idea was scrapped in favor of a piston design .
Shot images
My brother and I took some photos of Supercannon II shooting .
Performance statistics
Effective range @ 100 PSI : 73 feet *
Last drop range : not measured because it does n't matter
Effective range with 5 % glycerin @ 95 PSI : 78 feet
Water output @ 100 PSI ( fire hose nozzle ) : 135X
Water output @ 60 PSI ( no nozzle ) : 542 - 812X
* I only measure the range until the end of the puddle .
Most other people use last drop , which is misleading because the last drop can't soak anyone and often is 5 or more feet ahead of the puddle .
That is my " effective range " measurement .
The range is only useful for the part that will deposit major amounts of water ... not 10 mL 5 feet ahead of that .
Comparatively , Supercannon II blows every other water gun out of the water .
Supercannon II compares most closely to a fire hose .
A fire hose has water output of 4.0 L/s approximately , which converts to 133X .
Compare a fire hose 's 133X to Supercannon II 's 135 Xâ € ” the figures are identical !
Supercannon II is a fire hose .
Performance on graphs
I realize a lot of people new to water guns might read the statistics and think " That 's cool , but I do n't know what 's good . "
In the graphs below I compare the performance of Supercannon II against other popular water guns .
You can see the difference in performance very clearly .
The graph above shows Supercannon II 's range compared against the range of other water guns .
You can easily see that it is over twice as far as most water guns , and 20 feet more than the most powerful manufactured one , the CPS 2000 .
What is more startling however is the output graph .
Note that the scale above is logarithmic , that is , each notch means 10 times as much as the last notch .
If we did the scale with normal axises , simply put , you would n't be able to see the competition .
Supercannon II performs at about 10 times as much flow as the APH , and 20 times as much flow as the CPS 2000 .
A linear - axis graph follows .
Materials
The list below is approximately what I used .
You can and I do suggest making changes based upon what is available to you and what you prefer .
1 1/2 inch NPT female threaded PVC ball valve
3 1 1/2 inch NPT male threaded adapters
teflon tape
2 1/4 inch 4 inch long bolts
2 1/4 inch washers
2 1/4 inch nuts
1/2 inch PVC pipe
3/4 inch PVC pipe
1 1/2 inch PVC pipe
4 inch PVC pipe ( pressure rated )
1 1/2 inch fire hose nozzle ( McMaster - Carr part number 6424T62 )
2 Buna -N piston cups ( McMaster - Carr part number 9411K28 )
1/2 inch PVC check valve
Male air coupler
2 female 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch male threaded bushing
1/4 inch NPT air pressure gauge
1/2 threaded coupling
1/2 inch PVC ball valve
2 1/2 inch male threaded adapter
2 1/2 inch tees
1/2 inch threaded female to 1 1/2 inch male bushing
2 1 1/2 inch female to 3 inch male bushings
2 3 inch female to 4 inch female reducers
1/2 inch bolt about 3 inches long
2 1/2 inch metal fender washers
2 1/2 inch rubber fender washers
2 1/2 inch washers
1/2 inch spacer
1/2 inch nut
Vaseline ( petroleum jelly )
Loctite
The tools this water gun requires are a drill ( either a hand drill or drill press will be adequate ) , a 1/ 4 inch drill bit , a hacksaw , an air compressor , a wrench , and preferably a clamp .
Construction
The first part of Supercannon II I constructed was the valve assembly .
Brass valves are easier to open , but , they are far more expensive and heavy .
I choose a plastic ball valve that would be hard to turn if I did n't add a torque arm .
The torque arm makes the valve extremely easy to turn while saving some money .
To construct the torque arm , cut a length of 3/ 4 inch pipe as long as you want the torque arm .
Get the 1/4 inch nuts , washers , and bolts and the valve itself .
Drill a hole about in the center of one of the sides of the ball valve 's current handle .
Drill another hole near the end of the PVC pipe in the center .
Put the bolt through the two drilled holes and use the washer and nut on the other end to put it on more permanently .
This procedure allows you to make aligned holes very easily .
Now , drill straight though both the PVC pipe and the ball valve 's handle like you were doing both at the same time .
Look at the image above if you are confused .
After drilling the holes , put the bolt , washer , and nut on to finish the handle .
Tighten the nuts on pretty good , but not good enough to break the ball valve 's existing handle .
To further quicken valve opening , you also can lubricate the valve with some spray silicon lubricant .
Close the valve , spray the lubricant on the ball part , spread it , and open and close the valve in rapid succession to spread the lubricant over the parts of the valve .
Wipe off excess lubricant .
The image above shows all of the non-piston parts of Supercannon II except for the pressure gauge and the bushing used to attach it .
Compared against other water guns , Supercannon II is remarkably simple in concept , involving no pump and no water reservoir .
The 4 inch PVC pipe was cut about 4 feet long .
Think about how much water you want in your water tank .
With a 1:1 water to air ratio , approximately half the volume of the pipe is water .
Using the volume of a cylinder , you can convert accurately the volume in cubic inches to liters by dividing by 61 .
4 feet gives you about 4.9 liters of water , and 5 feet gives you about 6.2 liters .
The back end of the gun is the part that fills the gun with air .
The back end features a check valve with an air coupler to attach to an air compressor .
The check valve lets air in one way , but not out the other way , which is what you want in a design like this .
The ball valve is necessary to vent compressed air from the back of the water gun .
Venting the air is necessary after shots because the piston needs to be moved to its original position .
The air vent release is very loud , so I would suggest adding an air muffler like McMaster - Carr part 4450K4 .
The air muffler releases the air a little more slowly over a larger area , reducing the noise .
The front end of the gun contains the firing valve , the fire hose nozzle , and some PVC parts connecting them .
The three 1 1/2 inch male threaded adapters all go in this part .
It is possible to use a 1 1 / 2 inch pipe nipple instead of two of these threaded adapters to connect the ball valve to the nozzle , but I did not do that .
The parts above all make the piston .
There are two Buna - N piston cups , two metal fender washers , two rubber fender washers , two washers , one bolt , one nut , and one slightly larger nut I used as a spacer .
Larger nuts can be used as spacers , but they also make dedicated nylon spaces that would work better .
The images below will show how the piston is constructed .
Note that the image on the right is deceiving due to barrel distortion .
The pistons themselves are straight — the lens makes them appear bent .
The finished pistons will be connected in the following order like the image above :
bolt metal fender washer rubber fender washer Buna - N piston cup washer spacer washer Buna - N piston cup rubber fender washer metal fender washer nut
Note the orientation of the piston cups , with them pointing away from each other .
Also note that the nut should be put on with Loctite , which I will discuss more below .
In retrospect , I would suggest epoxying the head of the bolt to the metal fender washer to prevent a small potential leak through the piston at higher pressures .
I have noticed a tiny bit of water that can be poured our of the air vent valve after many shots , but that may also be the result of the humidity and the compression of the air .
Nonetheless , epoxying the bolt to the washer will not do any harm , so I suggest it .
Inserting the piston into the pipe can not be done with the piston constructed as is in the images above .
It must be installed in parts .
The two images show how the piston should be arranged before inserting it into the pipe .
Using a popsicle stick , apply Vaseline or whatever other lubricant you have to the perimeter of the seal .
Be sure to check that your lubricant is compatible with the Buna - N rubber in the piston cups .
Put the piston on top of the pipe and push it in slowly .
This might be a little difficult because the seal is meant to be tight , so I used an improvised piece of PVC and a rubber mallet to get the piston into the pipe .
The seal is inside of the pipe .
Note the excess vaseline on the perimeter of the pipe .
Wipe that off .
Later you should clean the entire pipe with dish soap to break up any lubricant on the pipe that may interfere with the PVC cement and primer .
Push the pipe to the other end with a stick ( a piece of PVC pipe works ) and flip the 4 inch pipe over .
The piston is now there , but upside down .
Put the washer on top of the other washer and the spacer .
Lubricate the perimeter of the piston cup and insert it into the chamber like you did previously .
Also lubricate the pipe itself above the piston already in there .
Look at the background of the left image to see how .
Wipe off excess vaseline .
Get the hold in the center to align with the bolt so the bolt goes through it .
That might take a little messy work with your hands in the pipe , but it is necessary .
Afterward , put the rubber fender washer , the metal fender washer , and the nut on the bolt and tighten the nut on .
You will have to hold the piston still as you use the wrench to tighten the nut .
Use Loctite to ensure the nut does not move during the life of the water gun ( read the package to see how ) .
The piston is installed .
Wash off the entire pipe with water and dish soap to remove any vaseline on the pipe .
Wait for the pipe to dry completely before solvent welding all of the parts together .
The image above is Supercannon II completed .
Filling the water gun
Due to the very simple design , filling this water gun is very different than filling other water guns .
To fill , open all valves on the gun .
Remove the fire hose nozzle .
Get a ramrod ( I used a long piece of 1 inch PVC pipe ) and push the piston down to what location you want it in .
I measured and put markings on my ramrod to know when to stop pushing .
Close the vent valve on the back .
Pour water down the open firing valve until the water is up to the threaded nozzle .
Close the firing valve .
Connect the air coupling to an air compressor , and pressurize the water gun .
When the desired pressure is met , disconnect the coupling .
The gun is now pressurized and can be fired at will .
Adding an air muffler
While an air muffler is not required for a water gun in the style of Supercannon II , you might want one to reduce the noise made when the air vent is used .
The air vent is very loud — about 105 dBs .
An air muffler reduces the noise level to less than 70 dBs , likely lower .
I bought McMaster - Carr part number 4450K4 , which reduced noise level by more than it reported it would , so I was very pleased .
To install an air muffler , apply teflon tape and thread it onto the ball valve you use to exhaust the excess air .
The image above shows my filling assembly about a year and a half after completing Supercannon II .
I designed the assembly to be upgradeable , mainly to be able to attach regulated air output to it , but that never happened .
I broke off one of the pieces of plastic pipe , so I replaced everything with metal pipe .
This wo n't break now .
You can see the air muffler on the end of the ball valve .
Photos of the completed water gun
A closeup of the nozzle .
You can see how big the nozzle is here .
It 's 1/2 inches in diameter .
I did not experiment with other nozzle sizes , but I would imagine that a different nozzle size could improve this water gun 's range further .
The only thing that would need to be done would be drilling this nozzle larger .
These three images of Supercannon II show how long it is .
When making this guide , I was having trouble finding pictures that would n't be obscenely long , so I simply combined them into one image .
Supercannon II is over 5 feet long .

It shows the pressure gauge , air vent valve , and filling assembly .
Photos and videos of the water gun in action
Water gunning at its best .
At the time , I did n't have any higher resolution pictures .
Check out our gallery for higher quality shot images .
This frame from the video of the shot shows definitively that the gun could shoot past 70 feet .
The gun also could shoot drops of water past 75 feet , but that range was not measured and it can not be determined by this photo because the shadow of the tree obscures the last drops .
Above is a photo of Supercannon II about a year and a half after it was built before I did a bunch of tests with it .

OTTAWA 
The largest leveraged buyout in history skirted a potentially crushing blow on Friday .
The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in favor of Bell Canada and its purchasers late Friday , saying that the deal can proceed .
While the ruling ends a challenge from bondholders , the $ 52 billion buyout still faces uncertainty over its financing and , more broadly , questions about the value of the company .
In a move that almost no one foresaw , an appeals court in Quebec , Bell ’s home province , refused last month to approve the sale to a group led by the Ontario Teachers ’ Pension Plan and its partners , including Providence Equity Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners .
The deal was structured under a Canadian system that requires both shareholder and court approval .
The appeals court , however , refused to back the deal after finding that the company had not fairly considered the interests of current bondholders .
By adding about $ 34 billion debt to Bell , the buyout would depress the value of the company ’s current debentures .
The decision surprised most corporate law specialists in Canada who generally assume that , as in the United States , directors must consider only the needs of shareholders when making decisions about takeovers .

The test GPs use to diagnose depression is worse than useless , according to new research .
Under the latest government guidelines , doctors are paid extra to ask patients two simple questions .
Your answers are supposed to show if you are depressed or not .
But , a study has found that 62 per cent of patients diagnosed as depressed were n't in fact depressed at all .
As a result , doctors and psychiatrists could be seriously over - estimating the number of people who are depressed - and prescribing drugs to thousands who are healthy , says the study 's author , Dr Alex Mitchell , a consultant psychiatrist at Leicester General Hospital .
Under current guidelines , with mild to moderate depression are meant to be offered talking therapies - psychological treatments which help people change their attitudes or behaviour patterns .
Research by the mental health charity SANE has found that only and studies have found they can two per cent of patients were having cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) and more than 80 per cent of patients were being treated with medication .
Anti-depressants come with a range of side - effects .
About 25 per cent of patients have problems when they try to stop taking them and studies have found they can cause a rise in suicidal thoughts and actions .
Patients also report a loss of libido .
Two recent studies have linked the drugs with a drop in bone density leading to osteoporosis and a dramatic fall in the number of sperm a man can produce .
Given all this , you would expect those two questions , approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) in 2004 , to be exacting .
In fact they are absurdly simplistic and , worryingly , if you answer yes to both you could be put on Prozac .
The two questions are :
• During the past month have you been bothered by feeling down , depressed or hopeless ?
• During the past month have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things ?
The GPs ' two - question test is n't the only one the experts have got badly wrong .
Dr Mitchell 's other shocking discovery is that the latest guidelines to detect post-natal depression ( PND ) are even more inaccurate , but in the opposite direction .
A new three - question test fails to spot an astonishing 80 per cent of the women who actually are depressed .
" It uses the same two questions as for regular depression and then adds a third : " Do you want help ? "
This reduces the accuracy of the test to just 17 per cent , " explains Dr Mitchell .
NICE is now in discussion with Dr Mitchell about the PND test .
According to the doctors ' newspaper Pulse , many GPs are dropping the depression test because they do n't believe it is good for patient care , even though they will lose income as a result .
It 's mainly aimed at high risk patients , such as those with heart disease or diabetes .
Many GPs say they do n't have the time for longer , more accurate testing - the reason for introducing the shorter test in the first place .
The useless tests also threaten to make a nonsense of a new government initiative to make CBT available to many online .
Last year , a group of charities , including the Mental Health Foundation and Mind , called for a " large sustained cash injection to improve psychological treatments ' .
They said CBT was as effective as drugs and that more than half of GPs believed it was the best option .
The internet scheme , unveiled by Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt last month , has been designed to meet criticism that , even though CBT is recognised as the best treatment for depression , waiting times can be more than a year because the health service needs 10,000 more therapists .
If you rate as depressed on the flawed test , you get eight onehour interactive computer sessions on a program called Beating The Blues with homework projects and GP progress reports - much cheaper than training 10,000 therapists .
The aim , said Ms Hewitt , was to allow patients to access the right sort of therapy " instead of just being prescribed medication " .
One doctor who has been using the system in Swindon , Wiltshire , for three years was enthusiastic .
Dr Peter Crouch said : " It has significantly helped patients cope with anxiety , insomnia and stress . "
But , of course , how useful it is depends on how accurately people are diagnosed .
Indeed , what is the point of rolling out a programme that will be offered to hundreds who do n't need it - or if it is n't provided to those who do ?
Soon many will be spending hours at their keyboard doing CBT exercises for no reason .
The ' good ' news is that computers and the internet are likely to be much more widely used to spot who needs help - and at least these seem more accurate than the two - question test .
A recent report by researchers in Taiwan reported that an online questionnaire filled in by more than 500 people identified 38 per cent as depressed and 46 per cent as not .
When they were tested by a psychiatrist , 75 per cent of the diagnoses were correct .
Soon patients may be asked to fill in longer questionnaires of this sort , while they are in the waiting room .
And if it is done on a computer the doctor could then have the results during the session .
For the moment , what can you do to increase your chances of getting the right sort of help ?
Dr Mitchell 's research into how GPs diagnose depression also provides some useful tips .
" Doctors tend to be influenced by how patients describe their problems , " he says .
" If you talk about physical symptoms - how tired you are , how you can't sleep - your doctor will usually suspect a physical cause even though those are also signs of depression .
" Be clear about your main symptom .
So if feeling down or low is what 's really making your life miserable , talk about that . "
How can you avoid being labelled as depressed when you are n't ?
Do what may seem like common sense and explain your problems .
What the test ignores is that sometimes people have a very good reason to feel low : you 've been sacked , for example .
A recent U.S. study has found that as many as a quarter of people currently labelled as depressed are reacting perfectly normally to stressful events .
It suggested that even psychiatrists regularly miss the broad picture .

( James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own )
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Europe is next in line to feel the impact from tighter credit , a tough situation for an economy heavily dependent on bank financing .
The European Central Bank ’s April bank lending officer survey showed a continuing sharp tightening in lending standards combined with a weakening in demand for loans .
The survey showed that loans to businesses , consumers and house buyers all became harder to get and more expensive in the second quarter of the year .
And future expectations point to further tightening .
Why ?
Banks are worried about the prospects for the European economy , its housing market , their banking clients and the industries those clients compete in .
Yet even as banks are making their excuses to clients and declining to lend , those same clients are backing out of the door , smiling tightly and politely declining to apply for loans in the first place .
Demand for loans in the euro area is deteriorating at the most rapid pace in the survey ’s five - year history , according to the ECB , due to less interest in fixed investment or in mergers and acquisitions .
That could lead you to conclude that Europe is experiencing a normal slowdown but not a credit crunch .
However , while the euro zone has thus far been spared the worst of the impact of the global credit difficulties , there is reason to believe that is more a matter of timing than immunity .
“ If the economy is slowing down and you get a supply - driven credit squeeze on top , then you might face a more significant and more prolonged downturn in economic growth , ” said Marco Annunziata , head of global economics at Unicredit in London .
“ In Europe this is a significant risk . ”
Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 15 percent in the year to March 2008 , a healthy clip by anyone ’s standards .
But , to put it bluntly , much of that lending has been involuntary .
With the capital markets largely shut , especially for riskier borrowers , many European companies have doubtless drawn down on their existing lines of credit .
Those loans , many of which have 364 - day maturities , were entered into before the credit storm , and when it comes to refinance , those corporations will find less money available , at a higher costs and with stricter standards as to who is fit to borrow .
Remember , too , that for the banks this forced growth in their outstanding loan book has been painful .
Many of the margins charged on these old loans are now uneconomic for banks , and they are under pressure to rebuild their balance sheets rather than lend more .
According to Julian Callow , economist at Barclays Capital , the changes in loan officer sentiment in the equivalent and much older U.S. survey tend to lead actual changes in lending by about a year and a half .
So expect Europe ’s lenders to cut back on lending as soon as they get the chance .
AN ECONOMY DEPENDENT ON ITS BANKS
Europe ’s economy still depends in large part on bank lending .
In the euro zone , bank credit accounts for about 85 percent of corporate financing -- compared with less than half in the United States -- with securities issuance taking up the rest .
That has put Europe ’s corporations , if not its banks , in better shape in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the shadow banking system of loan securitization .
But Europe arguably will be doing some catching up , credit crunch - wise , as its banks get the opportunity to call in loans and start the much needed process of charging more and being choosier .
So what will the impact of tighter credit be on Europe ?
Since the ECB lending survey is only a bit over five years old , there is not a lot of experience to go on .
However , the U.S. version , the Federal Reserve ’s Senior Loan Officer survey , has been around a lot longer , since 1990 in its current form .
A 2002 study by Cara Lown and Donald Morgan of the New York Federal Reserve here found the survey was a good leading indicator for the economy overall .
Besides being a leading indicator for lending itself , tightening standards in the U.S. survey were found to “ matter a lot ” for economic growth .
It is very reasonable to expect that this relationship will hold in Europe , if not be stronger , given corporate Europe ’s tight relationship to their banks .
Look for the impact to develop over the coming few months , especially in the last quarter of the year , as banks are finally able to begin deleveraging by tightening up on loans coming due .
Look too for the impact to allow the ECB to strike a more dovish tone on interest rates .

Car of the Future
PBS Airdate : April 22 , 2008
NARRATOR : Eight hundred million cars .
If you put them bumper to bumper , they 'd circle the Earth about 100 times .
That 's how many cars are on the road today .
They come in all shapes and colors , but have one thing in common .
DAVID L. GREENE ( Oak Ridge National Laboratory ) :
Our transportation system is almost entirely fueled by petroleum , more than 95 percent .
A quarter of all the petroleum ever consumed in the history of the world was consumed in the last 10 years .
So we 're consuming it at an accelerating rate .
JOHN B. HEYWOOD ( Sloan Automotive Laboratory , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) :
What is scary is that projections suggest that by 2050 there 'll be two billion vehicles , two and a half times as many as there are today .
NARRATOR : Many experts agree there 's an energy shortage and soaring gas prices looming in the future , not to mention , melting ice caps from global warming and national security threats from dependence on foreign oil .
TOM MAGLIOZZI ( Automobile Mechanic / Co-Host , Car Talk ) :
Can I change the station ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI ( Automobile Mechanic / Co-Host , Car Talk ) :
No , you can't .
This is important stuff .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : This is scaring me .
I do n't like it any more .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , come on .
Do n't be such a sissy .
NARRATOR : Two brothers have embarked on a quest .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Where are we ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I do n't know .
We 're not in Kansas any more , I can tell you that .
NARRATOR : They want to find out what 's being done right now that will keep our cars moving in the future .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Stand back !
NARRATOR : They 're testing new technology and alternative fuels , and they 're getting behind the wheels of vehicles that might take us down a new and different road .
Join Click and Clack , the guys from Car Talk , on their search for the Car of the Future , right now on NOVA .
DOUG BERMAN ( Producer , Car Talk ) :
Okay , let 's go .
Stand by .
Ready ?
Open them up .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Hello , and welcome to Car Talk , from National Public Radio with us , Click and Clack , the Tappet Brothers .
Are you ready to take a call ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : I 'm ready .
NARRATOR : For 30 years , Tom and Ray Magliozzi have helped radio listeners solve their automotive problems .
CAR TALK CALLER : I have a Ford Ranger pickup , and I love the truck , but I hate the gas mileage it gets .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Well , see , if you drove less you 'd like it better .
NARRATOR : Today , Click and Clack have a car problem of their own .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I do n't think so , man .
It 's not going to start .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Come on , it 'll start .
NARRATOR : Tom 's beloved roadster , a ' 52 MG , is back in the shop .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , it sounds like a sick cow .
No , you know , this car 's done for .
It really is time to move on and look for another vehicle .
This is n't going to do it nymore .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Well , what could be better than this ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Almost anything .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : But where would I find another car ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Take a wild guess .
NARRATOR : To replace a relic from the past , Tom and Ray head for Detroit , searching for the car of the future .
Each year in the Motor City , carmakers shop their latest models in what must be the world 's largest showroom .
It 's a sideshow Vegas would envy .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Pretty damn spectacular show .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Sure is .
Let 's go find your dream car .
Let 's go find the car of the future , or maybe the car of your future .
I thought you were interested in these models .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : I am .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I meant the cars .
How many horsepower is this thing , guys ?
You must know , right ?
CAR SHOW ATTENDEE :
What is this , 5 ...?
CAR SHOW SALESPERSON : Yeah , 500 .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : A mere 500 .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Looks like my MG .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , right !
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Not the MG engine , the whole MG !
RAY MAGLIOZZI : This is an absurd amount of horsepower to have in anything , I would think .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Ridiculous .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : But ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Absolutely ridiculous and stupid .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : But people want to buy them ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : They 're whackos !
NARRATOR : To lure buyers , cars and trucks have become bigger and more powerful every year .
Since 1985 , average vehicle weight has increased 1,000 pounds .
Horsepower has almost doubled .
JOSEPH B. WHITE ( Wall Street Journal ) :
If you look anywhere in the world , not just the United States , you look anywhere in the world , people will buy the most horsepower they can afford .
There 's something kind of primal and elemental about having a powerful machine at your beck and call and at your command .
The car companies know this ; they 're selling emotion .
If we just needed an appliance to get from A to B , we 'd all be driving around in Toyota Corollas .
NARRATOR : As weight and horsepower increase , cars are consuming more gasoline than ever before , despite its growing cost .
Even a former Texas oilman seems to get it .
GEORGE W. BUSH ( President of the United States , 2003 ) :
For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil , and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists .
AMORY B. LOVINS ( Rocky Mountain Institute ) :
Think about where your money goes when you put your credit card in the pump .
Some of your oil money is going directly to arm people who are trying to kill us .
NARRATOR : Burning oil is also changing the chemistry of the atmosphere .
AMORY LOVINS : Coming out of your tailpipe are all those carbon dioxide molecules .
Those go up in the air .
They 'll stay there for about a hundred years , messing up the climate .
NARRATOR : Increased carbon emissions are creating climate changes that scientists warn us are dangerous .
DAVID GREENE :
We 're going to have to find other sources of energy to power the transportation system .
And we 're going to have to make it more energy - efficient at the same time .
NARRATOR : The Alt . Wheels Festival , in Boston , is a different kind of car show that celebrates alternative energy and efficient transportation .
If the Detroit car show is about primal thrills , Alt .
Wheels is about social responsibility and concern for future .
Like the green movement itself , Alt .
Wheels is small , but bursting with enthusiasm about every conceivable technology that might curb our dependence on oil , including , perhaps , Tom 's dream car .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : I love it !
RAY MAGLIOZZI : This is right up your alley .
I can tell , as soon as I saw this , that this is the kind of vehicle ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , that 's me , man .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : ... that you would love .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : What makes it run ?
ALT WHEELS EXHIBITOR : The motor scooter .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's got a gas , it 's got a gasoline engine that 's running , yeah ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Oh , it 's got a gasoline engine .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So , the only alternative about this is that it 's dangerous .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Where 's the accelerator ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : This is the accelerator .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Is there a reverse ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : No . Stop !
NARRATOR : Creating the car of the future is no small feat .
Whatever their environmental benefit , we expect our cars to be reliable , practical and safe .
The car of the future also needs to store a lot of energy in a small space .
And nothing does this better than petroleum , which comes from plants and tiny plankton , like these , that were buried in mud millions of years ago .
Over time , these ancient fossils were transformed into energy - rich molecules of hydrogen and carbon , or hydrocarbons , that are refined into gasoline .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : And you 're getting a hundred miles a gallon ?
It does n't seem like quite enough to justify the danger .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : This is the kind of car you want to leave to your first wife .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : How you doing ?
BOB , FORD REPRESENTATIVE : Hi , guys .
NARRATOR : Car companies have great hopes that hydrogen will someday replace carbon and power cars that are emissions free .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So you fill up the tank .
The tank must be in the back .
BOB , FORD REPRESENTATIVE : Yeah .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Right .
One tank ?
BOB , FORD REPRESENTATIVE :
One tank .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Can we see it ?
NARRATOR : These companies have invested billions to produce small fleets of prototypes like this one .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Now , if you 've got a very narrow suitcase here , you 're in good shape .
BOB , FORD REPRESENTATIVE :
You 're in good shape , right .
NARRATOR : But until more hydrogen cars are on the road , it 'll be hard to find places to fill the tank .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : But they 're not going to start investing in making the fuel available unless they have a commitment from Ford and the other companies that they 're going to ....
It 's a chicken and the egg kind of thing .
I mean , you have to start building the cars and ...
BOB , FORD REPRESENTATIVE : Exactly , you 've got to get those chickens out there before the , before the eggs , so the ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : So the chickens are first ?
This is a time honored question .
This is an age old question you 're about to answer here .
NARRATOR : This chicken and egg question has no clear answer .
History shows that cars and gasoline evolved together over many , many years .
BETH LOWERY ( General Motors , Vice President , Environment and Energy ) :
There 's about 170,000 gas stations in the country now , so we have a very established infrastructure of internal combustion engine that everybody knows and loves in their vehicles today .
And they go to the local gas station and they fill up their gas tank .
And that 's a system we know .
JOSEPH ROMM ( Center for Energy and Climate Solutions ) :
We have a fueling infrastructure of gasoline that was built over the course of many decades .
And it has been paid off a long time ago , and it is delivering gasoline very cheaply .
So to deliver an alternative fuel other than gasoline is no mean feat .
NARRATOR : Changing an economy based on petroleum is an almost insurmountable task .
But a small island nation is hoping to do to do just that .
Iceland has a thousand times fewer people and cars than the U.S. Still , rush hour in Reykjavik is no joke .
In a country where gas costs almost eight dollars a gallon , Iceland 's dream is to stop importing oil by replacing conventional cars with hydrogen vehicles , if and when they come to market .
In the meantime , a small fleet of buses has been warming the population to the new technology .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : This is a nice bus , but it 's a bus .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yes , it is the bus .
Yeah , it 's just a bus .
Oh , yeah .
No , there 's nothing different about it except that it's a fuel cell bus , which is pretty interesting .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , but it sounds the same .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : No smell , though ; have you noticed that ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : No smell .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : No smell , which is very nice , especially in the city .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : There 's a little smell , but I think that 's you .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : When we go back to the station , can we see you refuel the bus ?
REYKJEVIK BUS DRIVER : Yes .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Is there a brick wall we can stand behind ?
REYKJEVIK BUS DRIVER : If you dare .
NARRATOR : Like gasoline , hydrogen is volatile stuff .
Remember the Hindenburg ?
That disaster almost ruined hydrogen 's reputation for good .
But at the world 's first public hydrogen fueling station , it 's stored safely in pressurized tanks .
Let 's hope so anyway .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Wait , I want to get a look at this .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Okay .
Go ahead .
We 're not afraid .
REYKJEVIK BUS DRIVER : Really ?
You look like chickens .
NARRATOR : Pressurized hydrogen is pumped into storage tanks on the roof of the bus , where it 's combined with oxygen in layers of thin membranes called fuel cells .
Hydrogen atoms are broken apart , releasing electrons that flow through a circuit , providing electricity that propels the bus .
The only emission is water vapor .
DAVID GREENE :
There 's been a lot of progress in the technology , but hydrogen vehicles are not anywhere near ready for the market yet .
They 're too expensive , the fuel cells are not durable enough , and , of course , we have problems with how do you store sufficient amount of hydrogen on board the vehicle .
NARRATOR : Iceland prides itself on helping to improve this technology by testing it every day .
JíN BJíRN SKíLASON ( Icelandic New Energy Ltd. ) :
You go to a small society like Iceland where a lot of things are simpler than a big society like the U.S. or Europe , you can actually test things out here .
That 's actually how we think we can help the world .
NARRATOR : While vehicles are tested in Reykjavik , the fueling infrastructure is being developed in the countryside .
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe , but does n't exist in pure form .
It 's made by splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen , and that takes energy .
Iceland gets this energy from water that flows from melting glaciers and from steam that rises from the ground .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Where are we ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I do n't know .
We 're not in Kansas any more , I can tell you that .
But there 's steam coming up out of the ground .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : This is so weird .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : How do I look ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : You look marvelous .
This is something .
NARRATOR : Iceland itself was created by volcanoes erupting from a crack between two plates on the Earth 's surface .
Power plants harness this geothermal energy to generate electricity that can be used to make hydrogen .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Why is Iceland engaged in this geothermal power project , so to speak ?
ALBERT ALBERTSSON ( Svartsengi Power Plant ) :
You know , geothermal and hydro is Iceland 's oil , actually .
And , you know , Iceland is straddling two tectonic plates , the North American plate and the Eurasian plate .
And gentlemen , we are just in the middle of the two plates .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Move over a couple of feet .
You might be sitting in a bad spot .
ALBERT ALBERTSSON :
There is enough renewable energy sources in Iceland to produce all the hydrogen this nation needs .
NARRATOR : Someday Iceland may harness volcanoes to power cars , but the transition to hydrogen could take 50 years .
JíN BJíRN SKíLASON : A 50 - year timeframe is not a long timeframe , actually .
When you talk about a full energy paradigm shift in 50 years , that means a lot , a lot of changes for society .
NARRATOR : New technology does not spring full - grown from the womb .
And it 's too soon to tell if and when hydrogen transportation will come of age .
But Iceland 's efforts may bring us closer to the answer .
DAVID GREENE :
They have vast amounts of renewable energy available to them and a very small population .
There 's no way , today , we can do what they 're doing .
But we will learn from their experience .
We 're going to gain from this effort that they 're making .
NARRATOR : The future of hydrogen may be shaped here , but for automakers , its greatest potential lies in larger countries where transportation systems are not yet developed .
In China , bicycles are vanishing quickly .
Experts predict that in two decades China will have the same number of cars as the U.S. and gas stations are racing to keep up .
BETH LOWERY : In China , we do n't have a gas station on every corner .
And we 're looking at opportunities for fuel cells and hydrogen infrastructure in economies , such as China , where you 're not taking over an entire infrastructure and trying to start all over again .
NARRATOR : But for developed nations like the U.S. , is there some alternative to gasoline that does n't involve reinventing the wheel ?
It could be ethanol , or E85 .
Like gasoline it's a hydrocarbon , but government studies show it produces 25 percent less greenhouse emissions .
Ethanol is made from corn sugar .
If Iceland has volcanoes , we 've got cornfields , which can be harvested year after year .
In Brazil , ethanol produced from sugar cane now provides 40 percent of the nation 's motor fuel .
CHEVROLET COMMERCIAL :
What if cars and trucks could be fueled by corn ?
NARRATOR : Flex fuel vehicles that can burn ethanol and gasoline do n't cost much more than conventional cars .
So that 's all the good news .
Now the bad news :
JOSEPH ROMM : It 's not that great for the environment .
It 's , it 's very energy - intensive to grow corn and extract energy from it .
NARRATOR : Fossil fuels are used to make fertilizer and pesticides to help corn grow and are also needed to ferment corn sugar .
Some critics claim it takes more energy to make ethanol than you get out of it , while others caution that we can never grow enough corn to meet demands .
DAVID GREENE :
There 's simply not enough of it , and we need a lot of it for food .
So that 's not going to be the solution , but it 's going to be part of the solution , I think .
NARRATOR : Still , ethanol does have great potential .
LEE R. LYND ( Mascoma Corporation ) :
There 's really not much question , this is a good motor fuel .
The question is , how inexpensively can we make it , and how much of it can we make ?
NARRATOR : For 20 years , Lee Lynd has been trying to answer these questions .
And , like many , he believes the solution involves something else besides corn .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Do n't go down here .
It 's dangerous down there .
It 's this way .
Pay attention , will you ?
Lee .
Hey , how are you ?
LEE R. LYND : Great .
How are you ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Hey , did you bring the corn ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Well , of course I brought the corn .
LEE R. LYND : You guys are armed and dangerous .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Look , we 're down to about a quarter of a tank .
Will this be enough to get us home ?
If not , we have a couple of cans of Jolly Green Giant Niblets out there , too .
Maybe we can ...
LEE R. LYND : We 're looking at making ethanol , and we 're looking at making it from a different part of the plant .
So the actual corn ethanol comes from the seeds , same stuff we would eat , same stuff we 'd feed the cattle .
And there 's a lot of the rest of the corn plant , and there 's also a lot of other kinds of plants that can be grown .
And what we 're interested in is called cellulosic biomass , not a household word , perhaps .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yet .
LEE R. LYND : Not yet , thank you .
And so ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : But right now , what we use is the kernel .
LEE R. LYND : Is the kernel , right there , yep .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Those guys .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Now what 's the difference between cellulosic biomass and the kernels here ?
LEE R. LYND : Good question .
This is cellulosic biomass , the cob , in here , is cellulosic biomass , and the whole stalk that held this up ...
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So everything that is n't the niblets is cellulosic biomass .
LEE R. LYND : There you go , exactly .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's the stuff that we would ordinarily throw away .
NARRATOR : Cellulosic biomass is the woody structure that props up the plant .
It 's found in waste products like wood chips , paper sludge , wheat straw and corn stalks , as well as switchgrass , a native plant that grows without fertilizer and pesticides .
Like all plants , switchgrass pulls carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to grow .
When the grass becomes ethanol that 's burned under the hood , the carbon dioxide is released back into the air and reabsorbed by the next crop of grass .
If cellulosic ethanol can be manufactured without burning fossil fuel , net carbon emissions are , essentially , zero .
LEE R. LYND : This is nothing but ground - up corn stalks right here .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , it is ?
LEE R. LYND : This stuff is less expensive , very cost - effective raw material .
So you might say , " Well , why are n't we doing this already ? "
Answer ?
Converting this stuff , the cellulosic biomass , into ethanol , is more difficult than converting ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Ah .
LEE R. LYND : This stuff .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So how do you make it ?
Can you take us to the lab and show us ?
LEE R. LYND : I 'd love to .
Come on in .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : You 're not going to kill us afterwards , are you ?
I 'm afraid if we learn too much it might be dangerous .
LEE R. LYND : So , the question is , " How do we do this ? "
And it starts off with microorganisms , very small living things that you can only see with a microscope .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : What 's the big thing ?
It looks like Tom 's car .
LEE R. LYND : That is a lump of cellulose .
And you 'll notice that attached to it there are the same sort of black rods .
Those are bacteria that are adhered to the cellulose .
In fact , there are some more of them on that little particle there .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : They 're doing a job on him .
LEE R. LYND : Yeah , they 're kind of ganging up on that little ...
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , yeah , he 's in trouble .
NARRATOR : These microbes are tearing cellulose apart , releasing sugar compounds locked within .
In fermentation tanks , another microbial species turns that sugar into ethanol .
Lynd 's goal is to combine genetic material from the two species into a single microbe that can make ethanol from cellulose in one efficient step .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Why is that turning two steps into one step such a big deal ?
I mean , what effect will it have overall on the costs of what we 're doing ?
LEE R. LYND : This would be revolutionary , from an economic point of view , if you could get this into one rapid , efficient step .
And we think we can prove this in a few years , and other people are assuming this is decades away .
And time will tell if we 're right .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Thanks a lot , Lee .
Hey , sounds great .
LEE R. LYND : Thanks for all the questions and all the interest .
I really appreciate it .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Great , thanks so much .
Bye - bye .
LEE R. LYND : Oh , hey .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh .
We 're going to need these I think .
It 's a long ride home .
Good bye .
It 's a good thing there are smart guys like Lee working on this stuff .
If they had to depend on you and me , it 'd take centuries .
NARRATOR : Advocates argue that we have the land to grow enough biomass to replace at least a quarter of the gas we now consume with cellulosic ethanol .
They also believe it could replace gasoline altogether , if cars were more efficient .
Surprisingly , today 's cars are n't very efficient .
In fact , less than one percent of the energy in the tank actually moves the driver .
Ninety percent is lost between the tank and the wheels , and the rest is used to push the mass of the vehicle .
At the Sloan Automotive Lab at M.I.T. , John Heywood and his students are on a mission to save energy by improving engine performance .
For more than a century , gasoline engines have powered cars by turning chemical energy into mechanical work .
Vaporized gasoline enters the combustion chamber ; a piston compresses the vapor until it 's ignited by a spark , creating pressure that forces the piston downward ; the spent gas is vented as exhaust .
Working together , pistons turn the crankshaft that sends power to the wheels .
JOHN HEYWOOD : People say , " The internal combustion engine , it 's old technology .
Why do n't we replace it ? "
It 's going to take a really long time to change to something else , even if we got something else there , developed and ready .
And we do n't yet .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Hey , John .
Hi.
Long time no see .
NARRATOR : Lured by smell of engine fumes , Tom and Ray return to the lab where they once spent time as M.I.T. students .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Well , you know , the last time I was here , I was with a classmate and Professor Keck , and I blew the cylinder head off an engine .
I hope they wo n't hold that against me .
JOHN HEYWOOD : Some of those things still happen .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I 'm sure they do .
You folks have been working for a while on improving engines , and this is what you do here .
And we want to know what you 're doing , what the future holds , where the frontier is .
Enlighten us , please .
We need all the help we can get .
JOHN HEYWOOD : Okay .
Well , we 're trying to help move the technology forward .
Some things we do n't understand very well .
You know that .
This is where we 're working on engine lubrication and friction .
NARRATOR : One of the ways Heywood is improving engines is by reducing friction .
Almost half the energy in the combustion chamber is lost to friction , as pistons rub against the walls of the cylinder .
Using a laser to observe the process , Heywood tests different lubricants and piston geometries to find small ways to save energy .
MIT LAB WORKER : Anywhere you see white , like here , is oil .
JOHN HEYWOOD :
And what we want is where the rings are , it 's dark , you want a little oil to lubricate the rings , keep friction low , but just enough .
If it 's too much , it 'll go into the cylinder and we 'll lose some oil .
So that 's what we 're learning about .
And it really feeds back into designing all of this better and improving fuel consumption .
NARRATOR : Over several decades , automotive engineers at Sloan and other labs around the world have increased engine efficiency by 30 percent .
JOHN HEYWOOD : Engines and transmissions have got steadily more efficient , year by year by year by year by year .
So it 's better technology .
Then the question is : " What do we do with these more powerful and more efficient engines ? "
We 've put them into increasing vehicle performance so our vehicles accelerate faster , more aggressively , and we 've put them into larger vehicles , heavier vehicles .
We 're better off because these vehicles are more efficient .
Had they not been more efficient , we'd be even worse off .
But we have n't gained .
We 've sort of stood still .
JOSEPH ROMM : Technology , by itself , does not increase fuel economy .
The role of technology is to enable smart regulations , is to enable reductions in oil consumption and greenhouse gases through federal action , not in place of federal action .
NARRATOR : History shows regulation does increase fuel economy .
After the 1973 oil shortage , Congress created mileage standards , forcing automakers to build more efficient vehicles .
By 1987 , average mileage had increased dramatically .
But that caused oil prices to fall , which in turn led to public indifference .
JOSEPH ROMM : In the 1970s to early 1980s , we doubled the fuel economy of cars .
And then starting in the mid-80s , we stopped .
NARRATOR : Mileage standards remained unchanged from 1985 to 2007 , and truck and S.U.V. sales almost doubled .
Because these vehicles have lower standards than cars , average fuel economy today is actually a bit less than it was 20 years ago , despite hard - won gains in engine efficiency .
Many people buy heavy , inefficient vehicles because they feel safer .
Amory Lovins is a champion of a revolutionary approach to making cars that are efficient and safe .
AMORY LOVINS : I 'm a recovering experimental physicist .
And I 'd been thinking about the physics of cars and why are they so inefficient that you know , your car 's using a hundred times its weight in ancient plants every day , and yet only 0.3 percent of that energy ends up moving the driver .
This did n't seem very good .
NARRATOR : In 1982 , Lovins founded the Rocky Mountain Institute , a Colorado think tank .
Among the 50 fulltime staff are a handful of automotive engineers who have helped Lovins rethink the physics of the car .
MIKE , AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER :
One would argue , if you had half the car , you would need half the battery and half the motor to push it around .
AMORY LOVINS : And half the money to pay for it .
MIKE , AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER :
And half the money to pay for it , exactly .
NARRATOR : Lovins realized that cars could be more efficient if he could find ways to make the engine move less weight .
AMORY LOVINS :
We started digging into how to make the car lighter , with better aerodynamics , with lower rolling resistance .
We ended up concluding it was quite straightforward to triple the efficiency of a car , at roughly the same cost .
NARRATOR : Lovins 's group replaced the conventional auto body with 14 light - weight components that lock together to form a reinforced shell with half the weight of steel .
From the tapered roofline to the smooth underbody , every surface is streamlined to reduce drag .
AMORY LOVINS :
If you directly save a pound in a car , then you actually save more like a pound and a half , from needing less engine to accelerate it , less brake to stop it , less suspension to hold it up and so on .
NARRATOR : The " Hypercar " reduces weight without reducing size , by making parts from tiny carbon fibers that are heated with nylon to form a composite stronger than steel .
The wings and much of the fuselage of Boeing 's new 787 Dreamliner are made with carbon composites , which will save 20 percent in fuel .
Race cars are also made with carbon composites .
After hitting a wall at 160 miles an hour , the driver in this car walked away .
NEWS REPORTER : How are you feeling ?
KATHERINE LEGGE , DRIVER : A bit shaken , but I 'm okay , as you can see .
Oops , sorry .
All my bits are intact , so it 's good .
Goes to show how strong the cars are .
AMORY LOVINS : With such light but strong materials , you can make cars that are big , which is protective and comfortable , without also making them heavy , which is hostile and inefficient .
Therefore you can save oil and lives and , indeed , money , all at the same time .
NARRATOR : Today the Hypercar is still just an idea embodied by this one - of - a- kind prototype sitting in the corner of Lovins 's shop .
Carmakers have spent a hundred years perfecting ways to mass - produce cars from steel , and Lovins has failed to convince them to make a radical change in materials .
Carbon fiber is expensive , and molding it into parts is labor - intensive .
Undaunted , Lovins is now developing machinery that can mass produce parts at an affordable price .
Drawn by curiosity and skepticism , Ray has come to the Rockies , leaving Tom in bed with a cold .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , my brother did n't want to come out here .
I knew it .
Too cold .
He saw the weather forecast , figured he 'd call in sick .
He had that phony little sniffle .
Hah .
Hey , Amory .
AMORY LOVINS : Ray .
Hey , welcome .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Thanks for inviting me .
AMORY LOVINS : Oh , my pleasure .
We 've got such cool stuff to show you .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Jeez , I 'm really impressed because I thought this was going to be like a carnival car , you know , some little tiny little thing that you 'd have to get shoehorned into .
This is a real car .
AMORY LOVINS :
This will carry five modern - size adults in comfort ...
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Super - sized adults .
AMORY LOVINS : ... and up to 69 cubic feet of cargo .
In fact , we figured this could cruise on the highway at 55 miles an hour on the same power to the wheels that today 's SUVs use on a hot day to run the air conditioner .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Really ?
That 'd be pretty neat .
AMORY LOVINS :
This is the most complex and heavily loaded part of this car .
It 's the whole side assembly .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , it 's where the doors would go .
AMORY LOVINS : Yeah , exactly right .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , sure .
AMORY LOVINS : Yeah , and I 'll bet you can lift that with one hand .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : You think ?
AMORY LOVINS : Yeah .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I do n't know .
I 'm a weakling .
Oh , it 's pretty light .
AMORY LOVINS : Yeah .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's a few pounds , it's ...
AMORY LOVINS : Is n't that amazing ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , it is amazing .
AMORY LOVINS : Which means any part , any of the 14 body parts can be lifted by one worker with no hoist , so you do n't need jigs and robots and welders .
It just snaps together and you glue it .
Then it 's stronger than the original material .
So you just got rid of the body shop .
That 's why this is so revolutionary for manufacturing .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Neat .
Well , I did bring a piece of test equipment from my lab .
Can I use it ?
AMORY LOVINS :
You wicked fellow !
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Stand back !
Uncle !
AMORY LOVINS : It 's strong .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's strong .
But jeez , and you know , there are a couple of tiny little scuffs , and then nothing got telegraphed to the back .
The back is completely unscathed .
NARRATOR : The case for carbon fiber is very strong .
But until costs are reduced , ultra - light cars will not be on the sales lot any time soon .
For those who want efficient cars now , one answer is to buy a hybrid .
The Prius was the first commercial success , and now other companies are getting in the act .
A hybrid is a gas - powered car that also has an electric motor and a battery pack .
When the car idles , it uses electricity instead of wasting gas and spewing fumes .
The gas engine is used at speeds when it 's most efficient , and it charges the batteries at the same time .
Batteries are also charged through braking wheels when the car slows to a stop .
The result is a car that gets the same pickup as a regular car but burns less gas .
Because hybrids have batteries and a motor , it takes a bit more energy to manufacture them , but over their entire lifespan , hybrids still consume 30 percent less energy and produce 30 percent less carbon than non-hybrids of the same size .
But hybrids still burn gas .
At his shop at U.C. Davis , Andy Frank is changing that .
Andy and his students are building a hybrid that can charge its batteries through a wall socket .
This connects the car to the electric grid so it can get energy from distant power plants .
Andy is the inventor of the plug - in hybrid , and for 20 years he 's been developing and improving his concept .
Compared to standard hybrids , the plug - in has more batteries and a larger motor but needs less space for the engine and the gas tank .
Like many ,
Andy hopes this evolutionary design will cause an energy revolution .
ANDREW FRANK ( University of California , Davis ) :
This kind of a car can transition us off of oil and onto electricity .
DAVID GREENE :
It 's a major change , in that , now , you can get electricity from the grid .
You can take it from your home .
You can take it from almost anywhere .
So this is a huge difference , in terms of the energy source for transportation .
NARRATOR : With an overnight charge , the batteries hold enough juice to go 60 miles , more than the average daily commute .
And for longer trips , it 's got an engine that extends its range to 600 miles .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : If , when we stop at Motel 5 , for example , we plug the thing in overnight ...
ANDY FRANK : That 's right .
We borrow a little energy from Motel 5 .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : They wo n't even notice a 50 - foot — I love it — a 50 - foot extension cord .
ANDY FRANK : Well , or you would be a long ways and they 'd be ...
RAY MAGLIOZZI : You want your room on the second floor ?
No , no , we 'd prefer to be on the first floor .
ANDY FRANK : Got to be on the first floor .
But that 's the whole point .
Whatever available 110 - volt socket is all you need to charge this car .
NARRATOR : Skeptics say that all plug-ins do is shift the pollution source from the tailpipe to the smokestack , but studies show that powering cars with electricity from today 's mix of power plants could reduce greenhouse emissions by about 40 percent .
Further reductions are possible if electric power gets cleaner .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Even if you have to build power plants , you 're not using any gasoline .
ANDY FRANK : That 's right .
That 's the whole point .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : The whole point .
ANDY FRANK :
You 're shifting off of gasoline onto an electric society , and that , once you walk into the electric society window , you open the door to the possibility of direct renewable energy .
Electricity can be generated in a lot of different forms .
And in particular , it can be generated with solar cells on top of your roof , it could be generated from wind .
In other words , today 's sunshine would give you tomorrow 's driving .
And you put that energy ... store it in the batteries .
I think one of the things that this kind of car motivates is the possibility of personal wind and personal solar .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : My brother 's been responsible for a lot of personal wind .
ANDY FRANK : So now we 're cruising on electricity alone .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's great !
It 's great .
And people do n't care as long as it does what they want it to do .
TERRENCE WILLIAMS ( Ph.D. Candidate , University of California , Davis ) :
But you know what it does do that 's better than your car ?
It 's faster .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's faster , yeah , yeah .
And it gets better mileage ?
TERRENCE WILLIAMS : That 's correct .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : And it does n't pollute as much ?
TERRENCE WILLIAMS :
That 's right .
ANDY FRANK :
The most important thing is the ability to use a renewable energy directly from the sun .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Right .
And if I can ever get my home nuclear reactor kit to start working , I 've got it made .
NARRATOR : It costs four times less to power Frank 's plug - in from the grid than it does to run it on gasoline .
But if plug-ins become the car of the future , will there be enough electricity to keep them all running ?
DAVID GREENE : Our existing electric utility system could handle tens of millions of plug - in hybrid vehicles if they would be recharged during off - peak times , such as at night .
NARRATOR : With today 's batteries , plug-ins can only go so far on electricity , but Frank believes they 're a viable step toward more efficient transportation .
ANDY FRANK : I 'm hoping that the car companies really get serious and start building these things , because the sooner they get it out in the hands of the public , the sooner we can begin to transition ourselves off of oil .
NARRATOR : Martin Eberhard is convinced that cars can be powered by batteries alone .
He 's the founder of Tesla Motors , and his electric sports car is built to prove electrons are a hands - down winner over gasoline .
MARTIN EBERHARD ( Founder , Tesla Motors ) :
A gasoline engine is terribly inefficient .
It 's below 20 percent efficient , typically .
But an electric car like ours is , you know , in the neighborhood of 85 percent efficient .
It 's that kind of difference .
So it would be like 135 miles to the gallon equivalent : big difference in a car that does zero to 60 in four seconds .
NARRATOR : The Tesla Roadster can go 250 miles on a single charge .
But it takes a lot of batteries to go even that far , and they come at a price .
MARTIN EBERHARD : The Tesla Roadster costs $ 92,000 , right now .
You can buy options and spend more if you like .
The great big hairy goal we have is to create the next great American car company .
It 's insane , right ?
We are up against some big guys out there .
NARRATOR : The first 600 roadsters are being handmade overseas .
At Tesla headquarters in Silicon Valley , engineers are refining hardware and software for the next , more affordable model .
MARTIN EBERHARD : A lot of the complexity that you find in a typical car has moved out of mechanical things and into electrical things and software .
NARRATOR : The mechanics of the Tesla are stunningly simple .
The electronics module is the brain that controls the battery pack , which accounts for at about a third the cost of the vehicle and powers a 75 - pound motor that drives the rear wheels .
MARTIN EBERHARD :
If you look in our motor , there 's one moving part .
And that drives a very , very simple transmission .
But to make that motor do its thing requires a fairly large box of fairly sophisticated silicon and a lot of software behind it to make it do what it needs to do .
So a large amount of the drive train development was pretty natural to do right here in Silicon Valley .
NARRATOR : The power supply is filled with lithium ion batteries that have revolutionized portable computers and electronics .
MARTIN EBERHARD :
Well , first of all , lithium ion batteries are just the best battery technology today .
Lithium is readily available and fully recyclable .
The significant advantage of lithium ion is it's not a heavy metal , so , in the handling process , you do n't have a health hazard .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's already broken .
They have it on the lift .
MARTIN EBERHARD : Practically the first thing they put in this building was the lift .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : You know , we have the same lifts in our shop , except ours are all covered with grease .
Where 's the grease , Martin ?
Where is the grease ?
This is a grease - free shop .
MARTIN EBERHARD :
So this is all carbon fiber body , and even the structure behind , you can see , is carbon fiber .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So this is the battery pack , and it 's got little batteries in it ?
MARTIN EBERHARD : Yeah , quite a few little batteries .
I might have one here , hold on .
There you go , yeah .
Like that .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Just like that .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : And how many of these are in there ?
MARTIN EBERHARD : Six thousand eight - hundred and thirty - one , approximately .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : How do you write that number ?
Could n't you round it off to seven thousand ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I do n't mean to throw a wet blanket on the whole issue here , but I know there was some talk about some laptops that were catching fire and ...
MARTIN EBERHARD : Yep .
We were actually quite concerned about what would happen if one of these batteries were to catch fire , early on .
And we set about designing the battery packs so that if one battery catches fire , it does n't set the neighbors on fire .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : What is it about lithium ions that makes them so special and makes them so different from other batteries ?
MARTIN EBERHARD : Energy density — how much energy can fit into a small package .
Lithium ion batteries are about four times the energy density of previous car batteries .
And that 's a phenomenal difference .
That 's like a four - times bigger gas tank .
So , that 's where the driving range comes from .
It comes at a price , today , but I think that the driving range is one of the most important things to make electric cars become acceptable .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : I 'm in .
Put your seatbelt on .
Say your prayers .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : You do n't mind if I do n't look ?
NARRATOR : Perhaps foolishly , Martin lets his multimillion dollar baby out of sight without a chaperone .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : See you !
MARTIN EBERHARD : First time driving ?
NARRATOR : Tom 's next car might be a two - seater with no tailpipe , if he 's got the money .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : We could be in Mexico in about two hours with this car .
NARRATOR : Pushing the envelope of technology always brings a cost .
But if alternative vehicles are going to curb our oil addiction , they must be sold not by the hundreds but by the millions , at a competitive price .
This is a challenge for large automakers , but to meet it , they must make big changes in what they sell .
JOSEPH WHITE :
The question is whether the car companies can shift from selling horsepower and start selling high fuel economy .
We 're starting to see that .
CHEVROLET VOLT COMMERCIAL : Ladies and gentlemen , the 2007 Chevrolet Volt concept .
NARRATOR : Meet the Chevy Volt , a hot new contender in the green car sweepstakes , a car that 's designed for a world without oil .
ROBERT A. LUTZ ( Global Product Development , General Motors ) :
So if your daily driving , whether to work or running errands or recreational use , is 40 miles a day or less , and you charge the vehicle every night when you get home , you will never need to buy gasoline during the entire life of the vehicle .
NARRATOR : Under the hood of the Chevy Volt is an electric motor that can be powered in several different ways .
Lithium ion batteries charged from the grid give it a driving range of 40 miles .
Batteries can also be charged by a generator that burns ethanol or gasoline , extending the range another 600 miles .
The motor can also be powered by hydrogen fuel cells .
The Volt is a prototype built to promote the idea that affordable , practical cars can be powered from diverse energy sources .
But it 's not for sale yet .
The problem is batteries are not included .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So tell us , when 's this going to happen ?
Or is it going to happen ?
JOSEPH WHITE : Both are good questions .
I think General Motors would seriously like for a car like this to happen .
The question is ...
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Well , of course .
JOSEPH WHITE :
The question is they do n't have the battery technology yet to make it work .
And , because they do n't have the battery technology , this is , essentially , an imaginary car .
It 's a very nice imaginary car , but it 's an imaginary car .
NARRATOR : How long the Volt will remain an imaginary car is unclear .
GM says batteries must get cheaper , safer and more reliable before the Volt becomes a reality .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : If you can tell us without killing us , when can we expect this car ?
ANTHONY POSAWATZ ( Vehicle Line Director , General Motors ) :
We will be ready when that battery is ready , there 's no question in my mind .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So , five to seven years ?
ANTHONY POSAWATZ : But , most importantly , when General Motors brings a product out like the Chevrolet Volt , it has to be a product that the battery will last 10 years , that 'll be safe for the customers , and will meet all their needs .
They do n't want any compromises .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Alright , Tony , tell us .
When is it coming out ?
JOSEPH ROMM : I think General Motors should be taken seriously .
I think that if they build it , people will buy it , plus , the competition — Toyota , Honda — will introduce plug - in hybrids , I have no doubt .
So I think that there is much more reason to be optimistic now than in a very long time .
NARRATOR : G.M. hopes to start producing the Volt by the end of the decade , but today it stands alone in a sea of beefy trucks and high - powered road machines .
Will cars like the Volt ever replace them ?
Tom and Ray are n't so sure .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : It 's right next to the Ford Mustang with 550 horsepower .
BETH LOWERY : Yes .
And the Camaro convertible .
Is n't that great ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Yeah .
BETH LOWERY : America is all about choice .
If you want a Camaro , buy a Camaro .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : But if we 're about hugging trees ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : With 500 horsepower ?
Who the hell needs 500 horsepower ?
BETH LOWERY : Obviously not you .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Why do you make such sh-t ?
I mean it 's ridiculous !
BETH LOWERY : You mean these popular vehicles that are on the floor ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Yeah , these popular vehicles .
Five hundred horsepower ... jeez !
BETH LOWERY :
It creates a little excitement , does n't it ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : You 're good , Beth .
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Thanks a million .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Thanks for your time .
BETH LOWERY : Thanks .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Sorry for giving you a hard time .
BETH LOWERY : That 's okay .
I 'm used to it .
NARRATOR : After a century of making cars fueled by gasoline , how quickly can carmakers change their course ?
ANDY FRANK : We 've got to get alternative vehicles into our society as quickly as possible .
Because when shortages start to occur , we will have economic disruption like you cannot believe .
JOSEPH ROMM : We can't wait .
We have to reduce our emissions starting in the next few years .
If we do n't we 're going to find it virtually impossible to avoid catastrophic warming .
NARRATOR : But is there too much at stake to be left in the hands of carmakers and consumers ?
DAVID GREENE :
We 're not able to rely on individual decisions in the marketplace to solve the problem of climate change , to solve the problem of oil - dependence .
It takes collective action .
It takes government action .
JOSEPH WHITE :
It 's asking a lot of the auto industry to force the change all on its own .
It 's not really their job .
BETH LOWERY : If we decide we really want to reduce dependence on petroleum as a society , then we have to have the collective will to do so .
And that includes making sure we have the right government policies in place , that we have the right vehicles in place , the right fuels , and the customers understand that that 's really a priority .
NARRATOR : But will customers buy these new kinds of cars if carmakers build them ?
How willing are we to embrace change in something so fundamental to our lives ?
AMORY LOVINS : Ultimately , as citizens and as consumers , we 're responsible for the world we create .
If we do n't like the way it 's turning out , let 's change it .
JOHN HEYWOOD : Individual choices and actions matter .
They really do .
And it all adds up .
NARRATOR : If we do embrace change , future generations may look back fondly on today 's cars as dinosaurs from a bygone era , relics from the age of oil .
DAVID GREENE :
This is an achievable goal .
It 'll take time .
We can't do it tomorrow .
We can't do it even in five years .
But every year that we work on it , the situation will get better .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : So let me know , are you ready to move on and get something new ?
I mean , are you ...
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Well , I 've seen a lot of very interesting technology , and I know what I want .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Really , what 's that ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : I want you to turn that into a plug - in hybrid .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Really ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Yeah .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Oh , let me see , we 'll throw in some fuel cells , maybe .
We 'll throw some carbon fiber panels on it .
Let 's get out of here , will you ?
Ethanol tank , fuel cells , so what else do you want ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : That 'll do .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : When do you want it ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : How about tomorrow ?
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Sure .
Five o'clock ?
TOM MAGLIOZZI : Five o'clock is fine .
RAY MAGLIOZZI : Works for me .
