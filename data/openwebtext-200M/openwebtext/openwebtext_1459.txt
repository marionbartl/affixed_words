Today 's LCD TVs may be a lot better than sets from a few years ago , but there 's plenty of room for improvement
Today 's LCD TVs may be a lot better than sets from a few years ago , but there 's plenty of room for improvement .
At DisplaySearch's U.S. Flat Panel Display conference yesterday , component makers talked about new equipment , glass , and films all designed to make flat - panel displays better and less expensive .
Charles Annis , vice president of manufacturing research for DisplaySearch , said that a year ago there was a huge drop in profitability among the panel makers because they invested so much in new capacity , but were then hit with the recession .
But this year , based on growing demand , particularly in China , the industry has seen a significant recovery .
According to Annis , strong demand is projected for the next few years , and panel makers are reacting by building new fabrication plants .
On the technology front , he said , there 's a lot of work being done on " high transmission " manufacturing .
This allows for higher contrast ratio ( related to the move towards LED backlighting ) , new color filter technology to improve color reproduction , and technology that will enable easier manufacturing of 240Hz .
Annis said that LED backlighting in TVs is expected to grow from 3 percent of the market in 2009 to 20 percent this year ; by 2016 , essentially all LCD TVs will use LED backlights .
He noted that there had been a glass shortage for part of 2009 , but it has improved this year .
Annis also noted that while Sharp now has a Gen 10 factories , and others are expected to follow , most of the investment is in Gen 8 and Gen 6 factories .
Bruce Berkoff , chief marketing officer for displays at Applied Materials , predicts much higher growth in the display industry than the DisplaySearch analysts , driven by new applications from tablets to larger TVs .
There has been a 20 - times cost reduction per area in LCD manufacturing over the past 15 years ; and by 2015 , the number of TVs sold could top 400 million , he said .
That 's nearly twice the number sold this year , and it 's spurred by the growth of the middle class in emerging markets .

My friend Reihan Salam has a new article in Time magazine called " The Dropout Economy . "
It 's in a section on the top ideas for the next decade .
He must be feeling the motion underway too .
The driving need to be a social / cultural / tribal entrepreneur that makes something new out of the broken old system .
Here 's some salient ideas from the article :
Somewhere in the suburbs there is an unemployed 23 - year - old who is plotting a cultural insurrection , one that will resonate with existing demographic , cultural and economic trends so powerfully that it will knock American society off its axis .
Imagine a future in which millions of families live off the grid , powering their homes and vehicles with dirt - cheap portable fuel cells .
As industrial agriculture sputters under the strain of the spiraling costs of water , gasoline and fertilizer , networks of farmers using sophisticated techniques that combine cutting - edge green technologies with ancient Mayan know - how build an alternative food - distribution system .
Faced with the burden of financing the decades - long retirement of aging boomers , many of the young embrace a new underground economy , a largely untaxed archipelago of communes , co-ops , and kibbutzim that passively resist the power of the granny state while building their own little utopias .
Rather than warehouse their children in factory schools invented to instill obedience in the future mill workers of America , bourgeois rebels will educate their kids in virtual schools tailored to different learning styles .
Whereas only 1.5 million children were homeschooled in 2007 , we can expect the number to explode in future years as distance education blows past the traditional variety in cost and quality .
The cultural battle lines of our time , with red America pitted against blue , will be scrambled as Buddhist vegan militia members and evangelical anarchist squatters trade tips on how to build self - sufficient vertical farms from scrap - heap materials .
To avoid the tax man , dozens if not hundreds of strongly encrypted digital currencies and barter schemes will crop up , leaving an underresourced IRS to play whack - a- mole with savvy libertarian " hacktivists . "
Work and life will be remixed , as old - style jobs , with long commutes and long hours spent staring at blinking computer screens , vanish thanks to ever increasing productivity levels .
New jobs that we can scarcely imagine will take their place , only they 'll tend to be home - based , thus restoring life to bedroom suburbs that today are ghost towns from 9 to 5 .
Private homes will increasingly give way to cohousing communities , in which singles and nuclear families will build makeshift kinship networks in shared kitchens and common areas and on neighborhood - watch duty .
Gated communities will grow larger and more elaborate , effectively seceding from their municipalities and pursuing their own visions of the good life .
Whether this future sounds like a nightmare or a dream come true , it 's coming .
This transformation will be not so much political as antipolitical .
The decision to turn away from broken and brittle institutions , like conventional schools and conventional jobs , will represent a turn toward what military theorist John Robb calls " resilient communities , " which aspire to self - sufficiency and independence .
The left will return to its roots as the champion of mutual aid , cooperative living and what you might call " broadband socialism , " in which local governments take on the task of building high - tech infrastructure owned by the entire community .
Assuming today 's libertarian revival endures , it 's easy to imagine the right defending the prerogatives of state and local governments and also of private citizens — including the weird ones .
This new individualism on the left and the right will begin in the spirit of cynicism and distrust that we see now , the sense that we as a society are incapable of solving pressing problems .
It will evolve into a new confidence that citizens working in common can change their lives and in doing so can change the world around them .
No joke .

Having defective pipes is among the most challenging scenarios that you can face in your
The 2010 Technology Entertainment Design conference wrapped up on February 13 , in Long Beach , California , and the new talks are just now making it online .
If you ’re not familiar with the conferences , they started in 1984 , and showcase some of the world ’s most engaging thinkers in short talks about specific topics .
Before we have time enjoy all the new talks in search of the next great language moments at TED , we thought we could at least round up five of the most thoughtful , interesting , and entertaining talks from past TED conferences .
The following talks approach the subject of language from diverse fields including linguistics , biology , and digital media .
1. Wade Davis on endangered cultures
National Geographic Explorer - in- Residence , Wade Davis , discusses the erosion of the ethnosphere in this TED talk from 2007 .
He proposes that language loss may be the greatest indicator of weakening global cultural diversity .
To use Davis ’ own words , the experience of watching this talk might be like “ being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with Baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ”
And even if it ’s not that , it is definitely one of the most entertaining TED talks about language and culture currently available .
2. Erin McKean redefines the dictionary
Editor - in - chief of the American Heritage dictionary , Erin McKean , describes how the role of lexicogrophers is really to “ fish ” for new words rather than to “ direct traffic ” on questions of language .
In this talk , McKean discusses the nature of the bound printed dictionary and how digital technologies can potentially improve upon the dictionary ’s centuries - old form .
If you enjoy what you see and hear , visit her online dictionary : Wordnik .
3. Steven Pinker on language and thought
Steven Pinker gives viewers a crash course in simple grammar and then proceeds to extrapolate on the not - so - simple topics of human intelligence , human language , and indirect human verbal communication .
Most importantly , though , viewers get to hear Pinker tell jokes about guacamole .
4. Susan Savage - Rumbaugh on apes
Susan Savage - Rumbaugh comments on the nature - versus - nurture debates surrounding language development in animal species through her studies of the bonobo ape .
Savage - Rumbaugh , a distinguished primatologist , shows TED viewers how bonobos may respond to language and learn language much like humans do .
5. James Geary , metaphorically speaking
James Geary , aphorist and author , speaks on the complex topic of the metaphor in spoken , written , and symbolic language .
Watch as Geary shakes up ideas about the metaphor — possibly even giving viewers a new appreciation for Elvis Presley as a wordsmith .
Are there any TED talks about language and translation you thought we excluded ?
Let us know in the comments for this post .
Is there a part of you that you hate to look at and perhaps try to hide from others ?
Do you glance at your image in distress whenever you pass a reflective surface ?
Many of us are embarrassed by or dissatisfied with some body part or other .
I recall that from about age 11 through my early teens I sat in class with my hand over what I thought was an ugly bump on my nose .
And I know a young woman of normal weight who refuses to sit down in a subway car because she thinks it makes her thighs look huge .
But what if such self - consciousness about a perceived facial or body defect becomes all consuming , an obsession or paranoia that keeps the person from focusing on school or work , pursuing normal social activities , even leaving the house to shop or see a doctor ?
What if it leads to attempted suicide ?
Such are the challenges facing tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from body dysmorphic disorder , or B.D.D. , a syndrome known for more than a century but recognized only recently by the official psychiatric diagnostic manual .
Even more recently , effective treatments have been developed for the disorder , and its emotional and neurological underpinnings have begun to yield to research .

Ottawa , 22 March 2010
Reference to the Federal Court of Appeal – Commission 's jurisdiction under the Broadcasting Act to implement a negotiated solution for the compensation for the fair value of private local conventional television signals
In A group - based approach to the licensing of private television services , Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2010 - 167
Introduction
1. Section 3 ( 2 ) of the Broadcasting Act ( the Act ) states that the Canadian broadcasting system constitutes a single system that is to be regulated by a single independent public authority , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
Section 5 ( 1 ) of the Act requires the Commission to " regulate and supervise all aspects of the Canadian broadcasting system with a view to implementing the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3 ( 1 ) of the Act . "
2 . The Commission is given broad powers under the Act to fulfill its mandate , including the power to issue broadcasting licences on such conditions as it deems appropriate for the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in section 3 ( 1 ) of the Act and to require broadcasting distribution undertakings ( BDUs ) to carry , on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate , programming services specified by the Commission .
The Commission is also given the power by section 10 of the Act to make regulations respecting a number of subjects including : the carriage of any foreign or other programming services by distribution undertakings ; the resolution , by way of mediation or otherwise , of any disputes arising between programming undertakings and distribution undertakings concerning the carriage of programming originated by the programming undertaking ; and such other matters as it deems necessary for the furtherance of its objects .
3 . In fulfilling this mandate , the Commission has created a comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure that each part of the broadcasting industry contributes to the fulfillment of the policy objectives in the Act .
For example , the Commission has :
imposed a series of obligations on programming undertakings , including quotas for the exhibition of , or expenditure on , Canadian programming ;
constructed rules regarding what programming services BDUs are required or permitted to distribute , including a requirement that certain BDUs distribute local television stations and other services as part of the basic package provided to all customers ( i.e. , mandatory carriage ) ;
mandated wholesale fees for the distribution of particular specialty services , with a rate that is , in some cases , set by the Commission or , in other cases , negotiated between the parties ; and
created a system to protect the exclusive broadcast rights of local television stations in their markets by requiring a BDU to delete a programming service it distributes that is comparable to that of the local television station ( i.e. , program deletion ) and , in some circumstances , substitute the comparable programming of the local television station being broadcast simultaneously over the deleted signal ( i.e. , simultaneous substitution ) .
4 . The Commission applies these existing regulatory obligations to a different extent in different circumstances in a manner that is fluid and continues to adapt to changing circumstances .
For example , the Commission has permitted parties , by conditions of licence , to negotiate alternative solutions to the program deletion obligations , which have been incorporated into the regulatory regime .
The Proceeding
5 . In Policy proceeding on a group - based approach to the licensing of television services and on certain issues relating to conventional television , Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009 - 411 , 6 July 2009 ( as revised by Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009 - 411-3 , 11 August 2009 ) , the Commission initiated a proceeding to examine a group - based approach to the licensing of television services , including an examination of whether or not a negotiated solution for the compensation for the fair value of local conventional television signals is appropriate .
In the course of the proceeding , the Commission received 289 comments addressing these issues .
The Commission also received approximately 12,000 comments as part of a campaign organized by Rogers Communications Inc .
6 . Among the issues raised during the proceeding was whether the Commission has the jurisdiction under the Act to implement a negotiated solution for compensation for the fair value of private local conventional television signals .
BDUs presented a legal opinion that such a regime would establish a new copyright in the signals of private local television stations and is therefore ultra vires the powers of the Commission .
Local television stations presented legal opinions that such a regime falls within the Commission 's jurisdiction under the Act to supervise and regulate the broadcasting system .
7 . In A group - based approach to the licensing of private television services , Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2010 - 167 2010-167
1. Licensees of private local television stations would choose whether i ) they will negotiate with BDUs for the value of the distribution of their programming services , failing which they will be able to require deletion of the programming they own , or for which they have the exhibition rights , from all signals distributed in their market , or ii ) they will continue to benefit from existing regulatory protections .
2. Licensees of private local television stations would make their choice by a date set by the Commission , and this choice would be valid for a fixed term of three years .
3 . If a licensee of a private local television station chose option i ) :
a) It would forego all existing regulatory protections related to the distribution of local television signals by BDUs , whether imposed by regulation or by condition of licence , including mandatory distribution and priority channel placement on analog basic , and simultaneous substitution .
b ) BDUs would be required , at the request of private local television stations , to delete any program owned by the licensee of that local television station or for which it has acquired exclusive contractual exhibition rights .
c ) Deletions would be exercised against the signal of any programming undertaking distributed by the BDU , whether foreign or domestic , affiliated or not , including that of the private local television station making the request .
d ) It could negotiate with a BDU for a fair value in exchange for the distribution of its programming service in lieu of the deletion rights set out in b ) and c ) .
This compensation could be monetary , non-monetary ( e.g. , simultaneous or non-simultaneous substitution , carriage arrangements , marketing and promotion ) , or both , and could be negotiated on an individual station basis or as part of a broader negotiation with entire ownership groups .
e ) Parties to the negotiation would be given a fixed period after the date on which the licensee of a private local television station chose option i ) to conclude negotiations , during which the existing regulatory protections would continue to apply .
This period could be shortened or extended by agreement between the parties .
f ) The Commission would minimize its involvement in the terms and conditions of the resulting agreements , intervening only in cases where there is evidence parties are not negotiating in good faith , and would consider acting as arbitrator only where both parties make a request .
4 . If the licensee of a private local television station chose option ii ) , all regulatory protections for private local television stations in force at the time the choice is made , and as amended during the term in which that choice is valid , would remain in force .
These would include , where provided by regulation or by condition of licence : mandatory carriage , priority channel placement on analog basic , program deletion , simultaneous or non-simultaneous substitution , and any payments to individual stations or funds approved by the Commission in lieu of these obligations , including payments for carriage of distant signals as provided for in Broadcasting Public Notice 2008 - 100 .
8. 2010 - 167 In Broadcasting Regulatory Policy , the Commission did not determine the legal issue as to whether or not it has the jurisdiction under the Act to implement such a regime .
Rather , the Commission stated that it would refer the matter to the Federal Court of Appeal for determination .
Consequently , the decision to implement the regime will only be concluded after the Court has ruled on this reference .
9 . With respect to its determination to refer this matter to the Federal Court of Appeal , the Commission stated the following in its regulatory policy :
There is , however , a significant potential impediment to the implementation by the Commission of this market - based resolution .
In response to Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2009 - 411 , the Commission was presented with two legal opinions , both worthy of consideration .
One submitted that the Commission had the requisite authority to introduce a regime of broadcast regulation that would have the effect of requiring appropriate negotiation , such as those described above , between broadcasters and BDUs ; the other took the position that BDUs have a continuing right to disseminate the broadcaster 's over - the - air signal without negotiation or remuneration by virtue of the provisions of the Copyright Act .
While the Commission has found that it is necessary to provide the licensees of private local television stations with the right to negotiate a fair value for the distribution of their programming services by BDUs , it recognizes that there is a valid dispute between parties over the Commission 's legal authority to impose such a regime .
Therefore , given the importance of the question to the ability of the Commission to ensure that the objectives of the Act are met , and the continuing need for certainty in dealing with the approaching group licensing renewals , the Commission has decided to refer the question of its jurisdiction to the Federal Court of Appeal ( the Court ) .
The Commission will request disposition of the issue on an expedited basis .
Order
10 . Pursuant to section 18.3 and section 28 ( 2 ) of the Federal Courts Act , the Commission therefore orders that the following question of law be referred to the Federal Court of Appeal for hearing and determination and requests disposition of the matter on an expedited basis :
Is the Commission empowered , pursuant to its mandate under the Broadcasting Act , to establish a regime to enable private local television stations to choose to negotiate with broadcasting distribution undertakings a fair value in exchange for the distribution of the programming services broadcast by those local television stations ?
Procedure
11 . The Commission expects to receive directions on procedure from the Federal Court of Appeal .
The Court 's directions on procedure will be available at the Court , and copies can be obtained from the Commission on request .

New York ( CNN ) -- Former President Bill Clinton left the hospital Friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries , longtime friend Terry McAuliffe told CNN .
Clinton , 63 , was hospitalized at New York - Presbyterian Hospital 's Columbia campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days , according to Dr. Allan Schwartz , the hospital 's chief of cardiology .
Two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery Thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that Clinton underwent in 2004 -- was blocked , Schwartz said .
An electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack , Schwartz said .
" If I know Bill Clinton , he 's going to get right back on the phone , " McAuliffe , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , told CNN on Friday .
" Yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room , they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery .
" He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti .
And I guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he 'll be back on the phone . "
Schwartz said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with Clinton 's post - bypass diet or exercise , which Schwartz called excellent .
Rather , Schwartz said , this is " part of the natural history " of the bypass treatment .
" He really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise .
He really followed the program , " Schwartz said , adding he told Clinton that he'd be allowed to return to work Monday .
The stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service , Schwartz said .
Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient 's heart vessels where they are inflated , pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow .
The graft 's blockage is n't unheard of , because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years , Schwartz said .
However , a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of Clinton 's heart -- still looks " pristine , " Schwartz said .
" We know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open , " he said .
Stents and chest pain explained
Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after Thursday 's procedure .
In a written statement , Douglas Band , counselor to the former president , said : " President Clinton is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti 's relief and long - term recovery efforts . "
Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea Clinton , and wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , were with him at the hospital Thursday night , Schwartz said .
Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East , but her departure has been delayed until Saturday , a senior U.S. official said .
Bill Clinton has n't left the public eye since he departed the White House in 2001 , maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches .
Since the January 12 earthquake that hit Haiti , he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the U.N. special envoy .
On February 3 , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon placed Clinton in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there .
Clinton also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January .
David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst , said Clinton was " exhausted " and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month .
Clinton had busy schedule before heart procedure
Clinton 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday .
Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery .
Dr. Spencer King , president of St. Joseph's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , rejected as outdated suggestions that Clinton needs to slow down .
" This is kind of a ' 50s concept , " he told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday .
" Now , we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done .
The outlook for people is totally different . "
" If he slows down , he slows down , " said King , who who has not treated Clinton .
But , he added , " It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up . "
King said Thursday 's stenting procedure may not be the end of Clinton 's heart woes .
" The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more , " he said .
" There 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again . "
CNN 's John King , Ed Henry , Jessica Yellin , Elise Labott and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report .

I ’ll walk you through every important aspect of credit card usage .
Credit cards can be a valuable tool for individuals and business owners alike .
If you are going to use credit cards , it ’s essential to understand how credit cards work and the best ways to use them .

Common Questions About Credit Cards
Credit Cards 101
Used wisely , credit cards can play a big role in personal finance .
Most smart people I know do one of two things with credit cards : either they do n’t touch them at all , or they use them to their advantage .
How can a credit card be a positive piece of your financial portfolio ?
First , find the right card .
Then , make sure you handle it properly :
Pay it in full each month
Maximize your cash back and rewards
Watch out for fees
Over time you will rack up rewards and your credit history should improve .
I know a lot of people do n’t care for credit cards , including some of my readers .
Many people use their credit cards as if they ’re free money , not fully recognizing that they have to pay back the charges .
But if you have the self - control to use credit cards wisely , I think they have their place .
I see credit cards as simply another financial tool , like life insurance or a Roth IRA .
They ’re just an instrument to make things happen financially .
It ’s all in how you treat them .
What Is a Credit Card Limit ?
When you are given a credit card , you are assigned a credit card limit .
This is the highest balance you can spend on the card .
Anything spent above this amount will incur an over - the - limit fee .
Your initial credit card limit is based on your income and credit history .
Are There Cards Without a Limit ?
Some credit cards do not come with a limit .
The American Express charge card , for instance , does n’t allow you to carry your balance forward .
For that reason , you do n’t really have a limit on your spending within the month .
After all , you ’ll be paying it all off .
What do they care how much you spend ?
However , I ’ve heard that although there is no stated , pre-set limit , you will receive a notification when you ’ve reached a “ soft ” limit , based on your history of spending with the card .
How a Credit Card Limit Affects Your Credit Score
One of the factors involved with calculating your FICO credit score is your “ amounts owed . ”
This is judged based on the amount owed compared to the amount available .
Therefore , if you have a high credit card limit , any balance you carry will pale in comparison to your high limit .
It ’s recommended that you keep your balance to 30 % of your overall limit .
Having a higher limit will help your credit score .

How to Raise Your Credit Card Limit
Considering the effect the credit card limit has on your credit score , you might want to try and raise it to its highest level .
Credit card companies will naturally raise your limits over time as your payment history builds up .
But you can also call them and request a credit limit increase .
Make sure you ask them to only do a “ soft pull ” of your credit history .
A hard pull can negatively impact your credit score .
Some online portals allow you to do this as well .
Takes just a few minutes and could really help your score .

Basic Tips for Good Credit Card Use
If you plan on using a credit card , here are a few tips to keep in mind to make sure you have the best experience possible .
Most credit cardholders do n’t use their cards to their full advantage .
If you are not following these simple rules , you ’re missing out .
1. Know Your Credit Card Terms
You may say to yourself , “ who reads those terms ?
I do n’t need to read the credit card terms . ”
Yep , it ’s boring , but it ’s a necessity .
There is a lot of fine print involved with a credit card .
At the very least , turn over your credit card statement and review the following :
Annual percentage rate ( APR )
Other APR
Variable - rate information
Grace period for purchases
Balance calculation method
Annual fees
Minimum charges
Specific transaction fees ( cash advance and balance transfer )
Late payment and over - limit fees
Of course , make sure you know your credit limit and any cash advance limits .
2. Review Your Charges
When you get your first credit card statement in the mail , you ’ll want to make sure that the APR applied to your balance is the APR that you were given when you were accepted .
You also will want to review your individual charges ( just as if you were reviewing your bank statement ) to ensure there is nothing unexpected .
Lastly , look for any changes that the credit card company might be making .
This could be a change in the interest rate or fees .
It only takes a moment and not taking this time to check could lead to unexpected charges later .
3. Protect Your Credit Card Number
Protections for credit card use are getting stronger every day .
However , it ’s still important to keep your number under wraps .
Make sure you never share your credit card number with anyone .
And if you use it to purchase something online , be sure that the website you are dealing with is reputable .
Check out Privacy.com as an additional way to protect you when making online purchases .
Since your credit card statements usually have your full card number printed out , consider keeping them in a safe , shredding them , or going to online statements .
Many of us now elect online - only credit card statements , which helps eliminate the paper trail .
4. Keep Your Balance Well Below the Credit Limit
Be sure you are n’t maxing out your credit cards : using all of your available credit balance .
Credit utilization is a factor in determining your credit score .
You want to keep the amount of credit used well below the amount of credit you have .
This is per card , and across all cards .
The recommended card utilization is 30 % , which means if you have a $ 10,000 limit you ’ll want to keep your balance under $ 3,000 .
5. Always Pay Your Balance in Full and on Time
This is a basic tip , but I ca n’t repeat it often enough .
Credit cards are unsecured debt that carries a higher interest rate than a home or auto loan .
And unlike a home mortgage or a school loan , the interest you pay cannot ever be tax - deductible .
There are few things as cool as earning a free flight from a reward card .
But those miles are n’t really free if you ’re paying higher interest rates .
Paying your credit cards bill on time is also the factor that influences your credit score the most .
For all these reasons , you need to take it very seriously .
Do n’t wait till the last minute each month to make your payment .
Instead , get it taken care of as soon as possible .
And if you ’re someone who has a forgetful streak , setting up automatic payments with your credit card issuer may be a smart move .
If you do set up automatic payments , you ’ll still want to check your statement each month for any errors .
And keep in mind that it often takes one or two billing cycles before automatic payments kick in .
In the meantime , you ’ll need to continue making manual payments .
6. Know Your Statement Closing Date
Your billing cycle lasts a month , and all charges made within that period must be paid in full by the next due date to avoid interest .
When you know your statement cycle ’s closing date , you can make large purchases the day after in order to receive another 30 days of an interest - free loan .
7. Take Advantage of Rewards !
If you do pay your balance in full every month , you must earn rewards .
Not carrying credit card debt means that you are handling your finances well and even receiving a free loan from your card issuer .
Do n’t just pat yourself on the back , earn as many rewards as possible from your credit cards .
One caveat of credit card rewards : do n’t spend more than you need to just for the sake of earning more rewards !
This defeats the purpose of a rewards card .
However , as long as you can stick to spending only what you would normally spend .
A credit card is n’t a license to overspend .
I ’ve lost track of all the award flights , free hotel stays , and cash back that I have earned since I started getting serious about maximizing my credit card rewards .
Yet I still see people leaving valuable rewards unclaimed by using a non-reward card that they pay off each month .
If your rewards can equal 2 - 5 % of your spending , how much are you giving up ?

How to Find the Perfect Credit Card for You
How do you find a credit card ?
Choosing a credit card can be tough with all the options available to you .
How do you find one that will fit your needs and match up well with your habits ?
One thing is for sure .
You do n’t want the credit card companies telling you which card to use .
Being intentional about your choice will end up producing the best result for you .
So how do you go about finding the best card for you and your situation ?
Here ’s what I do :
Stick to my principles
Know my needs : short and long - term
Analyze the various factors
Let ’s dig into those a little bit deeper .
1. Stick to Your Personal Credit Card Principles
When you ’re dealing with credit cards or any financial product , for that matter , it ’s good to have a set of principles to fall back on .
I sometimes call it my “ credit card philosophy . ”
Your principles will help you establish a bare minimum for accepting a credit card .
Some principles I have when it comes to cards are :
use cards with no annual fees ( unless there is strong evidence to get a card with a fee ) interest rates do n’t matter because I pay them off each month avoid all retail store cards
If you do n’t trust yourself with credit , then , by all means , skip credit cards and keep using your cash , debit cards , or a charge card .
Some people like to keep it simple and have just one card .
They value simplicity versus optimization .
Others find it valuable to have multiple cards , for different types of situations .
Only you know your credit card principles .
Use those to help guide your choice .
2. Know Your Credit Card Needs
The next step is to take a quick inventory of your needs for this new credit card .
Where will you use the card ?
How often ?
Will your situation change from year to year ?
Is this for personal or business purposes ?
For us , we see the long term value in a “ daily spending ” type card .
One that will give us cash back for regular purchases ( fuel , groceries , etc. ) on a consistent basis for many years to come .
If you travel a lot and plan to use your credit card for travel needs , you probably have a different set of needs than that of someone who ’s looking to use a card for daily spending .

If you simply need a credit card in the short term to do a 0 % balance transfer , your needs are going to be completely different .
It ’s also valuable to think about your long - term needs for a card .
You can always cancel a card after your short - term goals are met .
But if you can combine a card ’s value in both the short and long - term , then you ’ve really got a great card .
A good example of this is a balance transfer card that has a nice reward system .
Once you ’re done with the transfer then you can use it as a reward building card .
But watch out for increases in interest rates , even if you do pay the card off in full each month .

3. Analyze the Credit Card Factors
Now that you ’ve considered your principles and understand your needs , both short and long - term , you are free to compare credit card offers based on various credit card factors .
The factors to include in your analysis could be some combination of those listed below .
Sign - Up Bonus
Many cards offer attractive sign - up bonuses .
Sign - up bonuses are where you can really earn a lot of points / cash quickly .
Some of the best credit cards offer bonuses of 50,000 + points .
To put that in perspective , at 1 point per $ 1 spent , you ’d need to spend $ 50,000 before you could earn 50,000 points .
Even if you earned double points for every $ 1 spent , it would take $ 25,000 in spending to earn that many points .
Yet , some sign - up bonuses require you to spend as little as $ 500 to $ 1,000 within your first three months with the card .
For this reason , if two cards offer similar ongoing earnings potential , the sign - up bonus for each could be the deciding factor .
You do need to be careful with sign - up bonuses in one regard , though .
While many have reasonable minimum spending requirements , some are fairly high .
Do n’t chase after a sign - up bonus if you ca n’t meet the minimum spending requirement while keeping your normal spending habits .
Value of Points
One cent per point is considered a general credit card rewards baseline .
Using the 1 cent per point guideline , 25,000 points would be worth $ 25o in cash or travel .
But not all points and miles are created equal .
Some points are worth less than 1 cent , while others can be worth much more than 1 cent .
A massive sign - up bonus from one card could actually be worth less than a more modest sign - up bonus from another card that has more valuable points .
There are many point valuation systems to be found online .
Check a few of them out before choosing a card .
Earnings Potential
Big sign - up bonuses are nice .
But how many rewards will you be able to earn with your credit card on an ongoing basis ?
There are two main ways that credit cards allow cardholders to earn rewards .
The first is to give extra rewards for spending on “ bonus categories ” and give 1 point per $ 1 spent on everything else .
Every card is different , but typically credit cards offer 2 x to 6 x points on bonus category purchases .
Popular bonus categories include :
Restaurants
Flights
Hotels
Car rentals
Gas
Business expenses ( for business credit cards )
Other credit cards forgo the bonus categories and instead give extra rewards on all purchases .
Depending on the card that you choose , you could get up to 2 % back on all spending with a flat - rate credit card .
If you spend a lot of money on certain categories like travel or gas , you may want to look at a card that gives a big bonus for those expenses .
Otherwise , a flat - rate card may be a better fit .
Also , pay attention to bonus category spending caps .
For instance , a card that offers 2 % on all purchases with no spending cap may be worth more than a card that offers 5 % up to a $ 6,000 cap .
This could especially be true if you are planning on using your credit card for business expenses .
Redemption Flexibility
How many ways you can redeem points ?
Some cards only allow you to redeem points toward one thing , like airfare or cash .
Other cards , however , offer ultimate flexibility allowing you to choose between redeeming your points for airfare , hotels , rental cars , gift cards , cash , or even merchandise .
Also , pay attention to available travel partners as this can add even more redemption flexibility to your credit card rewards .
Chase Ultimate Rewards points , for example , can be transferred to a multitude of travel partners like Hyatt or Southwest .
The Citi ThankYou Rewards program includes a good number of travel partners as well .

0 % Intro APR Period
Are you looking to finance a large purchase ?
Cards with 0 % intro APR periods can help with that .
Many of the best credit cards come with 12 to 18 months of 0 % interest .
Be careful , though , of “ no interest if paid in full ” periods ( also called “ deferred interest periods ” . )
These types of promotions tend to be popular with home improvement credit cards .
With deferred interest periods , you pay no interest if your card balance is paid off completely before the end of the promotional period .
Otherwise , all the interest that accrued during the deferred interest period will be added to your balance .
When possible , choose credit cards that offer a true 0 % APR intro period .
And if you do choose a deferred interest card , make sure that you pay it off before your promotional period closes .
Acceptance
Is this a card that ’s accepted in most stores ?
What about overseas ?
If you do a lot of international travel , this could influence your decision .
For instance , Visa and Mastercard are typically safer bets for overseas travel than American Express and Discover .
Balance Transfers
If you owe a balance on one or more credit cards with a high APR , it could save you a lot of money to transfer your balance to a new credit card that offers a 0 % APR period .
Dropping your APR from 15 % or more to 0 % could help you apply a lot more of your monthly payment towards principal .
Do be aware that most credit cards charge a balance transfer fee .
The balance transfer fee on many credit cards is 5 % of the amount transferred .
But some of the best balance transfer cards offer a 3 % intro balance transfer rate .
I ’m sure I ’ve left out a few factors , but those should get you started .
Slap the relevant factors down on a spreadsheet or notepad and evaluate the cards available to you .
Once you ’ve performed the three steps above you should be in a comfortable spot to make a decision on a specific credit card .

Reasons to Avoid Store Credit Cards
There are a lot of different types of cards .
From small business credit cards to co-branded airline cards .
But one type of card I encourage you to stay away from is the retail store credit card .
One of my very first jobs was selling retail at a store in the mall .
Working usually helps your finances , but that job was one of the causes of my issues with debt .
It ’s hard to resist buying new things when you spend the workday surrounded by advertising and sales displays .
Self - control becomes even more difficult when you can be instantly approved for a store credit card .
I could only give my spiel about the “ benefits ” of our card so many times before signing up myself .
I paid for that mistake for quite a while .
I ’ve become wiser about finances in the years since then , but still ca n’t go into a store without being solicited to sign up for a credit card .
There is always some type of incentive , but is it ever a good idea to sign up for a store - branded credit card ?
The short answer is : no .
The cons to store credit cards easily outweigh the temporary perks that come with signing on the dotted line .
These are the top reasons why you should almost always dismiss the sales pitch and avoid signing up for store credit cards .
1. High - Interest Rates
Most types of credit cards average around 16 % APR .
Store credit cards , on the other hand , are usually well in excess of 20 % APR .
Stores can easily afford to give you 10 % or even 15 % off your first purchase because they will make it all back if you do n’t immediately pay off your balance .
Also , the high - interest rates for store credit cards tend to be a standard number for everyone .
This means that even if you have a great credit score , it will not provide you with any benefit when it comes to the interest rate for store credit cards .
2. Increased Spending & Debt
Odds are that you ’re in the store with plans to make a purchase .
Then , they offer you a discount on your total purchase that day , if you sign up for a store credit card .
Once approved , who is actually going to stick with just one or two items ?
The people who are duped into signing up for the store credit cards are also going to buy a bunch of extra things to “ take advantage ” of the one - time deal .
Not to mention the fact that they now have available credit to use , keeping cash in their wallets ( at least for the time being . )
As the holder of a store - branded credit card , you will start receiving emails and mailings to keep you up to date on every new promotion .
The stores may also send you special coupons .
These could tempt you to spend even more .
It is all too easy to get caught up in the moment and be distracted by the “ deals . ”
People forget how they will have to pay back every penny that they spend .
And when they do n’t , the balances will continue to grow thanks to the large interest rates .
3. Restricted Use
You are not going to see any of the typical credit card symbols on a store - branded one .
That is because they are only good for that specific store .
You may be able to use it for different locations , but do n’t bother trying to buy groceries with one of your mall credit cards .
Multiple credit cards mean a thicker wallet , more due dates to keep track of , and more bills in the mail .
4. Credit Score
As store cards can only be used for one retail location , you will need numerous cards to do all of your shopping .
The big problem with this ( besides an overflowing wallet ) is that too many applications will temporarily hurt your credit score .
More importantly –and you may not realize this –credit scores are calculated , in part , on a comparison between your account balance and the amount of available credit .
Store cards usually have low credit limits .
If you carry a balance on these cards , it will negatively affect your credit score because of the low percentage of available credit .
5. Impulse Decisions
Quick decisions rarely tend to be good ones .
As someone who previously cajoled customers into signing up for store cards , I remember the quick and streamlined process .
Once someone agreed to apply , you wanted them signing off right away .
You did n’t want to give them time to read the fine print or reconsider .
And do n’t be too proud about being approved for a store card–almost everyone is approved .
It usually takes more time to convince someone to apply for a card , than it does to get them approved .
6. You Will Likely Lose Money On Interest & Late Fees
It ’s easy to rationalize that you ’ll pay off the total amount due on your credit cards each month , but it does n’t always happen .
Stores know that the odds are in their favor when it comes to credit cards .
A large percentage of customers who sign up for cards will be paying them off for some time to come .
Forgetting to pay the bill on time could cost you as much as $ 30 for a late fee .
The amount lost on a minor discount or coupons is quickly regained by the stores as you carry a balance and / or make a late payment .
Which Cards Should You Sign Up For ?
What credit cards should you sign up for ?
Try a card that actually gives you long - term rewards .
Travel rewards cards are a good example .
These types of cards can be used all over the world and have lower interest rates .
Also , instead of receiving coupons or discounts that encourage additional purchases , you can score free plane tickets or stays at hotels .
As always , the key to benefiting from the use of credit cards is not spending more money than you can afford to pay back .
Credit card debt can be a huge problem , but it can be avoided by paying off your balance every month .
Only then do you benefit from the incentives offered by a credit card company .
What to Do if You ’re Declined for a Credit Card
Have you ever heard the expression “ It does n’t hurt to ask ? ”
This sentiment is never truer than when it comes to credit cards .
Too often , cardholders think the big banks are monolithic institutions whose decisions regarding its account holders are set in stone .
In fact , nothing could be further from the truth .
If you ’re declined , ask the card company to reconsider your application .
Remember when , as a child , you would ask one parent for something only to appeal to your other parent when your request was rejected ?
Although you have ( hopefully ) grown out of using that tactic , it actually works when applying for a credit card .
The Benefit of Talking to a Human Being
You see , nearly all credit card issuers rely on their computer systems to evaluate the credit score of new applicants before making a decision .
At the same time , they allow you to contact an actual human being to discuss any rejection .
It turns out that their customer service representatives do have the power to reconsider your credit card application .
Sometimes it is just a matter of a person correcting a computer ’s poor decision , but other times it may involve closing another existing account or moving a line of credit .
And if you do n’t get the answer you are looking for the first time , just call back again and speak with someone else .
You wo n’t get into trouble .
More Things You Should Ask the Card Companies For
1. Bump Your Bonus
Let ’ say you apply for and receive a new credit card only to find out that there was a better sign up bonus available for that card .
Or , what if a larger signup bonus offer appears shortly after you apply ?
It sounds too good to be true , but you can actually contact your bank and ask to receive the better offer .
To use the bank ’s terminology , just ask if you can “ apply the other offer code to my account . ”
They will know what you are talking about and they often have the power to make the switch .
2. Forgive Late Fees
I would like you to believe that as a credit card expert , I have never made a late payment .
But of course , I have , if only by mistake .
Yet I can truthfully say that I have never actually paid a late payment fee .
The trick is to merely call the bank , admit your mistake , and ask to have the late fee waived .
Considering that banks pay hundreds of dollars in marketing , advertising , and sign - up bonuses just to attract one new customer , they are delighted to retain an existing card member merely by writing off a small fee .
3. Offer You a Retention Bonus
Not only will banks forgive fees to retain new customers , but they will also offer you a bonus if you threaten to cancel .
Just call the bank , tell them that you are thinking about closing your account , and ask to speak with a retention specialist .
That person will search their systems to find an offer designed to keep you as their customer .
This could involve bonus points , miles , or cash back .
In other instances , they might even waive your annual fee .
4. Just About Anything
Do you know someone that you can call that will do just about anything you ask them ?
Even if you do , are they available 24/7 ?
Amazingly , this is a service that is provided by a large number of different credit cards .
For example , Visa has its Signature Concierge program that will provide you with directions , help you make travel plans , or recommend a restaurant .
Similarly , MasterCard has its World Elite Concierge program , and most American Express cards offer some form of travel and shopping assistance .
So stop accepting the dictates of your credit card issuer and start demanding more .
After all , it does n’t hurt to ask .
Common Questions About Credit Cards
Below , you ’ll find the answers to the most common credit card - related questions .
What Should You Do When Your Credit Card is Lost or Stolen ?
I was hanging out with a friend recently when he realized he had misplaced his credit card .
He called the restaurant he was dining at last night .
Luckily , they had his card .
He also called his card company to ensure there had been no fraudulent charges made on the card .
He was in the clear .
I told him he should n’t have had as many glasses of wine with dinner . 🙂
Credit Card Customer Service Hotlines
Here ’s a list of the numbers to call for each major card issuer to report your lost credit card .
Note :
With most of these numbers , they will ironically ask you for your card number .
However , I ’ve tried to list below what other options you have , or how to just get to a person to talk to .
Chase : 1-888-269-8690 ; From outside the US : 1-480-350-7099
– You will need to wait for the prompts for the card number to pass .
Then when they ask for it , enter the last four digits of your social security number
: 1-888-269-8690 ; From outside the US : 1-480-350-7099 –
You will need to wait for the prompts for the card number to pass .
Then when they ask for it , enter the last four digits of your social security number Discover : 1-800 - DISCOVER ; From outside the US : 1-801-902-3100
– Press # , then press 2
: 1-800-DISCOVER ; From outside the US : 1-801-902-3100 – Press # , then press 2 Citi : 1-800-950-5114
– Press 0
: 1-800-950-5114 – Press 0 American Express : 1-800-528-4800
– Say “ report a lost or stolen card . ”
Then say , “ I do n’t have it ” if you do n’t know your card number
In the Case of Fraud , What Charges Are You Liable For ?
It ’s definitely important to call your credit card company as soon as possible once you realize your card is lost or might have been stolen .
The person with access to your card could be running up a bunch of charges .
So what happens if they spend $ 500 on the card before you call your credit card company ?
Well , luckily we have the Fair Credit Billing Act , which , as I understand it , says you are only liable for up to $ 50 in fraudulent charges .
However , most banks will waive that $ 50 liability so you ’ll most likely not be responsible for any fraudulent charges .
Also , once you call your credit card issuer and inform them of the lost or stolen card , you are no longer liable for future fraudulent charges .
For more information see the FTC’s Facts for Consumers page on the Fair Credit Billing Act .
Make note of the requirements to mail in a letter as well .
Is a Credit Card Cash Advance a Bad Financial Move or Good Emergency Plan ?
A cash advance using a credit card is similar to using your ATM card .
Instead of a debit or check card , you use your credit card and credit card PIN at the ATM to withdraw funds .
Unlike a debit or check card withdrawal where you ’re actually using your own money , with a credit card cash advance you are using borrowed funds , made available to you through your credit agreement .
The amount you can withdraw depends on your overall credit limit , your daily cash advance limit , as well as any overall cash advance limit that the card company may apply .
As you can see , cash advances are a pretty convenient way to get quick cash .
However , these types of withdrawals are discouraged because of the high rate of interest applied to these balances , associated fees , and the method with which some card companies use to incur interest and apply for payments .
Cash advances can also come in a second form : checks .
You ’ve probably received these checks in the mail before .
If you were to use these checks for anything , they would essentially be the same as doing a cash advance through an ATM .
How to Find Your Credit Card Cash Advance Fee and Interest Rate
It ’s important to understand how these types of transactions will be handled .
As you ’ll see , it ’s not the most advantageous financial move you can make .
Let ’s take a look at an example Schumer Box to see some of the fees and rates to be applied to these cash advance transactions .
To find your Schumer Box , look on your credit card statement , or with those cash advance checks you ’ve received .
This example shows the rate that will be applied to any cash advances that you use .
As you can see , the rate is higher than the normal purchase rate .
Towards the bottom of the box , you can see the fees associated with cash advances .
As you can see , with that type of fee , you can quickly be paying a lot just to use this type of transaction .
More Credit Card Fees to Watch Out for
You also need to watch out for any ATM fees that you ’ll incur during the withdrawal .
In addition to fees , you need to understand that usually , interest charges for cash advances begin when you make the withdrawal .
There is no grace period like for purchases .
However , the card company will apply your payment to that first since it has the highest rate .
Tips for Making the Most of a Cash Advance
If you ’re going to use a credit card cash advance , make sure it ’s under these circumstances :
You fully understand your credit card terms and know what fees you ’ll incur , your limit , and how the balance will be paid off
You ’re using a card with a $ 0 balance
You use a no - fee ATM
You can pay it off fast
Alternatives to the Credit Card Cash Advance
There are several other ways to get cash quick .
You can get cash by returning things , consignment shops , peer - to - peer lending , an equity line of credit , among other things .
Most of those ideas are a better alternative than the credit card cash advance .
But none provide the truly last - minute , immediate , emergency cash that you might need when you do n’t have your debit card .
How Do You Opt - Out of Credit Card Offers ?
One of the things that may be piling up in your house is a stack of offers to sign up with a new credit card or lower your insurance .
While these are great financial tools , you may not want to know about them every day in the form of a junk - filled letter .
You should sign up for credit cards when you want to , right ?
Not when the credit card company wants you to .
Here ’s how to opt - out of all those credit card offers :
Use an Opt - Out Service
Visit a website called OptOutPrescreen.com and sign up for their five - year or permanent opt - out service .
It ’s free and your right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act .
Also , if you want to get rid of general junk mail , DMAchoice.org is where you can opt - out of general marketing mail .
DMAchoice represents about 80 % of the total volume of marketing mail in the United States .
So you ’ll be getting rid of a lot of mail by signing up with them .
Both services are free .
Call the Bank or Credit Card Issuer
Now , what this does n’t do is stop the junk mail that comes from your bank or your current credit card providers .
Do n’t you hate those annoying cash advance checks ?
To get rid of these mailings , call your bank or credit card company directly .
While you ’re at it , why not sign up for electronic statements as well ?
Regarding opting out , I know this is n’t for everyone .
There are some benefits to getting offers in the mail .
You can use these offers to negotiate lower rates on your current credit cards , find the best cash back credit cards , or find a really nice 0 % APR deal .
But you can always shop online to see what banks are offering at that time .
Just keep that in mind when deciding on whether to opt - out or not .
Bottom Line :
Credit cards can provide tremendous benefits and value .
When you take full advantage of them , you can earn lots of rewards that can be converted into cash , free travel , gift cards , and more .
But credit cards can also be a curse when they tempt you to overspend and rack up interest charges .
But you can maximize the pros of credit cards and minimize the cons by following the “ good credit card use tips ” provided in this guide .
Binding [ edit ]
How to do structural binding or destructuring in function argument lists or let bindings .

You can destructure the map like this :
( defn list - xyz [ {x :x , y :y , z : z} ] ( list x y z ) ) user= > ( list - xyz {:x 1 , :y 2 , :z 3} ) ( 1 2 3 )

Instead of accessing vector elements like this :

you can destructure the vector like this :
( defn vec-norm [ [ x , y , z ] ] ( Math / sqrt ( + ( * x x ) ( * y y ) ( * z z ) ) ) ) user= > ( vec-norm [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) 3.7416573867739413

The infinite sequence ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 .... ) can be defined using ( range ) since clojure 1.2:[ 1 ]
( def integers ( range ) ) ( take 10 integers ) ;; ⇒ ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )
or alternatively using iterate :
;; Generates ( x ( inc x ) ( inc ( inc x ) ) ... ) ( def integers ( iterate inc 0 ) ) ( take 4 integers ) ;; ⇒ ( 0 1 2 3 )
( def newton ( iterate ( fn[ x ] ( / ( + x ( / 2.0 x ) ) 2 ) ) 2 ) ) ( take 5 newton ) ;; ⇒ ( 2 1.5 1.4166666666666665 1.4142156862745097 1.4142135623746899 )
Polymorphism [ edit ]
Overload function based on number of arguments :
( defn argcount ( [ ]
0 ) ; Zero arguments ( [ x ]
1 ) ;
One argument ( [ x & args ] ( + 1 ( count args ) ) ) ) ;
List of arguments ( argcount ) ;; ⇒ 0 ( argcount " dog " ) ;; ⇒ 1 ( argcount " cat " 1 3 4 ) ;; ⇒ 4
Create multi-method which dispatches on the number of its arguments :
( defmulti g ( fn[& arglist ] ( count arglist ) ) ) ( defmethod g 0 [ & arglist ]
" No arguments . " ) ( defmethod g 1 [ & arglist ]
" One argument . " ) ( defmethod g 2 [ & arglist ]
" Two arguments . " ) ( defmethod g : default [ & arglist ]
" More than two arguments . " ) ( g ) ; ⇒
" No arguments . " ( g 1 ) ; ⇒
" One argument . " ( g 2 ) ; ⇒
" One argument . " ( g 3 4 ) ; ⇒ " Two arguments . " ( g " cart " 1 [ 2 3 ] ) ; ⇒
" More than two arguments . "
Create a multi-method which dispatches on the class of its arguments :
( comment Define f to be a multi-method function and dispatch using class of argument ) ( defmulti f class ) ( comment Use this definition for f if the class of the argument x is a long ) ( defmethod f Long [ x ]
" Argument is a long " ) ( comment Use this definition for f if the class of the argument x is a double ) ( defmethod f Double [ x ]
" Argument is a double " ) ( comment Use this definition for f for all other argument types ) ( defmethod f : default [ x ]
" Argument is not a number " ) ( f 3 ) ; ⇒ " Argument is a long " ( f 3.4 ) ; ⇒ " Argument is a double " ( f " string " ) ; ⇒ " Argument is not a number "
( comment Define g to be a multi-method function which dispatches on the class of its arguments ) ( defmulti g ( fn[x , y ] [ ( class x ) ( class y ) ] ) ) ( comment
Use this definition for g if class of first argument is a long and class of second argument is a long ) ( defmethod g [ Long , Long ] [ x , y ] " Both arguments are longs " ) ( comment Use this definition for g if class of first argument is long and class of second argument is double ) ( defmethod g [ Long , Double ] [ x , y ] " First argument is a long and second argument is a double " ) ( comment Use this definition for g as the default ) ( defmethod g : default [ x , y ] " All other cases " ) ( g 3 2 ) ; ⇒ " Both arguments are longs " ( g 3 4.3 ) ; ⇒
" First argument is a long and second argument is a double " ( g 4.3 4.3 ) ; ⇒

Create a multi-method that dispatches on the value of its argument :
( comment Create multi method h that dispatches on the value of the argument ) ( defmulti h ( fn[x ] x ) ) ( comment

Import Java Classes from Jar File [ edit ]
( import ' ( cljext.swing DelegatingPanel IPainter ) )
The first item in the import list is the package name followed by the names of all the classes in the package to import .
Note : you must use the package name and not the name of the jar file which contains the package of classes .
If you 're not sure what the package name is , from a terminal type :
jar tf jarfilename.jar
Let 's say you see something like : org / jfugue / Anticipator.class
Then the import statement would be :
( import ' ( org.jfugue Anticipator ) )
Not :
( import ' ( jarfilename Anticipator ) )
File IO [ edit ]

Write to Output File [ edit ]
Writing creates a new file or will overwrite existing file
( spit " output.txt " " some output text " )
To append to existing file use " spit " with " : append " set to true
( spit " output.txt " " more text with spit append " : append true )
Now our file should say :
" some output textmore text with spit append "
Strings [ edit ]
Use str to concatenate strings :
( str " A " " B " " C " ) ;; ⇒ " ABC "
and use apply with str as an argument to concatenate a sequence of strings :
( apply str [ " A " " B " " C " ] ) ;; ⇒ " ABC " ( apply str [ " /usr/ include " \/ " stdio.h " ] ) ;; ⇒ " /usr/include /stdio.h " ( map ( fn [ file ] ( str " /usr / include / " file " .h " ) ) [ " stdio " " gmp " " signal " ] ) ;; ⇒ ( " /usr/include/stdio.h " " /usr/include /gmp.h " " /usr/include/signal.h " )
Use interpose to join a sequence of strings with a separator :
( apply str ( interpose \ : [ " A " " B " " C " ] ) ) ;; ⇒ " A: B: C " ( apply str ( interpose \ : [ " /usr/local/ sbin " " /usr/local / bin " " /usr/sbin " " /usr / bin " " / sbin " " / bin " ] ) ) ;; ⇒ " /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin "
Use re-seq to split a string at boundaries by a regular expression , here \w+ denotes a character class of all alphanumeric characters plus " _ " :
( re-seq # " \w + " " to be or not to be " ) ;; ⇒ ( " to " " be " " or " " not " " to " " be " )
Reversing a string is done via reverse which returns a sequence of the characters in the string ; use apply with str to turn it into a string again :
( reverse " I am cold " ) ;; ⇒ ( \d \l \o \c \space \m \a \space \ I ) ( apply str ( reverse " I am cold " ) ) ;; ⇒ " dloc ma I "
and to convert any object into a string simply supply it as an argument to the str function :
( str 3 ) ; ⇒ " 3 " ( str 3.0 ) ; ⇒ " 3.0 " ( str ' a ) ; ⇒ " a " ( str ' ( 1 2 ) ) ; ⇒ " ( 1 2 ) " ( str {:a 1 :b 2} ) ; ⇒ " {:a 1 , :b 2 } "

The writing process : clear and redoubtable
You need to impose your arguments on the readers , as any respectable college term paper writing service will tell you .
a)
They should be able to glance at your thinking process ( only then will they willingly participate in your writing process ) , b ) figure out what your major argument is and why c ) you are able to come to a particular conclusion ( documenting various sources through citations and bibliography ) .
Your readers must also be able to gauge your d ) methodology - in other words your approach to the discourse .
Thesis and introduction should be precise and powerful
Introduction to an academic paper establishes why the reader should bother about reading what you have to say in your paper .
Unless it is imposing and strong and adequately general ( not too specific ) , it will miss the bull ’s eye .
For instance , those who seek people to write papers for money know that any good academic paper writer will never use an introduction like , “ global warming is a threat ” .
The argument is simple ; Global warming is a threat for sure but there are so many other entities which are a threat .
So , by using this introduction you are being too general .
As already said , the introduction should fall between general and specific .
When you think , “ I need someone to write my paper ” , you will want them to write an introduction like “ Global warming may seriously threaten our existence and reduce the planet ’s life ” .
Same is true for thesis .
It should be debate - worthy and precise .
Citations must follow regulations
You are using references ; work of other people to propose your theory about your specific discourse .
An in - text citation like ( Higgins and Anderson 1982 , p.47 ) . is the norm .
Reputable academic paper writing services will tell you that there should be no space between the first parenthesis and the name of the author , space between name and the year , no space between page number and the closing parenthesis and the period .
Writing an academic paper is an art but if you think of your role as an author seriously and imagine your readers as worthy , the above three strategies to master academic paper writing will surely help you .
THE “ peripheral ” economies of the European Union are all in trouble , it is said .
So Europe 's “ core ” economies , especially in the euro - area heartland , must decide how to help colleagues teetering on the edge of both bankruptcy and the map — without wrecking the budget discipline needed to make the euro work .
This week 's summit of EU leaders , which began after The Economist went to press , was due to be dominated by this debate , pitting Germany ( the core of the core ) against governments that believe a credible plan must be drawn up to help far - flung , spendthrift members of the club .
The list starts with Greece .
But there are worries ahead about Portugal , Spain and even Italy .
Talk of an ailing periphery has become so common in the EU that it takes a squint at a map to realise how odd ( and revealing ) it is .
An outside observer might conclude that in the EU , a country 's economic might ( and its credit rating ) correlates with its distance from Brussels and Frankfurt .
Yet this is not so .
Finland is a euro - area country a long way from both cities that can raise ten - year government debt more cheaply than such core countries as France and Belgium .
In practice , talk of peripheral Europe is , deep down , a way of saying something quite different .
When journalists , officials and politicians first began to use the phrase , it was shorthand for southern countries with worrying public finances , plus Ireland , also on the edge of the European map .
Recently , though , Ireland has become a pin-up country , praised by senior officials and politicians for a stoical embrace of austerity after its property bubble burst .
“ Peripheral ” is now no longer a shorthand term , but a euphemism for “ southern ” .
North - south divisions are hardly new in the EU .
When the euro was planned in the 1990s many German politicians wanted a currency zone comprising only Germany , the Benelux countries and France .
France wanted a bigger group , fearing that southern countries outside would devalue , as both Italy and Spain did in 1992 - 93 , making French exports less competitive .
But the Germans suspected France 's southern push had other goals : a monetary union likelier to tolerate both greater fiscal laxity and more political meddling .
In truth , Europe 's south is not a monolithic block .
Charlemagne recently went to Portugal .
Although it is under less pressure than Greece , Portugal 's credit rating was downgraded this week .
It has a big budget deficit and deep structural problems ( more than half of Portuguese adults left school at the minimum leaving age ) .
Portugal suffered a shock when ex-communist countries joined the EU and lured multinational firms that liked cheap labour .
Against that , Portugal has done more to trim its public sector than Greece and Spain and more to reform its pensions than Italy , and recently froze welfare spending until 2013 .
In Lisbon memories are fresh of how northerners were “ surprised ” when Spain , Italy and Portugal met entry conditions for the single currency .
Antonio Vitorino , a minister at the time , recalls a Dutch colleague frostily saying : “ well , now you 've qualified for the euro , you do n't need cohesion funds [ ie , EU regional help ] any more . ”
Yet Portugal did not do its homework to prepare for euro entry , says Mr Vitorino .
After qualifying for low German interest rates overnight , citizens entered a spiral of private debt .
Nor did Portugal reform its labour markets .
“ We all knew from 1999 that there could be asymmetric shocks in the euro zone , ” says Mr Vitorino , later an EU justice commissioner .
But Germany “ refused to discuss ” the strains that might be caused by differing levels of economic development .
Today 's north - south divisions are sharper , more populist , and carry greater risks .
It is no political mystery why the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , has taken such a hard line on a Greek bail - out and hinted that the worst - behaved countries should face expulsion from the euro .
German voters are strongly opposed to paying for Greece to avoid default , and Germany 's constitution also sets legal hurdles to any bail - out that might threaten the euro 's stability .
German virtue against Greek vice
In politics arguments have special force when they are easy to grasp and reflect long - held prejudices .
The German debate on Greece has been shaped by the fact that some Greeks can retire ten years earlier than Germans , and by the statistical fraud carried out by previous Greek governments to disguise their budget deficit .
From this , it is but a short step to German headlines calling Greeks “ swindlers in the euro zone ” ( triggering Greek headlines about Nazi crimes and gold - pinching in the second world war ) .
Such name - calling ignores the human complexity of Europe .
Greece has been badly governed for years , with successive governments handing out jobs for life , early retirement and lucrative contracts .
But such clientelism came about partly because the country was harshly ruled for many years .
Socialist rulers expanded the public sector in the 1980s partly to bring leftist citizens back into the mainstream after decades of exclusion and repression by the right .
Jobs for life were granted partly to stop new governments sacking their predecessor 's favourites .
Such history matters .
From the north , southerners handed jobs for life by political patrons look privileged .
From the south , those public - sector workers feel more like victims , whose low - paid jobs are just compensation for past ills .
( Portugal 's public sector grew partly to absorb 800,000 citizens who arrived after its colonial empire collapsed in 1974 . )
Europe is going to need more empathy if the euro is to hold together .
The hard work of returning to true convergence will be impossible without voters ' consent .
As Europe faces that task , no economy , north or south , can be considered peripheral .

“ The public school system has been described as the best sucker list in America .
Because of the delivery power of the attendance officer , educational policy is highly vulnerable to use by special interests to forward their personal and public causes .
Sooner or later , most social reformers get around to trying to influence what is taught and how . ”
Francis Keppel , former United States Commissioner of Education1
The social reformers are now in charge .
While the public is preoccupied with stopping federalized health care , job killing environmental regulation and other ambitious extensions of federal power , the take - over of K - 12 education is underway .
Rahm Emanuel ’s oft - quoted advice about crisis and opportunity comes to mind .
The crisis is a stagnant , reform - averse education system .
This president , a social reformer and self - described progressive , is not one to waste an opportunity .
And what an opportunity it is !
Historical amnesia regarding the Founders and the Constitution is already advanced .
A national curriculum could accelerate the process and hasten the progressives ’ nirvana .
Using education for political ends is hardly a new concept .
20th century history is replete with despots who viewed education as a way to achieve their goals and , not incidentally , hold on to power .
Abraham Lincoln understood it , “ The philosophy of the schoolroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next . ”
Joseph Stalin was less sanguine , “ Education is a weapon , ” he said , “ whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed . ”
National standards are aimed at transferring state authority over education to Washington .
The carrot for the national standards ’ stick is the 4.35 billion allocated to “ Race to The Top ” ( RTTT ) in the Stimulus Bill .
Eligibility to compete for a share of RTTT gold is contingent upon the states ’ acceptance of the standards .
Putting RTTT in the Stimulus Bill rather than in the rewrite of No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) avoided legislative discussion .
Count another slick maneuver by an administration famous for them .
Although the standards are advertised as state - led and voluntary because they are funded and promoted by the National Governors Association and the Council of State Chief School Officers , the reality is different .
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan recently announced that approval of the standards would also be linked to reauthorization of NCLB , and an even bigger pot of money .
At a time when most states are in fiscal disarray , that ’s “ an offer they ca n’t refuse . ”
Duncan also said that the government would provide $ 350 million to develop tests tied to the standards .
The sucker list beckons and not for the first time .
During the 1930s , the American educational establishment embraced progressive education .
It became rooted in the teacher training institutions where , in its various permutations , it is entrenched today .
The unifying theme being that to prepare students to remedy society ’s inequalities , they must be inculcated with the proper belief system .
A new , “ child - centered ” approach flooded the nation ’s schools requiring a more permissive classroom in which children pursue topics of interest to them .
Structured curriculum flew out the window along with American history , civics , phonics and geography .
In came a plethora of progressive nostrums , among them whole language , new math , and a social studies curriculum emphasizing the need for government planning and regulation ; the primacy of the group over the individual ; and a pervasive relativism that proclaims all values equal and subject to change according to societal needs .
Textbook publishers have been complicit .
In 2006 , Gilbert C. Sewall of the American Textbook Council , 2 explained how it all works to a Senate committee .
“ Publishers cater to pressure groups for whom history textbook content is an extension of a broader political or cultural cause .
They make books whose content is meant to suit the sensitivities of groups and causes more interested in self - promotion than in historical fact , scholarly appraisal , or balance . …
The collaboration of educational publishers with pressure groups and textbook censors is disturbing .
Determining what history children will learn , who will be heroes and villains , what themes will dominate , and what message will be sent are crucial subtexts in civic education .
At worst , biased instructional materials are undermining students ’ appreciation for America and citizenship . ”
Any protests from parents and scholars were mostly ignored until 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik .
Fear that America was falling behind in science and math produced a brief attempt to return to fundamentals .
It also provided an opportunity for education lobbyists to expand federal education funding by linking it to national defense .
Until then , Congress had been unwilling to fund general education , presumably in deference to the Constitution , which reserves education to the states ( 10th Amendment ) .
When Congress passed the National Defense in Education Act in 1958 the federal relationship to education changed .
For more than 50 years , under various titles , Congress appropriated ever - larger sums of money to improve education .
Ironically , much of that money has been used to promote progressive theories and goals , thanks to like - minded federal bureaucrats who allocate the funds .
Inflation adjusted per pupil spending tripled in 4 decades , the number of teachers increased 61 percent , enrollment rose about 10 percent .
Test scores stayed flat or declined .
Whether national standards will improve student achievement is very much an open question , contrary to supporters ’ claims .
A CATO Institute report3 explains that empirical support for national standards is weak .
“ First , there simply has not been much comparative research done .
Second , what little has been done has typically focused not simply on national standards , but standards coupled with high stakes for students , something not contemplated , at least publicly , under the Common Core State Standards Initiative . ”
There are very real practical and political reasons why nationally imposed standards wo n’t improve education outcomes and are more likely to result in mandated mediocrity .
As the CATO report points out , the vast array of well - healed educational special interest groups , ( teacher unions , professional associations , think tanks , political and education advocacy groups , publishers and other vendors etc. ) , are certain to use their considerable lobbying powers ( and political muscle ) to shape the standards to serve their particular financial and political interests .
Many of these groups oppose rigorous standards because they want to avoid the political and job consequences when students fail .
But perhaps the greatest barrier to demanding standards is that they conflict with the egalitarian nature of progressivism .
How can there be social justice when some students excel and others do n’t ?
( We already have schools that frown on competitive sports and protect students ’ “ self esteem ” by refusing to name valedictorians . )
The latest proclamation by Secretary of Education Duncan , that the Office of Civil Rights will open “ equity ” investigations into individual schools , exemplifies the conflict .
Duncan wants the government to ensure “ that low - income Latino and African American students ” have the same access to Advanced Placement classes as do other students .
But it is not ethnicity that keeps black and Latino pupils out of AP courses , it is the schools they attend that make them less likely than white and Asian students to possess the academic skills needed to succeed in AP classes .
If the investigations determine the numbers are deficicent , will the remedy be a quota system like that used for college admissions ?
Or will principals avoid the problem by allowing poorly prepared students to enroll in AP classes .
And what effect is either remedy likely to have on students and on the quality of AP courses ?
Another outcome , perhaps the more plausible one , is outlined in the text of a letter from Marc Tucker to Hillary Clinton on the eve of Bill Clinton ’s 1992 election .
Tucker is president of the National Center on Education and the Economy and an advisor to the U. S. Department of Education on how to implement the Common Core Standards and Race to the Top .
The letter discusses the Clinton educational agenda , lays out a plan for imposing National Standards , and much , much more .
Tucker writes ,
“ We think the great opportunity you have is to remold the entire American System for human resources development … ”
Tucker recommends “ a national — not federal — human resources development system … a national system of education in which curriculum , pedagogy , examinations , and teacher education and licensure systems are all linked to the national standards , a system that rewards students who meet the national standards with further education and good jobs …. ”
It would be “ a seamless web that literally extends from cradle to grave and is the same system for everyone .
… labor market boards ” would be “ established at the local , state and federal levels to coordinate the systems for job training , postsecondary professional and technical education , adult basic education , job matching and counseling . ” 4
Tucker warns , however , that “ Radical changes in attitudes , values and beliefs are required to move any combination of these agendas , ” and he provides suggestions to bring these about .
In the brave new world of Tucker ’s description , we are no longer individuals with plans and dreams of our own , we are human resources to be allocated as determined by the needs of the global economy and by those who know what is best for us .
In 1840 , Alexis De Tocqueville ( Democracy In America ) thought about how despotism might overtake a democracy .
He warned that should citizens become preoccupied with procuring “ petty and paltry pleasures ” they would be at risk .
He described :
“ … an immense and tutelary power , which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate .
That power is absolute , minute , regular , provident , and mild .
It would be like the authority of a parent … .
It provides for their security , foresees and supplies their necessities , facilitates their pleasures , manages their principal concerns , directs their industry … .
After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will , the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community .
It covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated rules , minute and uniform … .
The will of man is not shattered , but softened , bent , and guided … .
It does not tyrannize , but it compresses , enervates , extinguishes , and stupefies a people , till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals , of which the government is the shepherd … .
It is vain to summon a people who have been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power ; this rare and brief exercise of their free choice … will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking , feeling , and acting for themselves , and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity . ”
But I digress .
Given the statist proclivities of the present administration and its disregard , if not contempt , for the democratic process , the drive for a national curriculum will persist , even with public resistance , ( if there is any ) .
It ’s doubtful if many people will have the time or inclination to read the proposed Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History / Social Studies and Science now available for review , and they will need to hurry .
Only three weeks have been allotted for public input before the standards are finalized .
Critics have called them “ inexplicit , generic , broadly stated , ” and “ an empty set of skill - based benchmarks . ”
No doubt the standards were contrived to avoid the controversies that doomed previous attempts .
In any case , their content is irrelevant .
The standards are just the bait .
The switch comes later .

One of the most widely - discussed parts of Google 's scoring has always been PageRank .
That " secret ingredient " is hardly a secret .
Here it is .
That early paper not only gave the formula for PageRank , but mentioned many of the other signals in Google 's ranking , including anchor text , the location of words within documents , the relative proximity of query words in a document , the size and type of fonts used , the raw HTML of each page , and capitalization of words .
Google has continued to publish literally hundreds of research papers over the years .
Those papers reveal many of the " secret formulas " for how Google works and document infrastructure that Google uses .
Some of these papers have spurred not only open - source projects but entire companies in their own right .
When Jordan 's government - supplied water got too dirty to use , farmer Khaireddin Shukri decided to make his own .
In 2002 , Mr. Shukri spent $ 250,000 to build a small desalination and purification plant for Modern Valley Farms , which he managed in the Jordan Valley .
While it was a significant investment , it allowed him to reuse the valley 's abundant brackish water and sell his produce in foreign markets with stricter health requirements .
Today , the farm provides fresh salads for all McDonald 's outlets in Jordan , and Shukri has moved on to another venture that exports premium produce to Europe .
His embrace of a high - tech , value - added business model offers an example for how sustainable water practices can enable farms to prosper in one of the world 's driest countries .
" The most limiting factor in desert farming is water , " says Shukri .
" If we do n't know how to manage the water we wo n't survive . "
A dangerous combination
Jordan is already consuming more than its renewable water resources , and as its population and economy grow , the need to economize and find new sources of water is becoming more urgent .
The latest International Panel on Climate Change predicted that the Middle East region is likely to face both a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperatures – a dangerous combination for Jordan , and countries like it , which are already water - poor and at significant risk of desertification .
With many blaming agriculture as a chief culprit in the nation 's water shortages , Shukri 's approach offers a ray of hope – and a rebuttal to those who say Jordan should stop exporting produce to preserve its limited resources .
Irrigated agriculture accounts for 64 percent of annual water use in Jordan .
That 's down from 75 percent in 1996 .
But farms produce only 3.1 percent of Jordan 's gross domestic product and are responsible for only 2.7 percent of local employment .
Farmers dispute these government statistics , but even they admit farms waste water made cheap by government subsidies and illegally drilled wells .
There 's long been talk of raising water prices in line with the resource 's actual value , but many farmers , already working on thin margins , have been resistant to the idea .
Some farmers grow thirsty crops such as bananas that sell for a pittance .
Even staples , like tomatoes and cucumbers , often go to market at prices lower than the cost of the water it takes to grow them .
" We 're planting so much ... the prices of that produce goes really , really low , " explains Abdel Rahman Sultan of Friends of the Earth Middle East , an environmental advocacy group .
Tomatoes sell for an average of 8.5 cents per pound , according to government figures .
By contrast , Shukri makes a healthy profit with the patented Coregeo Tenderstem broccoli that he grows and packages :
Three kilograms ( 6.6 pounds ) of broccoli takes only about a cubic meter of desalinated water – which costs between 30 and 60 cents – to produce .
Shukri makes about $ 2.50 per pound selling the broccoli to British supermarkets .
Sustainability in question
But some question whether any farm exports are sustainable , given Jordan 's shortage of water .
" We just simply cannot accept [ exporting produce ] no matter how much you charge , " says Mr. Sultan .
" We 're in the middle of the desert !
We 're at the center of climate change .
We cannot afford to lose our water just for the sake of making a few people richer . "
Some of Jordan 's most productive farmers say this antifarm attitude is part of the problem , because the government does n't require practices that could make agriculture more sustainable .
They say that water waste is at more than 50 percent .
Farmers like Shukri are trying to show that , with proper management , agriculture can not only survive but profit , and can support the higher cost of using nontraditional water sources .
It 's true that running a high - tech operation requires serious investment , as well as work to maintain the exacting health and environmental standards demanded by Europeans .
But that investment produces jobs in administration , research and development , and materials and packaging , argues Shukri .
Souheil Marto , who took over Modern Valley Farms when Shukri left in 2008 says that he has 12 staff members just to do paperwork for health certifications .
The farm also employs 300 local women in its fields and processing plants , as well as some foreign workers .
Mr. Marto recently moved into packaged foods ; his first coup was the salads for McDonald's .
" Now we are looking into adding more things to that , because the more you go in this direction , the more value you can add to your product , " he says .
Nearby , Shukri and a partner have started their own venture , called DAMCO .
Concerned about his farm's carbon footprint , Shukri is researching freshness bags that will allow him to transport produce to Europe by truck , rather than air .
Marto is looking for money to build a wind or solar generator on his farm .
The two farmers may be anomalies for now .
But they argue that if farm water - use practices do n't change , Jordan 's future in agriculture will be in doubt .

The Obama administration ’s main school improvement initiative has spurred education policy changes in states across the nation , but it is meeting with some last - minute resistance as the first deadline for applications arrives Tuesday .
Thousands of school districts in California , Ohio and other states have declined to participate , and teachers ’ unions in Michigan , Minnesota and Florida have recommended that their local units not sign on to their states ’ applications .
Several rural states , including Montana , have said they will not apply , at least for now , partly because of the emphasis on charter schools , which would draw resources from small country schools .
And Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said last week that his state would not compete for the $ 700 million that the biggest states are eligible to win in the $ 4 billion program , known as Race to the Top , calling it an intrusion on states ’ rights .
Still , about 40 states were rushing to complete applications for the Tuesday deadline , the first in the two - stage competition .
The last - minute opposition is unlikely to derail efforts by most of those states to win some of the federal money .
Partisanship did n’t take a complete backseat on September 11 , 2001 , as there were some murmurs during the first few hours of media coverage about which side ’s administration could be more at fault .
But even five years after Jon Stewart famously told CNN ’s dueling Crossfire hosts to “ stop , stop , stop , stop hurting America , ” some folks ca n’t stop politicizing tragic events and claiming them for or against their respective sides .

A disturbed Texas man deliberately crashed a small plane into a building containing a federal tax office Thursday in an apparent suicide attempt , after setting his house on fire , officials said .
Two fighter jets were scrambled out of a nearby airport in response to the incident , which officials said did not appear to be linked to terrorism .
“ This was apparently – according to an official – a deliberate act , ” CNN anchor Tony Harris said .
“ Joseph Andrew Stack is the name of the pilot . ”
The plane struck the second floor of the seven story building in Austin , Texas about 10:00 am ( 1600 GMT ) and burst into flames in a massive explosion that forced people to flee out of the windows , witnesses and officials said .
A rambling suicide note signed by Joe Stack was discovered online that blamed the government for an unfair tax system which he apparently said ruined his life .
The unverifiable note concluded that “ violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer ” and said he hoped his actions would cause a “ knee - jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are . ”

In a provocative column at Business Insider titled “ The Austin Texas Bombing Is A HUGE Image Blow To The ‘ Tea Party ’ Right , ” Joe Weisenthal is strikingly honest about the partisanship warfare ( and a bit more fair - minded than the title might indicate ) .
“ It ’s not clear who the Austin , TX plane crash pilot Joe Stack hung out with , but let ’s just put it out there and stop playing pretend : this is not good publicity for the ‘ Tea Party ’ right , and no , we ’re not saying Stack was a tea partier , ” Wiesenthal writes .
“ But in his insane manifesto he rails against the IRS , bailouts , and , well , all of the right wing ’s typical enemies . ”
Is this fair to the right ?
No .
Will some of the media use this as a chance to smear the “ tea partiers ” ?
Sure .
But we ’re not talking about what ’s fair , we ’re just talking about what happens .
The bottom line is that this event is to Obama what Oklahoma City was to Bill Clinton , and Oklahoma City helped Clinton a lot in the dark days after the 1994 election .

At the conservative - leaning Free Republic a number of commenters worry that the incident will tarnish the Tea Party movement and / or call Stack liberal because he mentioned opposition to President George W. Bush .
NavyCanDo writes ,
“ This sounds like the rantings of the loonatic Mike Malloy from Leftist talk radio show .
He over the last few nights has been saying violence is the only solution .
Hard to believe this guy is alloud to be on the air . ”

In response to TruthHound ’s “ And this commie scumbag gets his spew posted to FREE REPUBLIC !?!?
Why ? ” , VRWCmember responds ,
So that when the drive - by media tries to spin selected quotes from the screed as a “ tax - protestor ” ( like those Tea Party extremists ) , we already have the truth that this guy is no right - winger , but rather a wealth - envying class warrior tax - dodge scammer ( probably jealous that TurboTax Timmy could get away with it but he could n’t ) , anti-religion , anti-Bush , anti-capitalist nutbag who was probably a hope and change voter .
Notice in his screed that he bemoans the fact that congress could bail out the bankers and the automakers , but could n’t find a way to pass universal healthcare .
His SPEW NEEDS TO BE POSTED so that people can see he was no right - winger .
Do n’t let the media spin this guy as a Tea Party activists .
You KNOW they will try .
NavyCanDo agrees , “ Probbaly to counter the missinformation .
Look at the first few hundred post on the original breaking news .
It was greared he was going to be a Tea Party person and that the media was going to use that against conservatives everywhere . ”

Falcon countdown dress rehearsal a ' great success '
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 26 , 2010
Taking advantage of a picturesque day in the Sunshine State , the privately - developed Falcon 9 rocket came to life Friday afternoon as engineers loaded 75,000 gallons of propellant aboard the vehicle during a simulated countdown .
The Falcon 9 vents liquid oxygen late Friday afternoon .
Friday 's countdown wet dress rehearsal was " the smoothest test we have conducted to date , " said Tim Buzza , the Falcon 9 launch director .
The booster has spent the last week at Complex 40 after being assembled inside a hangar at the pad 's southern perimeter .
Stormy weather and high winds earlier this week pushed the countdown rehearsal to Friday .
After powering up the 15 - story rocket , the launch team verified all systems were functioning , performed engine purge checks and cleared workers from the launch pad .
About 29 managers and engineers inside SpaceX's Launch Control Center oversaw the countdown , which began at the T - minus 2 hour , 30 minute point .
The transporter / erector , also serving as an umbilical tower and strongback , was partially tilted away from the rocket around 1:30 p.m. EST .
Liquid oxygen started flowing into the two - stage Falcon 9 launcher at about 3 p.m. EST .
The super - cold oxidizer was loaded into the rocket until the first and second stage tanks were 98 percent full , then the launch team topped off the liquid oxygen to liftoff levels , where they remained throughout the countdown , according to SpaceX .
The shining white rocket was coated in ice after liquid oxygen was placed on - board .
The Falcon 9 was next filled with kerosene fuel , which powers Merlin engines on both stages of the rocket .
In the final 10 minutes of the countdown , the Falcon 9's navigation system was aligned for launch , the rocket was transferred to internal power , the engine steering systems were checked out , and propellant tanks were pressurized at T - minus 40 seconds , according to Buzza .
The countdown clock was stopped at T - minus 10 seconds around 5:15 p.m. EST using the pad abort system .
After safing the rocket and launch pad , SpaceX drained the Falcon 9 of propellant and raised the strongback next to the launcher .
" It was a good day , " said Elon Musk , SpaceX 's founder and CEO .
Engineers will spend the next few days carefully reviewing data from Friday 's test .
If the results prove satisfactory , SpaceX plans to fuel the rocket again in the coming weeks for another countdown rehearsal that will end with a brief ignition of the Falcon 's nine first stage engines for about three - and - a - half seconds .
Unlike Friday 's practice countdown , which was unannounced , the engine test will send an unmistakable roar across the Florida spaceport .
The launch date for the inaugural Falcon 9 rocket mission remains unclear , but it is not expected to occur before March 22 .
The demonstration flight 's launch window opens at 11 a.m. EDT each day .
SpaceX is developing the Falcon 9 rocket and a spacecraft named Dragon under a NASA contract to deliver supplies to the International Space Station beginning next year .
Since its founding in 2002 , SpaceX has launched the smaller Falcon 1 rocket five times , reaching orbit twice .
The company is considered a frontfrunner among commercial firms competing for the job of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station under NASA 's new emphasis on private human spaceflight .
Kentucky Fried Chicken has pulled a controversial Australian cricket ad and apologised for " any misinterpretation " as furious debate raged in the American media about whether it was racist .
The commercial , featuring a white Australian cricket fan offering fried chicken to West Indies supporters , has been pulled from the air in Australia .
" KFC Australia is removing the television advertisement that was being run in conjunction with the Australian cricket season , " the fast - food giant 's US head office announced .
" We apologise for any misinterpretation of the ad as it was not meant to offend anyone . "

If you want to learn more about the thematic development in these two films , check out my original blog entries for Razor and The Plan .
They detail my compositional process and identify the major theme unique to each movie .
And , in case you missed it before , here ’s a great behind - the - scenes video of my session with Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian , recording the theme from “ The Plan . ”
BSG : The Plan and Razor will eventually be available on iTunes as well .
My sources tell me this should happen on Tuesday .
However , considering my luck with iTunes lately , it will more likely occur sometime before the sun expands and envelopes the planet . :)
Seriously , though … an iTunes release is imminent .
Literally years in the making , this album contains music I wrote before and after the tracks on the Season 4 album , making it the perfect , book - ending companion piece .
I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did making it , and I ’m eager to hear what you think of it .
I know you have all been waiting patiently for this for years .
The wait is almost over ! :)

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. appeals court struck down on Friday limits on individual contributions to independent political advocacy groups that want to spend money directly to support or oppose candidates for president and Congress .
The unanimous ruling by nine federal appellate judges held the limits violated constitutional free - speech rights under the First Amendment .
The decision cited the Supreme Court ’s ruling in January in another campaign finance case .
The two rulings together are expected to unleash a flood of money ahead of the congressional elections in November and in other political campaigns such as the 2012 presidential contest .
Two months ago , the high court ruled 5 - 4 that corporations can spend freely to support or oppose federal candidates on the grounds limits violated free - speech rights .
President Barack Obama opposed the decision for giving special interests more power .
The appeals court based its decision in large part on the Supreme Court ’s ruling .
It struck down limits on how much money the nonprofit groups can collect from donors for political ads and other campaign spending .
Under the limits , an individual can give up to $ 5,000 per year in contributions to the groups that plan to use the money to support or oppose a federal candidate .
The decision was a victory for a group called SpeechNow.org , which said it intended to support candidates for federal office that share its views on the right to free speech and freedom of assembly .
The contribution limits violated the First Amendment by preventing individuals from donating in excess of the limits and by prohibiting SpeechNow.org from accepting donations in excess of the limits , Chief Judge David Sentelle said .
The ruling was a defeat for the Federal Election Commission , a federal agency in charge of oversight involving the campaign finance laws .
It adopted the regulations at issue in 2005 .
The appeals court upheld reporting requirements covering donors and spending by such groups .
The Supreme Court upheld similar disclosure requirements in January .
“ Requiring disclosure of such information deters and helps expose violations of other campaign finance restrictions , such as those barring contributions from foreign corporations or individuals , ” Sentelle wrote in the 21 - page ruling .
Separately , a three - judge federal court rejected a legal challenge involving the Republican National Committee and upheld long - standing limits on contributions to political parties .
The limits were part of the 2002 campaign - finance law .
Picture Of The Day : Some Fans are Hot , and Some are Not
Nothing beats a sexy female sports fan…or two !
Sometimes it seems as though you can find one in just about any city in the world , rooting for just about any team , whether it be the Boston Bruins , FC Barcelona , or the Florida Gators .
So , with that being said , should we simply assume that all sports cities are havens for hot chicks ?
The answer to that is an emphatic NO !
Unless , of course , you are into fat chicks with gremlin faces and giant saggy tits .
In Liverpool , it appears as though they are .
Or at least you would hope that they are .
Otherwise they may not have much else to chose from .
Shall we assume that this lucky lady is the one banging the team captain ?

Backpack Fever
Duncan Long
Note : A slightly modified version of this article was written in 1989 for American Survival Guide .
A lot has changed since then .
However some of the information may be helpful and this article is therefore being reprinted here .
There 's a lot of confusion about what the term “ survival ” means .
To some , it 's getting through the aftermath of an airplane wreck in a desolate area .
It can mean knowing when to avoid walking in radioactive wastes .
Or , it can mean knowing how to barter with troops in the aftermath of riots , war , and looting .
To others , survival has to do with avoiding danger and knowing how to deal with it when it breaks into your home in the dead of night .
Survival ideas abound and there are as many definitions and strategies as there are survivalists .
Some have good ideas for survival and some have unsound tactics .
Bad ideas can mean extra work or trouble in everyday life ; bad ideas during a survival situation get you killed .
On - the- job training does n't work when you 're dealing with poison and gunfights .
Or survival .
One of the most dangerous ideas- - as far as I 'm concerned - - is that of " backpack fever . "
A " back - pack survivalist " is a survivalist that plans on leaving his home ahead of a disaster and taking to the woods with only what he can carry out with him .
He plans to survive through a strategy that is a sort of cross between the Boy - Scout - in - the- woods and Robinson Crusoe .
The backpack survivalist plans on outrunning danger with a four - wheel drive or a motorcycle and hopes to travel light with a survival kit of everything he might need to cope with the unexpected .
He has n't cached anything in the area he 's headed for because , chances are , he does n't know where he 's headed .
Somehow , he hopes to overcome all odds with a minimum of supplies and a maximum of smarts .
Certainly it is a noble cause ; but it seems like one destined to failure .
And that 's not survival .
( Let 's back up a minute .
Backpack fever - - or bug - outosis- - does makes sense when you 're facing a localized disaster like a derailed train with overturned poisonous gas cars .
A a potential nuclear meltdown , an impending hurricane , or similar disasters where there is a safe place to run to .
During such a time , it makes perfect sense to retreat and come back when things settle down .
Likewise , some people have to work in dangerous areas .
For them , donning a backpack and heading for a retreat that they 've prepared before hand is a viable survival strategy .
These people are n't backpack survivalists . )
Let me make a confession .
Yes , I once was a closet backpack survivalist .
I had an ALICE pack and had it packed with all I could carry .
As I learned more about how to survive , I realized I needed to carry more .
Soon I discover - ed that , just for my family to survive for a very few days , I 'd need a pack mule and / or a hernia operation ...
Something was very wrong .
Probably most beginner survivalists start out the same way .
Things are bad so let 's bug out .
Backpack survivalism is an effort to deal with the possibility of a major disaster .
As backpack survivalists , we make elaborate plans centered around the idea of " bugging out " of the area we live in .
We hope to travel to an area that is safer than the one we 're in and plan on living off the land or on some survival supplies we 've hidden in the area .
On the home front , we carefully prepare a stock of supplies that we can quickly cart off in a car or van when things start to look bad .
As more and more plans are made and as ever more survival gear is purchased , the survivalist realizes just how much he needs to cope with in order to survive .
If he is any sort of realist , he soon amasses enough gear to warrant a truck or- - more likely - - a moving van just for carrying the survival equipment .
( And do n't laugh , there are survivalists who have large trucks for just such use . )
Some brave souls continue to make more elaborate plans and some of these survivalists may be able to pull off their plans .
Those who have really thought things out and have spared no expenses may manage to survive with a bug - out strategy .
But I think there are more logical - - and less expensive- - ways to survive a large crisis .
Forget all your preconceived notions for a minute .
Imagine that there is a national emergency and you are an outside observer ?
What happens if a nuclear attack is eminent , an economic collapse has occurred , or a dictator has taken over and is ready to round up all malcontents ( with survivalists at the top of the list ) ?
Situations change with time .
The survivalist movement - - and backpack fever - - first started up when gas guzzler cars were about all that anyone drove .
That meant that a survivalist with some spare gasoline could outdis - tance his unprepared peers and get to a retreat that was far from the maddening crowd , as it were .
( Read some of Mel Tappan 's early writing on survival retreats .
His ideas are good but many have been undone with the new , fuel - efficient cars . )
With cars getting 30 or even 40 miles per gallon , it is n't rare for a car to be able to travel half way across a state on less than a tank of gasoline .
The exodus from cities or trouble spots will be more limited by traffic snarls than lack of gasoline even if the gas stations are completely devoid of their liquid fuel .
Too , there are a lot of people thinking about what to do if the time for fleeing comes .
A lot of people will be headed for the same spots .
( Do n't laugh that off , either .
In my area , every eighth person has confided his secret retreat spot to me .
And about half of them are all headed for the same spot : an old missile silo devoid of water and food .
I suspect that the battle at the gates of the old missile base will rival the Little Big Horn . )
No matter how out - of - the- way their destination , most survivalists are kidding themselves if they think others wo n't be headed for their hideaway spot along with them .
There are few places in the US which are n't accessible to anyone with a little driving skill and a good map .
Too , there are few places which are n't in grave danger during a nuclear war , Pandemic , or national social unrest .
Though most nuclear war survival books can give you a nice little map showing likely targets , they do n't tell you some essential information .
Like what the purpose of the attack will be .
The enemy may not be aiming for military targets that day ; a blackmail threat might begin by hitting the heart of the farmland or a number of cities before demanding the surrender of the country being attacked .
The target areas on the maps might be quite safe .
And the maps show where the missiles land IF they all enjoy 100 percent accuracy and reliability .
Anyone know of such conditions in war ?
With Soviet machinery !?
Targets may be relatively safe places to be in .
Added to this is the fact that some areas can be heavily contaminated or completely free of contamination depending on the wind directions in the upper atmosphere .
Crystal ball in your survival gear ?
But let 's ignore all the facts thus far for a few moments and assume that a backpack survivalist has found an ideal retreat and is planning to go there in the event of a national disaster ...
What next ?
His first concern should be that he 'll have a hard time taking the supplies he needs with him .
A nuclear war might mean that it will be impossible to grow food for at least a year and foraging is out as well since animals and plants may be contaminated extensively .
An economic collapse would n't be much better .
It might discourage the raising of crops ; no money , no sales except for the barter to keep a small farm family going .
With large corporations doing much of our farming these days , it is not unreasonable to expect a major famine coming on the heals of an economic collapse .
Raising food would be a good way to attract starving looters from miles around .
Ever try to pack a year 's supply of food for a family into a small van or car ?
There is n't much room left over .
But the backpack survivalist needs more than just food .
If he lives in a cold climate ( or thinks there might be something to the nuclear winter theory ) then he 'll need some heavy clothing .
Rifles , medicine , ammunition , tools , and other supplies will also increase what he 'll need to be taking or which he 'll have to hide away at his retreat site .
Shelter ?
Building a place to live ( in any style other than early - American caveman ) takes time .
If he builds a cabin beforehand , he may find it vandalized or occupied when he gets to his retreat ; if he does n't build it beforehand , he may have to live in his vehicle or a primitive shelter of some sort .
Thus , a major problem is to get a large enough vehicle to carry everything he needs as well as to live in .
History has shown that cities empty themselves without official evacuation orders when things look bad .
It happened in WW II and has even happened in the US during approaching hurricanes , large urban fires , and nuclear reactor problems .
So there 's a major problem of timing which the backpack survivalist must contend with .
He has to be packed and ready to go with all members of his family at the precise moment he learns of the disaster !
The warning he gets that warrants evacuating an area will have to be acted on quickly if he's to get out ahead of the major traffic snarls that will quickly develop .
A spouse at work or shopping or kids across town at school means he 'll either have to leave them behind or be trapped in the area he 's in .
A choice not worth having to make .
Unless he 's got a hot - line from the White House , the backpack survivalist will not hear the bad news much ahead of everyone else .
If he does n't act immediately , he 'll be trapped out on the road and get a first - hand idea of what grid - lock is like if he 's in an urban area .
Even out on the open road , far away from a city , an interstate can become hectic following a ballgame ...
Imagine what it would be like if everyone were driving for their lives , some cars were running out of fuel ( and the occupants trying to stop someone for a ride ) , and the traffic laws were being totally ignored while the highway patrol tried to escape along with everyone else .
Just trying to get off or on major highways might become impossible .
If things bog down , how long can the backpack survivalist keep those around from helping to unload his truck - load of supplies that they 'll be in bad need of ?
Telling them they should have prepared ahead of time wo n't get many sympathetic words .
Even on lightly - traveled roadways , how safe would it be to drive around in a vehicle loaded with supplies ?
Our backpack survivalist will need to defend himself .
But let 's suppose that he 's thought all this out .
He has a large van , had the supplies loaded in it , managed to round every member of his family up beforehand , somehow got out of his area ahead of the mob , is armed to the teeth , and does n't need to take an interstate route .
When he reaches his destination , his troubles are far from over .
The gridlock and traffic snarls wo n't stop everyone .
People will slowly be coming out of heavily populated areas and most of them will have few supplies .
They will have weapons ( guns are one of the first things people grab in a crisis according to civil defense studies ) and the evacuees will be desperate .
How many pitched battles will the survivalist 's family be able to endure ?
How much work- - or even sleep - - can he get when he 's constantly on the lookout to repel those who may be trying to get a share of his supplies ?
This assumes that he gets to where he 's going ahead of everyone else .
He might not though .
If he has to travel for long , he may discover squatters on his land or find that some local person has staked out his retreat area for their own .
There wo n't be any law to help out ; what happens next ?
Since ( according to military strategists ) our backpack survivalist needs about three times as many people to take an area as to defend it , he will need to have some numbers with him and expect to suffer some casualties .
Does that sound like a good way to survive ?
What about the local people that do n't try to take over his retreat before he gets there ?
Will they be glad to see another stranger move into the area to tax their limited supplies ?
Or will they be setting up roadblocks to turn people like the backpack survivalist away ?
But let 's just imagine that somehow he 's discovered a place that does n't have a local population and where those fleeing cities are n't able to get to .
What happens when he gets to his retreat ?
How good does he need to be at hunting and fishing ?
One reason mankind went into farming was that hunting and fishing do n't supply enough food for a very large population nor do they work during times of drought or climatic disruption .
What does he do when he runs out of ammunition or game ?
What happens if the streams become so contaminated that he can't safely eat what he catches ?
Can he stake out a large enough area to guarantee that he wo n't depleat it of game so that the next year is not barren of animals ?
Farming ?
Unless he finds some unclaimed farm machinery and a handy storage tank of gasoline at his retreat , he 'll hardly get off first base .
Even primitive crop production requires a plow and work animals ( or a lot of manpower ) to pull the blade .
No plow , no food for him or domestic animals .
And domestic animals do n't grow on trees .
Again , unless he just happens to find some cows waiting for him at his retreat , he 'll be out of luck .
( No one has packaged freeze - dried cows or chickens - - at least , not in a form you can reconstitute into living things ) .
Intensive gardening ?
Maybe .
But even that takes a lot of special tools , seeds , know - how , and good weather .
Can he carry what he needs and have all the skills that can be developed only through experience ?
Even if he did , he might not have any food to eat .
Pestilence goes hand in hand with disasters .
Our modern age has forgotten this .
But during a time when chemical factories are n't churning out the insecticides and pest poisons we 've come to rely on , our backpack survivalist should be prepared for waves of insects flooding into any garden he may create .
How good is he at making insecticides ?
Even if he carries out a large quantity of chemicals to his retreat , how many growing seasons will they last ?
Did he truck out a lot of gasoline and an electrical generator with him ?
No ?
Do you REALLY think he can create an alcohol still from scratch in the middle of no- where without tools or grain ?
Then he'd better write off communications , lighting , and all the niceties of the 20th Century after his year 's supply of batteries wear out and his vehicle 's supply of gasoline conks out .
I 'm afraid we 've only scratched the surface though .
Thus far things have been going pretty well .
What happens when things get really bad ?
How good is he at removing his spouse 's appendix - - without electric lights , pain killers , or antiseptic conditions ?
Campfire dental work , anyone ?
How good is he at making ammunition ?
Clothing ?
Shoes ?
I think you 'll have to agree that this hardly seems like survival in style .
Even if our backpack survivalist is able to live in the most spartan of conditions and has the know - how to create plenty out of the few scraps around him , he 'll never have much of a life ahead of him .
Camping out is fun for a few days .
Living in rags like a hunted animal does n't sound like an existence to be aimed for .
The bottom line with backpack fever is that , with any major disaster that is n't extremely localized , running is a panic reaction not a survival strategy .
Running scared is seldom a good survival technique and backpack fever during any but a localized disaster ( like a flood or chemical spill ) looks like it would be a terminal disease with few , rare exceptions .
So what 's the alternative ?
A number of writers , from Kurt Saxon to Howard Ruff to Mel Tappan , have already suggested it but I think that it bears a retelling .
What they 've said is this : get yourself situated in a small community that could get by without outside help if things came unglued nationally or internationally .
Find a spot that allows you to live in the life - style you 've grown accustomed to ( and a community that allows you to carry on your livelihood ) but which has the ability to grow its own food and protect its people from the unprepared ( or looters ) that might drift in from surrounding cities during a crisis .
This spot has the ability to carry on trade within its borders and has a number of people who can supply specialized products or professional skills .
An area with two thousand to five thousand people in it along with a surrounding farm community would be ideal but sizes can vary a lot according to the climate and city .
Ideally such a town would have its own power plant with a few small industries along with the usual smattering of doctors , dentists , and other professionals .
This type of community is n't rare in the US .
It 's quite common in almost every state .
You could probably even take a little risk and commute into a city if you must keep your current job .
( In such a case a reverse backpack fever strategy just might work - - you 'd be bugging out to your home . )
Western civilization stepped out of the dark ages when small communities started allowing people to specialize in various jobs .
Rather than each many being his own artisan , farmer , doctor , carpenter , etc. , men started learning to master one job they enjoyed doing .
Each man become more efficient at doing a job and - - through the magic of capitalism - - western culture finally started upward again .
A small modern community like the one suggested above , when faced with a national economic collapse or the aftermath of a nuclear war , would eventually lift itself up the same way .
It would give those who lived in it the same chance for specialization of work and the ability to carry on mutual trade , support , and protection .
Such small communities will be the few light spots in a Neo- Dark Age .
Which place would you rather be : in a cave , wondering where the food for tomorrow would come from , or with a group of people living in their homes , working together to overcome their problems ?
Even the most individualistic of survivalists should n't find the choice too hard to make .

WASHINGTON – Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele is taking his calls to build a “ big tent ” party seriously – with the RNC running up a nearly $ 2,000 tab at a bondage - themed West Hollywood nightclub .
The hard partying on RNC ’s dime was revealed in the committee ’s FEC filings reviewed by the Daily Caller , which examined a February RNC trip to LA .
Included was $ 1,946.25 spent at Voyeur , a “ bondage - themed nightclub featuring topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex . ”
Also expensed was $ 9,099 at the Beverly Hills Hotel and $ 5,596 at the Four Seasons .
Steele was already under fire for a pricey RNC winter meeting in Hawaii costing $ 4,000 .
RNC spokesman Doug Heye denied that Steele had ever visited the club and said they were investigating the cost .
“ The chairman was never at the location in question , he had no knowledge of the expenditure , nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable , ” Heye said in a statement to reporters .
As for Voyeur ’s ambiance , the top listing on reviewing site Yelp states simply : “ Oh. Wow .
Rolled up here with 6 girls around midnight on a Saturday night … Seriously .
This club is amazing .
There are topless “ dancers ” acting out S&M scenes throughout the night on one of the side stages , there ’s a half - naked girl hanging from a net across the ceiling … ”
Cosmic rays are particles that streak through the universe at near - light speed , colliding with giant balls of gas .
But their origins are shrouded in mystery .
Now physicists have uncovered an important clue about where these superfast particles come from .
Advertisement
Physicists used the Fermi telescope to examine how cosmic rays behave when they slam into giant balls of gas that are remnants from supernovas .
Cosmic rays are mostly protons , and when they smash into these remnants , they are bounced around by magnetic fields and produce gamma rays .
The video below dramatizes what the Fermi saw , looking at different kinds of emissions from three middle - aged supernova remnants called W51C , W44 , and IC 443 .
Scientists compared these emissions to those from relatively young supernova remnant Cas A , which is 330 years old .

On Monday , physicist Stefan Funk explained what his team discovered to the American Physical Association .
Symmetry Breaking reports :
Young supernova remnants seem to possess both stronger magnetic fields and the highest - energy cosmic rays .
Stronger fields can keep the highest - energy particles in the remnant 's shock wave long enough to speed them to the energies observed .
" We think that protons accelerated in the remnant are colliding with gas atoms , causing the gamma- ray emission , " Funk said .
An alternative explanation is that fast - moving electrons emit gamma rays as they fly past the nuclei of gas atoms .
" For now , we can't distinguish between these possibilities , but we expect that further observations with Fermi will help us to do so , " he added .
Either way , these observations validate the notion that supernova remnants act as enormous accelerators for cosmic particles .

So it would appear that supernova remnants are the source of ultrafast cosmic rays .
They may not be the origin of these freakishly fast protons , but they are definitely speeding them up as they pass by .
Now we know where cosmic ray harvesters will need to park to capture their quarry .

This week , we interview Blaft Publications , publisher of Tamil Pulp Fiction .
How did you get involved in the anthology ?
Rakesh Khanna : I moved to Chennai from California in 1998 to do a master ’s in mathematics .
I did n’t know any Tamil , and it ’s a tough language to learn , so in attempt to learn a little more about the place I was living in , I tried to read some Tamil writing in translation .
But all I could find was either really heavy literature about serious social issues , or else long and intricately plotted historical epics about the Chola Empire , and I could n’t manage to wade through any of it .
What I needed at that time was something to give my mind a break from partial differential equations , something fun and fast - paced .
And apparently they just did n’t translate stuff like that .
I knew it existed , though , because I kept seeing these ten - rupee Tamil pocket novels , strung up on a nylon cord above the counter at the tea stall , and the titles were written in English in Tamil script ( which I did manage to learn ) : things like Super Bumper Horror Detective Novel , or Today Crime News : Thrilling !!
And they had these insane covers with photoshop montages of Wes Craven movie stills , Iron Maiden album covers , Hindu religious calendar art , and Tamil TV serial cops .
So I was madly curious .
A few years after college , I met Pritham–here was a fan of Tamil pulp who was totally gung - ho about the project AND could translate .
So we cooked up the plan for the book and she started reading a lot and sending me sample translations .
Pritham Chakravarthy : Like Rakesh said — cook was what I did first when Rashmi [ partner of Rakesh & Blaft ] came over for dinner , which is when she sounded me on the idea .
Well , I was hooked .
But , given my other interests , I had not read any pulp in a long time .
So , I had no clue about the present scene .
I made a quick visit to my sister ’s lending library to check on the most popular in the recent times [ 2006 - 07 ] borrowed a pile and spent the next three months reading pulp .
The process was so absorbing that it was time to revisit my old favorites too .
That was how we were able to get some clue to a period .
On the selection process , I visited four other popular lending libraries , friends in the publishing business and authors for more names .
Like I say in my Translator ’s Note , given my family background , my exposure was limited to approved authors .
For instance , I had never read a Tamilvanan when I was a child .
But my husband grew up on it .
Rakesh himself had collected some ; only because he was seduced by the lurid covers .
I translated many more stories than what appeared in the first volume .
Some we put aside for future volumes , some where discarded because they did not fit into our design , or where too difficult to retain the cultural references without tampering with the original .
Some simply because it was too elaborate and there was no way of checking on the historical accuracy [ like the quasi- historical romance of Chandiliyan ] .
What is about “ pulp ” that appeals to you ?
To you personally , how is Tamil pulp unique from other types of pulp ?
Rakesh :
There are lots of different styles within Tamil pulp … but I think one thing it all has in common is how fast - paced it is .
It totally outstrips American pulp ; each chapter is usually only a page or two long , and each chapter usually has at least one murder or explosion or someone getting eaten by a cheetah or attacked with black magic .
Pritham : Tamil Pulp ?
Well , it is closer [ to ] home .
I know the places they speak about .
After all we did read Holmes without ever knowing if there was indeed a Baker Street , and guzzled Blyton , with no knowledge of what lacrosse was .
Believe me I come from a place where if you know English , then it is infra-dig to be reading Tamil pulp .
It does n’t matter if you are reading the more literati stuff .
Honestly , I was a part of that clan too , until Rakesh made me read them .
Shameful , but true — for a person who is teaching cinema .
Pushpa Thangadurai : 1 . ANTHOLOGY
Regarding ANTHOLOGY
so far as the original story is not abridged or maimed but published as a whole , it is quite in order and does not infringe copywrite act ..
2. PULP FICTION
Ghost stories , fantasy , science fiction can all be put into PULP categories .
But many “ High Brows ” among us will thrash them as trash .
I created lot of stories on this category .
In the West , when Detective and Sex stories came in abundance , literary people used to term them as useless .
After many years , many discussion , and many debates these stories were also considered as literary .
Here in India , these things were settled long ago .
Long Long ago !
That is our genius !
A Novel or KAVYA as it was call constituted Nine RASAMS .
They are SRINGARA
HASYA
KARUNA
RAUDRA ( ANGER )
VEERA
BHAYANAKA
( That gives you fear )
BHIBASTH ( A Drama RASA )
A kind of fear , ( I suppose )
So this is the way our wise ancient people , have looked upon a story .
Our “ High Brow ”s do not know them or bother to know ..
Also the Western and as European Ideologists have said that Short stories originated from India .
Also our tales have depicted about birds and animals taking part as real characters .
I repeat again I kindly note that all these things have been told by American and Europeans Ideologists .
Pritham : Some background for his answer # 1 :
We had some misunderstanding about the fact that we were going to take an excerpt from his novel My Name is Kamala for the anthology … somehow he got the idea that we were going to use the whole thing ( 250 pages ! ) and is still slightly peeved at us .
I think he will be happier now that his complete “ Karate Kavitha ” story is appearing vol .
2 .
Here is a link to explain what he ’s talking about with the rasams in answer # 2 .
Lavie :
Can you tell us a bit more about the format of the books ?
Size , number of pages ?
Are they more like short stories , or full novels , or something in between ?
Also , how are the stories usually told ?
Are they first person , third person ?
Do they follow one hero throughout the story ?
Also , can we get a picture of something like the tea stand Rakesh talked about ?
“ and each chapter usually has at least one murder or explosion or someone getting eaten by a cheetah or attacked with black magic ”
That sounds so awesome , makes me want to write one too !
Rakesh :
These days , pulp “ novels ” ( which are actually more like magazines devoted to one author ’s work , published bi-weekly or monthly ) generally come in a 175 x 95 mm format , usually 96 or 144 pages .
The length of a story can vary widely …
A typical “ novel ” might contain one longish story , what Americans might call a novella , in the 15 K - 20 K word range , with some jokes or readers ’ letters or poems or fan fiction shorts stuffed in at the back .
OR , it might contain two shorter stories of about equal length .
OR , a longer work can be serialized in successive monthly “ novels ” …
Indra Soundar Rajan does this quite frequently .
Some of his stories are really massive and epic , I think the complete Sivamayam is around 200,000 words .
These later get collected and published in a single volume ( or in the case of Sivamayam , 2 volumes ) .
In older days , I think this concept of the monthly publication devoted to one author ’s work was not so common …
Novels ( American usage now ) were serialized in variety magazines .
For instance , Pushpa Thangadorai ’s My Name is Kamala was serialized in Dhinamani Khadir over 43 weeks in 1974 - 75 , and later released as a book .
3rd person storytelling seems most common — Indra Soundar Rajan ’s stories generally follow a single hero ( actually usually a heroine — his stories revolve around Goddess worship and woman power ) , with occasional departures , say , to check out what ’s going on in the villians ’ lair .
Rajesh Kumar ( a spectacularly prolific Tamil crime writer who has currently got a bid in with the Guinness Book to dethrone L. Ron Hubbard as the world ’s most published author ) has a standard trick of switching scenes back and forth between two or three sets of characters , who seem to be unrelated until the mystery wraps up at the end .
Pushpa Thangadorai has done some first - person stuff , including My Name is Kamala , an excerpt of which is included in our anthology .
Also , detective writers Suba ( two authors , one name ) have a series of novels starring a retired army colonel hero , and those are all written in first person .
Pritham :
Wow … this is a lot of information .
Single have been published since 1920s .
Besides these singles are those serialized in popular magazines .
It is only after DTP became cheap and available to many — in the early 80s , did single novels prolifically hit the market .
They are around 6 to 8 inches in length and three in breadth , about 94 to 120 pages long .
In the 80s the most popular single publication was Ranimuthu [ Queen ’s pearl ] that published very popular authors , and sometimes advertised the next months forthcoming issues as well .
Authors vied with each other to come out in this journal .
Popular authors like Kalki , Akilan , Sujatha , Maniyan , Saavi , Sivasankari , Tamaraimanalan , Indumathi , Cho have all been a source for commercial Tamil cinema , before the new breed ; many of them who are a part of our volume , entered the scene .
Writing very long stories did not come only with Indra Soundarrajan ; with his Sivamayam and Vikrama Vikrama .
Thillana Mohanambal and Thyaga Bhoomi ran for years and abridging them for movies was quite a task indeed .
Rakesh :
Attaching some not - great photos of a Chennai newsstand ( without associated tea stall ) – Siva News Mart in Indira Nagar – with some Tamil and English mags and pulp novels .
Siva , the proprietor , is in one of the pics .
Here is a link to a short movie clip of behind - the - scenes at a Tamil press …
For Pritham , I just want to clarify what infra-dig means as I ’m not familiar with that expression .
For Rakesh and Pritham , what ’s the collaboration process like ?
Who has the final word on which stories get included in the book ?
And for Pritham , what were the challenges in translating the stories ?
Rakesh :
We have had plenty of arguments , but not so much about which stories should go in the books , we ’ve been pretty much on the same wavelength there .
For the first anthology , I remember we had a hard time deciding how to represent the romance / chick - lit genres , and Pritham went through a lot of stuff and did a lot of sample translations before she found the Ramanichandran novel and the Vidya Subramaniam stories that eventually went in .
Deciding on things for Volume 2 was easier , because we were n’t so worried about being representative of Tamil Pulp as a whole , and got to sort of focus on horror / supernatural and mystery stuff .
Once Pritham has finished her first draft of the translation , then we sit together and try to tweak the English so that it is n’t so American as to bug Indian readers and is n’t so Indian as to bug American readers .
Pritham :
With our long colonial history , when you are educated in an English - medium school , you will deny your Tamil roots .
To be seen reading a Tamil pulp book is “ lower than a dig . ”
It ’s lower than a worm .
Your servants can read it , but you ’re not supposed to .
You ’re supposed to read Ian Fleming ( or these days , Chetan Bhagat ) , and feel classy .
Pritham : I think I have the last word , he thinks he has the last word .
Pritham : A few of the authors , like Pattuokkottai Prabakar and Rajesh Kumar , use so many English words mixed in with their Tamil that the job was easy — it was basically just “ correcting ” their grammar .
The toughest author was Indra Soundar Rajan , who uses a lot of cultural references .
In Tamil ( and most Indian languages ) , there are many social situations in which people would never address each other by name .
For instance , a younger brother will never refer to his older brother by name , but would instead call him Anna .
For Indian readers , even Indian English readers , it would sound very strange for a younger brother to call his elder brother by name , so we had to keep the Tamil word in this , and other cases .
But it gets more complicated : for instance , a wife will call her husband Baava , Maama , Enna , Machchan or Anna , depending on their caste .
But Machchan can also mean brother - in - law .
How do you convey all this ?
The word Amma is used for “ Mother ” , but “ Mother ” sounds strangely British and formal , and “ Mom ” sounds strangely modern and American .
So we kept the Amma and put it in the glossary .
A person would always refer to a woman employer or woman politician with the same word , Amma ; in this sense it might be translated as “ Madam ” — BUT using the word “ Madam ” makes the speaker sound either overly formal or sarcastic .
Confusingly , the same word Amma is also used to invoke the goddess ( any goddess ) .
It was occassionally tough to juggle all these considerations .
One of the fun challenges was deciding which of the onomatopoeia and sound effects to keep –Tamil authors use a lot of them .
They ’re very different from English sound effects .
Check this sentence from a story by Medhavi in the upcoming sequel anthology :
“ When the fourth man caught the purse — labak ! — and turned around to run , there was a hard punch — pateer !— on his face , and — veduk ! — the purse was snatched from his fist . ”
With selecting the stories and the problems of translation in mind , who is your target audience for the anthology ?
Pritham :
The first idea of the reader was the likes of Rakesh in India , who were fascinated by the covers , but could n’t read the inside .
As the material grew juicier and heavier , we began looking at the larger English speaking world as our readers .
When that scale came into the picture , it also altered the selection of the stories , and the other interests , what to put on the endnotes , how much of research goes into the Translator ’s note , and what kind of intro blurbs we give the authors themselves .
The authors themselves were enthusiastic about our efforts , for as Ramani Chandran said , “ Oh good .
Now my granddaughter will be able to read my stories .
Lavie : I just wanted to ask , as well , how has the reception for the book been ?
It seems to have been widely reviewed outside India ?
And how has it been recieved in India ?
Pritham : About reviews from outside India , I have no idea .
At home it has been well received .
Numbers , Rakesh can give you .
Rakesh :
When we started this , I had it in my head that the book would be easier to sell abroad than in India .
I was proved wrong .
We got wonderful press in India ( if I may brag , see here and here for super great reviews we got early on ) and tons of enthusiastic support from Indian bloggers and tweeters .
And it ’s still selling at a good clip all around the country .
Outside India , we have been mentioned or reviewed on a few blogs , but I think the word is still getting out there … it ’s tricky for a small press to get international distribution , and we are still learning the best ways to do it .
Though now our stuff is available from Small Press Distributors in the US , from MarketAsia Distributors in Singapore / Malaysia , and from Motilal Banarsidass in the UK .
What is it about the text that you think will appeal to international readers ?
Pritham : Does n’t sex , crime , drugs , and corruption have an universal appeal ?
Rakesh :
If there ’s room for it , you can mention that aside from Tamil , Blaft has also been doing translations from one of the top Hindi pulp authors …
Surender Mohan Pathak .
We released The 65 Lakh Heist last year and Daylight Robbery last week .

Ok , we all know good Trek games are as rare as a squeamish Klingon but Cryptic might just be on to something here .
Not to say it ’s “ good ” by industry standards but it does break the mold a bit and has a lot more potential than , say , Star Trek : Legacy .
a few moments of magic trapped in a transporter buffer that ’s compensating for a phase variance .
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again , when looking for entertainment from the Star Trek franchise , especially in video games , keep your hopes high and your standards low .
Star Trek : Online has rethought the MMO presets in designing some of its features , like space combat and bridge officers , but it finds itself sorely lacking content outside of the usual grind and more than its share of bugs .
Let me say , first , to the Trekkies that this is n’t just a bland mmo with the star trek franchise glazed over it .
You can play as a Vulcan , Betazoid , Bolian , Ferengi , Andorian and most any other race in the show .
And if you really want to play an excluded race like a Cardassian , just make it in the handy alien race creator .
Their racial abilities are straight out of canon with an MMO twist : Vulcans with their little known superhuman strength and Bajoran ’s spirituality giving them bonuses to healing received .
Even humans have racial traits , like enhanced repair skill ( admit it ; what did Scotty , LaForge and O’Brien all have in common ) .
So you hardcore MMO players do n’t have to feel disadvantaged just because you want to play your favorite race out of the show .
But as with any game made by Cryptic , the amazing character creator is where the glitz and glamor of a finely craft piece of art ends .
STO ’s early leveling scheme is different from anything I ’ve ever seen .
Rather than a quick first few levels to get you used to basic attacks and using abilities followed by slower more difficult leveling curves , all of STO from start to finish runs at about the same rate .
This means you ’ll spend the same amount of time going from levels 1 to 10 as from levels 30 to 40 .
This also means a rather excessive amount of time in the starting ship using only three or so special abilities to smash pathetically easy Klingons and Gorn .
This leads to rather serious abuse of the game ’s difficulty curve as there ’s no challenge to the game until about twenty hours in , at which point you ’re greeted by the Crystalline Entity , a fully fledged raid boss , and a few nasty Reeman captains who will kill you faster than a red shirt on an away team .
But since there ’s no penalty for dying and damage to enemy groups is persistent through your instantaneous respawn , you ’re not really going to be challenged by these enemies , just frustrated that the game never gave you any warning or strategy for dealing with them .
It ’s sort of like putting a speed bump on a disused highway .
You ’re not actually going to cause people to slow down unless you warn them it ’s there , you ’re just going to annoy them and damage their car .
That ’s not to say these challenges should be removed .
Far from it , STO just needs to learn how to curve its difficulty and how to give meaning to challenges .
But after 40 hours or so , the difficulty curve irons out , your ship gets distinct from other ships your allies are using and grouping starts to make a difference .
At one point I was flying my Defiant - class escort through the wormhole at Deep Space 9 with a buddy of mine in a Galaxy - class cruiser about to engage some Jem ’ Hadar and thought to myself “ this is really cool , I ’m actually in a Star Trek MMO . ”
These moments of magic are too few and far between , and some of the writing in early quests could have Gene Roddenberry facepalm in his grave , but they ’re definitely there and , for a trekkie , worth the time to get to .
Most fantasy MMOs claim they do n’t want to be like World of Warcraft and eventually fail because World of Warcraft is a good game and intentionally trying to be different is like intentionally trying to make mistakes .
STO is the first game to date that I have not only fully believed when its developers claim it ’s not trying to beat WoW , but is actually better for it .
The space combat is the defining feature in this .
Though in the early levels the space fights break down to firing all your weapons while flying in circles , the strategy later on gets very intense and remarkably like the show .
Ok it does n’t make any sense that a laser beam only has an effective range of ten kilometers , but for some reason they always managed to get that close to each other in the show , so it all looks just like Star Trek should .
The ships all have four shield facings which can be brought down by weapons fire individually and recharged through their own regeneration and special abilities from your engineering officers .
Your science officer ’s abilities all find creative ways to cripple the enemy ship , usually by running something hard to pronounce through the main deflector dish .
The tactical officers confer attack patterns and augment torpedo spreads and weapon targeting .
The names of the abilities make me want to start running the game off voice macros .
Another of those magical trek moments mentioned above was when I told one of my friends that I was going to break the Borg Cube ’s tractor beam by polarizing my hull , then use attack pattern alpha to bring my weapons about and fire quantum torpedoes .
There ’s no way to roll that sentence around in my head without envisioning Sisko shouting orders on the bridge of the Defiant .
Your choice of which officer your character plays determines your roll on the ground but also gives you some interesting abilities to use in space .
Your role in space combat is determined by what ship you chose to fly , though you ’re never locked into it like a class and can change at any time .
The real test of an MMO is how it keeps you playing month after month and in this regard Cryptic constantly misses the mark .
Like Champions
Online , STO has just barely enough quests and content to see you through to the level cap .
Once you ’re a rear admiral there is , at time of writing , one Special Task Force mission , the STO equivalent to a five man dungeon , called The Infected wherein you free a starbase which has been assimilated by the borg .
The difficulty of this mission is something like a particularly hard heroic dungeon in World of Warcraft and certainly requires coordination and effort .
But that does n’t mean it ca n’t be beaten by pick up groups and certainly is n’t a lofty enough prize to build a fleet for .
There are several more Special Task Forces announced , so perhaps STO will come into its own in a month or two but for now the content is so lacking it ’s difficult to justify a monthly subscription .
The game is also subject to more than its share of show stopping bugs .
At time of writing most of the very rare weapons in the game do n’t even work , any ability with a shared global cooldown bounces its cooldown off the server and has a chance to not happen at all based on individual lag , this includes such basic things as firing torpedoes and switching weapons on the ground .
Your bridge officers on the ground are unable to navigate even straight corridors without getting stuck in a wall somewhere and I ’ve fallen through a couple floors out into space .
STO is basically a few moments of magic trapped in a transporter buffer that ’s compensating for a phase variance .
You can see the beauty trying to get out , but you have to work through the bugs and compensate the tachyon emitter just to make it playable at some points .
It certainly justified its purchase price to me but is a bit of a letdown as an ongoing experience .
I recommend you give it a couple months to work out its issues and then , if you ’re a fan of the shows , see what this game has to offer .

“ Organized religion ’s ” trust levels are only a few percentage points higher than our politicians .
This is a grave problem for the church .
This statistic is telling : the majority of Americans , over three quarters of them , view religion with a similar suspicion as our politicians , which are often associated with incredible self - interest and pettiness .
Während die Bundesregierung für Deutschland statt des ausgesetzten Websperren - Gesetzes ein Löschgesetz gegen Kinderpornographie vorbereitet , forciert nahezu unbemerkt von der Öffentlichkeit die Europäische Union ihre Bestrebungen , Darstellungen von Kindesmissbrauch im Web europaweit auszublenden .
Dies geht aus einem geheimen Dokument des Rats der Europäischen Union ( " EU - Ministerrat " ) hervor , das der Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur heute veröffentlicht hat .
In dem Positionspapier gibt der Rat Empfehlungen für einen Aktionsplan zur EU - weiten Bekämpfung von Cybercrime .
Bezüglich der Bekämpfung von Missbrauchsdokumentationen im Web sind die Vorstellungen der Ministerrunde eindeutig : Die Entwicklung eines Filtersystems soll forciert vorangetrieben werden .
Als Beispiel nennt der Rat das europäische CIRCAMP - Projekt .
Dessen Aufgabe ist es unter anderem , einen einheitlichen Rahmen für die nationale Gesetzgebung zur Webfilterung zu liefern .
Dazu hat CIRCAMP den Child Sexual Abuse Anti Distribution Filter ( CSAADF ) definiert , der auf DNS - Basis Domains blockt .
Bisher haben sieben Staaten CSAADF umgesetzt , nämlich Norwegen , Schweden , Dänemark , Finnland , Schweiz , Neuseeland und Italien .
Großbritannien ist zwar CIRCAMP angeschlosssen , hat aber mit dem Filtersystem Cleanfeed einen anderen Weg eingeschlagen .
In einer CIRCAMP - Präsentation wurde Deutschland noch im Dezember 2009 unter " Countries close to running CSAADF " geführt . ( hob )
In two places at once : Strange world of quantum mechanics shown to work in visible world for first time
The mind - bending laws of quantum mechanics , where tiny atoms and molecules can effectively be in two places at once , have been applied to a visible object for the first time .
A U.S team managed to create a quantum state in an object billions of times larger than any previously tested .
Andrew Cleland from the University of California and his team used a tiny metal paddle , which is inclined to vibrate when a current passes through it .
A team has proven that quantum mechanics does n't just work in the world of atoms and molecules
They cooled it to a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero .
This is very close to its quantum mechanical ' ground state ' , which is when no more energy can be removed .
The team then transmitted just one quantum of electrical energy from a specially devised electric circuit to the paddle .
They were able to show the resonating paddle was in a quantum state , between one and zero quanta of energy .
This meant it was effectively moving and standing still at the same time .
The paddle was effectively a real - life version of ' Schrodinger 's cat ' - a famous thought experiment devised by the physicist Erwin Schrodinger .
The team placed a tiny metal paddle ( enlarged here ) into a quantum state , so it was moving and still at the same time depending on when it was observed
He described a situation where a cat is placed inside a steel chamber alongside a vial of acid and a small amount of radioactive substance .
If one atom of this decays during a test period this will break the vial and kill the cat .
Schrodinger said according to quantum law the cat was alive and dead in a super - position of states while the chamber was closed .
The state of the cat is only decided when the chamber is opened and the cat is observed .
So it is the observation or measurement itself that affects the outcome .
This is the nub of the paradoxes that occur in the quantum state - the world of the very very small .
But the latest experiment is important as it proved that the principles of quantum mechanics can apply to everyday objects as well as atomic - scale particles .
From left to right : Andrew Cleland , Aaron O'Connell and John Martinis were part of the team that made the breakthrough
' This is an important validation of quantum theory , as well as a significant step forward for nanomechanics research , ' Professor Cleland told the journal Nature .
So why do n't we see much larger objects like buses moving and standing still at the same time ?
Professor Cleland says the larger an object , the easier it is for outside forces to disrupt its quantum state .
' The environment is this huge , complex thing , ' he said .
' It 's that interaction with this incredibly complex system that makes the quantum coherence vanish . '

Democrats in the House of Representatives achieve a legislative landmark that has eluded generations of lawmakers before them .
House passes landmark health bill
Democrats in the House of Representatives achieved a legislative landmark Sunday night that has eluded generations of lawmakers before them – reshaping the American health care system to extend insurance coverage to nearly 32 million people and halt industry practices that discriminate against the sick .
Sunday ’s
House vote on a Senate reform plan represents the climatic finale to a yearlong saga that has taken its toll on the president and his party – one that had dimmed Barack Obama ’s once - incandescent star and now sets up an uncertain postscript for his Democratic colleagues headed for reelection fights in the fall .

The 219 -212 vote , with no Republicans voting yes and 34 Democrats voting no , nonetheless secures a historic win for Obama while providing his party with some much - needed momentum after a long , grueling slog that has Democrats playing defense in the run-up to the midterm elections .
“ This is n’t radical reform , but it is major reform , ” Obama said shortly before midnight at the White House .
Referring back to his own presidential campaign slogan , Obama said , “ This is what change looks like . ”
Obama watched the vote in the Roosevelt Room with Vice President Joe Biden and about 40 staffers – who burst into cheers when the vote count hit the 216 - vote mark , meaning the bill was on its way to Obama ’s desk and into law .
The president is likely to sign the bill Tuesday , then set off on a new campaign of selling it all over again to a deeply skeptical public .
Republicans already are threatening a variety of legislative and legal challenges to the bill .
Emotions ran high on the House floor , and someone from the Republican side of the chamber shouted “ Baby killer ! ” at Michigan Rep.
Bart Stupak – a staunch opponent of abortion – as he spoke against a Republican motion to kill the reform bill .
Stupak is the leader of a group of a half - dozen anti-abortion Democrats who cut a deal with the White House that cleared the way for final passage on the bill Sunday .
It was n’t clear who shouted , but reporters and at least one GOP lawmaker said it seemed to come from a Republican House member , who could n’t be identified Sunday night .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked the late Sen .
Ted Kennedy in urging her colleagues to vote yes , reading from a letter that Kennedy left to be read by Obama after Kennedy ’s death last year .
" Senator Kennedy wrote that access to health care was the great unfinished business of our society – that is , until today , " said Pelosi .
She spoke in historic terms of the $ 938 billion bill , comparing it to landmark legislation like Social Security and Medicare – reforms that changed the social fabric of the nation and Americans ’ fundamental relationship with their government .
The bill represents the biggest expansion of government - funded health care since the creation of Medicare .
The legislation requires all Americans to secure insurance coverage , either through their jobs or through a state - run insurance exchange that goes into effect in 2014 , and provides subsidies for those who ca n’t afford it .
The reforms mean 95 percent of all documented Americans will have coverage by 2016 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Also on Sunday night , the House passed a “ clean - up ” bill to make fixes to the Senate legislation , by a vote of 220 - 211 .
Then later this week , possibly as early as Tuesday , the Senate will take up that bill as well – but only after the president signs the underlying bill into law .
A weekend of protests by conservative activists outside the Capitol brought home the high political stakes surrounding the vote , as Republicans have vowed to try to dislodge the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate by convincing Americans reform is a costly and dangerous government overreach .
Democrats believed – or hoped at least – that by putting the messy process of enactment behind them , they could make the case to the public that there is much to be gained from reform .
From the outset of the debate , Republicans favored a scaled - back approach that focused on lowering premiums for people who have coverage instead of expanding it to those who do n’t .
On Sunday , GOP lawmakers said the near - trillion dollar package threatened to bankrupt the government .
“ This is not who we are , and it is not who we should become , ” said Wisconsin Rep . Paul Ryan .
“ It ’s unconscionable what we ’re leaving the next generation . ”
House Republican leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) turned to his Democratic colleagues across the aisle .
“ Have you read the bill ?
Have you read the reconciliation bill ?
Have you read the manager ’s amendment ? ”
Boehner said , as Democrats shouted back “ yes ! ” each time .
“ Hell no you have n’t ! ” Boehner thundered , as the chair gaveled him down .
At midnight , about an hour after the first vote , some Democratic lawmakers returned to a spot outside the Capitol where conservative Tea Party protestors has shouted at them over the past two days .
The Democrats were cheering and thanking anyone who came by .
New York Rep. Anthony Weiner shook hands with supporters .
Connecticut Rep. John Larson walked by , clutching the bill .
And Georgia Rep. John Lewis , who was active in the civil rights movement , received a hero 's welcome .
" It feels good , it feels good .
It feels so good to win one , " Lewis said .
The legislation has been at death ’s door almost from the moment it was introduced , revived again and again by a persistent president and a core of devoted advocates on Capitol Hill .
But each reincarnation sparked another round of infighting among Democrats about what the final bill should look like .
Once again , the final vote came down to a decades - old interparty fight over abortion – and Stupak .
But Democrats owe their greatest debt to vulnerable colleagues who backed the bill , even though it could easily cost them their seats come the fall – members like Pennsylvania Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper , Ohio Rep. Steve Driehaus and Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello .
" Who are you going to stand with ? " declared Ohio Democratic Rep. John Boccieri , a last - minute convert to “ yes ” who opposed the bill when the House first voted in November .
The buildup to Sunday 's long - awaited vote lacked the drama of its predecessor , a nail - biter last November in which Democrats corralled the final votes shortly before heading to the floor .
Instead , a deal anti-abortion Democrats cut with the White House late Saturday night paved the way to passage on Sunday .
After a late - night session with the president ’s advisers , Stupak and others agreed to support the legislation in exchange for an executive order from the president reaffirming the longstanding ban on federal funding of elective abortion .
Stupak also forced party leaders to articulate that promise on the House floor , making it a part of the federal record .
He engaged in that exchange with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , a principal author of the legislation who has locked horns with the Michigan Democrat repeatedly .
The deal came about after a personal appeal from Stupak ’s longtime ally , fellow Michigan Rep.
John Dingell , the former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee whose father first offered legislation creating universal health care back in 1943 .
Dingell helped broker negotiations between an angry Stupak and party leaders at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue when all looked lost .
" John Dingell had a piece of me yesterday for quite some time , " Stupak said .
" He kept me well informed of what I should be doing . "
Stupak stole all the early headlines , but Pennsylvania Rep .
Mike Doyle and some other lawmakers helped broker a truce with the White House and abortion - rights advocates , led by Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro .
Stupak , though , gave them all the political cover they needed to back the final package .
Democrats built momentum all week , and Sunday was no different .
As news of the Stupak deal filtered out , Washington Rep. Brian Baird , who voted against the House bill , kicked off the day by announcing his plans to vote " yes " this time .
North Dakota Rep. Earl Pomeroy , another wavering Democrat , followed that up by announcing his plans to back the bill , despite numerous reservations with the legislation and the final process .
The combined legislation expands Medicaid by $ 434 billion over the next decade so that people who make less than 133 percent of poverty are covered in every state , the CBO said .
It also sets aside $ 466 billion in subsidies to help lower - and middle - income households that do n’t qualify for Medicaid buy insurance on the exchange .
The Senate bill also imposes fees on companies that do n't provide coverage to their employees and sets penalties for people who do n't participate .
The House “ fix - up ” bill makes changes that make the Senate legislation more palatable to House Democrats -- including rolling back a tax on high - cost insurance plans to 2018 and cutting out the “ Cornhusker Kickback ” and other special deals .
Lost in all the drama over health care , the reconciliation fix also includes a dramatic revamp of the student - lending industry that would shift billions in federal aid from private lenders back to the government .
The president ’s health care push touched off angry protests from Americans worried about the costs of the legislation , its impact on the economy and whether it would be a government intrusion on the doctor - patient relationship .
Sunday was no different .
On the Capitol grounds , opponents and supporters of the bill showered the building in chants .
Thousands of protestors gathered on the lawn beneath the House chamber chanting , “ Kill the bill !
Kill the bill !
Kill the bill ! ”
Republicans , on a balcony overhead , took turns rallying the crowd by waving an American flag .
The protests at times turned ugly .
After Lewis was called a racial epithet on Saturday , Pelosi and Democratic leaders locked arms with Lewis to cross the Capitol complex Sunday , brandishing the gavel used to pass Medicare .
The win enhances Pelosi ’s stature as a historic figure , not just as the first female speaker in House history but also as one of its most powerful .
Colleagues credit her resolve for keeping the process alive after a catastrophic special - election result for the party in Massachusetts erased its commanding 60 - vote supermajority in the Senate .
But even with the votes seemingly in hand , Pelosi never stopped working .
During a round a votes Sunday , a Republican aide overheard Illinois Rep. Jerry Costello , an anti-abortion Democrats who was still holding out after the Stupak deal , tell the speaker , " I will not be intimidated . "
Speaker Nancy Pelosi just buttonholed Rep. Ike Skelton , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , who has remained a " no " vote , in the speaker 's lobby off the floor for a few minutes .
As she wrapped up her private talk and headed back to the floor , Rep. Charlie Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) was anxious to find out what happened .
" Did he change ?
Did he change ? "
Rangel asked .
" No , but I 'll talk to you , " Pelosi said , pointing to the floor .
Skelton , meanwhile , disappeared .
Retiring Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy , referring to his late father , Ted Kennedy , said , “ No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor his memory than the earliest possible passage of this bill for which he fought so long .
. .
His heart and his soul are in this bill . ”
Sunday 's vote , said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , " concludes a national conversation that began more than a century ago . "
Carol E. Lee , Jonathan Allen , David Rogers , Carrie Budoff Brown and James Hohmann contributed to this report .
( CNN ) -- Federal agents seized 2,880 rounds of ammunition found inside an SUV that was being driven from Brownsville , Texas , to Mexico , U.S. Customs and Border Protection said .
A 19 - year - old Mexican was attempting to drive the 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer across the bridge that links Brownsville with Matamoros , Tamaulipas state , when he was stopped for a secondary inspection , the release said .
The ammunition , which included 13 armor - piercing rounds and five assault - rifle magazines , was hidden inside 18 plastic bags found inside the SUV , the release said .
Nearly 1 in 4 Californians under age 65 had no health insurance last year , according to a new report , as soaring unemployment propelled vast numbers of once - covered workers into the ranks of the uninsured .
The state ’s uninsured population jumped to 8.2 million in 2009 , up from 6.4 million in 2007 , marking the highest number over the last decade , investigators from UCLA ’s Center for Health Policy Research said .
People who were uninsured for part or all of 2009 accounted for 24.3 % of California ’s population under age 65 -- a dramatic increase from 2007 driven largely by Californians who lost employer - sponsored health insurance , particularly over the last year .
Among those over age 18 , nearly 1 in 3 had no insurance for all or part of 2009 , the UCLA researchers found .
The ranks of uninsured children also grew .
The study was based on phone interviews from 2007 , updated with current insurance enrollment data .
Adults over age 65 , who are covered by the federal Medicare insurance program , were not included .
As a result of the insurance gap , many already strapped Californians have put off needed medical care and usually wound up crowding emergency rooms , receiving costly care on the run .
Hospitals and insurance companies often pass on those expenses to customers with insurance , increasing the cost of healthcare and driving up rates for those who have coverage .
The new UCLA estimates arrive as President Obama and congressional Democrats scramble this week to finalize an agreement on healthcare reform .
Democrats who are pressing the overhaul say it would expand health insurance to tens of millions of uninsured people across the country .
Yet even as leaders in Washington seek to expand coverage , California officials are wrestling with budget proposals by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to cut or eliminate publicly funded insurance programs that critics say cover more than 2.5 million low - income children and their parents -- some of whom lost coverage because of layoffs .
California has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country , alongside Texas and other states with high unemployment .
Because California ’s population is so large , however , it has more uninsured people than any other state .
The number of uninsured has swelled in tandem with California ’s unemployment rate , which rose to 12.3 % in December from 5.7 % two years earlier , and as employers shifted more healthcare costs to employees .
Bruce Kuhlmann of Santa Rosa was laid off in December 2008 from his job as a technology sales executive in Northern California .
He has depleted much of his retirement savings to pay for care since he was diagnosed with cancer last month .
The father of three , including two college - age children , has found it difficult to buy insurance on the individual market .
Kuhlmann , 58 , worries about affording an operation that he believes will cost about $ 30,000 .
“ I ’ve spent a fortune of my own money , ” Kuhlmann said in a phone interview as he prepared to undergo a medical procedure at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital .
“ I have a house mortgage .
It ’s hard to get a job because I do n’t feel so good .
Everything is negative . ”
UCLA researchers said they were surprised by the big jump in the uninsured population from 2007 to 2009 .
The director of the health policy center , E. Richard Brown , said the state ’s 8.2 million people without coverage was the highest number he had seen in nearly three decades of studying the issue .
“ California ’s situation is pretty dire with respect to healthcare coverage , ” Brown said .
The numbers of uninsured are likely to climb as the state ’s jobless rate is expected to remain in the double digits well into next year .
“ The shocking increase in people losing insurance spotlights the problem that . . . coverage may not be there for us when we need it , ” said Anthony Wright , executive director of Health Access California , a Sacramento consumer group .
“ This adds more urgency to the debate over the pending health reform proposals , which directly address the insecurity Californians are facing . ”
Researchers said federal subsidies for laid - off workers helped some people who lost jobs and coverage .
Yet even so the loss of insurance affected young and old alike .
The percentage of uninsured children grew to 13.4 % in 2009 from 10.2 % in 2007 .
The increase would have been greater if not for insurance programs paid for by the state and federal governments .
The number of uninsured children rose from 1.1 million to 1.5 million over the two years .
The study ’s lead author said that adults who lack the safety net face the most daunting prospects .
“ Being uninsured has real human consequences .
. . .
It is costly for all of us , ” said Shana Alex Lavarreda , director of health insurance studies at the UCLA research center .
“ It makes reforms of the system absolutely essential . ”

“ It ’s impossible , ” Gerald said in a matter - of - fact tone , “ simply impossible . ”
“ Now just so we ’re clear , ” Craig responded , “ by ‘ impossible ’ , you actually mean ‘ a big pain in the ass ’ , but you ’re a smart guy who can make it happen , right ? ”
That drew a few chuckles from the handful of other coworkers who joined them in the conference room , but Gerald just sighed .
“ No , Craig , by impossible , I mean impossible .
Not doable .
Ca n’t be done .
Im - poss - i- ble .
Well I mean , unless you can somehow change the underlying structure of the way everyone communicates on the Internet . ”
“ But we do n’t need to change it for everyone , ” Craig jumped in , “ just one client .
Surely , you can do that ! ”
The situation at hand was not an uncommon one .
Craig , one of the company ’s top producing sales reps , had once again sold a client on a feature they did not have .
He certainly did n’t lie about having the feature , but instead proposed an offer the client could n’t refuse : if you buy it , we ’ll build it .
Management , not being the type to turn down booked sales , could n’t refuse the offer either .
And thus , they sided with Craig on what ‘ impossible ’ actually meant .
They also assigned Gerald and team to develop the much - needed feature : an IP - based authentication system that would allow users of their Software - as - a - Service product to access the system without ever needing to log in .
Gerald ’s main objection with IP authentication was that the majority of users – and in fact , all of the users at the client site – were behind a router .
Though they ’d certainly each have an internal IP address assigned , they would all share the same public IP , making one computer indistinguishable from the next .
To make matters even more tricky , their application was used by hospitals to track certain kinds of patient data , which meant that HIPAA – the regulatory framework that defines how patient data must be stored and accessed – needed to be followed .
And not just followed , but followed , tested , certified , re-certified , and double - tested .
Any change to the HIPAA - related functions – authorization included – would need to go through a painful internal and external QA process .
Given the impossibility of getting the end - users internal IP address from the outside , Gerald figured that using cookies would be the next best thing .
Have the user log - in once , and then store an authentication cookie on the computer for as long as possible .
Sure , that meant clearing cookies would trigger a new login , but it seemed to be a fair and easy work - around .
Well , not so much : the client vehemently rejected the idea , saying that their employees could n’t be bothered with having to remember yet another login , even if only temporarily .
After going back to the drawing board , Gerald came up with another idea : configure the firewall proxy server on the client ’s side to add a custom HTTP header ( X - Forwarded - For ) that included the original IP address .
That idea went over just about as well : HTTP headers could be forged , and a malicious employee inside of the company could hack in too easily .
Gerald ’s third proposal to the client involved a site - to - site VPN connection .
The application server would be exposed access via the client ’s internal network , which would not only allow them to use IP authentication , but Windows - integrated authentication as well .
It was his best idea yet , and made things that much easier , as the client would be able to configure which username has access instead of which IP address .
Unfortunately , the IT folks at the client were n’t a big fan of the approach , as “ a VPN connection is inherently insecure . ”
At wits end , Gerald came up with yet another idea : a “ Single Sign On ” approach of sorts .
When the end - user would access their application , the system would look for an “ authentication ticket ” cookie .
When not present , the user would be redirected to another server – which lived inside the network – whose sole purpose was to generate a secure authentication ticket that included the private IP address .
The ticketing server would then redirect to hosted application , which would then verify the authenticity of the ticket and give the user access .
The client absolutely loved the idea .
“ This is exactly what we ’re looking for , ” the client ’s project manager said , “ no need to remember logins , plus solid security . ”
The sales contract was signed , and the project was officially a go .
And finally , three months later , the new feature was finished .
It took three solid weeks of development time , two weeks of QA testing , several thousand dollars in new hardware , and tens of thousands of dollars for an external HIPAA assessment , but the sales rep and the client ’s project manager said it ’d be worth it : no more remembering logins .
Now , all that was needed for implementation was a list of IP addresses that were allowed to use the computer .
“ Hi Gerald , ” the client ’s project manager wrote in an email , “ please provide the following IP with access to the system : 10.1.23.97 . ”
Gerald confirmed , and reconfirmed : only one user needed access to the system .
And apparently , she really hated remembering logins .
If only there could be many more snubs like that .
On Monday , a leak from the White House suddenly made it clear that there would be no summit between the European Union and the United States in late May , as had been widely anticipated .
It ’s a great service that Barack Obama rendered to Europeans .
This humiliation probably convinced a few more of the obvious need to finally get their acts together and be more united on foreign policy if they want to have a say in the world — or just be taken seriously .
What makes the rebuff particularly stinging is that Europeans know Mr. Obama is right ; they know he would welcome and regularly meet a senior European Union official , or even several ( provided they do n’t rotate every six months ) , who would actually talk for all of Europe .
( Not to mention their dashed hopes in the Lisbon Treaty , which was supposed to enhance their diplomatic credibility . )
In fact , much of Europe ’s progress in foreign policy in the past two decades came after similar moments of frustration , humiliation and antagonism .
For some people of a certain generation , The Wizard , staring Fred Savage , was a life - changing movie .
While the story is fairly unbelievable by anyone but a kid under the age of twelve in 1989 , those same kids had the dream presented to them that they could have grand cross-country adventures based solely on their Nintendo skills .
I mean , I had Ninja Gaiden , and I played Rad Racer and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .
Who says I could n’t win $ 50,000 by playing these games ?
Additionally , this movie made every kid want a Nintendo Power Glove , and the fact that it was pretty much an hour and a half sneak peak at the new Super Mario Bros.
3 , made every kid want that game more than anything .
It ’s no wonder Super Mario Bros .
3 is one of the best selling video games of al time .
Looking back , I do n’t understand why video game companies do n’t produce this same story every four or five years to each new generation of kids , but plug in their newest innovative game to try to boost game sales .
Honestly , I do n’t feel like Fred Savage , Beau Bridges , and Christian Slater are doing much else these days .
Australian scientists say they have discovered the first evidence that an ancestor of the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex once roamed across Australia .
The finding , published today in the journal Science , fills a major gap in the evolutionary history of T rex and overturns the theory the giant predator was a purely northern hemisphere animal .
It also puts a dampener on hopes of finding a unique Australian dinosaur , says Museum Victoria curator of vertebrate palaeontology Dr Tom Rich .
The discovery is based on a pubic bone found about 20 years ago at Dinosaur Cove , 220 kilometres west of Melbourne in Victoria .
It was made after Dr Rich took a number of isolated and unidentified bones overseas for identification .
Conspicuous feature
Lead author Dr Roger Benson , a research fellow in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge , says he instantly recognised one of the bones belonged to a coelurosaur .
Coelurosaurs are the group of mainly small - bodied , predatory dinosaurs that includes birds at one end and tyrannosaurs at the other , Dr Benson says .
He says the identification was initially based on " one conspicuous feature " .
Dr Benson says the far end of the pubic bone was expanded into a " boot " shape fore and aft , but was very narrow across .
" Basically , our [ the Museum Victoria ] pubis is almost identical to that of T rex , only much smaller , " Dr Benson said .
The new species , which Dr Rich says would have been about one - third to one - quarter the size of T rex , shares other features with the giant predator , including short arms and powerful jaws .
" It 's much more similar to T rex than one other tyrannosaur ( Raptorex , from China ) of slightly older age than ours , " Dr Benson said .
" We know Raptorex had a robust skull and small arms and we know that our new fossil is from a tyrannosaur even more closely related to T rex .
Thus it 's most likely the general body plan of our new one was similar . "
Surge in discovery
Until recently the only known tyrannosaurs were those like T rex - giant predators from Asia and North America that lived about 70 million years ago , just before the Cretaceous mass extinction , says Dr Benson .
However in the past decade a " surge " in discoveries has revealed diverse types and body sizes in the tyrannosauroid family from up to 170 million years back in the Middle to Late Jurassic .
" It 's these discoveries , mostly man-sized or smaller , that have filled in the story of tyrannosaur evolution , " says Dr Benson .
" Since all discoveries have been from the northern hemisphere , tyrannosaurs have been considered as northern dinosaurs that might have just never made it down into the south .
" The new discovery shows that this is wrong and that 110 million years ago tyrannosaurs were probably global .
This poses a question .
Why did tyrannosaurs grow to giant size and dominance in the north , but apparently not in the south ? "
Dr Rich says the new species of Tyrannosaurus also shows the likelihood of finding a unique Australian dinosaur is low .
" The picture that seems to be emerging is that dinosaurs were more or less cosmopolitan , " he says .
" We are getting elements that look like those found in the northern hemisphere and we have n't found the dinosaur equivalent of the koala ; we do n't seem to have a unique dinosaur . "
( Mashable ) --
We 've just confirmed with Google that the company has signed an agreement to acquire social search engine Aardvark .
Google is n't disclosing the terms , but news of the acquisition was first reported by TechCrunch , who put the figure at around $ 50 million .
Google told us that it's " signed an agreement to acquire Aardvark but do n't have any additional details to report at this time . "
Aardvark is a relatively new startup from former Googlers that uses social distribution channels to get immediate answers to your questions .
As a user you can either ask or answer questions , and those questions and answers are funneled through friends and friends of friends via social channels , IM and e-mail with the purpose of turning your online network and reach into a easy way to get more qualified answers to your queries .
In some ways , Aardvark is very much like an alternative search engine that puts your social circle to work .
While we can only speculate as to what Google will do with Aardvark and its team at this point , here are few things that might make a service like Aardvark appeal to the likes of Google :
_ Better search results : Earlier this year Google introduced answer highlights in search results in an attempt to actually answer your queries .
From this endeavor we know that Google is interested in better understanding how to actually answer your queries , instead of just returning a list of links .
Google could potentially use the database of Aardvark questions and answers to help them fine tune its algorithms and improve this experience , or even integrate Aardvark answers into results pages .
_ Social context : Google Social Search attempts to provide context to your queries by returning matching content from your social network .
Aardvark is somewhat of an extension of this idea , and could easily factor into and improve the social search experiment .
_ Insight behind the question and answer chain : Aardvark has tons of interesting data on what searchers want to know , and how or why people choose to answer a particular query .
Aardvark also has proof of concept that distributed social queries are effective means to getting fast answers to user questions .
This data could help Google better understand what motivates certain queries and / or prompts quick responses .
It 's certainly not a stretch of the imagination to guess that Google could even add Aarvark - like functionality to search , so that while you search you can query your friends as well .

This year 's Document Freedom Day will take place on the 31st of March .
On this day , the organisers intend to highlight the importance of open document formats and standards .
As last year , there will be global activities and events for people to participate in .
The organisers say that the motivation behind the day is " To help you make your documents future - proof " .
They add that " Any person can save documents in open document formats , which are based on Open Standards , and be sure that people will be able to read those files , independent of the software they use " and that because of this " Anyone can build applications that read and write files in these formats .
The Internet was built upon Open Standards , and that ’s why you see so much innovation online . "
The organisers list possible ways of getting involved in the project 's blog .
They include distributing leaflets , organising workshops , or simply adding the project 's logo to one 's home page .
The organisers say that what 's important is to make as many people as possible aware of the topic .

We have all heard that defragmenting a hard drive ( HDD ) can give you a boost in performance .
Is this just a an old wive ’s tale or is it grounded in reality ?
Most of us , whether we are top - notch IT talent or just a regular Joe or somewhere in between know that taking care of a computer and doing some basic upkeep can keep it running at a decent clip .
Defragmenting a HDD is one of those basics that we should all do and has been so since well , mechanical HDDs came into existence .
However , is this just good housekeeping practice based on actual results , or is it just one of those myths about what to do with your computer to keep it running well ?
The Test Setup
To set this test up and to keep it fair , I am using VirtualBox .
The image I built is based off of Windows XP SP3 in a 14.9 gb image .
I downloaded and installed all possible windows updates ( critical or not ) from Microsoft as of 02/08/2010 .
I then installed MS Office 2007 and downloaded all the updates for it .
I then uninstalled office and the updates for office .
I then copied many photos to and from the drive .
I then removed every other photo ( over 2,000 photos ) , then installed Microsoft Office 2007 and downloaded the updates for it again .
I then deleted all of the photos .
I then used a program called Fragger to purposely fragment the rest of the drive ( fragger wrote 5,706 mb of pure fragmentation to the image ) .
I then installed all of the softwares to be used in this test ( the defragmenters ) so they would be preinstalled on the backup image .
I then used the function built into VirtualBox to make a backup image of the virtual machine so that I could restore from that backup for the purpose that each defragmenter has a fair chance on the same exact fragmented dataset .
To start things off , I needed to find some sort of baseline for performance .
After doing much searching , I settled on a free tool called HDTune .
It is n’t as full featured as the full pay -version of the program , but for the purposes of these tests , it was more than enough .
It gave me 4 readings that I felt were the most relevant to the tests I was doing : Minimum Read Speed , Maximum Read Speed , Average Read Speed , and Access Time .
I did not measure defragmentation time as I started each of them defragmenting before i went to bed each night , so time did n’t matter to me .
I would like to go ahead and say that I feel it is safe to assume most others do something similar .
With defragmentation being something that should be done at least , in my opinion , once a month , it will tend to be something that is set to be done while the pc is not in use , like during the night while you are sleeping , thus why I tested in this manner .
I then found myself ready to run the tests .
Then the bright idea occurred to me : Maybe Virtual
Box will have a massive impact on the tests , so I need to have a comparison of my HDDs read speed outside of Virtual Box and inside of it .
So , I ran those tests .
I then decided that once I ran all the tests , I would use the winner of the tests and defragment my harddrive ( previously defragmented with MyDefrag before building the Virtual Box image ) to see if it improved things any , especially after deleting and restoring multiple 15 gb images in the process of the tests .
The version of Virtual Box used in this test was Virtual Box 3.0.12r54655 .
The HDD that I am using and got the original base results to compare against is a ST3250410 AS with Windows XP installed on it .
Also , where needed , I will note what options I used with each defragmenter in an attempt to get the ‘ most ’ out of the program .
The Defraggers
The Results Inside of Virtual Box
The first thing I needed to do inside of Virtual Box was to get a baseline reading that I could compare against .
The first reading I took was just after installing Windows XP SP3 and all of the updates – critical or not – available at the time .
This would represent the fresh system install speed that we all know and love so well .
The results are as follows :
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 0.7 58.6 39.2 25.6
I then needed a baseline test after all the work I put into purposely fragmenting the image , the results of which are below .
What was surprising to me was how far the average read speed fell .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 4.9 57.7 31 13
Now , for a baseline defragmentation , and the standard against which all the other defragmenters in this roundup will be measured , I ran the built in defragmenter that comes standard with WindowsXP .
The results that came back were very surprising , which when I ran this , gave me great hope for what the others might be able to accomplish as they are all touted as ‘ better ’ than the default built into windows .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 5.7 59 50.6 7.5
3rd Party Defraggers
Now , with that as a nice set of baselines to compare against , I then went on with the rest of the tests .
After every time that I restored the image , I would then defrag the image , reboot it , then run the tests .
The next results are of my defragger of choice ( before i ran these tests ) .
After the tests , will it still remain my favorite ?
We shall see .
The next results are for MyDefrag .
For options , I chose Defrag Monthly for the most thorough defrag .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 22.4 204.8 67.9 8.4
These results had me excited .
That big of a boost over the default defragger aside from Access Time ( which would prove to be the only thing that the XP Defragger was better at in the end , to only slightly spoil the results ) .
However , with these results in , it was now on to the next defragger : Defraggler by Piriform .
For options , I chose – Move Large Files to End of Drive .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 23.5 206.6 68 8.2
The next candidate up for testing is one that I found quite by accident while looking over slickdeals .
net for some deals on Steam .
Puran Defrag is a program that used to be payed - for software that is now freeware .
I decided to give it a chance in this roundup to see if a ‘ payed for ’ style program was worth the money it used to cost .
The option I chose on this one was to use the setting : Boost overall system speed by Puran Intelligent Optimize
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 1.3 207 50.9 8.6
Then , the next test was on to a program I had used in the past , then decided to stop using once I found MyDefrag ( formerly JKDefrag ) as it did n’t feel as fast after defrags .
Would this test bear that out ?
The options I chose for this one were : remove temp files before defragmenting , move system files to beginning of disk , defrag and optimize
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 5.4 206.8 58.9 9.0
Then , the final program in our roundup was suggested to me by fellow forum member C627627 .
Vopt was a program I had never heard of , but since it was a free download , I decided to add it to the test and to see how effective it was .
The options I chose that were available to me in this one were : tighter packing , move system restore to end of drive .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 19.7 202.7 57.9 9.3
The Results Outside of Virtual Box
Before doing the battery of tests that I did , and knowing what would happen to my HDD after deleting and restoring a 15 gb image file over and over , I ran a preliminary speed test on my HDD to see what the transfer rate was outside of Virtual Box so that I could see what the affects of running the tests inside of Virtual Box would be , if any affect .
Those results are below .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 4.7 81.8 73 15.3
I then decided that for a final bit to test my drive to see if the overall results winner actually improved anything , I used Defraggler with the same options as in the Virtual Box test , then ran HDTune one last time .
Minimum Speed ( Mb/s ) Maximum Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Speed ( Mb/s ) Average Access Time ( ms ) 52.1 81.8 74 15.2
So , even though the improvements were minimal aside from minimum speed , it still improved over even the MyDefrag results before all the other tests .
Results Summary
Conclusions
With the results of the tests in , it seems the ‘ old wive ’s tale ’ of defragmenting your HDD to maintain performance is not only true , the results of it were astounding .
Even if you do n’t use a 3rd party defragger , the tool built into Windows itself gives a massive boost in performance .
I do realize that these results are only for my machine and specific for only a virtual machine inside of Virtual Box .
Even as that may be , I feel there are two 3rd party defraggers I can confidently recommend to anyone to use on their machines as their results are so similar , and the overall increase in speed is different by only 0.1 Mb/s .
So , congratulations are in order for MyDefrag 4.2.7 and Piriform Defraggler 1.16.165 !

Perhaps by necessity , perhaps by desire , but most likely by both , An increasing percentage of Americans say they more enjoy saving than spending .
The recession and financial crisis have resulted in a significant change in the way many Americans feel about spending and saving .
Six in 10 Americans ( 62 % ) now say they more enjoy saving than spending -- while 35 % say the reverse .
This reflects a shift that began in December 2008 and a marked change from the first half of the decade , when Americans were about evenly split regarding whether they more enjoyed spending or saving .
Demographics
Changing Consumer Psychology
Essential to the " go forward " economic outlook is whether consumer spending will return to pre-recession levels or reflect a " new normal " spending pattern .
The significant shift to saving in American preferences , as opposed to spending , suggests an important change in consumer psychology .
Most likely , this change in consumer preferences results from the severity of the recession , the financial crisis , many Americans ' severe loss of wealth in their homes and investments , and the significant change in the availability of credit throughout the economy .
At the same time , many consumers also say their spending behavior has changed .
More than half of the nation 's consumers across socioeconomic groups say they are continuing to spend less , despite the claims of many economic observers that things are getting better and recovery is underway .
Two - thirds of consumers who are spending less -- and 38 % of all Americans -- say their current reduced level of spending is their new , normal spending pattern .
And significant percentages of Americans across all major demographic groups say this is their new normal .
Further , Gallup 's continuous tracking of consumer spending behavior in early 2010 shows that consumers are actually doing as they say by spending at a new - normal level -- consistent with their 2009 spending , and much lower than their spending at the beginning of the recession in 2008 .

Discovery raises possibility of manufacturing painkillers more cheaply using vats of microbes rather than fields of flowers
Scientists have identified the two genes in opium poppies which are used to make codeine and morphine , two of the most important painkillers in a doctor 's armoury .
The discovery opens the door to alternative ways of making the drugs which do not involve giving over vast areas of farmland to growing the flowers .
One hope is to transfer the genes into microbes , which could be grown in vats and provide huge quantities of the drugs at a fraction of the cost of farming and processing the plants .
Researchers said the findings could lead to the creation of strains of opium poppies that cannot make morphine , the opiate chemical turned into heroin and exported from Afghanistan and other countries for illicit use .
More than 2,500 hectares of British fields have been turned into opium poppy farms to meet NHS demands for morphine , a potent painkiller that was first isolated in 1806 .
The flower variety , Papaver somniferum , has been grown commercially in the UK since 2002 and differs from the common red flower , which does not contain morphine .
Pharmaceutical companies extract the drugs by processing seed pods stripped from the flowers , producing an annual national yield of codeine and morphine of 100 tonnes .
Some 27 m pills containing codeine are sold over the counter every year in a painkiller market worth £ 500m .
A team led by Peter Facchini at the University of Calgary , in Canada , identified the two genes used to make codeine and morphine from out of 23,000 in the opium poppy .
The finding , reported in the journal Nature Chemical Biology , ends a 50 - year quest .
" The evolution of these two genes in a single plant species has had such a huge impact on humanity over the past several thousand years , " said Facchini .
" Our discovery allows this unique genetic power to be harnessed . "
Microbes are already used by the medical industry to mass produce synthetic insulin for diabetics and steroids for treating rheumatoid arthritis .
Last year , Tasmania 's attorney - general , Lara Giddings , raised concerns over the impact of opium poppy farms on wildlife .
Farmers in the country , the world 's largest producer of legal opium , reported that wallabies had been hopping around in circles after eating the plants .
In 2008 , the European Union 's drug agency warned that Britain faced a heroin crisis following a record harvest of poppies in Afghanistan , which accounts for 90 % of the world 's illicit opium .
By blocking one of the genes , scientists said they could create a strain of poppies that produce codeine but do not go on to convert this into morphine , the source of heroin .
This would " allow the direct recovery of codeine from the plant and prevent the formation of morphine , which would preclude the illicit synthesis of heroin , " the scientists write in the journal .

I love this video !
It ’s actually a couple of years old , but it very cleverly shows how disconnected male advertisers are when it comes to understanding the female consumer and where to connect with her .
As a matter of fact , I think it rings more true today than ever before .
Although it ’s humorous format is entertaining , the message is very serious :
The female consumer is breaking up with brands , and she is trying to tell advertisers why .
Listen to her .
We do n’t talk anymore .
You ’re doing all the talking .
We ’re not exactly having dialog
You ’re saying you love me , but you ’re not behaving like you love me .
It ’s not genuine .
I ’ve changed and you have n’t .
We do n’t hang out in the same places anymore .
You ’re not listening to me .
If you knew me , you ’d know I do n’t care anything about that …
Guys , be very careful not to assume she is breaking up with your brand because of the recession .
It could be because you simply are not listening to her .
Looking for a long - lasting , trusting relationship , in this rapidly changing market ?
Then make an effort to know who the female consumer of today is , believe that she reacts differently than men , understand her , and know how to connect with her on the Internet .

Peter T. Fox , M.D. , is director of the Research Imaging Institute at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio .
He and his coauthors studied a brain network that enables people to place interpersonal decisions on the back burner for later processing .
The team 's research provides evidence that genetics plays a role in this network .
Credit : UT Health Science Center San Antonio
When we put an idea on the back burner , it goes into a processing area of the brain called the default - mode network .
This network enables us to hold the low - priority idea in abeyance until a time when we are n't busy with something else .
" The default - mode network appears to be the brain 's back burner for social decision making , " said Peter T. Fox , M.D. , director of the Research Imaging Institute at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio .
" Usually these back - burner ideas relate to interpersonal interactions and decisions that can't readily be quantified and should n't be rushed . "
Dr. Fox likened this to putting a computer batch job into background processing to wait until the system is less busy .
A recently released study from the Research Imaging Institute , the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research and other institutions offers evidence that genetics plays a role in this back - burner setup , which has been shown to be abnormal in a variety of psychiatric disorders .
The work was described in the Jan. 18 - 22 online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The default - mode network is one of several neural networks that operate whether the mind is at rest or is occupied doing a task .
A separate PNAS paper , published in 2009 by Dr. Fox and the same collaborators , presented a strong case that all human behaviors may be properly viewed as cooperative interactions among these networks , Dr. Fox said .
The newer research estimated the importance of genetic effects on the default - mode network by creating maps of eight anatomically distinct regions within the network .
These maps were obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) studies in 333 individuals from 29 randomly selected , extended - family pedigrees .
Network connectivity and gray - matter density were correlated to genetic factors .
" We found that more than 40 percent of the between - subject variance in functional connectivity within the default - mode network was under genetic control , " Dr. Fox said .
Based on this information , it is possible new diagnostic tools could be considered for various psychiatric or neurological illnesses , he said .
The study also included collaborators from the Yale University School of Medicine , the University of Oxford in Oxford , U.K. , and Imperial College in London , U.K .
The project is an outgrowth of longstanding collaborations between the UT Health Science Center and the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research using tools for gene discovery .
It is also a result of substantial collaborations between the Research Imaging Institute and Oxford to develop novel applications of imaging methods .
" One long - term research goal is to test whether other intrinsically connected networks are also under genetic control , which we expect they will be , " Dr. Fox said .
" We also want to identify the genes that are controlling the default - mode network and other networks , and identify disorders associated with their abnormalities .
A final goal is to develop treatment strategies . "

Thank God , I 'm not a lawyer , but it might go something like this :
" Only upon the submission of a birth certificate that is recognized by an issuing State within the United States of America , shall any person , body , entity , or thing , be recognized as the equivalent of an " individual " or a " human being " with any rights whatsoever under the Constitution of the United States of America . "
The people who write bills can submit this concept in impenetrable legaleze , as seems to be required by the current madness that passes for government .
The teabagging element of the loony right has finally given us a germ of an idea , the slightest feint toward a legal concept , that the center and the left can rally around .

Paying $ 8.25 to talk to a live ( perhaps semi- nude ) girl over the internet seems like a porn site pop-up ad , but it 's actually the business plan for GameCrush - a company aiming to link male gamers and willing PlayDates .
Advertisement
Earlier this week , Kotaku explained the basic premise of the website :
Interested , lonely men ( or cashed up pranksters ) can sign up to the site , and once there , choose from two options : play a simple Flash game ( checkers , etc ) against a " PlayDate " , where you get face - to - face time with one of these " attractive girls " over a webcam , or join them for a bit of multiplayer over Xbox Live .
A single game of either will cost you $ 8.25 , with Xbox Live matches running for 10 minutes , and Flash games for 6 .

Banking on the fantasy needs of men ( and the occasional woman - Kotaku points out that there 's a Goth boy registered , interested in playing with boys or girls ) , the site also sorts the women into two categories : flirty or dirty , depending on the level of nasty talk requested .
In essence , GameCrush is marketing cybersex 2.0 , with a video game chaser .
Apparently , quite a few people are looking forward to the service .
Over at IGN , Daemon Hatfield writes the most comprehensive review of the site and its ranking mechanics :
After a session you can rate your PlayDate on her hotness , gaming skill , and flirtiness .
The highest - rated girls will receive preferred placement on the site .
GameCrush is assembling a team of its most highly regarded PlayDates called JaneCrush , which would be positioned similar to Ubisoft 's Fragdolls in that members of JaneCrush will generate content for the site like blogs and editorials .
GameCrush wants to turn its most popular girls into gaming stars .

Hatfield notes that the women are generally allowed to choose their partners , and ultimately concludes game crush is just a space for girls who like to game to make a little cash on the side .
However , his test experience reveals a slightly different dynamic at play :
During an early demo of the service I played a couple casual games with PlayDate Ambibambi23 .
She was a nice girl ( and totally kicked my ass in both pool and Battleship , btw ) but her boyfriend was hanging out behind her and she made mention of him a couple times .
Her game mood is set to " flirty , " but there was zero flirting going on .
I can imagine some guys might be disappointed if they paid to play with a girl , only to hear her go on and on about her boyfriend — and even have to see the guy during a video chat .
I gave Ambibambi23 high marks for her gaming skill but dinged her for her lack of flirtiness .

Yep , just a little side cash - as long as the boys like you and you do n't bore them talking about your boyfriend .
Most of the girl gamers in the blogosphere have reacted with disgust .
Sinnicism points out the stereotypes inherent in the project and launch :
GameCrush.com suggests that girls who game are really difficult to find , and that girls do not , can not , or should not regularly game unless they 're getting paid to do so .
Again reinforcing the stereotype that women do not actually enjoy playing video games , but simply do it to get attention from men ; as though we are only motivated by the possibility of receiving male attention in every area of our lives .
As though we put on lipstick and sit in black lace panties while playing video games just in case a man catches us doing it ( ok , not going to lie , that sounds a little fun ) .
It makes me wonder if anyone ever stops to think about the fact that many women simply enjoy the same things that men do .
SHOCKING !
I know .

Over at the Border House Jadelyn rips into the venture :
Just a quick scan nets me evidence of FAIL on heterosexism , women - as - commodities , and serious reinforcement of gamer stereotypes for both male and female gamers .
GameCrush assumes that the bulk of gamers are male and heterosexual , and that those male gamers are nerdy shut -ins who tremble at the sight of a real live woman and who have never developed the social skills to interact with women in person , so they need to purchase time with them in the only social arena they are comfortable .
It also assumes that female gamers are such rarely - sighted unicorns that the assumedly - dorky male gamers will be willing to pay for the unique , previously - unknown pleasure of playing video games with a woman .

But the existence of a space like GameCrush should n't come as a surprise - indeed , online gaming culture stokes the fires that lead to this particular beast .
Writer Katharine Fletcher grappled with her own ambivalence about feminism before she entered the gaming industry , and was confronted with a variety of confusing scenarios that revolved around gender in the workplace .
Writing for Wired 's Game Life section , she reflects on the role being female played in her career , noting :
I am the first to acknowledge that , while I was hired for my gaming and writing credentials , if I had n't also been female I probably would n't have got my first job as a game journalist .
I can't quite decide whether this is good , bad or somewhere in between — when you hire someone to be part of a team , you are taking on their personality , and their gender is a part of that .

Fletcher speaks to a fellow games writer and former model Alex Sim - Wise and finds a similar story :
Alex also enjoys being in an industry where you are valued " for your smarts rather than your assets " , but admitted it was probably the combination of the two that had got her the attention she receives .

Women occupy a strange position , whether players or employees .
Women players , regardless of how many there are , how vocal they are , or how long they have been playing are often seen as anomalies , intruders into clubhouse .
Women working in the industry are often judged by both their abilities and attractiveness , as well as their ability to let a lot of shit slide .

In this type of gaming landscape , it only makes sense that a company would try to capitalize on sexism and stereotypes .

UPDATE : This report refers not to the current year but to the 2009 crop year , which according to the USDA did see a slight drop in US GMO soybean plantings , as predicted .
New estimates on the 2010 crop year should be forthcoming so we can ssee if this really was a blip or a trend .
_______________
Is it possible that last year we reached Peak Monsanto ?
( via the Non- GMO Report ) :
Low commodity soybean prices , attractive premiums , and rising prices for genetically modified soybean seed are leading American farmers to plant more acres of non-GMO soybeans this year .
Representatives with soybean associations , universities , and grain buyers all say that demand for non-GMO soybeans is growing , leading to more non-GMO acres .
Genetically modified Roundup Ready soybeans have taken an increasingly larger percentage of U.S. soybean acreage each year since their introduction in 1996 , reaching 92 percent in 2008 .
But this could be the first year that the trend reverses .
Grover Shannon , a soybean breeder with the University of Missouri , Delta Research Center , thinks non-GMO acreage could account for 10 percent of total soybean acreage this year .
This analysis comes from The Organic and Non-GMO Report so it ’s fair to be skeptical .
But it does quote a rep from a state soybean associations , not generally bastions of sustainable ag proponents :
“ We are seeing more interest in growing non-GMO soybeans , ” says Mark Albertson , director of marketing , Illinois Soybean Association . …
Albertson has talked to several farmers who have n’t grown non-GMO soybeans in eight years , but will this year because of the premiums .
Grain companies large and small are contracting farmers to grow non-GMO .
“ We called all the companies buying non-GMO , and about one - half of them had enough acres , ” Albertson said .
The reasons run the gamut from farmer anger at Monsanto ’s price increases for its GM seed and its RoundUp pesticide to the recognition that the rise of resistant weeds have reduced the rationale for going GM in the first place to another kind of increasing resistance — among consumers towards GM foods .
Of course , it ’s entirely possible that this is a blip and not a trend — we wo n’t even know for certain that total planted acres of GM soybeans have declined until later this year .
Still , when you combine this news with the Justice Department ’s active antitrust investigation into Monsanto , you may legitimately conclude that the tide may be close to turning against the biotechnology giant .
Over the years would - be game pirates have been targeted in a number of ways such as through draconian DRM schemes and even viruses .
Now it appears that file - sharers who thought they were going to download a high - profile interactive erotic novel have been instead treated to a security and privacy breach of epic proportions .
Although probably not that popular with your average Western Modern Warfare 2 gamer , visual novels are very popular in Japan .
Players watch and listen to a story and as it unfolds and are able to influence the outcome of the plot by making decisions which cause the game to branch .
These games often have erotic and downright sexual elements and Cross Days from developer 0verflow is no different .
The game suffered several delays before release , apparently so that it could be launched along with a special , ahem , USB ‘ hands - free ’ device for experiencing ‘ climax scenes ’ ( NSFW : Male and female versions ) but it was finally released just a few days ago .
Of course , not everyone would acquire the game through the official channels and many turned to file - sharing networks for their erotic gaming fix .
Some , who were not particularly careful about the item they were downloading , were in for a pretty big shock .
Alongside the pirated versions of Cross Days can be found some software which claims to be the installer for the game , but is actually a piece of pretty vicious malware which appears to try to punish would - be pirates .
When run , the installer pretends to be the game but using personal information gathered from the victim ’s computer ( including IP address ) , it presents a survey which asks for more personal information – including their email address and password .
Once completed , the information is uploaded to a website for all the Internet to see – accompanied by a screenshot of the victim ’s desktop .
Samples of the information uploaded by the trojan can be viewed here and although much of it is in Japanese , there ’s enough pictures and English text to entertain most readers and thoroughly embarrass the unlucky reader of Keily ’s Plant .
Adding insult to injury , according to a report the installer ’s terms of service agreement actually states that all these things happen , but as we all know , hardly anyone reads them .
Although it is possible to have the would - be pirate ’s personal information taken down from the website , first the user has to effectively apologize for having tried to illegally download Cross Days .
Adding to the confusion , developer 0verflow are reporting that users of Avast !
anti-virus software receive a false - positive warning ( Win32 : Trojan - gen ) when installing the real game .
This is n’t the first time Japanese file - sharers have been targeted by malware writers .
In 2007 a bizarre virus was released which threatened to kill people who illegally download using P2P .

" Engraved on it are instructions for building a phonograph to play the ' Sounds of Earth ' record .
A stylus and cartridge are included with the record .
Also shown are the proper way to reconstruct the pictures recorded on the record and the location of our Sun in our Galaxy . " *
Truth :
The construction is gold - plated copper .
The committee that curated the record was headed by le hero Carl Sagan .
It should probably include a photo of me looking at it .
You know , for scale .
So that aliens know how big we are in relation to the record .

... I mean , I 'm not going to , like , sing the hook to the " Music of the Spheres " or the wind or anything .
Although maybe I 'm taking singing lessons right now just in case NASA needs someone .
I made the title totally longer and therefore better by adding " Space " along with " Stellaradicus " and " Infinitus " .

BEIJING ( AFP ) – Authorities are investigating a Chinese zoo where three dozen animals including 13 rare Siberian tigers died recently , amid charges it was harvesting their parts , state media said Monday .
The probe of the zoo in the northeastern city of Shenyang will look at whether the animal parts were being used as ingredients in Chinese medicine and other products , Xinhua news agency said .

China banned the international trade in tiger bones and related products in 1993 , and is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) , which also bars such trade .
But such transactions exist as many tiger parts , such as penises and bones , are commonly believed to increase sexual potency or cure certain illnesses .
Xinhua quoted a manager at the Shenyang Forest Wildlife Zoo as saying that the carcasses of the dead tigers , 11 of which starved to death and two of which were shot after mauling a worker , have been cut up and put in cold storage .
But another unnamed zoo worker said the bones had been used to make tiger - bone liquor that was used to “ serve important guests ” .
The deaths , which came to light as China celebrates the Lunar Year of the Tiger , have been blamed on a combination of inadequate funding , an unusually cold winter and poor general conditions at the facility , the China Daily said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Zoo workers fed the tigers cheap chicken bones in recent months as funding dried up .
On Sunday , the Shenyang government announced that it had allocated one million dollars to save surviving animals and fund the zoo .
Besides the tigers , 22 other animals have died , including rare species that are protected in China , among them a red- crowned crane , four stump - tailed macaques , and one brown bear .
The Shenyang government has a 15 percent share in the zoo , which is mainly privately owned .
ADVERTISEMENT
China says it has nearly 6,000 tigers in captivity , but just 50 to 60 are left in the wild , including about 20 wild Siberian tigers .
In the 1980s , China set up tiger farms to try to preserve the big cats , intending to release some into the wild .
But conservation groups say the farms are used to harvest ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine .
Yesterday IndustryGamers reported that , according to one analyst , EA are looking to get 2 million subscribers when Star Wars : The Old Republic releases next year .
Many have since speculated that EA needed this amount of subscribers for the game to break eave .
In a genre where only one game has ever exceeded two million subscribers at $ 15 per month , that ’s a very high standard to put yourself up against .
Then again , we are talking about Star Wars , beloved by geeks the world over .
We ’re also talking about BioWare , who have blown many gamers away with the awesomeness of Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age : Origins .
Over at massively they discuss this matter in further details .
A a really good read I recommend to check out :
Two million is possible worldwide , right ?
The other issue that I ’m hanging on is the fact that 2 million subscribers is a far fetch for the North American and European markets .
The key word in this sentence is subscribers .
While Aion may tout a very significant three million users worldwide and World of Warcraft holds up the 11 million subscribers sign , the Asian market is not full of 15 dollar a month subscribers .
As we dislike microtransactions , they dislike a pay per month scheme .
Because of this , it ’s difficult to really put a solid figure on the number of accounts in Asia .
Plus , there is also the fact that some of them may never spend the magical $ 15 per month while others may spend well over that .
World of Warcraft has only hit approximately 2.5 million users in North America , which draws the issue of obtaining two million subscribers into question .
We have a market where , right now , 300,000 users is an impressive amount for a game that is n’t World of Warcraft .
Going from 300,000 users to two million users is a very large divide for a game to conquer .
Check out the full story here
Last week I talked about how we replaced a small C program with an equivalent piece of Haskell code .
As much as I 'd like to say that we deployed the code and there was much rejoicing and client side caching , the real story is a little more complicated than that .
There were some really good questions that we had to consider :
How many maintainers at any given time know the language ?
The Scripts project is student - run , and has an unusually high turnover rate : any given maintainer is only guaranteed to be around for four to five years ( maybe a little longer if they stick around town , but besides a few notable exceptions , most people move on after their time as a student ) .
This means at any given point we have to worry about whether or not the sum knowledge of the active contributors is enough to cover all facets of the system , and facility in a language is critical to being able to administrate the component effectively ( students we are , we frequently don both the sysadmin and developer hats ) .
In a corporate setting , this is less prominent , but it still plays a factor : employees switch from one group to another and eventually people leave or retire .
We have two current maintainers who are fairly fluent in Haskell .
The long - term sustainability of this approach is uncertain , and hinges on our ability to attract prospective students who know or are interested in learning Haskell ; in the worst case , people may crack open the code , say " what the fuck is this " and rewrite it in another language .
How many maintainers at any given time feel comfortable hacking in the language ?
While superficially similar to the first point , it 's actually quite different ; posed differently , it 's the difference between " can I write a full program in this language " and " can I effectively make changes to a program written in this language . "
At a certain level of fluency , a programmer picks up a special feat : the ability to look at any C / Fortran derived language and lift any knowledge they need about the syntax from the surrounding code .
It 's the difference between learning syntax , and learning a new programming paradigm .
We may not be simultaneously Python / Perl / PHP / Java / Ruby / C experts , but the lessons in these languages carry over to one another , and many of us have working " hacker " knowledge in all of them .
But Haskell is different : it 's lineage is among that of Lisp , Miranda and ML , and the imperative knowledge simply does not translate .
One hopes that it 's still possible to tell what any given chunk of Haskell code does , but it 's a strictly read - only capability .
Who else uses it ?
For one of the team members , migrating from Subversion to Git was a pretty hard sell , but at this point , minus the missing infrastructure for doing the migration properly , he 's basically been convinced that this is the right way forward .
One of the big reasons this was ok , though , was because they were able to list of projects ( Linux , our kernel ; AFS , our filesystem ; Fedora , our distro ) that they used regularly that also used Git .
We can't say the same for Haskell : the " big " open - source high - visibility applications in Haskell are Xmonad and Darcs , of which many people have never used .
As a student group , we have far more latitude to experiment with new technology , but lack of ubiquity means greater risk , and corporations are allergic to that kind of risk .
It ’s a conspiracy theory that will never die .
They call them “ birthers . ”
It seems no matter how many times President Obama ’s birth certificate is handed to them , no matter how many lawsuits they lose , they just continue to insist that the president is hiding something about his place of birth …
That he may secretly be a Kenyan .
Or worse .

Count Congressman Nathan Deal ( R - GA ) among them .
Except , by asking for Obama ’s birth certificate , Deal insists he ’s not questioning the president ’s “ legitimacy ” as other birthers may .
He just thinks it is something President Obama would like to “ clear up . ”
The congressman , who is running for Governor of Georgia , sent an electronic letter on congressional stationery to the White House at the beginning of December , asking President Obama to release his birth certificate .
“ This is probably the first time in 233 years of American history that a sitting member of the House of Representatives has officially challenged the legitimacy of a sitting president , ” birther blog The Post & Email claimed .
“ This forever changes the public discourse . ”
Unfortunately for them , it did not .
The story went largely unnoticed .
ADVERTISEMENT
President Obama ’s birth certificate has been available on the Internet since 2008 .
A copy is visible at the bottom of this article .
Yet , at a Feb. 6 meeting of the Georgia Christian Alliance , Deal told a group of birther activists that their questions “ deserve at least [ Obama ’s ] response . ”
Deal added : “ I do not shy away from hard questions .
I answer those questions .
If I do n’t have information to answer the questions , I have to go to the folks who do have the answers .
In this case , the president is the one who could clear this up .
What I am asking him to do is tell me where I can ask my constituents to go to see authentic documentation that he says [ inaudible ] will satisfy their curiosity . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
As if on cue , the Georgia Liberal blog launched its own campaign asking Deal to prove that he is , in fact , eligible to run for governor .
“ Sure , maybe Deal is a resident of Georgia now … maybe …
But has he been so for the past six years ? ” they sarcastically ask .
“ And has he been an American citizen for 15 years ?
And , is he actually 30 ?
I mean , I ASSUME he is 30 … but we ca n’t assume these things , we need proof ! ”
ADVERTISEMENT
They would like to be known as the “ proofers , ” the blog adds .
Neither Deal ’s House.gov site , nor his campaign site feature documents proving his eligibility to run for governor .
However , during the presidential campaign , then - Senator Obama had his birth certificate posted to a site dedicated to counteracting outlandish political attacks .
That document was confirmed as valid by Hawaii ’s health director .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ These sort of things deserve straightforward responses , ” Deal claimed during his recent interview .
“ I ’m not questioning his legitimacy to serve as president .
I would think that he would like to clear that up … ”
During an appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier in February , President Obama chided Republicans for these type of attacks .
“ Surely you can question my policies without questioning my faith , ” he said before adding , “ or , for that matter , my citizenship . ”
Just 44 percent of Republicans at - large believe President Obama is a United States citizen , according to a recent Daily Kos poll .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Washington Independent ’s David Weigel posted a video of Deal “ being questioned by minor birther figure Carl Swensson . ”
“ I know that some folks are trying to label this as politically incorrect , ” Deal told Swennsson .
“ I want to tell you something .
Political incorrectness is paralyzing our society .
These kinds of things deserve straightforward responses .
And I think this ought to be put to rest I ’m not questioning his legitimacy to serve as president .
I would think he ’d like to clear that up in as unequivocal a fashion as possible .
And that ’s simply all I ’m asking . ”

Why writing software is not like engineering
Why writing software is not like engineering
Terence Parr [ author of ANTLR parser generator etc ...]
This article popped up on reddit and news.ycombinator.com .
In Romanian
While my talent lies in software , my graduate studies were in computer engineering ( designing and building digital computers ) .
One observation always struck me : computer engineering seemed more straightforward than computer science ( building software ) .
There are a set of engineering design rules to follow and engineering projects are much more likely to work out than software projects .
Yes , there are some spectacular engineering failures but , empirically , reliable and useful software is more difficult to pull off .
To illustrate my point , consider the amazing space probes we send throughout the solar system .
The spacecraft themselves work extremely well , often living long past their design lifetimes .
Their control software , on the other hand , has to be constantly tweaked and patched in flight to keep the mission together .
I am not trying to say that engineering is easy ; it is not .
My goal is simply to explain why software is harder to get right than physical construction projects in general and why " software engineering " is an inappropriate term .
The Economist magazine ( Nov 27 , 2004 p. 71 ) cites the Standish Group 's estimates that
" ...30 % of all software projects are canceled , nearly half come in over budget , 60 % are considered failures by the organizations that initiated them , and 9 out of 10 come in late . "
The article goes on to point out that while few large infrastructure projects are completed on time and on budget , you usually get something in the end .
You have to enter the realm of software ( or the military ) in order to spend billions and get nothing for it .
The biggest reason for this profligate waste lies in that , while a partially completed building or infrastructure project with flaws can still be useful , software either works or it does n't .
Because software is devilishly difficult to get right , we often end up with nothing ( e.g. , FBI Dumps Botched Computer Overhaul , F.B.I. Faces New Setback in Computer Overhaul ) .
Why is writing software not like engineering ?
The answer lies in a single fundamental difference with far - reaching ramifications : engineering is constrained by the real , physical world and software is not .
While obvious , this is the crucial difference that explains why software development is harder to get right .
The next few sections explore these ramifications .
Engineering components exist in the real world
Physical engineering projects are easier to visualize and , therefore , easier to build ; heck , you can actually touch the components and the final product with your hands .
The further you get away from the Newtonian view of the physical world that we experience in everyday life , the more difficult the project .
Quantum physics is difficult because particles do n't behave like rocks .
String theory , the most promising method of modeling quantum physics , is primarily difficult to understand because it deals with six or seven extra dimensions beyond the usual three spatial dimensions .
Imagine trying to design and build a house on a Calabi - Yau Manifold ( image to the right is a 3 - D projection ) .
Software does not even have the concept of dimension .
You might say that there are no lines within which to color .
At least for engineering projects above the quantum level , no one expects to find structures that " defy the laws of physics . "
This limits what you can physically build and how you can build it but at least it provides a well - defined world in which to work .
The ethereal world of software does not have this luxury , but our tools are getting better .
Object - oriented programming was invented to make writing software more familiar to our hunter gatherer brains ; that is , to make software components with properties and behavior like objects in the real world .
Engineering components interact in more predictable ways
Engineering is less risky than software because engineering experiences fewer constituent component interactions .
While minor changes to one part of a car 's structure can easily affect the crash robustness of another , it would be unusual for a design flaw in the dome light to cause intermittent engine stalls .
In a home construction project , you would have to work pretty hard to make a toilet flush every time someone rang the doorbell .
When building software , on the other hand , you have to be hypervigilant to avoid these undesirable interactions .
One of the reasons many programmers like pure functional programming is its lack of side effects -- there simply is no way for the toilet to flush inadvertently when the doorbell rings .
The situation is even worse in languages like C++ without inherent buffer overflow protection .
A remote fragment of code can unintentionally alter the behavior of the overall application much more easily .
In fact , it is this particular weakness that most hackers exploit .
By causing a buffer overflow , an attacker can force the program to open a hole in its defenses .
Engineering has fewer fundamental midcourse design changes
The final reason that software is more difficult to get right than engineering projects concerns midcourse design changes .
The physical world is not as malleable as the insubstantial world of software and , consequently , clients simply have lower expectations .
Congress does not go to NASA halfway through a moonshot and ask them to go to Mars instead .
Most engineering projects are able to actually use the waterfall design method : determine functional requirements , design , implement , test .
For most software projects , this is a recipe for disaster .
Unfortunately , midcourse design changes happen in software all the time -- every time the customer gets a peek at the running software .
In fact , the agile software development method is a direct response to ever - changing design requirements .
Programmers are asked to embrace change as an opportunity .
Still , constant changes to the design hamper development efforts and developers must constantly refactor software to prevent it from becoming a tangled , unmaintainable mess .
You might ask why , if software is so hard to get right , airplanes do not fall out of the sky .
It turns out they do occasionally and bad software is often the culprit ; e.g. , watch a fly - by - wire Airbus 320 crash .
Most of the time , however , hardware control software for airplanes , cars , and medical devices works as expected .
The reason for the increased reliability is threefold .
First , there are lives at stake and people are likely more careful .
Secondly , the software developers are not asked to alter the software fundamentally during development .
For example , a propeller driven airplane does not become a jet aircraft in the middle of development .
An engineering team would start over , whereas a software team is typically asked to make radical changes midstream .
And , finally , such software deals with controlling physical devices and starts to gain some of the advantages afforded physical engineering projects .
Is software development a science ?
So if software development is not like engineering , what is it ?
We call the discipline computer science , but I am not sure that term is completely appropriate either .
You may recall the old joke , " If a discipline has ' science ' in the title , it probably is n't . "
In my view , science is about discovering and describing physical phenomena using a scientific method .
Merriam - Webster describes the scientific method as :
" Principles and procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge involving the recognition and formulation of a problem , the collection of data through observation and experiment , and the formulation and testing of hypotheses . "
That description smacks of debugging more than the act of writing software .
Computer science is about building things like engineering but without the luxury of a toolbox and components taken from the physical world .
No one has worked out reliable and effective procedures for building large pieces of software as the engineers have done for physical project .
As Alan Kay puts it , software is " engineering of a sort ... but just done by brute force " .
A conversation with Alan Kay :
" If you look at software today , through the lens of the history of engineering , it 's certainly engineering of a sort -- but it 's the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did .
Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other , with no structural integrity , but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves . "
Writing software is more an art than an engineering discipline
Writing software is most similar to writing fiction novels .
Writing novels is also an act of creation in an unconstrained and ethereal medium with few well - established construction rules .
We know good writing when we see it , but it is hard to teach .
Experience writing and feedback from better writers ( coders ) is the most reliable means of becoming a good writer ( coder ) .
Without a well understood process , software will remain more an art than a science .
The term " software engineering " is more a goal than how we actually write software .
Here 's one comic - book adaptation I would dearly like to see - Wes Anderson 's take on Spider - Man .
It is a tale of love and photography , of responsibility and revenge ; a film so arch it 's practically humpbacked .
For all that , The Amazing Spider - Man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears .
Downplay those distracting crime - fighting elements and Peter Parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited .
He is , in short , a very Andersonian antihero .
Sadly , it seems that this is a tale that will never see the light of day .
Anderson has yet to shoot a Spider - Man picture and ( despite swirling rumours to the contrary ) surely is n't about to embark on one now .
Neither , for that matter , has he remade The Lord of the Rings in his own image or launched a gloriously prostrate attack ad for John McCain .
Some directors spawn imitators .
Others , it transpires , prompt spoofs .
For better or worse , Anderson 's work is now so instantly recognisable that its hallmarks can be easily distilled and converted into a simple comedy formula .
Or , as he puts it himself : " I have my own personality and some people are going to like that and others are not .
I think some people find it very annoying when they feel that a film - maker 's signature is too visible .
But without ever quite making that choice , that tends to be the way I make 'em .
You can spot 'em a mile off . "
It is the fate of the spoof to be viewed as somehow derogatory ; the cruel , crass cousin of homage .
But is this strictly fair ?
The Amazing Spider - Man shows how they can actually be more honest – and more affectionate – than some coy and slippery imitation .
In the meantime , I eagerly await the next Wes Anderson Film We'll Never See .
Who knows ?
Some of these may yet come to eclipse the ones we do .
Finally all testing and bugfixing is finished .
OpenLink has done an outstanding job with this new release of Virtuoso .
Again my thanks go out to the Virtuoso development team and Patrick van Kleef who was my contact to smooth out the issues which prevented us to use Virtuoso 6 with Nepomuk .
So now is the time for distributions to package Virtuoso 6.1.0 and for you to update it on your own .
But wait , there is one little detail : the database format changed significantly between Virtuoso 5 and 6 .
That is why I wrote a little conversion tool called Virtuosoconverter which takes care of this problem ( Caution : the build system will download the Virtuoso 5.0.12 sources which are roughly 60 MB ) .
Usage is simple :
Shut down Nepomuk Install Virtuoso 6.1.0 Run the Converter Restart Nepomuk
Virtuoso 6 offers a wide range of features which are yet to be exposed through Nepomuk .
The fun is only just starting !
Hints for Distributors :
You might want to run the converter in auto mode before starting Nepomuk .
If you do not like the build system downloading the Virtuoso 5 sources simply put them in the source tree .
The build system will pick them up and use them instead of downloading .
Updates :
If you have old Virtuoso V5 data and do not run the converter after updating to Virtuoso V6 Nepomuk will not start .
The converter is the only way to convert the data to the new database format ( except if you run some sql commands on the server manually )
Here is a list of 10 famous puzzles which have been asked on a Microsoft Interview .
They are not in any specific order .
Clock Hands
How many times a day do the minute and hour hands of a clock overlap ?
Answer
Is Your Husband a Cheat ?
A certain town comprises of 100 married couples .
Everyone in the town lives by the following rule :
If a husband cheats on his wife , the husband is executed as soon as his wife finds out about him .
All the women in the town only gossip about the husbands of other women .
No woman ever tells another woman if her husband is cheating on her .
So every woman in the town knows about all the cheating husbands in the town except her own .
It can also be assumed that a husband remains silent about his infidelity .
One day , the mayor of the town announces to the whole town that there is at least 1 cheating husband in the town .
What do you think happens ?
Answer
100 Prisoners in Solitary Cells
100 prisoners are stuck in the prison in solitary cells .
The warden of the prison got bored one day and offered them a challenge .
He will put one prisoner per day , selected at random ( a prisoner can be selected more than once ) , into a special room with a light bulb and a switch which controls the bulb .
No other prisoners can see or control the light bulb .
The prisoner in the special room can either turn on the bulb , turn off the bulb or do nothing .
On any day , the prisoners can stop this process and say “ Every prisoner has been in the special room at least once ” .
If that happens to be true , all the prisoners will be set free .
If it is false , then all the prisoners will be executed .
The prisoners are given some time to discuss and figure out a solution .
How do they ensure they all go free ?

The sustained assault on climate science , detailed in this series , spread from the loonier corners of the internet first into certain media outlets with an ideological axe to grind , and now into neutral news outlets too lazy or lacking in confidence to carry out some basic checking before reporting the same distortions .
There is no excuse for this as there are a number of websites with easy - to - read and up - to - date deconstructions of the lies and misrepresentations peddled by sceptics , including Deltoid in Australia and RealClimate in the United States .
But if in echoing denialist misrepresentations some journalists are naïve or too busy to check , others are willing accomplices .
For several years
The Australian newspaper has been the leading organ of climate denial in Australia .
The list of beat - ups is so long that blogger Tim Lambert keeps a catalogue of The Australian 's war on science .
It 's a kind of archive of journalistic misbehavior that could be used in courses on media ethics .
Let 's consider a couple of them .
Franklingate
Earlier this month , The Australian decided it wanted to challenge Climate Change Minister Penny Wong 's " alarming predictions " about the effect of sea - level rise on Australia 's coasts .
So to which authority did journalists Matthew Franklin and Lanai Vasek turn to repudiate decades of scientific research ?
There he was , featured in a huge photograph on the front page under the headline " Wong wipeout does n't wash with locals " , a 53 - year - old bronzed man named Lee who said he'd been swimming at Bondi for 30 years and " was adamant he had seen ' no change ' to the coastline " .
To augment his careful observations , Lee engaged in some projections too , declaring that there 's nothing suggesting sea-levels at Bondi will change in the future .
Brilliant ; give him a job at Australia 's leading sea - level research outfit , the Antarctic Climate CRC in Hobart .
There he could go head - to - head with Dr John Church , the world 's leading authority on sea - level rise .
He chairs the World Climate Research Programme 's scientific committee on sea - level rise , was awarded the 2006 CSIRO 's Medal for Research Achievement , and in 2007 won the Eureka Prize for his work on the measurement of sea - level rise .
Mere trifles compared to Lee 's common sense .
Franklin and Vasek did not ask Church or any other authority on sea - level rise what their research shows ; instead , for " authority " , they quoted Bob Carter , one of Australia 's leading climate skeptics — a favourite of the Heartland Institute and a founding member of the Australian Environment Foundation , a front group set up by the Institute of Public Affairs and whose board has included Leon Ashby , now president of the Climate Sceptics Party .
The Australian 's decision to pitch the opinion of a bloke with a tan against years of scientific research is a deliberate strategy of pandering to ignorance , of fuelling wishful thinking at the expense of science .
As politics it 's clever ; as journalism it 's risible .
Walkergate
Jamie Walker writes beat - ups aimed at discrediting scientific claims that the Great Barrier Reef is seriously threatened by global warming .
In a story earlier this month ( front page again ) Walker accurately reported research by the Australian Institute of Marine Science to the effect that some reefs did not experience the expected bleaching last summer due to the influence of storms .
This became the headline " Report undercuts PM 's reef wipeout " because Walker made the ludicrous leap from the absence of bleaching for two years to a rosy future for the Reef into the indefinite future .
One data point became that basis for rejecting a catalogue of research linking warming seas to coral damage .
Walker has form for bagging marine scientists .
Last year a story by him headed " Scientists ' crying wolf ' over coral " was based on the opinion of Peter Ridd , a physicist who is listed as the Science Coordinator for the Australian Environment Foundation front group .
Weissergate
For years , the opinion pages of The Australian have been turned over to every denialist who pops up anywhere around the world , with even the loopiest given free rein — Christopher Monckton , Andrey Illarionov , Ian Plimer , Bob Carter , David Evans , Jon Jenkins , Christopher Booker , David Bellamy , Brendan O'Neill , Frank Furedi and many more .
The last two , incidentally , are members of an anti-environmental Trotskyist splinter group called the Revolutionary Communist Party , showing that , for opinion editor Rebecca Weisser , it does n't matter whether you are left or right as long as you loathe environmentalism .
Mitchellgate
The man who oversees this travesty of reporting is editor - in - chief Chris Mitchell .
Last year he was chuffed to receive the annual JN Pierce Award for Media Excellence for coverage of climate change policy from … wait for it … the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association , the foremost lobby group for the oil and gas industries .
APPEA lauded Mitchell because his paper's
" in - depth coverage of a range of public policy issues affecting Australia 's upstream oil and gas industry has been of a consistently high standard .
The reporting has been thoughtful , balanced , analytical , well researched and a big effort was made to ensure that all facets of the issue were presented . "
Astonishment robs me of words .
The Fox of print
Rupert Murdoch had a much - publicised change of heart in 2007 — thought to be stimulated by his son James — when he told his news editors that the planet should be given the benefit of the doubt and News Ltd would go carbon - neutral .
There are now rumours that Murdoch has recanted and has rejoined the denialist camp .
Certainly that would be consistent with the virulent anti-science now being run by his media outlets — including the triumvirate of broadsheets based in London , New York and Sydney — led of course by Fox News .
Murdoch 's son - in - law , Matthew Freud said he spoke for other family members when he last month launched a breath - taking attack on Fox News .
He said he is " ashamed and sickened by [ Fox boss ] Roger Ailes 's horrendous and sustained disregard [ for ] journalistic standards " .
Despite its high - brow pretentions , is not The Australian — with the same commitment to an ideological agenda , the same disregard for the separation of news and comment , and the same stable of bumptious right - wing columnists — just the Fox News of print ?
No wonder the paper 's last reporter with any credibility on climate change , Lenore Taylor , has finally jumped ship .
Right now on campuses across Australia , The Australian is engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign to sign up university students , offering a year 's subscription for $ 20 .
It would be comforting to believe that university students are capable of seeing through the distortions and manipulation of news that defines the national broadsheet .
But that is wishful thinking and to the extent that The Australian 's discount sale succeeds we risk seeing a generation of graduates whose understanding of climate science is grossly distorted by the newspaper 's unrelenting war on science .
For years , scientific organisations have attempted to correct The Australian 's misrepresentation of the science .
So unresponsive is the newspaper that some , including the Bureau of Meteorology , have just given up .
Science 's defenders
The trashing of the reputation of climate science spills over into the other sciences , so how has the profession been fighting back ?
After all , once the fury dies down it is likely to be many years before public trust in science can be rebuilt to previous levels .
It would be a grave mistake for scientific organisations to imagine that this will all blow over and the world will return to normal .
One would expect that the employers and professional organisations of the scientists who are daily attacked as frauds , cheats and political zealots would be in the public domain defending them against these charges .
But for the most part , they have been missing in action or engaged in skirmishes far from the main action .
The CSIRO is nowhere to be seen .
Instead it has put the lid on its climate scientists , barring them from presenting their work , preferring actively to promote the commercial interests of the coal industry .
The CSIRO 's new Chief Executive , Dr Megan Clark ( who transferred across from a senior executive position with BHP Billiton ) should be out in public defending vigorously the quality of the organisation 's climate research .
The Bureau of Meteorology , whose work has often been traduced , has tried to respond but seems to have capitulated in the face of hopeless odds .
The Australian Academy of Science includes fellows whose work has been called fraudulent and dishonest and who are the target of abuse and threats .
Their treatment should be a matter of the first concern , not least because the esteem in which all science is held is under attack .
At bottom , scientists are not good at public relations , and most scientists would much rather bury themselves in their labs than face a microphone .
Once this did not matter , but in the face of a sustained assault on their credibility by people who have an intimate knowledge of how to use the media to manipulate the truth , their unworldliness is causing lasting damage .
If only Miss Marple had been a bisexual biker with multiple piercings , a criminal record , and a long lick of oil - black hair over one eye , she might have solved a few more crimes .
Those are the accoutrements with which Lisbeth Salander ( Noomi Rapace ) is decked out in “ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , ” and they stand her in good stead for the unpicking of clues .
Lisbeth has a gift for computer hacking , plus an ability to trawl briskly through printed files , and I found it endearing that , even as the movie tries to rough us up with tales of fascists , dildos , woodland snipers , and exploding cars , the main lesson that we come away with is : there ’s nothing like a day in the archives .
Lisbeth is one of a pair of sleuths .
Her partner is Mikael Blomkvist ( Michael Nyqvist ) , a journalist with Millennium magazine , in Stockholm , who is hired by an aging industrialist named Henrik Vanger ( Sven- Bertil Taube ) to investigate a vanishing .
Forty years ago , his niece Harriet went missing from the island where he lives , during a meeting of the Vanger clan .
( The bridge connecting them to the mainland was , of course , closed that day : a variant on the old standby of the locked room . )
Henrik believes that she was murdered , and he suspects every member of his scowling family .
At one point , the surviving relatives even gather in a drawing room , with Blomkvist present , and for a few minutes we are indeed back in the hermetic world of Agatha Christie .
Is this film really as murky and modern as it thinks it is ?
There is no doubting the cunning of the director , Niels Arden Oplev .
He has constructed a long film , running more than two and a half hours , so as to make it feel like a short and speedy one .
Both the editing and the music rattle along at quite a clip , and even patches of dogged research are whipped into unlikely fervor .
The most elegant of these is Blomkvist ’s scanning of old negatives : grainy shots of Harriet , in the crowd at a parade , which , when blown up and placed in quick sequence , suddenly assume the shape of a mini-movie .
I am a sucker for these smaller narratives , crouched and concealed within the larger quest ; the problem comes as they start to swell and delay the Vanger plot .
First , we get a prologue in which Blomkvist is found guilty of libel in an unconnected matter , involving another wealthy public figure , and sent to jail .
( The sentence is delayed for six months , which gives him time to solve the case of the disappearing girl . )
Second , Lisbeth , who has unspecified convictions in her past , has a new probation officer , who forces her to provide sexual services in return for a financial allowance ; thus humiliated , she turns the tables , and basically rapes him back .
This frees her up to resume control of her own money , which buys her a new laptop , which allows her to hack into Blomkvist ’s own computer — for no apparent reason other than sheer nosiness — all of which inspires him to take her on as a deputy .
Got that ?
The result of these shenanigans is to yank our two heroes together , not before time , in a cottage on the Vanger estate .
Say what you like about Holmes and Watson , at least they took no more than a page to shake hands and agree to share lodgings .
Why , then , should Oplev delve so deep into backstories ?
Why ca n’t Lisbeth , if her old laptop is broken , claim a new one , using a quaint process that the rest of us call “ insurance , ” and thus save herself the bother of being tortured ?
The answer is that Oplev has not just thrills to purvey but anxieties to air .
His film is an adaptation of the novel by the late Stieg Larsson , the first of a trilogy , which has sold by the wagonload around the world .
Larsson was a reporter , like Blomkvist ; he specialized in exposing the activities of the far right , and his fiction is concerned , to the brink of obsession , with cruelties of every stripe .
The Swedish title of the book translates as “ Men Who Hate Women , ” and Lisbeth ’s private history — which , unsurprisingly , was riven by familial abuse — is linked to the Vanger saga not by any causal logic but simply by a vague , insistent dread of the tyrannical .
Beneath the sadistic surface , there is a strange cultural masochism in Larsson , as in his compatriot Henning Mankell , whose collected works I once feasted on through a single winter , with the kind of gusto that only crime fiction can excite .
It is as though both men want not merely to disassemble the reputation of their homeland as a model — the model — of benign social democracy but to dig backward in a bid to prove that the past , too , was not one of liberal health and justice but a sump of buried transgressions and moral disease .
( When you fear for your socialist Eden , the first people you blame , on instinct , will be capitalist dynasts like the Vangers , safe in their havens of corruption . )
There can be a twilit sadness to this failing of a myth , explored most beautifully in last year ’s “ Fishing in Utopia : Sweden and the Future That Disappeared , ” by the British author Andrew Brown , who lived there in the nineteen - seventies ; but “ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , ” both on the page and onscreen , largely dispenses with the melancholic .
The chilly shack where Lisbeth stays with Blomkvist is a comfortless parody of the blissful huts where Ingmar Bergman planted his lovers , in “ Summer Interlude ” and “ Summer with Monika , ” and Oplev scorns any hint of relaxation , preferring the stab of high drama : the moment that Blomkvist pinned up a row of photographs , showing the older generation of Vangers , I knew that half of them would turn out to have been Nazis .
Was wartime Sweden really just a smaller Germany with added meatballs , or am I missing something ?
If regret lingers anywhere in the movie , it is in the landscapes , which feel not just tranquil but furred with cold , as if the whole place , like the princess in a fairy tale , had been trapped in ice .
There are further hints of lost happiness in our heroes ’ names .
People keep addressing Blomkvist as Kalle , for a joke , Kalle Blomkvist being the intrepid boy detective in stories by Astrid Lindgren ; as for Lindgren ’s more famous creation , Pippi Longstocking , Larsson conceded that a dose of Pippi ’s resourcefulness , and her blithe insouciance in the face of civic norms , had crept into the figure of Lisbeth .
I see his point , but it ’s still a long way from Pippi ’s merry orphanhood to the emotional voiding and gothic glare of the woman in this film .
And , if Oplev wanted to honor Larsson ’s repugnance at misogynist extremes , why did he choose to linger so long , and in such yelping proximity , over the violation scene ?
Noomi Rapace throws herself into the title role , but something about the conception of her character , and about the far - reaching urgency of the sociopathic shocks behind the killing , smacks of a filmmaker pushing too hard .
That is why the movie finds it impossible to wind things up .
As we lurch from flash - backs to forward leaps , the final reel makes “ The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ” look as snappy as “ Some Like It Hot . ”
In a rare reflective interlude , Lisbeth says , “ You choose who you want to be , ” but the rest of the film belies that view , seeing most people , Lisbeth included , as prisoners sealed in their past .
It ’s a true conundrum , for those who devise mysteries : if the sins of the fathers , or the crimes of the motherland , are always to blame , what happens to pure evil ?
It could be out of a job .
As the festivity of the Winter Olympics dies away , what is the next extravaganza that Canada has to offer ?
Welcome to “ Chloe , ” in which a Toronto - based gynecologist has a lesbian affair with a prostitute whom she suspects of having slept with her husband .
If that is n’t a winter sport , I do n’t know what is .
Not unlike snowboard cross , perhaps , except that these contestants have lunchtime sex in hotels instead of knocking each other helmet first into the slush .
David ( Liam Neeson ) misses a surprise birthday party thrown for him by his wife , Catherine ( Julianne Moore ) , who does n’t realize that , for most men , surprise parties are slightly less enjoyable than surprise dentistry .
She thinks that he was otherwise engaged , and , in a fit of inquisitive revenge , pays a call girl named Chloe ( Amanda Seyfried ) to befriend and tempt him .
The befriending gets out of control , but Catherine is so aroused by firsthand accounts of it that she , too , falls into Chloe ’s embrace .
The movie — directed by Atom Egoyan , who should know better — is closely adapted from “ Nathalie , ” a French film of 2004 , with Gérard Depardieu and Emmanuelle Béart , but what seemed like standard practice for Parisians comes across here as unsmiling porno - farce .
Even the throbbing score , by Mychael Danna , sounds unwittingly risible , and there were times — I refer you to David ’s first , salivating gaze at Chloe across a coffee shop — when I felt that we could be watching one of those soft - core cable dramas starring the redoubtable Shannon Tweed , with titles like “ Night Raptures IV ” or “ Executive Sensations . ”
Wait , if you must , for the DVD , although even then , once you ’ve heard the hooker say , “ I try and find something to love in everybody , ” there is a strong case that “ Chloe ” should be pulled from your Erotica shelf and moved to Science Fiction . ♦
Republicans plan to run a platform of repealing health care reform in the November elections but one Democrat believes that GOP opposition will be a “ liability . ”
Sen. Chuck Schumer told NBC ’s David Gregory that Democrats that voted for heath care will enjoy their vote as an asset in the 2010 elections .
“ I predict , David , by November , those who voted for health care will find it an asset .
Those who voted it against it will find it a liability , ” said Schumer .

Brad , I sent this today .

Subject : SHAMEFUL and OUTRAGEOUS
To : executive-editor@nytimes.com
Cc : managing-editor@nytimes.com , SeniorEditor@NYTimes.com , public@nytimes.com , urbina@nytimes.com
Date : Tuesday , March 23 , 2010 , 4:53 PM Dear Mr. Keller : I am outraged that a supposedly professional newspaper such as yours pretends to be , still continues to spread misinformation and libelous lies against the ACORN organization .
It has been reported numerous times to Editor Hoyt that what he is printing about the O'Keefe encounter at ACORN offices has been shown to be a fraudulent story - made up by wet - behind - the - ears thug O'Keefe - who is now facing federal charges over another criminal transgression .
It is unforgivable that your rag does not see fit to print the unvarnished and uncorrupted truth .
It is not enough that you aided and abetted the Bush administration to push this nation into war by corrupting the news during the run-up to that war .
You have not learned any morality nor proper journalism since then .
I enjoin you to print a proper FRONT PAGE truthful story about the O'Keefe fraud .
It is beyond shameful and dishonest that your editors - even as they claim to correct the story - continue falsely to report that "
In the encounters , the activists posed as a prostitute and a pimp and discussed prostitution with the workers . "
WRONG !
I am still waiting for a voluminous FRONT PAGE story about how this young journalist has turned out to be a fraudster who doctored up videos to LOOK LIKE they posed as a pimp and a prostitute , and had everyone including Congress believing their fraud .
And that ACORN was wrongly denied federal funds through an unconstitutional ( as ruled already ) law of attainder .
It should also report that O'Keefe is now accused of a federal crime .
The proper title for this FRONT PAGE article would be " The truth is in - Fraudulent video caused demise of ACORN .
O'Keefe accused of federal crime . "
Our national media is on a precipitous fall from grace .
I suspect that it is incidents like this and like the scandalous misleading reporting in the run-up to the Iraq war that have caused this demise .
I am not sure that we have much left to preserve .
Please prove me wrong .
Sincerely .

You may have noticed on Maddow this evening about the up and coming Republitard barrage of Amendments to the health insurance bill ... the first two to be introduced were done so by philanderer David Vitter and one of them was to DENY FUNDING FOR ACORN !!!
It would be funny if it was n't so fucking sad , and if their goal was n't to just kick people in need while they are down .

Brad , I really want to thank you for maintaining the discussion on this issue .
Outside his of regressive , pre-teen tantrums and his violent need to be coddled by the media , Breitbart relies principally on 2 things to get his way -- 1 . the irrational anger and unfocused rage that he deliberately cultivates in his base , & 2 .
The apathy which he can presume that , most likely , everyone else has ( and with spineless opportunists like Hoyt running around , it 's not surprising that he comes to that conclusion . )
I 'm just glad folks like you are there to counter that negative imbalance , and that you have the means to voice what so many of us already know to be true– that this whole “ sting ” was all a fabricated political witch - hunt that targeted services for the poor with the hope of smearing Obama .
I am grateful for your work , because the kind of world which Andy , james and Hannah all envision is a freakish and scary one ... one where un-vetted and doctored video become not just political smear tools , but worse , the basis for public policy ( ... that congress could punish ACORN on the basis of questionable videos which they didnt even investigate or review is just appalling . )
O’keefe , Breitbart , Giles etc ... are all people who take it for granted that they do n’t need to be accountable for ANYTHING ( is that the stomach - churning , gutter - trash scent of Karl Rove wafting about ? )
So I am glad folks like you are there to make sure they are .
I am also glad to help hold Hoyt accountable for his participation in the BigGov agenda , and I want to thank you for giving us the proper contacts to express our disappointment at the NYT .
But Hoyt also needs to be taken to task for something else .
Hoyt has pushed the narrative dictated by Breitbart which claims that the msm " ignored " him & james etc ... ( as if Fox News isnt ' the msm ...
I mean , they might skirt each and every ethic in the book , but they ARE mainstream . )
That whole scenario was a pretty unconvincing one to me .
First of all , because I saw the review of the tapes on CNN the morning after they aired on Fox ’s evening show .
So the story was hardly “ ignored ” .
Rather , it seems like Breitbart went to some lengths to deliberately keep News groups ( other than Fox News ) out of the loop .
He did this perhaps just to make it look like he was being persecuted ( he really gets off on that ...
I bet there ’s a really mean & unforgiving set of anal beads in his hope chest . )
But honestly , I think he just didnt want to have james go in front of anyone that would ask a substantial question .
Consider that , when James released his tapes , every News anchor ( other than those on Fox ) claimed that James and Hannah would not respond to requests for comments .
And this was the very same weekend they released the footage .
And on the very day James released the footage , he posted a statement , read by Rush , which basically offered some lame and unconvincing excuses as to why he why he flatly refused CNN ’s request for an interview ON THE DAY HE RELEASED HIS TAPES .
You should read the post .... it ’s a real bed - wetter !
See O'Keefe ’s post on BigGov.com for 9-11-09 regarding this ... its really paranoid , and just plain loony .
I mean , how can someone say “ I have evidence of complicity in the awful crime of child - trafficking etc ... ” , but then openly ( and hostilely ) refuse the opportunity for air time to get your point across ESPECIALLY to a wide - reaching news group like CNN ?
I mean , Bertha Lewis went on Fox , and faced people who explicitly hated her .
What “ enemies ” was O’Keefe so worried about ?
Candy Crowely ?
Really ?
In his statement , James throws out all sorts of bs about CNN doing a " hit job " on him ( as if CNN had some secret love for ACORN ... as if the previous year never happened ! )
Personally , I think that is entirely Freudian .
O’keefe knows that he , himself , is a liar , a hack , and a hit - job goon .
So of course , his frail , chapped and abused mind thinks everyone else is as devious as he is .
And then there ’s the fact that Breibart all but admits to giving the story exclusively to Fox , and cutting almost everyone else out , from the get go ( see his Washington Times article on what he calls his “ politicized art ” . )
Again , he uses as his excuse some wacko , archaic distress over his “ enemies ” .
“ Enemies ” ...
Not , “ those who might disagree with me ” .
Not “ those who might ask me fair questions or offer reasonable critique about the material I am producing ” .
Not even “ fellow journalists ” .... “ Enemies ! ” I mean , what the hell ?
There ’s professionalism for ya !!!!
And Hoyt gave in to that contrivance , even though it was a lie , deliberately orchestrated by Breitbart to paint this false “ underdog ” veneer over his creepy , lying megalomaniacal charges .
You know ...
Hoyt just sucks all around .

Sorry Steve ,
Anyone who puts stock in Patterico 's foolishness is hardly in any place to call others " gullible " .
And that goes double for anyone who looks at those tapes and doesnt ask basic questions about their obvious inconsistencies , or the holes in James & Hannah ’s story .
If perhaps you had some understanding of human psychology , you might be aware of the studies done on facial responsiveness to taboo subjects .
Taboo and criminal topics , owing to their non-normative natures , will always cause some sort reaction to register on the faces of their audiences .
For instance , even in interviews with convicted child molesters , the subject of child molesting causes them noticeable “ surprise ” ( eg , if you do n’t want to peruse the literature , you can just check out the set -ups on the stings from “ To Catch A Predator ” . )
Likewise , robbers , when discussing robbery ( even those that are n’t their own ) get excitable and uneasy .
The same is true with drug - dealers or shop - lifters .
You do n’t need to be in a police interrogation to know that ... there ’s actually a rather substantial body of literature detailing the very subject of facial - responsiveness ( if the public library isnt too “ socialist ’ for you , you might want to check some of that material out . )
Non-normative subjects cause visible facial reactions , even to someone waering a ” poker - face ” .
Such subjects unsettle people , even if said person is ( for whatever reason ) " okay " with the taboo subject being discussed .
For instance , people who support the war evidence some degree of unease about discussing it , just because the subject is contentious .
The same is true , in recent months , with the subject of healthcare .
While I might be in support of healthcare reform , if the suibject came up at work , my face would register a noticeable change or “ surprise ” .
You can even look at James ’ own interviews on Fox regarding his tapes .
Look at how different his manner gets when it comes to the material ... its because of its contentiousness .
People are hard - wired to react that way by nature .
It takes a HELLUVA LOT of training ( or trauma ) to overcome that .
That being the case , if the subject of trafficking underage girls for prostitution really did come up in James & Hannah ’s discussions with ACORN , there would have been some moment when the faces of the ACORN employees would have registered , quite visibly , surprise at the idea that " oh , you are talking about child - trafficking . "
There would have been a moment when they would need clarification , or just to take that information in .
We do n’t see that at all .
I mean , my goodness , one lady doesnt even want Hannah in the office dressed like a hooker ...
She ’s clearly upset by the way Hannah is dressed , and has to be pressed by James into accepting her into the office .
Do you honestly believe that this woman , who was quite visibly put off by Hannah ’s dress , would just slip into the subject of international child sex - trafficking without batting an eye ?
Talk about gullible !!!
Look , the issue really isnt what James was wearing .
That aspect of the story is just representative of the fact that reporters were not asking basic , reasonable questions about the videos .
And Breitbart , James etc... , through their tantrums , their antics ( and their immediate refusal to meet with the very press which they pretended “ ignored ” them ) have tried very hard to maneuver away from those reasonable questions , and actually fault those who pose them .
That ’s really what Brad , and the rest of us are getting at .
Look , James claims to have evidence of some pretty serious crimes ( I mean , I consider human trafficking serious , do n’t you ? )
But he adamantly REFUSES to be accountable about that evidence .
Or to answer meaningful questions about them .
That speaks volumes .
It also leaves him to callously mock those who are truly suffering in that horrible reality of international human trafficking .
He ’s made a joke out of their sorrow .
One last thing .
I am sure that , like most of Patterico 's patsies , or BigGov bone - heads , you call yourself a Christian .
Ever read the Sermon on the Mount ?
Just sit down and take a long think about it .
This past winter was pretty darn cold ( conservatives were reveling in that fact , by assuming that the cold had bebunked Global Warming Theory . )
A LOT of people were turned onto the streets and went homeless because of what James and Hannah did .
You celebrate that fact , even as they make money and fame off of it .
They are too young to realize it now , but that ’s going to stay with them the rest of their lives ... someone once said “ the poor are always with us . ”
In your own lifetime , you will see just how far on the wrong side of history you truly are .

The American news media failed in all sorts of ways when it comes to the pimp hoax story .
First no mainstream news sources even bothered to delve whether the heavily doctored pimp hoax videos were legitimate .
Honest investigations , including those in courts of law , show they were not .
Second , the news media did n't explore the bigger picture of what ACORN does , and convey what role those low - level ACORN employees caught in those bogus Candid - Camera - Type " stings " played in the organization .
The news media broadcast a slanted and distorted picture of ACORN that offered almost no perspective whatsoever .
Even after being presented with the facts , the New York Times refused to retract the damaging lies that it published .
Congress , with nary a bat of an eye , disgracefully jumped on the anti-ACORN bandwagon without asking pertinent questions themselves , stopping funding to ACORN , and effectively putting an end to it .
Those lies were n't damaging to well - paid New York Times editor Clark Hoyt , probably did n't cause direct harm to Brad Friedman who practiced * honest * investigative journalism in exposing the ACORN pimp hoax for what it was , and those lies certainly do n't affect my standard of life here in Canada .
Those lies were damaging to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the United States .
The mainstream media failed them , the US government failed them .
The New York Times continues to broadcast misinformation .
What would be in it for the New York Times to do so ?
What would be the rationale behind refusing to tell the truth .
While Brad Friedman has given the New York Times the benefit of the doubt , I say follow the money .
The New York Times has a long history of publishing lies .
Look at their long history of lies regarding events Latin America ( http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/ChomOdon_ElSalvador.html).
Who benefits from those lies and the destruction of ACORN and the reduction of voters more likely to vote for progressive candidates ?
Follow the money .

First , I wish you would go after NPR like you did the NYT .
I also heard their short report on the demise of ACORN and they did virtually the same thing .
Here is what I just put on the comments page of teh NYT admitting it was wrong page :
I have to admit I have n't read all of the comments , so forgive me if I am repeating them .
First , it is illegal to not send in a registration form that has been filled out .
Even if it says Mickey Mouse .
Since when was following the law the basis for crying fraud ?
Since the media wanted to buy it , I guess .
Second , to say that 16 different reporters covered the story as an excuse for getting things wrong is pathetic .
Does that mean you really are n't responsible for fact checking and investigating stories because you do n't know who is doing what ?
Because someone else started covering the story ?
Third , I think the way the NYT swallowed this story should really be considered a STING operation on the NYT .
It shows how much the paper should not be trusted .

Ah Daley now you 've resorted to one liners .
I find it funny now that the new narrative by ponis is that even though Acorn did n't break the law they broke the Natural Law .
Good lord now we have a philosophical breaking of the law .
This is like the same argument birthers use when they bring up de Vattel as if he had any relevence .
Another issue :
If ACORN was trying to go about trying to help Giles " hide income " from the IRS , why tell her to even file ?
Prostitution is an all cash business .
They could have just as easily told her not to file or report absolutely zero income .
Lets see how long this lasts before Frey starts trying to out people 's real identities again

Why has n't Brad posted on Weigel saying that Brad has got it wrong .
O'Keefe and Giles did pose as a pimp and a prostitute as the tapes and audios make clear and that what Giles was referencing was the pimp costume concept .

Again a pimp finds johns for his hookers .
Nowhere did O'keefe claim Giles was his hooker or even that the " girls " would be his .
Nor did he say he would find johns for them .
You can claim it from now until next tuesday but it still wo n't make it so .
If anyone is moving the goalposts its your crew as there has been no breaking of the law yet people want to demonize Acorn still .

Once I saw George Will trying to discredit Jesse Ventura when he was governor of MN ... he tried to make him look like a kook by saying why to you believe in Kennedy conspriraacy theories when blah blah smart people / commissions have proven lone shooter ... I was waiting for Jesse to say well there is this and that disproves that etc.. instead Jesse just asked a questions back , he said ( paraphrasing ) " if it was not a conspriracy , why do they keep sealing record , keep things classified ? "
So i say to folks who keep claiming Brad is wrong even tho he references the evidence OKeefe provides , for folks think that Okeefe is the most reliable witness and he has no reason to lie and thinks all the Acorn employees on record , including the two offices that calle cops the day OKeefe visited them are they liars and the guy lying his way into office to illegally record people is the saint and honest , intergrity filled reporter .... I will simply ask you this , if Okeefe version of his visits are so truthful , WHY DOESN'T HE REALEASE THE RAW , UNEDITED TAPES OF HIS VISITS ????
The fact that he has never done this but only provides heavily edit material , clearly tried to mispresent how he looked in the offices ( know one denies now he was not dressed as pimp ) shows he has something dishonest to hide .
And there have been multiple criminal investigations that have sided with ACORN , are all these investigators and lawyers corrupt ?
The other thing that really irritates me is that even if the impression of ACORN O'Keefe created with his tapes were correct , if even the misrepresentation in the media of ACORN in regards to voting registration was correct , they 're alleged ACORN behavior IS NO WORSE THAN REBUBLICAN SUPPORTED ORGANIZATIONS such as the Republican registration consulting firm that had their leader convitcted of fraud and Blackwater that has engaged in all sort of behavior far more reprehensible than telling a 'ho to hide her cash , including Blackwater employees not just talking about child prostitution but engaging in it .
Has anyone defunded Blackwater yet ?
When Blackwater has to close its doors I 'll buy that there is a liberal MSM .

Bob Ross -
You keep repeating that based on dictionary definitions .
That is not the behavior of pimps I saw in action when I lived in New York in the 1960s and 1970s .
The women found their own johns .
Perhaps you have never witnessed them in action or grew up in rural America or somewhere where customs were different .
Keep repeating something that does n't match reality if it works for you .
Also , nobody has been claiming any actual crimes were committed to my knowledge .
If somebody has , can you provide a link ?

He never said he was a pimp , never claimed she worked for him , so what you have is him saying he's not going to be involved in her business and that she may one day give him money from them .
Not a pimp .
Maybe we do n't travel in the same circles but I 've never solicited , you have ?
Lets see one of your fellows over at patterico's blog keeps claiming there was a breaking of natural law .
I find it funny though how you guys were n't all up in arms when Dyncorp which still receives money from the government was running prostitution rings in bosnia with girls as young as 12 - 15 .

Thanks BlueHark .

You seem hung up on the fact that O'Keefe did not specifically call himself a pimp - so what ?
Acknowledge that he was going to use the earnings of the girls for his political campaign at least .
Also acknowledge my observation of the operation of pimps in the real world as opposed to the dictionary definition .

I ’ve known of Incanter , a powerful statistics library for Clojure , for a while now .
A couple of days ago I set out to get it running nicely , and was successful .
Here are the steps I took :
Installing Leiningen
I used Leiningen because I knew it made packages easy to install , and while it is described more often as a build tool than as a package manager , it has a repl command , so I can use it for experimenting with libraries , too .
It was at least as convenient as I expected .
I ’m going to continue using it to set up repl environments .
To install it , follow these simple instructions from the leiningen repository :
Download the script .
Place it on your path and chmod it to be executable .
Run : lein self - install .
That ’s it !
It uses the Java installation that comes with OS X . I installed this on Snow Leopard , but these instructions should work on Leopard as well .
If you replace aquamacs - emacs - starter - kit with emacs - starter - kit , all of the instructions in this blog post should work on other platforms , with some other minor changes .
Opening a Clojure repl with access to Leiningen
To start a new Leiningen project , I went to my home directory and ran :
This creates a directory called incanterplayground with project.clj and a few other files .
Only project.clj will need to be modified to get an Inanter repl environment up and running .
I opened project.clj and added the repository and dependency information for Incanter :
And then , following the instructions in Leiningen ’s README file , I ran lein deps and lein repl in the project directory :
I was n’t planning on using swank or nailgun .
I have n’t been using emacs , and nailgun does n’t sound very appealing to me , mainly because when I looked at using it with JRuby a year or two ago , it came with security warnings so strong that they seemed to be telling me you do n’t want to use this .
When I read the above message , though , I felt like I should give one of the two a try .
Before I even tried importing incanter , I started working on getting emacs and lein - swank running .
Getting the lein - swank plugin running
The lein - swank plugin is a server , and therefore does n’t require emacs to be up and running to run .
So I tackled getting lein - swank running , and I put off installing SLIME , which I did n’t know how to use , until afterward .
I added a dev-dependencies line to my Leiningen project file .
Here is project.clj with this added :
I then ran lein deps and lein swank :
( Note : I made this tutorial while running through these steps for the second time , so lein deps is using files that have already been downloaded .
The first time you run it , lein deps will show the download and installation progress . )
This indicates that the swank server is running , and is ready to be connected to by emacs .
Getting emacs running and installing packages with ELPA
I used to use emacs , and I had installed Carbon Emacs to try out org - mode .
I did n’t check to see if ELPA was already installed , but rather , ran the directions on the ELPA website .
This involved taking a piece of code and evaluating it .
Then I went to the ELPA package manager , selected the packages listed in the lein - swank installation instructions , and ran the install .
I saw a lot of warnings go by .
When I got done , I restarted emacs , and tried running M-x slime - connect .
The command , however , was n’t installed .
I searched for help , and found a post from a user who had the same problem .
Someone replied to the post saying that he probably had a bad installation of ELPA .
At this point I punted and decided to try aquamacs instead .
After installing aquamacs , and running it , I got the idea to find an emacs profile to use that would hopefully have ELPA already working .
I searched for an aquamacs emacs profile and found aquamacs - emacs - starter - kit .
I downloaded it to my github directory , rather than to my Emacs preferences directory .
I then added these three lines to the end of ~/ Library / Preferences / Aquamacs Emacs / Preferences.el ( which just had comments in it ) :
After this , I restarted Aquamacs , saw a ton of warnings fly by , waited it for it to finish what it was doing , and restarted Aquamacs again .
I saw more warnings fly by , and restarted Aquamacs again .
I may have restarted Aquamacs a third time before it stopped showing a lot of warnings .
It takes a little time for aquamacs - emacs - starter - kit to work its magic .
Then I installed the required packages by typing M-x package - list - packages , selecting the packages that I needed or wanted that were n’t already installed , and typing x to install them .
I made sure that clojure , clojure - test , paredit , slime , slime - repl , and swank - clojure were selected before hitting x .
After pressing x , I waited while some warnings flew by , and restarted Aquamacs again .
Then I tried typing M-x slime and then pressing tab to see what the autocompletion showed .
There were a bunch of results , so I felt confident that I had successfully installed SLIME .
Indeed I had .
Running SLIME
Finally , I ran SLIME .
I still had lein - swank running from a previous step , so I typed M-x slime - connect and chose the default host and port .
After a second or two , I saw a silly message indicating that it worked .
I poked around the commands , first using tab completion on M-x , and then looking at the the keyboard bindings in the project.clj buffer with C-h b.
I opened a new file with C-x C-f playground.clj , and started evaluating expressions in there .
You need to be in a window that ’s in the slime mode ; the * scratch * buffer will evaluate with emacs lisp if you type C-x C-e in it .
Here ’s an example session :
If you go to the end of the first line and type C-x C-e , SLIME should print out # ’user / x in the status line .
If it works , you know it ’s evaluating Clojure and not emacs lisp .
Go to the end of the second line and type C-x C-e , and then to the end of the last line and type C-x C-e .
It prints out 6 .
This way I know that it ’s running them in the same Clojure session .
Pretty cool , huh ?
Printing out a graph with Incanter
I found this introductory incanter code , pasted it into playground.clj , and started evaluating it .
After I ran C-x C-e on the first line , a new dock icon with a Java logo appeared .
I switched back to Aquamacs , went to the end of the second line , and typed C-x C-e again .
Three lines showed up in the emacs status bar , describing an object that was returned .
I clicked the new dock icon , and voila !
A graph showed up .
What now ?
Now that I have a nice Emacs , Clojure , and Incanter setup , there are so many different directions I could go .
I have something in mind , but I do n’t want to reveal it , because in my mind I might feel like I ’m done and lose my motivation to do it .
If you need ideas , though , one thing you could do is go to the Data Sorcery blog and start trying the examples there .
China has not hesitated to use military might to crush any Tibetan uprising China has sentenced a Tibetan Buddhist lama to more than eight years in jail for illegal possession of ammunition and embezzlement .
The monk , Phurbu Tsering Rinpoche , denies all charges , his lawyer said .
The man described as a Living Buddha was arrested after nuns at his temple protested against a crackdown on Tibetan Buddhism .
This had followed anti-China riots that erupted in Lhasa in 2008 and spread through the Himalayan region .
Delay Phurbu Tsering Rinpoche " was charged with illegal possession of ammunition and embezzlement , but he denied all charges , " lawyer Jiang Tianyong told AFP .
He had been arrested on 18 May 2008 , a few days after more than 80 nuns in Ganzi held a demonstration against an official campaign to impose " patriotic re-education " on their convents , in which they were required to denounce Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
" He was tried in April and the sentence had been scheduled to be read out days later , but for some unknown reason it was postponed until 23 December , " he added .
The 53 - year - old monk has not decided if he will appeal against the verdict , Mr Jiang said ; he added that he had not been allowed to attend the court .
THE TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet was always part of its territory Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century
In 1950 , China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to a bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India Dalai Lama now advocates a " middle way " with Beijing , seeking autonomy but not independence
Dalai Lama at critical crossroads Deep divisions over Tibet Profile : The Dalai Lama Phurbu Tsering is a " living Buddha " from Ganzi , a part of southwest China 's Sichuan province dominated by ethnic Tibetans .
Protests and rioting against Chinese presence in the region broke out in Ganzi in March last year after deadly unrest swept Lhasa , the regional capital of Tibet , which is next to Sichuan .
The Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has been campaigning for " meaningful autonomy " for Tibetans within China .
But his proposals , including autonomy for Tibetans outside the present boundary of the Tibet Autonomous Region , have been described by Beijing as a " back door to splitting the motherland " .

The FBI fabricated terrorism emergencies to obtain thousands of phone records between 2002 and 2006 , it 's been revealed .
The Bureau created " exigent letters " to get around rules that had already been significantly loosened by the Patriot Act .
The letters were used to obtain some 2,000 phone records , The Washington Post reports .
Washington Post and New York Times journalists were among the targets .
The internal concerns were confirmed in emails that are part of an investigation by the Justice Department 's inspector general , which is due to report this month .
As well as fabricating emergencies , FBI counter - terror investigators obtained phone records by simply leaning on operators , getting approval after the fact with blanket authorisations .
The Patriot Act allowed investigators to effectively self - certify their requests for communications data , using a " National Security Letter " ( NSL ) , a type of subpoena without judicial oversight .
The Justice Department has found that by fabricating emergencies and sending NSLs after it had obtained phone records , the FBI violated what civil liberties protections remained .
In response , the FBI claimed that although it did not follow statutory process to obtain the records , they were all legitimate targets for investigation .
" The [ Justice Department ] report is not expected to find — nor were there — any intentional attempts to obtain records that counterterrorism personnel knew they were not legally entitled to obtain , " said assistant director of public affairs Michael Kortan .
He added all the numbers obtained have been deleted and that " steps were taken as early as 2006 to ensure similar situations do not occur in the future " .
However , The Washington Post said it had seen emails showing FBI lawyers sounded the alarm in 2005 .
The US NSL system is similar to the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) regime for authorities to obtain communications data from phone companies and ISPs .
Each has no judicial oversight and investigators effectively self - certify their requests .
The UK system is much broader , however , with no requirement that national security is threatened and many more agencies , such as local councils , empowered to access records .
Oversight is provided by a former High Court judge appointed by the Prime Minister , who produces an annual report .
In 2008 , the most recent available , he says that 595 errors were made but added : " I am not convinced that any useful purpose would be served by providing a more detailed report of these errors . "
The government is developing a major extension to communications surveillance that would require internet firms to retain huge amounts of extra data , under the Interception Modernisation Programme .
Ministers have argued that that RIPA will be sufficient to govern access to the newly available terabytes of private information . ®
Lessons from the Stock Market Panic of 1907
In their timely look at the panic of 1907 , Robert Bruner and Sean Carr focus attention on what they believe to be the underlying causes of the ’07 stock market crash and recession , drawing parallels between it and the credit crisis of more recent times .
Their book , “ The Panic of 1907 : Lessons Learned from the Market ’s Perfect Storm , ” is now available in soft cover published by John Wiley & Sons ( 2007 ) .
Short Selling
The authors list seven contributing factors to the 1907 crisis : 1. ) Complexity2. ) Buoyant economic growth3 . ) Inadequate safety buffers4 . ) Adverse leadership5 . ) Real economic shock6 . )
Undue fear and greed and other behavioral aberrations7 . )
Failure of collective actionIn this review we ’ll focus on factor number 4 , adverse leadership , under which category the policies of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve fall .
One of the key statements the authors make is found on page 30 .
Quoting the passage at length :
“ In the summer of 1907 , a major economic shock hit the American capital markets .
In an effort to harbor gold reserves , the bank of England imposed a prohibition on U.S. finance bills , which were loans with which U.S. firms could import gold .
The contemporary economist , O.M.W.
Sprague , considered this action ‘ the most important financial factor in the panic of 1907 . ’
The prohibition slashed the volume of finance bills in the London market from $ 400 million to $ 30 million by late in the summer of 1907 .
This meant that American debtors could not simply refinance their obligations in London .
As a result , the flow of gold to America suddenly lurched into reverse as gold was remitted to London to settle the payment on finance bills .
This further contracted U.S. gold reserves nearly 10 percent between May and August 1907 and contributed to a national liquidity drought .
” In the above paragraph we discover that the underlying cause behind the Panic of 1907 was none other than a restrictive monetary policy , exactly the same posture assumed by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the year preceding the late credit crisis .
Although the authors do n’t see this as the primary cause of the 1907 Panic , Bruner and Carr go on to provide more insight into the relationship between tight money and stock market crashes and economic recessions by recounting other examples of how money shrinkage and credit restrictions fed the crisis of 1907 .
One prominent institution in the 1907 panic was the Knickerbocker Trust of New York .
Headed by the colorful Charles Barney , the financial institution was one of the largest and most successful trust company in the country and was the third largest trust in New York City , with nearly 18,000 depositors .
Trust companies engaged in most of the functions of both common and private banks , including making loans , industry consolidation and underwriting , and distribution of new securities .
They also sometimes owned and managed real estate .
Trust companies were also generally less well regulated than conventional banks .
They were allowed to hold certain assets that banks were n’t permitted to hold , such as stock equity .
Of significance , trusts were n’t required to hold reserves against deposits prior to 1906 .
As Bruner and Carr point out , the State of New York required trusts in 1906 to hold 15 percent of deposits as reserves , though only a third of the reserves had to be held in cash .
“ This meant that trust companies could earn a higher return on their assets compared to banks , and thus , could pay higher interest rates , ” according to Bruner and Carr .
“ Accordingly , the higher interest rates attracted deposits , and the trust companies grew rapidly .
In 1906 , the assets of all trust companies in New York City approximated the assets of all national banks and exceeded the assets of all state banks .
” Trusts were a hot commodity at the turn of the last century , attracting investment funds from countless Americans of all walks of life .
They also attracted scorn from the conventional banking community .
America ’s leading financier at that time , J.P. Morgan , was particularly critical of the investment trusts and viewed them as upstart competitors to his banking interests .
This is an important point to remember when analyzing the events of the 1907 Panic .
Morgan was also very much in support of corporate oligarchy and was a pioneer in the creation and advancement of Big Business .
He took every opportunity to undermine the role of small , independent firms in the business world , and according to his biographer Frederick Lewis Allen : “ Morgan seemed to feel that the business machinery of America should be honestly and decently managed by a few of the best people , people like his friends and associates .
He liked combination , order , the efficiency of big business units ; and he liked them to operate in a large , bold , forward - looking way .
He disapproved of the speculative gangs who plunged in and out of the market , heedless of the properties they were toying with , as did the Standard Oil crowd .
When he put his resources behind a company , he expected to stay with it ; this , he felt , was how a gentleman behaved … .
That Morgan was a might force for decent finance is unquestionable .
But so also is the fact that he was a mighty force working toward the concentration into a few hands of authority over more and more of American business .
” Morgan ’s antipathy toward “ speculative gangs ” and to trusts in general was brought to the fore when rumors started swirling over the solvency of the Knickerbocker Trust .
The rumors concerning the solvency of the Knickerbocker were less a question of the firm ’s standing in the New York financial community than a question of the Trust ’s president , Charles Barney , who was believe to have connections to a failed corner on the stock of United Copper by August Heinze and Charles Morse .
The connection between Heinze , Morse and Barney , however tenuous , was all that the increasingly jittery public needed to hear .
Before long depositors in the Knickerbocker Trust began withdrawing funds and from there the public ’s fears of the Trust ’s solvency spread to other financial institutions in New York .
It led to a full - scale banking panic that swept the country .
As the cash reserves of the Knickerbocker Trust began to dwindle , a meeting was called of the company ’s board of directors by J.P. Morgan .
The conference was an all - day affair and ran into the early hours of the morning .
The board made the critical decision to keep the Knickerbocker ’s doors open as long as it would take to secure assistance from other financial institutions in a relief effort led by Morgan himself .
In the meantime , Morgan and his partners would examine the Knickerbocker ’s books to determine the soundness of the trust .
According to Bruner and Carr , if Morgan and his partners determined it was sound , then Morgan would find the money to keep it afloat .
The directors of the Knickerbocker made a fateful decision to open the doors to their depositors the next day under the assumption that help from the Morgan - led rescue operation would be forthcoming .
They were disappointed in this expectation and were soon swamped by more withdrawals than they could stand .
A classic bank run was soon underway and the Knickerbocker was to be among the first casualties of the developing crisis .
As Bruner and Carr observe , “ Despite the assurances of the financiers … the day before , the officials of Knickerbocker said that no money was forthcoming when needed . ”
J.P. Morgan needed a high - profile victim for his plans to revolutionize the U.S. financial system and economy and he had one in the Knickerbocker Trust .
According to Bruner and Carr , the Morgan team concluded that the Knickerbocker was n’t solvent after a review of the company ’s accounts .
Yet a state banking examiner who had reviewed the Knickerbocker ’s accounts as recently as two weeks before the crisis had determined that the institution had sufficient funds to pay its depositors .
The evidence points to the fact that the Knickerbocker was set up to fail by Morgan .
Another major factor in the 1907 panic was the tightness of money and credit alluded to earlier .
Bruner and Cardded to ar observed , “ The national banking system did not have an efficient mechanism for increasing the supply of currency quickly . ”
In response to the panic conditions , depositors added to the woes of the financial system by withdrawing even more cash from circulation .
According to the authors , about $ 350 million in deposits were withdrawn from the U.S. financial system .
Most of this amount was hoarded in cash to the tune of $ 200 to $ 296 million .
One of the ways that banks sought to counteract the cash shortage was through the use of clearing house certificates , which amounted to temporary , emergency loans to member banks of the New York Clearing House .
These certificates were used as a substitute currency when clearing accounts with one another each day .
As Bruner and Carr observed , “ Since the certificates circulated among member banks as a substitute for cash , they effectively freed up actual cash for the public , thereby artificially expanding the nation ’s money supply .
Without a central bank to provide this function , the certificates proved to be extremely effective at restoring the liquidity to the financial system during critical periods of stringency .
” The use of clearing house certificates had been suggested during the crisis in New York .
But as the authors point out , Morgan was opposed to this .
The authors further hint that there could have been a hidden interest in the refusal to allow clearing house certificates by the larger banks : “ delay might serve the interests of strong banks that want to discipline the weaker banks – as historian Elmus Wicker has argued , such behavior represented a conflict of private interest over the public interest .
” Enter the U.S. Treasury .
In an attempt at stopping the panic , then Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou transferred cash from the vaults of the U.S. Treasury to deposits in several national banks .
By the middle of November 1907 , however , the Treasury held only $ 5 million in ready cash , which significantly curtailed the rescue effort of the government .
“ A nation gasping for liquidity thus turned to other sources , ” observe Bruner and Carr .
“ Bank clearing houses issued their near - money certificates in rising numbers , and imports of gold began to arrive in significant volume in November .
” The authors quoted Oliver W. Sprague , a Harvard professor writing in 1908 , as stating that “ The position of the banks was far from desperate , yet they had already entered the fatal and discreditable path of suspension , paying depositors at their own discretion . ”
In a remarkable historical parallel to the 2008 crisis , banks in New York during the 1907 crisis “ actually conserved cash as a result of their membership in the clearing house and otherwise profited from the extension of cash to the trust companies . ”
In November 1907 , the New York banks obtained as much cash as they remitted elsewhere in the U.S. according to the authors .
Sprague observed , “ The New York bankers proved themselves wholly unequal to the duties of their position as the central reserve banks of the country .
” In summarizing their post - mortem of the 1907 panic , Bruner and Carr quoted a 1983 study by the economists Diamond and Dybvig , who suggested that bank panics are simply randomly occurring events .
“ To be the last in line to withdraw deposited funds exposes an individual to the risk of less , ” write Bruner and Carr .
“ Therefore , a run is caused simply by fear of random deposit withdrawals and the risk of being last in the queue .
” A more pertinent explanation of financial panics is that they are at root liquidity driven phenomena , viz. , the lack of liquidity causes the trouble .
Bruner and Carr acknowledged the liquidity aspect of the financial panic of 1907 in stating , “ In an effort to sustain the dollar , Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou and his predecessor L.M.
Shaw sought to build government gold reserves for more than a year before the crash in March 1907 .
This took liquidity out of the financial system at a time when economic growth and the San Francisco earthquake [ of 1906 ] and fire created an urgent demand for more cash .
Correspondence within J.P. Morgan & Company noted the dearth of liquid funds with which to finance corporate needs .
” Bruner and Carr further noted that Cortelyou deposited a large volume of gold into the financial system in early 1907 , which had the effect of flooding the market with liquidity .
“ Yet this was not sufficient and then in June and July [ Cortelyou ] returned to attempting to build government reserves . ”
Gold began flowing abroad ahead of the U.S. crop harvest , adding further strain to the cash - strapped financial system .
An instructive graph presented by Bruner and Carr on page 165 showed that liquid assets held by banks on behalf of the public and the U.S. Treasury began to decline in June 1907 ahead of the worst part of the panic .
The authors noted that “ that summer recession was in full bloom ; it was hardly a time to take liquidity from the system .
This , unfortunately , was a pattern to be repeated again , most notably by the U.S. Federal Reserve between 1930 and 1933 .
Economist Glenn Donaldson has noted that ‘ market liquidity , or the lack thereof , is a primary element – perhaps the primary element – in determining the length and severity of a panic .
’” The authors go on to break down what they see as the primary drivers behind the crisis and the eventual return to normalcy .
There are many valuable lessons to be learned from a study of the Panic of 1907 , and Bruner and Carr have done an admirable job addressing some of them .
They emphasize that there is no single “ magic bullet ” explanation behind a crisis ; rather , a confluence of factors must be analyzed in order to get the big picture .
In distilling the causes of the 1907 panic down to seven , the authors present a compelling , if somewhat debatable , case for the reasons that led to the famous crash of 1907 .
The authors also remind us that a nation that fails to learn from history is doomed to repeat it .
On a cautionary note , the authors point out , “ It is all too easy to saddle taxpayers with the costs of saving firms , jobs , and industries .
Are we willing to pay for an absolutely risk - free society ?
” One of the demands among traders in recent years has been the desire to capture moves in individual stocks and ETFs in tough market environments .
Most stock market literature specializes in trading techniques geared toward bull markets .
Comparatively few books have been devoted to explaining techniques for profiting in down markets .
Many traders are intimidated by the prospect of short selling and , quite rightly , view it as a risky proposition .
Short selling is risky if you lack a good technical discipline for selecting short sale candidates among individual stocks and executing the trade properly .
With the right method , the risks in shorting can be minimized and the results profitable .
Although the Wall Street press does n’t like to publicize it , timely short selling can create profits for small traders much faster than conventional “ buy and hold ” investing .
In the years leading up to the fateful 120 - year Kress Cycle bottom in 2014 , profitable opportunities for selling short will only increase .
It ’s for the purpose of presenting a clear explanation and disciplined technical method for selling short that I wrote , “ How to Sell Short in the Stock Market . ”
Based on years of experience , this book takes you on a tour of the trading conditions that merit a short selling approach and explains how to grasp the opportunities as they arrive .
In this 130 - page volume you ’ll also discover how moving averages can be used to set up short sales to good effect .

In recent months Ireland 's stringent abortion ban has been cited approvingly by Islamic states as a model for their own societies , and now Irish enacted blasphemy laws have become the envy of nations like Pakistan .
According to the Irish Times , Ireland 's 2010 blasphemy law is being cited by fundamentalist Islamic states ' as justification ' for persecuting religious dissidents , according to an Indian campaigner who was exiled for his belief in free speech .
Many Islamic countries have enacted biting blasphemy laws .
In Afghanistan blasphemy is an offence under Sharia law and may be punished by penalties up to execution by hanging .
In Ireland , blasphemy is prohibited by the constitution and carries a maximum fine of $ 32,500 .
Meanwhile Sanal Edamaruku , who is on a five - day visit to Ireland , is reportedly facing charges of blasphemy in India after challenging the claims that water dripping from a statue in Mumbai was a miracle .
Catholic Church members in India complained to the police there last April , seeking his arrest under blasphemy charges that carry a three - year sentence .
Because of the threat , Edamaruku was forced to flee to Finland which has granted him a residency permit .
Edamaruku said he was ' surprised ' by Ireland 's decision two years ago to introduce a law on blasphemy , something that the then Fianna Fail - led government claimed was necessary to comply with the Irish constitution .
Since the law passed in 2010 , Irish voters have watched with disbelief as Pakistan and other countries have cited the statute at the United Nations to support their own blasphemy laws .
Meanwhile Michael Nugent of Atheist Ireland , which invited Edamaruku to highlight his plight and to host a series of public meetings , criticised the Irish coalition government 's decision to refer the issue to the constitutional convention which meets for the first time on Saturday .
' Both parties ( Fine Gael and Labour ) say they are committed to getting rid of the law - so the effect is simply to delay it happening .'
In India , Edamaruku established that a statue of Jesus said to ' cry ' real tears was not holy water so much as wholly ineffective plumbing .
But the backlash was instant and severe .
Edamaruku was accused of blasphemy , charged with offences that carry a three - year prison sentence and eventually , after receiving death threats , forced to seek exile in Finland .
Edamaruku is well known in India for debunking religious myths , and was already unpopular among Indian Catholics for publicly criticising Mother Teresa 's legacy in Kolkata .
Edamaruku reportedly travelled to Mumbai where he found that the dripping water was due to clogged drainage pipes behind the wall where it stood .
' India cannot criticise Pakistan for arresting young girls for blaspheming against Islam while it arrests and locks up its own citizens for breaking our country 's blasphemy laws , ' Edamaruku said .
' It is an absurd law but also extremely dangerous because it gives fanatics , whether they are Hindus , Catholics or Muslims , a licence to be offended .
It also allows people who are in dispute with you to make up false accusations of blasphemy . '
When researchers created mice lacking an enzyme that breaks down and releases stored triglycerides ( more properly known as triacylglycerols or TGs ) , they expected to see animals with better lipid profiles .
But according to a report in the March Cell Metabolism , a Cell Press publication , they got more than they bargained for .
The triacylglycerol hydrolase ( TGH ) - deficient mice showed global metabolic benefits , with essentially no downside .
" It was a surprising and unexpected finding , " said Richard Lehner of the University of Alberta .
" With this gene deleted , not only was there a decline in very low - density lipoproteins in the whole mouse , it also affected metabolism in fat tissue .
The insulin - secreting cells became smaller , suggesting that they did n't have to work as hard to secrete insulin , and the mice became more insulin sensitive . "
The animals ate more , but they also expended more energy and showed no change in body weight .
Very low - density lipoproteins ( VLDLs ) are a form of " bad " cholesterol , Lehner explained .
TGH normally frees up triglycerides from their storage place in the liver , releasing them for assembly into VLDLs .
Therefore , one might expect that loss of TGH would have ill effects on the liver , as triglycerides would build up there .
Indeed , he says , similar experiments with other enzymes have shown such an effect .
" We did n't observe that here , " Lehner said .
" Instead of being stored in liver , triglycerides were directed for oxidation . "
In other words , they were burned .
The liver also compensated by synthesizing less fat .
The studies demonstrate the potential of TGH as a therapeutic target for lowering blood lipid levels , with possible far - reaching beneficial side effects throughout the body .
That may be especially worthy of note , given that drug companies already have a TGH blocker .
In fact , Lehner 's team earlier showed that the TGH - inhibiting drug can lower the secretion of VLDLs from liver cells .
But it was n't clear whether the drug was really acting only on TGH .
The new findings add support to the notion that loss of TGH activity alone can have very significant and positive effects .
" But there is a still a lot more work to do , " Lehner says .
They plan to see what happens when mice on a high - fat diet lose the enzyme , noting that the mice in the current study were eating regular chow .
They also want to find out what happens when the enzyme is lost only in specific tissues -- fat tissue , for example -- instead of throughout the body .
One would also want to be careful that the chemical inhibitor targets TGH and not other enzymes in the same family .
For the most part , scientists do n't know what those other enzymes are doing , he says , and -- at least until they do -- specificity will be key .
" We 've answered a small piece of the puzzle , and this is or could be a good target , " Lehner says , although he emphasizes caution .
" Would it be a magic bullet ?
Now , that 's something else that has yet to be seen . "

A Very Special Episode
A single television episode can exemplify the spirit of its time .
A Very Special Episode presents The A.V. Club ’s survey of TV at its most distinctive .

Why do we laugh at the known ?
A few years ago , I was watching the Venture Bros. episode “ The Trial Of The Monarch ” and chuckling at a sequence in which the Ventures ’ archvillain fumed at the “ lies and pictures of also - lies ” in an unauthorized tell - all book about his life .
The Monarch pointed out some of the pictures of his wild youth on the New York punk scene : “ Here ’s one of me at Danceteria making out with Stiv Bators and Lydia Lunch ! ”
He also snapped at Dr. Girlfriend for wearing an outfit that looked like it was “ designed by Frank Frazetta , ” and wailed , “ I can see your dirtypillows ! ” Clever ?
Definitely .
But when the episode ended , I wondered :
What made all that name - dropping funny ?
Advertisement
To some extent , it ’s the comedy of defying expectation .
Here ’s
The Monarch , a supervillain dressed in a ridiculous costume , making references to obscure punk rockers , fantasy - magazine illustrators , and Stephen King novels .
Hilariously incongruous , yes ?
If I ’m being honest , though , I have to admit : I laughed because I “ got it . ” I recognized the names .
The Venture Bros. pandered to me , and I liked it .
Popular culture has been referring to itself for so long that tracing back the trend would be a Herculean task .
( Hey , that ’s a reference ! )
For as long as there ’s been art pitched to the masses — as opposed to “ high art ” — we ’ve been dealt the occasional parody , satire , homage , rip - off , and wink .
That inclination became something like a habit in the ’90s , when pop-culture references became less about commenting on the thing referenced , and more about references as ends in themselves .
Comedian Dennis Miller laced his jokes with names of long - forgotten actors and consumer goods , while in the movie business , pop - heavy chatter became some writers ’ way of conveying realism , hinging on the notion that real people ( at least the ones show - folk know ) mostly pass their time conversing about their favorite bands and TV shows .
Meanwhile , the distinctions between high and low culture continued the process of dissolution that began with the “ pop art ” movement of the ’60s , such that by the ’90s , ambitious academics were expected to have opinions on Bullwinkle as well as Bruegel .

Enter The Simpsons , Matt Groening ’s beloved cartoon family , which began life as a series of shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987 , then became a regular weekly half - hour series in January of 1990 ( following a Christmas special that ran in December of ’ 89 ) .
It took less than a year for The Simpsons to become a phenomenon , and a divisive one .
The first President Bush took a shot at the show , while some watchdog parent groups lodged complaints , and the court system of Orange County , CA heard arguments over whether a Bart Simpson - festooned “ Underachiever And Proud Of It ” T - shirt should be banned from the school system .
From the start , though , The Simpsons was as popular with intellectuals as it was with kids .
Groening had cultural credibility , thanks to his alt - weekly comic strip Life In Hell , and The Simpsons ’ anti-authoritarian nose - thumbing — which grew more brazen as the show became entrenched — drew on a tradition that threaded back through Saturday Night Live , Mad magazine , the Marx brothers , and beyond .
Plus ,
The Simpsons sported an impressive density of cultural references .
In the early years , The Simpsons could be enjoyed just as a funny , irreverent cartoon , but for a full appreciation , viewers needed to be familiar with everything from Tennessee Williams to Winsor McCay .

“ 22 Short Films About Springfield ” aired toward the end of The Simpsons ’ seventh season ( on April 14th , 1996 ) , and even by the standards of a show willing to experiment , it ’s an oddity .
In the early seasons , The Simpsons developed a distinctive narrative structure ; the best episodes tended to start off in one direction before revealing their actual story just before the first act - break .
( The classic example of this is season three ’s “ Dog Of Death , ” which pretends to be about the lottery for eight minutes before it becomes about the health woes of the family dog . )
Later , the show ’s structure fell more in line with classic sitcoms : an A - story , a B - story , and maybe a C - story , all taking place simultaneously and occasionally intersecting .
“ 22 Short Films ” is structured more like an adventurous sketch - comedy show , with vignettes and quickie gags weaving between a couple of recurring stories .
The episode begins with that proud 10 - year - old underachiever Bart Simpson and his buddy Milhouse spitting on cars and speculating about the lives of the people passing by .
Then the episode ’s title comes up ( another relative anomaly on The Simpsons ) followed by a series of short skits starring some of the show ’s minor characters : Dr. Nick , Superintendent Chalmers , Bumblebee Man , Cletus The Slack - Jawed Yokel , Snake , Reverend Lovejoy , Chief Wiggum , Apu , Comic - Book Guy , and more .
The idea for “ 22 Short Films About Springfield ” sprang from a vignette about Ned Flanders that The Simpsons writers whipped up to fill out a too - short season - four episode .
The staff began working with that idea , dividing up their favorite characters and writing little scenes , about half of which got cut after the script stage .
It ’s all in the tradition of comic books and Saturday - morning cartoons that devote a page or a few minutes to “ So - and - so in … ”

Some of the segments in the final product really pop .
The Simpsons ’ exaggerated white - trash boob Cletus arrives with a catchy theme song that rhymes “ yokel ” with “ folk ’ll : ”

Dr. Nick gives a lesson in advanced quackery :

And in the funniest segment of the whole episode , the bumbling Principal Seymour Skinner makes outlandish excuses for his botched lunch for Superintendent Chalmers :
Advertisement
Other segments — like Apu packing an entire party into a five - minute break from the Kwik - E - Mart , or Reverend Lovejoy encouraging his dog to poop on Ned Flanders ’ lawn — do n’t have as much replay value .
But then The Simpsons ’ seventh season as a whole is similarly varied , in that it contains some of the most genuinely sweet episodes of the whole series .
I ’m thinking here of “ Bart Sells His Soul , ” “ Lisa The Vegetarian , ” “ Mother Simpson , ” “ Marge Be Not Proud , ” “ Scenes From The Class Struggle In Springfield , ” and “ Summer Of 4 Ft. 2 , ” the latter of which makes me mist up just reading the title .
Those come alongside some of the series ’ wackiest episodes , like “ 22 Short Films ” and the season - opening resolution of the “ Who Shot Mr. Burns ? ” two - parter .
For all the off - the - wall craziness of “ 22 Short Films , ” the episode often seems more comfortable when it ’s treading familiar territory , as when withered corporate titan Mr. Burns snaps at his bee - stung lackey Smithers to keep peddling their tandem bicycle ( “ One more jostle , you wretched shirkaday ! ” ) or when Milhouse asks Comic Book Guy what he can get for 75 cents , and is offered a used copy of Hamburglar Adventure .
( “ A child has already solved the jumble using crayons .
The answer is ‘ fries . ’ ” )
In one of the two stories that thread through the entire episode , Lisa Simpson gets gum in her hair ( thrown by her brother Bart ) and endures a series of treatments to get the goo out .

In the other , Chief Wiggum finds himself inside a miniature Pulp Fiction parody — although perhaps “ parody ” is the wrong word , since the episode does n’t really make fun of Quentin Tarantino ’s 1994 breakout hit so much as replicate it .
First Wiggum and his underlings sit at Krusty Burger and do The Simpsons ’ version of Pulp Fiction ’s “ little differences ” scene :

And later , Wiggum gets run over by Snake , and they both end up bound and gagged in Herman ’s pawn shop , in a surprisingly graphic recreation of Pulp Fiction ’s “ bring out the gimp ” scene .
There ’s even a sly visual reference to the original , as Milhouse emerges at the end and literally “ gets medieval ” on the bad guy :

That pivot off Pulp Fiction is significant , given that Tarantino did as much if not more than The Simpsons to make the ’90s a safe haven for pop-culture fanatics .
“ 22 Short Films , ” for example , makes casual references to Fangoria magazine and the Midnight Star hit “ Freak - A - Zoid , ” along with the then - smash TV series ER ( in the Dr. Nick sequence ) and possibly Hee Haw ( in the graphics that accompany the Cletus sequence … although those could be read as generic cornpone ) , while Pulp Fiction makes conversations about fast food and old TV shows look so cool that well over a decade later , we ’re still besieged by commercials in which a cross-section of demographically desirable yahoos gather at chain restaurants to gab about their favorite sitcoms .
( Though nothing in any Applebees spot will ever be as charmingly old - timey as The Simpsons ’ Jasper responding to an offer of a free nose job by asking Dr. Nick to “ give me a Van Heflin . ” )
“ 22 Short Films ” slips its biggest reference into its title , which nods to Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould , the Genie Award - winning 1993 arthouse favorite which — like this episode — tells its story in fragments .
Because The Simpsons is an animated series , it generally is n’t that easy to date on - sight , unlike in Friends or Cheers , where the hairstyles alone roughly suggest what year an episode was made .
But the title and structure of “ 22 Short Films About Springfield ” definitely dates the piece .
Though the Simpsons writers have never been above outright obscurity , the show ’s newer fans may not realize that , in 1996 , a reference to Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould would n’t have been that obscure .
The mid-’90s were a time when independent movies got a lot of play in the mainstream media and at the multiplex , and though Glenn Gould was never a smash on the order of , say , Four Weddings And A Funeral ( or Pulp Fiction ) , it was fairly widely known , for its title if nothing else .
( In fact , if anything about this Simpsons episode makes me pine for the past , it ’s the recollection of an era when people knew the names of the prominent art films , even if they still did n’t go out to see them . )

In fact , later in 1996 , the more youth - oriented cartoon series Animaniacs aired a segment titled “ 10 Short Films About Wakko Warner , ” though I doubt the Animaniacs creators expected most of their viewers to get the joke ( in spite of Animaniacs ’ fairly substantial adult audience ) .
When I think about this Simpsons episode , I ca n’t help but wonder how many people in the years to come are going to see “ 22 Short Films About Springfield ” without ever having heard of Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould , or without having seen ER , or Pulp Fiction .
Then I think back to when I was a kid , and read Peanuts comics that referenced Citizen Kane or Beau Geste , or watched Looney Tunes packed with caricatures of celebrities I would n’t recognize until decades later .
I still remember reading Of Mice And Men for the first time in high school and being horrified at all the “ Lennie and George ” gags I ’d laughed at in Looney Tunes shorts over the years .
Which brings us back to the point of pop-culture references .
At their worst , references are a lazy way to fill out the dialogue in a scene without really saying anything at all .
At their most insidious , references can be a way of weeding out the un-hip by winking and nodding only to those who “ get it . ”
At their best , they can illuminate the item being referenced , either by revealing its value in another context or by showing it up as shoddy and mockable .

But there ’s also an element of fannish sharing that I ’ve always found appealing .
Perhaps I laughed at that Venture Bros. episode primarily out of sheer delight at hearing names rarely mentioned on TV , and at the delight I ’m sure the show ’s writers felt when they were chucking them in there .
It reminds me of one of my all - time favorite music videos , Sonic Youth ’s “ Teenage Riot ” ( now unavailable online , sadly ) , which cuts together brief clips of many of the band ’s favorite pop icons , from Kiss to Patti Smith to Harvey Pekar .
It also reminds me of the Pop Will Eat Itself song “ Can U Dig It ? ” , which serves as a menu of what was cool to PWEI in 1989 ( including the Sonic Youth spin - off band Ciccone Youth ) .
One value of a good reference is that it can send fans of one pop-culture artifact on little expeditions , tracking the secret history of the shows , music , and movies they like by digging through their footnotes .
We become archaeologists of pop , like the heroes of the Warren Ellis / John Cassaday comic - book series Planetary .
( How ’s that for a reference ? )
There ’s a longstanding tradition of this kind of digging in the arts , often under the loftier guise of creating and studying canons .
But the ’90s were more about rewriting the canon , and making sure that all the junk of the past got preserved alongside the classics .
Was all that pack - ratting worth it in the long run ?
Well , it certainly was fun at the time .
And let ’s face it , if you want to know what was on the minds of the rising generation in the relatively non-threatening mid-’90s , you wo n’t be too far off if you watch a trio of cartoon characters discussing the finer points of milkshakes .

Let 's close as the episode does , with “ The Tomfoolery Of Professor John Frink : ”
Advertisement
Professor Frink , of course , is The Simpsons ’ version of Jerry Lewis’ Nutty Professor , but in one of those weird perversions that often happens in the influence / homage game , I find that whenever I do a Jerry Lewis impression these days , more often than not , I ’m doing Frink .
In fact , since 1996 , my wife and I have been quoting the above bit of Frink - ery to each other , in part or in full .
Because that ’s something else that references do :
They forge bonds among those who share them .

BAGHDAD — A woman who veiled her explosives in a black robe struck a column of Shiite pilgrims on the outskirts of Baghdad on Monday in a suicide attack that Iraqi officials had predicted but could not stop .
The attack — coming a week after four enormous bombings in Baghdad using vehicles driven by suicide bombers — killed at least 38 people and wounded scores more along a major roadway in an industrial district on the northern edge of Baghdad , according to officials .
The bombing occurred despite what officials had pledged would be intensified security for the annual pilgrimage to Shiite Islam ’s holiest shrine in Iraq , underscoring the ability of insurgents to outmaneuver the country ’s security forces , seemingly at will .
Two more attacks — one with a grenade , another with a roadside bomb — later struck still more pilgrims in southern Baghdad , wounding 16 .
Can you train for trust ?
The question needs to be broken down ; but the quick answer is — yes .
Let ’s talk about how .
And then we want to invite you to experience it yourself .
Disclosure : this blog - post is part advertisement .
Trusted Advisor Associates is offering an open enrollment Being a Trusted Advisor program in New York , New York .
Read on to find out more , or just click here to sign up .
Now , back to training for trust ; let ’s break it down .
How to Approach Training for Trust
1 . Be clear what you ’re teaching .
There is training for trustworthiness , and there is training for trusting .
They are not the same .
It ’s the combination of one ’s trustworthiness and another ’s propensity for trusting that creates trust .
Trustworthiness can be learned and is a lower - risk proposition –focus your energy and resources here .
( See Trust , Trusting and Trustworthiness )
2. Keep it simple .
Break an amorphous , complex topic into bite - sized , digestible pieces .
Use a few solid , core models of trust .
We use the three Trust Models : the Trust Equation , the Trust Creation Process , and the Trust Principles .
3 . Make it stick .
Thought - provoking concepts are necessary … and far from sufficient .
We recommend four specific learning techniques to make a lasting impact :
a. Generous use of anecdotes — stories have a way of conveying the paradoxes of trustworthiness better than any rigorous intellectual model ;
b. Realistic cases — in particular , role - play exercises , cases and video vignettes ;
c. Muscle Memory — there is no substitute for ‘ feeling ’ the techniques , with hands - on demonstrations by experienced trainers and a lot of experimentation by participants ;
d. Ongoing application to current business situations — with instructors and coaches guiding you through it in real time , live ammunition , no safety net .
Above all else , trust is learned by doing .
What action will you take today to increase your trustworthiness ?

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
A missile believed to have been fired Thursday from an American drone killed the younger brother of a top militant commander in the North Waziristan tribal area , according to several Pakistani security and intelligence officials , residents in Waziristan and a friend of the commander ’s family .
The militant commander , Sirajuddin Haqqani , appeared to have been the target of the attack .
Mr. Haqqani , who the Americans say operates from a base in North Waziristan , took over major responsibilities for the family ’s militant network in recent years from his father , Jalaluddin Haqqani , who has been reported to be ill .
The Americans blame the Haqqani network for helping plan the suicide bombing against the C.I.A. base in Afghanistan in December in which C.I.A. operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed .
The brother , Mohammad Haqqani , was killed along with three others when their white station wagon was hit by a missile in Dande Darpakhel , a village in North Waziristan , bordering Afghanistan .
Americans believe that Sirajuddin Haqqani is closely affiliated with Al Qaeda and that his network is the most potent one working against international forces in eastern and central Afghanistan .
Dande Darpakhel is just north of Miram Shah , the capital of North Waziristan , and is considered the main base of the Haqqani network and family .
It has been a repeated target of missile strikes , one of which was believed to have killed several members of the clan last year .
Yesterday we were tipped to a video of Team Fortress 2 , imagined as a side - scrolling platformer .
Today I checked back with the creator for more details on this game and was assured he 's serious about completing the project .
Advertisement
Dylan " Steaky " Loney ( that 's " Steak -y , " as in the cut of meat ) , says his 2.5D Team Fortress 2 scroller is a Canabalt - esque game covering nine four different levels .
The objective wo n't be to shoot down or defeat enemies , but to run through the levels in the fastest possible time .
Players can switch between all nine classes , Trine - style , to get through obstacles and past enemies .
The first level , for example , features only the Scout .
Level two uses the Scout , Heavy and Sniper , and levels three and four involve everyone else .
Advertisement
No promises , says Loney , but he hopes to have it ready by the end of this month .
" I just called it Team Fortress Racers as I was working on it [ in December ] , " Loney said , " but lately the name 's changed to The Great Class Dash .
I 'm horrible at naming stuff , though .
So if anyone has a better suggestion , I 'm all ears . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
OK , but what is this , exactly ?
A map ?
A mod ?
Something in between ?
" Technically , it 's a map , " Loney says , " because it runs straight from TF2 .
There 's also no custom coding , which I think people usually associate with a mod .
With that said , though , it uses a huge amount of in - game scripting to completely modifiy the gameplay .
So I guess it is both . "
Advertisement
The Great Class Dash 's calling card is its 2.5D perspective , which we 've seen in throwback reboots like Bionic Commando : Rearmed and Matt Hazard : Bloodbath and Beyond .
Loney says that was actually very easy to accomplish .
" There are console commands built into TF2 that allow for a third - person camera , and you can change its position to make a side - scroller , " he explained .
Advertisement
" More complex was building the levels , which brings a lot of design problems , " he added .
" The way I chose to do this was to build as if the world had been sliced down a plane with everything past that point rendered solid black . "
In the video , we see the player beginning as Scout , with lightning - fast speed and leaping ability ; he switches over to Heavy to bust through a brick wall , and to Sniper to get around a coiled snake .
Figuring out which class successfully negotiates which obstacle will be a key , Loney said .
" The comments that identified Trine as my inspiration for class switching were dead - on , but the game itself does n't play like it , " Loney said .
" You 'll have to switch classes fast and often , making it almost like Guitar Hero in terms of pressing the right buttons at the right time . "
Advertisement
But , seriously , Sniper 's skill ?
Sneaking past wildlife ?
That 's like Aquaman talking to fish .
Loney said he wanted to amp up the Sniper 's capabilities , pegging off his Jarate , but quickly ran into a problem .
" Any player who had n't unlocked Jarate , or did n't have it equipped would suddenly break the game , " he said .
' So for this reason , weapon - specific abilities were pretty much eliminated .
" Even the simplest of ideas often lead to major headaches when trying to integrate , " Loney said .
" For this reason , I tried to keep things as basic as possible . "
Thus , Sniper 's invisible - to - wildlife skill was implemented , figuring that his rep as a deadly hunter terrifies them .
" A little farfetched , " Loney said , " but I do n't think it 's the worst idea in the world . "
Advertisement
Loney said he considered a multiplayer facet to his map - mod , early in the design phase , but realized that " huge amounts of scripting " would be required , and would n't be as fun . .
" With that said , i think a multiplayer 2D TF2 game would be amazing .
It would just have to be coded from scratch . "
So should Valve go ahead and do one already ?
Loney wo n't go that far .
" I do n't know that its something Valve should make , " he says .
" It would be a nice addition to the TF universe , and there 's definitely a lot you could do with the classes in terms of gameplay , but I think it might feel a little displaced coming from Valve .
Advertisement
" I fully support a mod team who decides to tackle making one though .
I think Gang Garrison did a fantastic job with it , though , so you would have to think of something new to bring , otherwise it would just be a 2.5D knock - off . "
Loney wants it made clear that he 's not making Team Fortress 2 Contra .
" My game is short , casual and very simple , " he says .
" Hopefully people wo n't go into it expecting crazy combat or trine - like puzzles to solve .
It 's a simple run and jump game because that 's what I was limited to with the scripting .
But that certainly does n't mean I would n't like to see a game that does more . "
Advertisement
When it 's finished , The Great Class Dash will be operable on any PC that can run Team Fortress 2 .
" You simply need to run the map from the main menu , " Loney says .
You can follow the project 's progress on his personal web site , and we 'll be sure to let you know when it 's ready .

The tea party movement started as a welcome protest against the alarming growth of federal spending and federal control .
It had a strong anti-statist flavor , or seemed to .
But judging from the applause for Sarah Palin at its convention , the movement 's suspicion of government power is exceeded only by its worship of government power .
Her keynote address at last week 's gathering in Nashville may have been the curtain raiser on a 2012 presidential campaign .
" I think that it would be absurd to not consider what it is that I can potentially do to help our country , " she told Fox News when asked about that option .
I 'm glad it was she and not I who first used the word " absurd " in relation to a possible Palin bid for the White House .
Because if her speech made anything clear , it's that the shallow , ill - informed , truth - twisting demagogue seen in the 2008 presidential campaign is all she is and all she wants to be .
When it comes to economic affairs , the tea partiers agree that — as Palin put it — " the government that governs least , governs best . "
When it comes to war and national security , however , her audience apparently thinks there is no such thing as too much government .
The conventioneers applauded when Palin denounced Obama for his approach to the war on terrorists .
Why ?
Because he lets himself be too confined by the annoying limits imposed by the Constitution .
" To win that war , we need a commander in chief , not a professor of law , " she declares .
Is her point that Obama is allergic to the use of military power or can't bear to fulfill his responsibility as head of the armed forces ?
That would come as a surprise to Iraqis , who have seen Obama stick to President Bush 's timetable for withdrawal .
It would come as a surprise to Afghans , who have seen him embark on a massive buildup of U.S. troops in their country .
It would come as a surprise to Pakistanis , who have seen an increase in U.S. drone missile attacks on their soil .
Palin accuses Obama of " reaching out to hostile regimes " and " apologizing for America , " with pitiful results : nuclear tests in North Korea , repression in Iran .
What she does n't mention — though , to be entirely fair , she may not know it — is that the first North Korean nuclear test came in 2006 and that before Obama arrived , the mullahs in Tehran did not rule with a gentle , loving hand .
Her chief gripe , though , is that federal agents read the alleged Christmas bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , his Miranda rights shortly after his arrest , at which point , she claims , he " lawyered up and invoked our U.S. constitutional right to remain silent . "
Not for long , he did n't .
The FBI says Abdulmutallab provided a wealth of useful information under questioning after he got a lawyer .
For that matter , as FBI Director Robert Mueller and National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair said last week , he is still being interrogated .
But facts have never been Palin 's strong suit .
Nor do they matter , because what infuriates her is the mere idea that constitutional protections would apply to " a terrorist who hates our Constitution and tries to destroy our Constitution . "
This is not some bizarre paradox .
Lots of people who despise our Constitution — Nazis , communists , Klansmen , Alaska secessionists — enjoy its protections .
Does she think the Bill of Rights should apply only to people who share her views ?
That would not leave much of the document she and the tea partiers claim to revere .
Besides , Obama did n't invent the heretical notion of accepting limits on the government 's latitude with jihadists .
The Bush administration turned hundreds of terrorism cases over to the federal courts , without audible complaint from the right .
The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution extends even to accused foreign terrorists held at Guantanamo .
The advantage of having a former law professor in the Oval Office is that he does n't have to be tutored in such elementary realities .
But Palin evinces a bitter resentment of any information that contradicts her blind faith in a benevolent , all - powerful security regime .
She 's more than willing to trade liberty for safety .
That went over conspicuously well in Nashville , where tea partiers cheered a leader who places excessive trust in government , disdains constitutional freedoms , and promotes a cult of personality .
So remind me :
What is it they do n't like about Barack Obama ?

The Interior Ministry ’s Jerusalem district planning and building committee provided “ procedural approval ” for the construction of 200 Jewish homes on Sheikh Jarrah Street in east Jerusalem three weeks ago , a member of the committee toldon Wednesday .
If it went ahead , the housing project , which reportedly received initial approval a year ago , would be situated near the Shephard Hotel , a building that is slated for demolition after the Jerusalem Municipality provided final approval earlier this month for the construction of 20 Jewish homes in its place .
District planning committee member Yair Gabai confirmed that procedural approval was given three weeks ago , but stressed that the development was far from receiving a final go - ahead .
It still has to go to the Jerusalem Municipality and pass through several layers of bureaucratic approvals before it could be implemented , he said .
Hagit Ofran , of Peace Now ’s Settlement Watch , told thethat the proposal had been “ revived unexpectedly .
” Ofran said the development would “ only add to the lack of confidence and increase anger among all those who are working for peace .
“ Arab homes would have to be destroyed if the plan went ahead , ” she continued .
The property is owned by Jews , but Arab tenants currently living on the site have received a protected status , which means the land ’s owners would have to locate alternative housing for them if they proceeded with the construction of the 200 housing units , Ofran said .
“ I thought this plan was discarded in May .
I was very surprised to see it reappear three weeks ago , ” she said .
“ A decision was made to put this program back on track .
“ I think this is an opportunity for [ Prime Minister Binyamin ]
Netanyahu to learn what is required of him if he really seeks peace .
He must ensure that these plans are stopped , ” she said .
An Interior Ministry spokeswoman denied that any approval of any kind had been given for the project .
Channel 10 reported on Wednesday evening that the latest proposed housing project would spread out over 45,000 square meters .
Meanwhile , Netanyahu has ordered the district planning committee to freeze deliberations over all proposals for future construction projects in the capital , Gabai said .
The district committee is the highest authority within the complex chain of bureaucratic bodies tasked with approving construction in Jerusalem , and has the power to provide the initial and most important okay for building proposals .
“ We have received an order from the prime minister telling us to stop approving any new plan , ” Gabai said .
“ It ’s a regretful decision , but I believe it is a temporary measure .
” The Interior Ministry said Netanyahu ordered the freeze to continue until a new board was set up , tasked with coordinating building plans in Jerusalem with the government .
Gabai said he could not estimate how many east Jerusalem building proposals were up for discussion by the committee .
“ We do not divide projects by locations .
All plans have been stopped for the whole of the city , ” he said .
He blasted the decision , and warned that it would inflate housing prices in the capital .
“ Every delay in housing plans will raise prices for young couplesseeking to own their own homes .
Contractors who purchased propertieswill be forced to pay interest to banks as they wait for approval , andthey in turn will charge higher prices for housing developments , ” Gabaisaid .
“ We have taken two steps backwards on affordable housing in Jerusalem .
This will also have a negative affect in demographic terms , sincecertain elements do not respect planning laws and construct homesillegally , ” Gabai said , referring to Arab construction in eastJerusalem .
“ The solution is very simple , and it is that the prime minister shouldgrow a backbone .
Relations with the US are not based on construction inJerusalem , ” he said .

The community organizing group Acorn announced Monday that it would close all its remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1 .
The organization is “ developing a plan to resolve all outstanding debts , obligations and other issues , ” said a statement released by the group .
Acorn has been battered by criticism from the right and has lost federal money and private donations since a video sting was publicized last fall .
Acorn employees were shown in the videos advising two young conservative activists — posing as a pimp and a prostitute — how to conceal their criminal activities .
In reaction to the videos , the Census Bureau ended its partnership with the organization for this year ’s census , the Internal Revenue Service dropped the group from its Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program , and Congress voted to cut off all grants to the organization .
There ’s a fine line between love and hate , and some Star Wars fanatics have crossed that flimsy divide with blasters a - blazin ’ when it comes to George Lucas , the visionary filmmaker who dreamed up the franchise .
The upcoming movie The People vs. George Lucas gives disgruntled Star Wars fans a chance to vent their frustrations about the direction the franchise has taken over the years .
Thousands of fans submitted video clips for the crowdsourced film , which will have its world premiere this March at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival in Austin , Texas .
“ We ’ve taken great care to show respect for a filmmaker who continues to inspire generations , and who has certainly inspired us to make this film , ” The People vs. George Lucas writer and director Alexandre O. Philippe told Wired.com in an e-mail interview after the announcement .
“ It ’s really hard to imagine what our pop-culture landscape would look like without Star Wars .
So our film is a love letter of sorts , but it ’s a rather twisted one , as we ’re looking at George through the prism of his fans . ”
The fan - fueled filmmaking process , enabled by the internet and easy access to video - editing technology , made it possible for Phillippe and his crew to connect with legions of fanboys and fangirls around the world , then stitch together a crazy - quilt indictment of Lucas ’ handling of the Star Wars legacy .
The movie looks at Star Wars as the cultural cornerstone it ’s become , Phillippe said .
“ Is George the sole owner of it , or does it now belong to the ages ? ” he said .
“ And what happens to your role as a creator when your audience claims it owns your art ? ”
Fan debate over the extensive changes made by Lucas in special editions of the films released long after the original theatrical runs gets pretty intense in The People vs. George Lucas , Phillippe said : “ As documentary filmmakers , we had to distance ourselves from the fact that we ’re fanboys and fangirls at heart , to deliver an objective , uncensored , no -holds - barred examination of a unique cultural phenomenon . ”
Crowdsourcing a ‘ participatory documentary ’
After launching a website in 2007 with an open call for fan contributions , the filmmakers received the predictable “ hours and hours of webcam rants , ” Phillippe said , as well as more advanced and creative materials : puppet skits , 3 - D animation and claymation segments , grindhouse - style commercials , children ’s drawings , vintage 8 mm films , fanedits and other treasures .
In all , Phillippe ’s team gathered an astonishing 600 hours of raw footage with which to construct the “ fully participatory documentary . ”
“ In many ways , The People vs. George Lucas is a tribute to the YouTube generation , which Lucas ’ advances in technology helped create , ” Phillippe said .
“ On a more profound level , it ’s about how new media interacts with old media , as well as ownership and copyright in the digital age ; and it was our intent from Day 1 to give the fans a prevailing voice in the doc . ”
Phillippe , who runs his production company Cinema Vertige out of Denver with his
wife , Vanessa Philippe , called the South by Southwest film fest an ideal place for his movie ’s launch .
“ The festival ’s unique convergence of indie films , music and interactive totally reflects the participatory nature of our doc across various media and forms of expression , ” he said .
The People vs. George Lucas has grown into something “ much larger than a documentary , ” Phillippe said .
It ’s become a “ very powerful grassroots movement ” fueled by amazingly supportive Star Wars fans , he said , adding that this week ’s announcement about the movie ’s SXSW premiere spurred a flurry of e-mails from fans around the world suddenly considering a trip to Texas next month .
“ Because we only have so many screenings , my fear , of course , is that we wo n’t be able to accommodate everyone , ” he said , “ but that ’s why we ’re hoping for a solid worldwide festival run , followed by a wide release , to give fans around the world the chance to see the film .
George triggers such strong emotions from so many people , and though I think we ’ll find people responding in different ways , I personally hope that this doc will be cathartic on some level . ”

The last full - sized Tricolour from the 1916 Rising still in existence , which was guided at a value of between $ 500,000 - $ 700,000 , has failed to sell at auction in New York .
The flag was withdrawn at $ 400,000 dollars .
The auctioneers say they are still optimistic about the prospects of arranging a private sale .
The Tricolour is thought to have flown from the top of the GPO during the rising .
The auction house ’s description says the linen Tricolour is accompanied by a note from Dr George St George , ( who owned the flag untill1922 ) reading ‘ Captured by British Troops at GPO Dublin , April 1916 and given to Dr George St George by an old War veteran , Sergt Davis ’ .
The flag was handed down to Mr St George ’s daughter and then was gifted ‘ to a neighbour , the son of a famous Irish nationalist and statesman , co-founder and early president of Sinn Féin ’ .
Bloomsbury Auctions says ‘ the fact that this flag is the only recorded full sized Tricolour of the 1916 Rising in existence , and therefore of the utmost rarity and importance … makes it a unique icon of immeasurable significance in the history of the Irish Revolution . ’
‘ Out - of - the - box ’ CIA think tank proposes concerns over women ’s rights , fear of terrorism as ways to boost support for Afghan war
Evidently spooked by the collapse of the Dutch government over the country ’s involvement in Afghanistan , the CIA has put together a strategy proposal to prevent what it fears could be a “ precipitous ” collapse of support for the war in Afghanistan among European allies .
ADVERTISEMENT
A document marked “ confidential / not for foreign eyes , ” posted to the Wikileaks Web site , suggests strategies to manipulate European public opinion on the war , particularly in France and Germany .
The document does n’t propose any direct methods by which the CIA could achieve this — there are no references to planting propaganda in the press , for example — but it does lay out what it sees as the key talking points to changing hearts and minds on the war .
Among its proposals , the policy paper suggests playing up the plight of Afghan women to French audiences , as the French public has shown concern for women ’s rights in Afghanistan .
For the German audience , the document suggests a measure of fear - mongering about the possible fallout of NATO failure in Afghanistan .
“ GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exposure to terrorism , opium , and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , ” the document asserts .
Read the report here , courtesy of Wikileaks .
The policy paper was prepared by a group called the “ CIA Red Cell , ” which describes itself as having been tasked “ with taking a pronounced ‘ out - of - the - box ’ approach that will provoke thought and offer an alternative viewpoint on the full range of analytic issues . ”

“ The fall of the Dutch Government over its troop commitment to Afghanistan demonstrates the fragility of European support for the NATO - led ISAF mission , ” the document states .
“ Some NATO states , notably France and Germany , have counted on public apathy about Afghanistan to increase their contributions to the mission , but indifference might turn into active hostility if spring and summer fighting results in an upsurge in military or Afghan civilian casualties . ”
The CIA report notes that 80 percent of the French and German public are opposed to the war , but offers a loophole : Public apathy , which has allowed European leaders to extend and broaden their involvement in Afghanistan despite deep opposition .
But “ if some forecasts of a bloody summer in Afghanistan come to pass , passive French and German dislike of their troop presence could turn into active and politically potent hostility , ” the report states .
ADVERTISEMENT
GET OBAMA INVOLVED
The CIA Red Cell points out that President Obama continues to enjoy popular support in Europe at levels he has not seen in the US in months .
The report suggests getting the president involved in selling the Afghanistan war to Europeans .
“ The confidence of the French and German publics in President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to handle foreign affairs in general and Afghanistan in particular suggest that they would be receptive to his direct affirmation of their importance to the ISAF missionÃ¢â‚¬â€ and sensitive to direct expressions of disappointment in allies who do not help , ” the report states .
ADVERTISEMENT
The report notes that “ when [ opinion poll ] respondents were reminded that President Obama himself had asked for increased deployments to Afghanistan , their support for granting this request increased dramatically , from 4 to 15 percent among French respondents and from 7 to 13 percent among Germans . ”
To change French minds , the CIA Red Cell proposes linking the Afghanistan war to the effort to improve women ’s rights in Afghanistan .
It also proposes pointing out that the Afghanistan mission is more popular in Afghanistan than it is in Europe , at least according to the statistics cited in the report .
“ Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing the ISAF role in combating the Taliban because of womenÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to speak personally and credibly about their experiences under the Taliban , their aspirations for the future , and their fears of a Taliban victory , ” the report asserts .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Highlighting AfghansÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ broad support for ISAF could underscore the missionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s positive impact on civilians .
About two - thirds of Afghans support the presence of ISAF forces in Afghanistan , according to a reliable … poll conducted in December 2009 , ” the report states .
For the German public , the message should be somewhat different , the report states .
“ Messages that dramatize the consequences of a NATO defeat for specific German interests could counter the widely held perception that Afghanistan is not GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s problem .
For example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exposure to terrorism , opium , and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics . ”
Numerous news reports in recent years have suggested that the CIA is more deeply involved in the Afghanistan war than it has been in previous wars .
For instance , when news broke that seven CIA agents had been killed in a suicide bombing at a forward operating base , it highlighted the fact that the CIA has been operating essentially as a branch of the military in Afghanistan , running the unmanned aerial drone strikes against the Taliban .
That suicide bombing also highlighted the difficulties the agency faces in getting a grasp on the situation in the Central Asian country .
CIA operatives had believed Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi , the suicide bomber , was willing to work as an informant for them .
They were apparently so completely unaware of his status as a double agent that they had prepared a birthday party for him in advance of his arrival , when he proceeded to blow himself up .

Wolfowitz Admits Iraq War Was Planned
Two Days After 9/11
by Jason Leopold
Dissident Voice
June 3 , 2003
While the hawks in the Bush administration attempt to justify the logic behind a preemptive strike against Iraq now that its become clear the country ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction are nowhere to be found , the true reasons for going to war are finally coming to light .
In his State of the Union address in January , President Bush said intelligence reports from the CIA and the FBI indicated that Saddam Hussein “ had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin , mustard and VX nerve agent , ” which put the United States in imminent danger of possibly being attacked sometime in the future .
Two months later , despite no concrete evidence from intelligence officials or United Nations inspectors that these weapons existed , Bush authorized the use of military force to decimate the country and destroy Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Now it appears the weapons of mass destruction will never be found and many critics of the war are starting to wonder aloud whether the community was duped by the Bush administration .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , both of who spent a better part of the past decade advocating the use of military force against Iraq , put the issue to rest once and for all .
Judging by recent interviews Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz gave to a handful of media outlets during the past week , the short answer is yes , the public was mislead into believing Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States .
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz admit that the war with Iraq was planned two days after the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 .
On September13 , 2001 , during a meeting at Camp David with President Bush , Rumsfeld and others in the Bush administration , Wolfowitz said he discussed with President Bush the prospects of launching an attack against Iraq , for no apparent reason other than a “ gut feeling ” Saddam Hussein was involved in the attacks , and there was a debate “ about what place if any Iraq should have in a counter terrorist strategy . ”
“ On the surface of the debate it at least appeared to be about not whether but when , ” Wolfowitz said during the May 9 interview , a transcript of which is posted on the Department of Defense website .
“ There seemed to be a kind of agreement that yes it should be , but the disagreement was whether it should be in the immediate response or whether you should concentrate simply on Afghanistan first . ”
Wolfowitz said it was clear that because Saddam Hussein “ praised ” the terrorist attacks on 9 - 11 that besides Afghanistan , Iraq went to the top of the list of countries the United States expected to launch an attack against in the near future .
“ To the extent it was a debate about tactics and timing , the President clearly came down on the side of Afghanistan first .
To the extent it was a debate about strategy and what the larger goal was , it is at least clear with 20 /20 hindsight that the President came down on the side of the larger goal . ”
In an interview with WABC - TV last week , Rumsfeld took it a step further saying United States policy advocated regime change in Iraq since the 1990s and that was also a reason behind the war in Iraq .
“ If you go back and look at the debate in the Congress and the debate in the United Nations , what we said was the President said that this is a dangerous regime , the policy of the United States government has been regime change since the mid to late 1990s … and that regime has now been changed .
That is a very good thing , ” Rumsfeld said during the interview , a transcript of which can be found at http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2003/tr20030527-secdef0228.html
Rumfeld ’s response is only partly true .
He and Wolfowitz , along with Vice President Dick Cheney and others in the administration , wrote to President Clinton in 1998 urging regime change in Iraq but Clinton rebuffed them saying his administration was focusing on dismantling al - Qaeda cells .
In the bigger picture , Iraqis are better off without Saddam Hussein , who ruled the country with an iron fist , torturing and murdering any citizen who spoke against his regime .
But that ’s beside the point .
The issue is the Bush administration lied to the world and launched an unjustifiable war .
And it ’s just the beginning of a so - called two front war the U.S. is planning against other “ outlaw ” regimes .
The administration is ratcheting up the rhetoric on Iran by making similar allegations that this country too poses a threat to national security by harboring al - Qaeda terrorists and building a nuclear arms arsenal .
Serious disagreements exist between the State Department and the Bush administration on how to deal with Iran , with the State Department pushing for an open dialogue and the Bush administration pushing for a new regime .
In a half a dozen interviews last week , Rumsfeld refused to respond to questions about whether the U.S. will use military force to overthrow Iran ’s governing body .
“ That ’s ( military force ) up to the President but the fact is that to the extent that Iran attempts to influence what ’s taking place in Iraq and tries to make Iraq into their image , we will have to stop it .
And to the extent they have people from their Revolutionary Guard in they ’re attempting to do that , why we ’ll have to find them and capture them or kill them , ” Rumsfeld said in an interview last week with WCBS - TV .
Wolfowitz , however , is more direct in how to deal with Iran .
Responding to the question of whether military force will be used to weed out the clerics running the country , Wolfowitz said in an interview with CNN International Saturday “ you know , I think you know , we never rule out that kind of thing . ”

Out ‘ Paid for by RNC ’ Line on Tea Party Signs
Created : March 15 , 2010 18:24 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Last week , the “ Take the Town Halls to D.C. ” campaign got a small amount of negative attention for “ LISTEN TO ME ! ” signs being distributed to activists by the Republican National Committee .
I stopped by the Take the Town Halls HQ today and saw the RNC ’s solution .
Here are the old signs :
Note the language at the bottom identifying the RNC as the maker of the sign .
But today , the “ LISTEN TO ME ! ” signs — a stack of them were underneath a 2005 Bush - Cheney inauguration bag — looked like this .

From afar , those blackish stickers fully obscure the RNC label .
A Queens imam who became entangled in a terrorism plot against New York City when he warned one of the planners that he was under government surveillance pleaded guilty on Thursday to a reduced charge of lying to federal officials .
Fighting through tears , the imam , Ahmad Wais Afzali , spoke of failing his adopted country , a country his conviction will soon require him to leave , maintaining that he had no idea of the seriousness of the case when he told Najibullah Zazi in phone conversations that law enforcement officials were investigating him .
Mr. Afzali , who had been approached by the New York Police Department to provide information on Mr. Zazi , said he was afraid when Federal Bureau of Investigation agents interrogated him two days later — so he lied about the conversation with Mr. Zazi , even though he knew it had been recorded .
“ My intention was not to protect Zazi but to protect myself , ” he said during a hearing on Thursday in United States District Court in Brooklyn .
“ In doing so , I failed to live up to my obligation to this country , my community , my family and my religion .
I am truly sorry . ”

That may also be good short - term politics  there are a lot more healthy people than chronically ill people  but it shortchanges those who most need help .
And until the problem of rising medical costs is addressed , the government will never solve its deficit problem .

Here is a look at the main “ fixes ” contained in Republican reform bills .
They primarily affect people who buy their own policies or work for small businesses , not the vast majority who get their insurance through larger employers .
INSURANCE IN ANY STATE
The cost of insurance for individual buyers varies considerably by state .
In New York , for example , the premiums are high because insurers are required by law to accept all applicants without regard to their health status and provide a wide array of benefits .
Under federal laws , health insurers can sell policies only to individuals in the states where they are licensed to do business .
The Republican proposals would allow insurers to designate any state as their primary place of business and then sell policies to residents of any other state .
Most insurers would probably choose a state with few requirements , enabling them to offer skimpy policies , shun the sickest applicants and keep premiums low .
The Congressional Budget Office expects that young and healthy individuals would flock to the lower - benefit / lower - premium states while the older and sicker would flock to the states where they are guaranteed coverage , causing premiums to rise even higher there .
The Republicans are also calling for federal bonus payments to states that reduce the number of uninsured or states where insurers lower their average premiums for individual and small group insurance .
The idea has some merit as an add - on to more comprehensive national reforms , but leaving the states to solve such major problems is unlikely to have much success .
ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS
The Republicans would allow individuals or small businesses to buy group coverage through various business , professional or civic associations .
The notion , a good one , is that a broader pool should enable the group to get lower rates than an individual could .
The downside is that these associations could also tailor their policies to attract the healthy , leaving the sicker out of luck or in small group coverage where they would drive up the average premiums .
Guest Post by Steven Mosher
All processes are subject to hacking , both from external and internal entities .
The IPCC process is no exception , neither is the process of writing for science journals exempt .
As recent reports show Pachauri hacked the IPCC processes to make them work against themselves and bend the system to his financial ends .
An inside hacker , like Pachauri , can be especially dangerous since he plays a role in structuring the very system that they hack .
Not only do they exploit a system they were meant to protect , but they also act in ways to prevent detection of their hacks .
What the recent disclosures about Pachauri show is that the IPCC process is now totally compromised , compromised from the inside .
Like a system exploited by a destructive hack , that system may be beyond repair .
It ’s time to reformat the hard drive and start from scratch , as climate scientist Hulme , spotted 101 times in the Climategate files and closely tied to Pachauri , suggested –perhaps in a moment of clarity after the discovery of the emails :
“ It is also possible that the institutional innovation that has been the I.P.C.C. has run its course .
Yes , there will be an AR5 but for what purpose ?
The I.P.C.C. itself , through its structural tendency to politicize climate change science , has perhaps helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production . ”
Just how was the CRU system hacked ?
And can such hacks be prevented or are they a very part of the nature of authoritarian systems ?
As discussed in our book “ Climategate : The Crutape Letters , now available on Kindle and in Ebook format , the “ hacks ” were focused on the publication process .
The IPCC reports were intended to be summaries of the science , both what we know and what we do n’t know .
These summaries were written for policy makers who would use the science and its findings to take action : action to prevent climate change , mitigate it , adapt to it , and to fund new studies where knowledge was uncertain .
And action is where the money is .
Every hack of the system cashes out into some form of compensation to the hackers : more money for their organizations or more prestige for themselves .
As the mails show the hacking of the CRU process and the scientific process itself was exposed primarily because of the “ pressure ” put on the hackers by the FIOA process .
And as the mails also show , the hackers moved to thwart the FOIA process by corrupting FOIA officers .
In fact , the most egregious hack of the system , Jones ’s request that people delete mails , came as the direct result of trying to cover up a hack of the process , the hack surrounding the ‘ Jesus Paper . ’
During the course of writing the account of Climategate , we noticed that Pachauri , was named directly in the files 11 times and he ’s mentioned by title in others .
Before canvassing those mails it ’s key to understand how the hackers worked to subvert the IPCC process and the scientific publishing process .
And finally , it ’s important to understand that they are planning counter measures that will allow them to continue hacking the system with the upcoming fifth assessment report due in 2013 .
As Jones indicates in late 2009 , Pachauri and Thomas [ Stocker ] an IPCC Co Chair took up the issue of FOIA with the full IPCC .
One ca n’t imagine that they argued for full disclosure or full compliance with disclosure laws .
As detailed in this mail Jones ’ alerts Stocker , who works at Bern in Switzerland , to measures Holland suggests for the next IPCC report .
Jones alerts Stocker to specific comments on Climate Audit , arming him for the next battle .
Tricks of the Trade .
The high level hacks of the IPCC system include the following : changing chronologies , altering the appearance of graphics to tell a different story making up science out of whole cloth , and citing non peered reviewed literature when they could not keep contrarian papers out of the IPCC documents .
The IPCC reports are supposed to be objective summaries of the state of the science and are supposed to reference only works that are published in the peer reviewed science that met specific time deadlines .
The deadlines are critical to have a fair and open process , ensuring that papers referenced have , in fact , been published and reviewed by others .
Jones , however , finds such procedures to ensure fairness an impediment to his determining what is important .
Hacking the deadlines to get the ‘ Jesus paper ’ into Chapter 6 of the 4th assessment report of the IPCC was easiest hack to uncover .
As the hackers left a paper trail of their activities that exists outside of the climategate mails .
The mails , merely confirm what Steve McIntyre had already figured out .
The mails of course add some background that strengthens the case , including the hacker ’s knowledge that McIntyre was on to their game as well as Jones suggestion to cover up the hack by changing the “ received date ” on the paper .
By hacking the deadlines of the process , and shoe horning in a paper that would not be fully reviewed and published for over a year , a paper that contains references to another paper published after the fact , the hackers could ensure that lead author Briffa had the ammunition he needed to write the chapter the way Overpeck , his overlord , wanted it written : with a punch line more compelling than the ‘ Hockey Stick ’ , that iconic figure of the global warming religion which “ shows ” that the current warming is “ unprecedented in human history . ”
This hack is akin to check kiting or akin to planting older fossils with younger fossils as occurred in the Piltdown Man hoax .
To further the promotion of the ‘ Hockey Stick ’ message the Chapter 6 team also manipulated graphics , “ hiding the decline , ” even when one reviewer explicitly demanded that they show the graphic as it appeared in the original science .
And finally , after keeping one skeptical paper out of the first two drafts of the report , as they had threatened to , the scientists finally resorted to making up facts on the fly .
Those are the user level hacks , but they go deeper .
At the IPCC level the hacking is open to scrutiny , and as we see , the journalists following the references in the IPCC document are now finding these user level exploits .
The deeper hacks , like a rootkit hack , involve the operating system of science , the science journals themselves .
Manipulation of the science at the IPCC level is easy to document , but corrupting the journal process , the process that is supposed to feed the IPCC process with “ trusted ” information , is tougher to document .
Without the mails which detail how these hacks work , one could imagine that the IPCC could be made “ hack proof ” merely by adopting more controls and a more open process .
The mails , however , indicate that the science publishing process has also been hacked .
Editors have been compromised , and the system of peer review has been corrupted .
Very simply , one can make the IPCC process as open and transparent as one likes , but as long as it is fed by a corrupt journal process , you will still get garbage science out of the IPCC process .
And further , you could reform the journals all you like and the process can still be corrupted by the individual influential researcher who hides his data and his code .
Eleven Mails
The 11 mails mentioning Pachauri by name , only give hints at how the system was worked to his advantage .
Reading them now in hindsight is instructive .
The first from Rob Stewart to Pachauri in 1998 , before Pachuari ’s tenure begins , details the process of communicating about IPCC matters .
As it notes , all communication should happen within the structures set up so that a traceable chain of evidence can be created .
As the Climategate files show , this policy was violated , violated precisely so that the 4th assessment could be shaped in a way not reflective of the underlying science .
In the second mail Pachauri invites Hulme to a conference , initiating a relationship with Hulme that will culminate in Pachauri and Hulme working together to on UEA ’s effort to win a government bid on the creation of a climate change center in England , as detailed in the third mail in the stack .
That effort results in the founding of the Tyndall Centre , a center named no less than 11 times in the mails .
The interests of Hulme and Pachauri are clear .
Use the science arm at CRU to drive conclusions in the IPCC that will drive funding into Tyndall and drive money into TERI , Pachauri ’s organization , and CRU .
The importance of funding should not be underestimated .
Money works to corrupt science , not by changing the answer , but by changing the questions that get asked .
The fourth mail shows some of the TERI organization ’s interests and one can see from the articles promoted in their newsletter that the agenda is clearly one of using the threat of climate change to drive a particular developing nation ’s agenda .
The fifth Pachauri mail is interesting for a variety of reasons .
The mail contains other mails , notably mails from Tom Wigley and Phil Jones who question the appointment of Pachauri , as they apparently believed that Pachauri was put in place by political forces , namely Bush , to serve corporate interests .
This typical kneejerk reaction of the Union of Concerned Scientists , who alerted Wigley to the issue , on reflection , is somewhat laughable now .
Hulme , as the mail show , defends Pachauri , his Indian partner , in the bid to get the Tyndall center , on rather odd grounds .
Simply : Wigley points out that the “ bushies ” are behind this and Hulme defends Pachauri by arguing that perhaps Watson , a Brit and the previous IPCC secretariat , has gone too far ; and Hulme wonders why an Indian and an engineer should not be considered .
Hulme strangely turns a political attack on Pachauri into an attack on his back ground .
The defense seems entirely misplaced , unless of course there has been some other communications where these concerns were raised .
So why does Hulme go “ racial ? ”
Whatever the reason it ’s apparent that discussions about Pachauri ’s appointment do n’t continue .
Hulme played the race card and issue ends there .
Perhaps
Hulme played the race card so he would not have to explain how having Pachauri “ on board ” would be beneficial .
Hulme ’s partner is now in charge of the IPCC ; and as Hulme writes , recalling the language of the conference Pachauri invited him to back in 1998 , it will be a good thing to have someone in charge who understands that climate change is a North / South issue .
It will also be good to have someone in charge who can funnel benefits your way .
The sixth Pachauri mail is from Tom Wigley in 2003 .
The topic of the mail is the strategy for responding to a single paper by Soon and Baliunas .
It ’s hard to fathom why a scientist would include the head of the IPCC as well as many other scientists on a mail that lays out the strategy for responding to lone contrarian paper .
The Soon and Balinunas paper , did have the notoriety of being a skeptical paper accepted by the peer review science , but it was hardly a crushing blow to “ the science . ”
Still , Wigley lays out for Pachauri , what the goal is .
Rebut the paper to make the job of writing the next IPCC report , due years down the road , easier .
So , the practices of just letting bad science die , or of letting individual scientists rebut the bad paper as they see fit are brushed aside .
Wigley believes that there must be some sort of orchestrated effort to provide the future writers of the IPCC reports with specifically targeted ammunition .
Science gets turned to producing papers to make the job of the science summarizers easier .
In the seventh mail in the stack Michael Mann appears to weigh in with his opinion .
Included in the mail , is Stephan Schneider .
Schneider , whose name appears at least 71 times in the mails , will later prove instrumental in getting the Jesus Paper into Chapter 6 of the 4th Assessment .
He is a Trojan horse inside the journal system .
But for Schneider , who “ knows the drill ” , the Jesus paper would never make it into the report .
What Schneider and Pachauri see , of course , is that Mann is making the contrarian paper a political issue and David Halpern of the OSFT has been contacted .
In the eighth mail , Jim Salinger will add his voice to the choir of those suggesting that the “ bad ” science be refuted rather than merely ignored .
Again , one has to ask what is the head of the IPCC doing on these mails ?
Why do Mann and Salinger think that he will be remotely interested in the fate of a single paper ?
In the ninth Parchuari mail , we see Hulme and Pachauri starting to take advantage of their connection through the Tyndall Centre , and Hulme suggests a joint publishing project .
So we have Hulme , who brushed off Wigley and Jones ’s political concerns about his partner Pachauri , actively engaging with the head of the IPCC to work on projects that both of their organizations will benefit from .
The 10th mail is interesting for one reason .
It provides some rich irony and it shows what men of character do when a publishing process is subverted .
The file contains an email from Mann and from Salinger , and both reference the turmoil cause by the Soon paper .
Notably Hans Von Storch is reckoned a hero for resigning his editorship at Climate Research over the incident .
The journal that he worked for had published the suspect paper , and his response and the response of other editors was resignation .
Simply put , those who worked on the IPCC reports took the same stance as Von Storch , they would take their names off the IPCC report .
Just as Climate Research erred in publishing the flawed Soon paper , the IPCC process has also published bogus science , even invented science where there was none .
In 2003 that one simple error was enough to get men of character to resign .
Authors of the IPCC report would do well to follow their example .
The incident bears some striking similarities to what we see today .
The Wall Street Journal editorial by Antonio Regalado , is included in the mail from Mann .
“ This week , three editors of Climate Research resigned in protest over
the journal ’s handling of the review process that approved the study ;
among them is Hans von Storch , the journal ’s recently appointed
editor in chief .
“ It was flawed and it should n’t have been
published , ” he said ”
And most importantly , the flawed science found its way into an EPA document much as flawed science has made its way into the IPCC report :
“ A reference to Dr. Soon ’s paper previously found its way into
revisions suggested by the White House to an EPA report on
environmental quality .
According to an internal EPA memorandum
disclosed in June , agency scientists were concerned the version
containing the White House edits “ no longer accurately represents
scientific consensus on climate change . ”
Dr. Mann ’s data showing the
hockey - stick temperature curve was deleted .
In its place ,
administration officials added a reference to Dr. Soon ’s paper , which
the EPA memo called “ a limited analysis that supports the
administration ’s favored message . ”
In 2003 the journal Climate Research let through a bad piece of science that challenged the “ hockey stick . ”
That bad science made its way into an EPA document because it favored the administrations view .
Clearly this was wrong .
And Von Storch took the right action .
And now , with the evidence that bad science has made its way into the IPCC report , its time for the responsible parties to follow the fine example of Von Storch .
The 11th mail which mentions Pachauri is important for understanding the events leading up to Phil Jones ’ refusal to give data to Warwick Hughes , but its relation to Pachauri is tangential , except for the hint it contains about the kind of rhetoric Pachauri would use to further his cause , an early clue into his character .
Buried in a series of editorials about Michael Mann forward by Briffa to Jones , we find the following 2005 gem from Steven Hayward of the American Enterprise Institute :
“ Not long ago the IPCC ’s chairman , Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , compared
eco-skeptic Bjorn Lomborg to Hitler .
“ What is the difference between Lomborg ’s view of humanity and Hitler ’s ? ” Pachauri asked in a Danish newspaper .
“ If you were to accept Lomborg ’s way of thinking , then maybe what Hitler did was the right thing ” Lomborg ’s sin was merely to follow the consensus practice of economists in applying a discount to present costs for future benefits , and comparing the range of outcomes with other world problems alongside climate change .
It is hard to judge what is worse : Pachauri ’s appalling judgment in resorting to reductio ad Hitlerum , or his abysmal ignorance of basic economics .
In either case , it is hard to have much confidence in the policy advice the IPCC might have . ”
Looking at the Pachauri mails in the Climategate files does n’t provide any new examples of wrongdoing .
We do n’t need any .
What it does do is give a sense of how the men who hacked the climate science operated .
How they reasoned , how they strategized and what they viewed as threats and opportunities .
If we want to improve the science in climate science and build a trusted system , we need to understand the “ black hats . ”
Building a trusted system for climate science
With the IPCC ’s reputation in tatters , it ’s hard to avoid the conclusion of Pachauri ’s man at CRU , Hulme .
Perhaps the IPCC has run its course .
If trust is to be rebuilt in climate science it must start from the bottom up , with the fundamental data and code of climate science .
The IPCC process will always be hackable , and so to will the climate science journals .
Cleaning up the mess must start at the foundation of science with open access to the data and the code used in climate science .
The notion that science can move forward while individual climate scientists hide data from their critics is antithetical to the dictates of reason .
CRU and others have no more excuses .
All and any data used in climate science should be published under a Creative Commons like license , free for anyone to view and use .
Confidential data should not be used ; it is not necessary to the science .
Phil Jones should be removed as an advisor to NOAA on data archiving and access .
That ’s having a black hat hacker in charge of the hardware .
The code of climate science should likewise be freely available .
In particular , we should press climate science to adopt a GPL license , one that enforces sharing of code .
In part GPL is required because on more than one occasion some climate scientists have used the public code of others without re-sharing it .
For example , they have used public code , modified it in undocumented ways , and refused to share the derivative work .
At the level of the journals trust can only be rebuilt by changes in people and principles .
The list of people who need to go is easy to draw up .
More importantly the Journals need to adopt principles of reproducible research .
If a reviewer or official “ replication ” expert cannot recompile the science from source , both data and code , the science needs to be rejected .
Above the journal level at the IPCC level of course Pachauri needs to go .
But the risk of him being replaced with a less crude hacker is high .
The issue is that trust cannot be blindly placed in people .
The entire IPCC process must be opened .
We want to watch that process first hand and be eyewitness to every word .

What 's The Greatest Software Ever Written ?
Witness the definitive , irrefutable , immutable ranking of the most brilliant software programs ever hacked .
Most red - blooded technologists will offer a quick opinion on what 's the greatest software ever , but when you take the time to evaluate what makes software truly brilliant , the choices are n't so obvious .
One of the most significant pieces of programming I know was n't even software .
Before the British built the Colossus machine , which translated German teletype code during World War II , it took the Allies up to six hours to decode a message and a day or more to pore over intelligence , draw conclusions , and pass along information to military command .
After Colossus , the Allies gained a picture of German military activity across the English Channel as the day unfolded -- intelligence that gave Gen.
Dwight Eisenhower the confidence to launch the D - Day invasion .
To the moon and back thanks to routine software

Colossus was built in 1944 to perform Boolean operations on a paper data tape that streamed through the machine at 30 miles an hour .
Its logic was literally wired into the machine .
It is , perhaps , the greatest software that never got written .
So where does that leave us ?
First , let 's set criteria for what makes software great .
Superior programming can be judged only within its historical context .
It must represent a breakthrough , technical brilliance , something difficult that had n't been done before .
And it must be adopted in the real world .
Colossus transformed a drawn - out mechanical process into electronics -- it was an early computer -- and provided a useful service by accelerating coded teletype translation .
Colossus shaped history .
Another example of great programming was IBM 's 360 system .
The software was written as the first general - purpose computer operating system in 1964 .
Many of the truths we assume today about software -- that simple designs are better than complicated ones , that a few skilled programmers will accomplish more than platoons of them - - are captured in Frederick Brooks ' book on the project , The Mythical Man-Month ( Addison - Wesley Professional , 1995 ) .
Brooks already knew how many things could go wrong with big software projects before the 360 project began .
In fact , he was a critic within IBM of carrying out the project at all ; he thought it had too many potential points of failure .
That 's why IBM put him in charge of it , I suppose .
Wise that they did .
The result was the first computer system capable of running different applications at the same time .
It spawned the IBM line of mainframes , which evolved into the 370 Series and present zSeries .
To this day , those systems remain backwardly compatible with Brooks ' 360 operating system .
Which leads me to another attribute of great software :
It 's got legs .
It is n't easily superseded .
We Know Great
Everybody agrees the IBM 360 was one of the greatest pieces of software ever written .
Greatness is easier to assess given a long historical perspective .
The closer you get to the present , however , the harder it is to name the greatest software .
Well , damn the torpedoes .
With great insight , I 've assembled this , my list of the greatest software ever written , from Colossus to the present .
I 've consulted software guru James Rumbaugh ; Stuart Feldman , president of the Association of Computing Machinery ; venture capitalists Ann Winblad and Gary Morgenthaler ;
Web site scripting software ( PHP 3.0 ) authors Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans ; and my little brother , Wally .
The list remains my own , however .
Those who find it full of wise and inspired choices can E - mail me at the address at the end of this story .
For those who find it misguided , distasteful , or willfully ignorant , send your message to Wally , a 6 - foot - 3 - inch former basketball star who still packs a wallop .
I 've always been amazed at the Apollo spacecraft guidance system , built by the MIT Instrumentation Lab .
In 1969 , this software got Apollo 11 to the moon , detached the lunar module , landed it on the moon 's surface , and brought three astronauts home .
It had to function on the tiny amount of memory available in the onboard Raytheon computer -- it carried 8 Kbytes , not enough for a printer driver these days .
And there would n't be time to reboot in case of system failure when the craft made re-entry .
It 's just as well Windows was n't available for the job .
The Apollo guidance system probably seems like routine software to technology sophisticates .
Far more complex navigational systems are in operation today .
The system 's essentials were a few well - known algorithms based on proven logic .
But to me , it 's still rocket science .
Great software dazzles us by virtue of what it does correctly in the face of everything that could go wrong .
IBM 360 had staying power
To those unimpressed by the relative simplicity of the Apollo space system , I ask this :
Would you rather place your life in the hands of a more complex system for moving things ?
Take , for example , the BAE Automated Systems software that was supposed to handle baggage at the Denver International Airport .
On its October 1993 launch date , it lost or misdirected so much luggage , or delivered so much of it into the jaws of the conveyor , that the city had to delay opening the airport for 16 months .
The cost overrun for the city : $ 1.1 million per day .
For that matter , our lives already are in the hands of such software .
The Federal Aviation Administration spent hundreds of millions of dollars , not once , but three times , trying to build an effective air traffic control system .
It has thrown out about half of what it has created , technology valued at $ 144 million , while the other half periodically hiccups and stalls .
Great software ?
I 'll stick with the Apollo guidance system .
For software to be considered a success , it has to be up to handling the job it was created to do .
That axiom certainly applies to VisiCalc , the first spreadsheet software .
It 's great because it demonstrated the power of personal computing .
The software put the ability to analyze and manipulate huge amounts of data into the hands of every business .
But VisiCalc itself , despite representing a breakthrough concept , was n't great software .
It was flawed and clunky , and could n't do many things users wanted it to do .
The great implementation of the spreadsheet was not VisiCalc or even Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 but Microsoft Excel , which extended the spreadsheet 's power and gave businesspeople a variety of calculating tools .
Microsoft 's claims that it makes great software are open to dispute , but the Excel spreadsheet is here to stay .
Nearly everyone is touched by it .

Before we take a look at some of the best and worst foods for your heart , let 's make one point clear : a healthy heart is useless without several other well functioning organ systems .
A strong heart can only keep you healthy if the following parts of your body are functioning properly :
Nervous system ( cerebrum , midbrain , spinal cord , vagus nerve , and sensory fibers )
Respiratory system ( nasal passageway , nasopharynx , oropharynx , trachea , bronchi , bronchioles , and alveoli )
Digestive system ( digestive tract , liver , gall bladder , and pancreas )
Blood vessels ( arteries , arterioles , capillaries , venules , and veins )
Assuming that all of the above components in your body are functional , some of the best foods for your heart and blood vessels are :
Green Vegetables
Romaine lettuce , green leaf lettuce , red leaf lettuce , arugala , kale , Swiss chard , collard greens , turnip greens , sesame leaves , basil , parsley , mint , broccoli , cabbage , brussels sprouts , green onions , leeks , spinach , zucchini , and Asian greens like bok choy , are the very best foods for your heart and blood vessels .
These green vegetables supply a wide array of vitamins , minerals , and phytochemicals that can nourish the cells of your cardiovascular system .
And just as important , these green vegetables have virtually no chance of harming your heart and blood vessels .
Foods That Are Naturally Rich In Omega - 3 Fatty Acids Raw walnuts , freshly ground flax seeds , purslane , wild salmon , anchovies , lake trout , fresh seaweed , organic eggs from birds that are raised in a free range environment , and high quality fish oil are all naturally rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and are well tolerated by the masses .
Undamaged omega - 3 fatty acids have been shown in both clinical and epidemiological studies to reduce one 's risk of cardiovascular disease .
Foods That Are Naturally Rich In The Full Vitamin C Complex Acerola cherries , black currants , tropical guava , grapefruit , green and yellow kiwis , lychee , longans , oranges , cantaloupe , papaya , persimmons , goji berries , and red currants are all naturally rich in the full vitamin C complex , which includes compounds called flavonoids .
Flavonoids are powerful antioxidants that can help protect your heart and blood vessels against damage created by free radicals .
Flavonoids can also support healthy dilation of your blood vessels during times when an area of your body needs increased blood supply .
The worst foods for your heart and blood vessels are those that are concentrated with unhealthy fats and / or sugar / refined carbohydrates .
The following foods will reliably create cardiovascular disease if consumed on a regular basis :
Food Concentrated Source Of
Unhealthy Fat Concentrated Source Of
Sugar And / Or Refined Carbohydrates Donuts Yes Yes French fries Yes Yes Soda / Pop - Yes Margarine Yes - Shortening Yes - Ice Cream Yes Yes Processed Cheese Yes - Tempura Yes - Meat Cooked At High Temperatures
Yes - Store - Bought Cookies Usually Yes Potato Chips ( Not Baked ) Yes Yes Pretzels - Yes Cake , Muffins , Pastries Usually Yes White Bread , Bagels Sometimes Yes Chocolate Bars , Candies Sometimes Yes
With regard to foods that are bad for your heart and blood vessels , please keep in mind that the quantity that you are exposed to over time is an important factor in considering their long term effects on your health .
Having an ice cream cone once every couple of months or a few store - bought cookies once every several weeks is not going to significantly raise your risk of developing cardiovascular disease if your overall diet and lifestyle are health promoting .
Occasional indulgences may even contribute to good health over the long run if you allow yourself to fully enjoy them , by yourself or with family and / or friends .
My point is this : do n't allow stress that can come from not following your ideal diet 100 percent of the time hurt your health more than the occasional dietary indulgence can .
A discussion about healthy and unhealthy foods for your heart and blood vessels cannot exclude the thoughts and emotions that you regularly choose to experience .
Just as eating French fries a few times per week can cause your heart and blood vessels to become fatty , chronic fury and pettiness are likely to contribute to cardiovascular disease over the long haul .
And just as eating lots of green vegetables can help keep your heart and blood vessels strong and vital , consistently choosing to feel grateful and compassionate can promote a healthy cardiovascular system .

CARBONDALE , IL — Doctors at Southern Illinois Hospital confirmed Monday that Dale Monfort , a 39 - year - old lymphatic - cancer sufferer who underwent emergency surgery last week , has just six months to pay .
Cancer sufferer Dale Monfort ( left ) receives grim news regarding his financial prognosis .

" Breaking that kind of news to a patient is never easy , " said Dr. Albert Sutin , who performed the six - hour , $ 30,840 procedure to remove a malignant mass in one of Monfort 's lymph nodes .
" To look a man in the face and tell him he 's got , at the very most , half a year to get his affairs in order , well , it 's one of the toughest things a doctor has to do . "
In total , Monfort 's operation and five - day hospital stay cost $ 44,172.46 , with full payment due no later than Jan. 30 , 2000 .
Advertisement
" At first , his outlook seemed excellent , " Sutin said .
" But when Mr. Monfort 's results tal came back from the billing department , we were forced to change our assessment of his financial condition . "
" As soon as we opened up his file , we saw it — a recent job change had left him without active health insurance for the month of August , " Sutin said .
" Quite frankly , at that point , we knew there was little we could do to help him . "

Unable to halt the uncontrolled growth of the bill , doctors referred Monfort to Marlene Davidoff , head of the hospital 's renowned FlexPay program .
Upon reviewing his records , Smith estimated that there is only a 10 percent chance his already - depleted bank accounts would be able to handle the massive withdrawals necessary in the final stages of repayment .
" Unfortunately , I do n't see much hope , " Davidoff said .
" If he were a young , physically active , non-smoking lawyer or investment banker , then I 'd say he'd have a good shot at beating this .
But a between - jobs high - school guidance counselor ?
You just do n't see those types recovering from this sort of thing . "
Advertisement
Monfort , who has a long family history of billing problems , said he " immediately knew something was wrong by the look on the specialist 's face . "
" These doctors know what they 're doing , " a visibly shaken Monfort said .
" They do n't usually send in their top payment counselor to talk to a financially healthy man .
The second I saw him , I knew they 'd discovered something terribly wrong deep within my body of credit . "

Monfort , who has been hemorrhaging funds ever since he was diagnosed with cancer on May 11 , was immediately placed within the hospital 's high - risk group .
The billing department is not planning to enlist the assistance of a credit - reconstruction specialist , however , saying that in light of Monfort 's already failing financial health , it would not be worth the risk .
In the meantime , Monfort has been tying up loose ends , using what precious little time he has left to visit members of his extended family and make contact with friends he has n't seen in years , some of whom may be able to loan him money .

" Dale 's a fighter .
He 'll lick this thing yet , " said Scott Roth , an old college roommate whom Monfort recently called to collect on an outstanding $ 200 debt from 1978 .
" I 'm willing to help him out as much as I can .
But , ultimately , it 's got to come from him . "
Monfort said he is trying to put his plight into perspective and take stock of his life .

" News like this really makes you reexamine your valuables , " Monfort said .
" It forces you to ask yourself what 's really important to you and what you 're willing to let go of at a garage sale . "
" In a way , " Monfort continued , " this has been good for me .
It 's made me realize just how much the little things were costing me .
Things like flowers for my wife or an ice - cream cone for my daughter . "

Specialists at the hospital say Monfort 's positive attitude greatly increases his likelihood of payment .
" When a patient skips the ' denial ' phase of coping with medical billing crises , we have a much greater chance of recovering our funds , " said Bob Gilliam , chief financial officer at the hospital .
" What we have to watch out for now , though , is the equally dangerous ' bargaining ' phase .
Dale must realize that there 's no getting around this .
He needs to face this bill head - on , because no matter how much he wishes it would , it 's not going to go away . "

Here 's why :
This is a picture of a steak that was cooked in a skillet to medium rare ( an internal temperature of 125 ° F or 51.7 °C ) .
The steak was then immediately placed on a cutting board and sliced in half , whereupon a deluge of juices started flooding out and onto the board .
The result ?
Steak that is less than optimally juicy and flavorful .
This tragedy can be easily avoided by allowing your steak to rest before slicing .
I 've always been told that this happens because as one surface of the meat hits the hot pan ( or grill ) , the juices in that surface are forced away towards the center , increasing the concentration of moisture in the middle of the steak .
Once the steak gets flipped over , the same thing happens on the other side .
The center of the steak becomes supersaturated with liquid — there 's more liquid in there than it can hold on to — so when you slice it open , all that extra liquid pours out .
By resting the steaks , you allow all that liquid that was forced out of the edges and into the center time to migrate back out to the edges .
Sort of makes sense , right ?
Imagine a steak as a big bundle of straws , each straw filled with liquid , and representing the muscle fibers .
As the meat cooks , these straws start to change shape , becoming narrower , and putting pressure on the liquid inside .
Since the meat cooks from the outside in , the straws are pinched most tightly at their edges , and slightly less tightly in their center .
So far so good .
Logically , if the edges are pinched more tightly than the center , liquid should get forced towards the middle , right ?
Well here 's the problem : water is not compressible .
In other words , if you have a two - liter bottle filled to the brim with water , it is ( nearly ) physically impossible to force more water into that bottle without changing the size of that bottle .
Same thing with a steak .
Unless we are somehow stretching the centers of the muscle fibers to make them physically wider , there is no way to force more liquid into them .
You can easily prove that the muscle fibers are not getting wider by measuring the circumference around the center of a raw steak vs. a cooked one .
If liquid were being forced into the center , the circumference should grow .
It does n't — it may appear to bulge , but that is only because the edges shrink , giving the illusion of a wider center .
In fact , the exact opposite is the case .
Since the center of a medium - rare steak comes up to 125 °F , it too is shrinking , and forcing liquid out .
Where does all that liquid go ?
The only place it can : out of the end of the straws — or , the surface of the steak .
That sizzling noise you hear as a steak cooks ?
That 's the sound of moisture escaping and evaporating *.
* There are ways to minimize the shrinkage of muscle fibers , thus minimizing moisture loss , but that topic will be covered in a future Food Lab installment .
Give That Theory a Rest
So why does an un-rested steak expel more juices than a rested one ?
Turns out that it all has to do with temperature .
We already know that the width of the muscle fibers is directly related to the temperature to which it is cooked , and to a degree , this change in shape is irreversible .
A piece of meat that is cooked to 180 °F ( 82.2 °C ) will never be able to hold on to as much liquid as it could in its raw state .
But once that meat has cooled slightly , its structure relaxes — the muscle fibers widen up slightly again , and it's this small change in shape that makes all the difference .
This image shows six steaks of identical thickness that were all cooked to an internal temperature of 125 °F .
I sliced one steak open every 2.5 minutes and placed it on a plate to collect any juices that leaked out .
Here 's what 's going on :
After No Resting :
The meat around the exterior of the steak ( the parts that were closest to the pan ) are well over 200 °F ( 93.3°C ) .
At this temperature range , they are pinched tightly shut , preventing them from holding on to any moisture .
The center of the steak is at 125 °F .
While it can hold on to some of its juices at this temperature , cutting the meat fibers open is like slitting the side of a soda bottle : some juice might stay in there ( mostly through surface tension ) , but liquid is going to spill .

While it can hold on to some of its juices at this temperature , cutting the meat fibers open is like slitting the side of a soda bottle : some juice might stay in there ( mostly through surface tension ) , but liquid is going to spill .
After 5 Minutes of Resting :
The outermost layers of meat are down to around 145 °F ( 62.8 °C ) and the center of the steak is still at 125 °F .
At this stage , the muscle fibers have relaxed a bit , stretching open a little wider .
This stretching motion creates a pressure differential between the center of the muscle fiber and the ends , pulling some of the liquid out from the middle towards the edges .
As a result , there is less liquid in the center of the steak .
Cut it open now , and some of the liquid will still spill out , but far less than before .

After 10 Minutes of Resting :
The edges of the steak have cooled all the way down to around 125 °F , allowing them to suck up even more liquid from the center of the steak .
What 's more , the center of the steak has by this time cooled down to around 120 °F , causing it to widen slightly .
Cut the meat open at this stage , and the liquid will be so evenly and thinly distributed throughout the steak that surface tension is enough to keep it from spilling out on the plate .
The difference is dramatic .
Just take a look at these two steaks :
In the steak on the left , all those delicious succulent juices are all over the plate .
In the steak on the right , everything stays inside , right where it belongs .
But wait a minute — how do we know that those juices really are staying inside the rested steaks ?
Is it not possible that in the ten minutes that I 've allowed it to rest that the liquid has n't simply evaporated , leaving me with a steak that is equally un-moist ?
To prove this is not the case , all you need to do is weigh the steaks before and after cooking .
Aside from a minimal amount of weight loss due to rendered fat , the vast majority of weight loss comes from juices that are forced out of the meat .
The steak loses around 13 percent of its weight just during cooking .
Cut it open immediately , and you lose an additional nine percent .
But allow it to rest , and you can minimize this weight loss down to around an additional two percent .
Larger Meats
So that 's all well and good for steaks , but what about for larger cuts of meat , say a whole roasted pork loin , or a prime rib ?
Well , the same principles apply here too .
the main difference is they need to rest for longer .
How long ?
Well there are various rules of thumb : five minutes per inch of thickness , ten minutes per pound , half of the total cooking time , etc .
By far the easiest and most foolproof way to test if your meat has rested long enough is the same way you can tell if your meat is cooked properly : with a thermometer .
Ideally , no matter how well - done you 've cooked your meat , you want to allow it to cool down until the very center has reached 120 °F ( 49°C ) .
At this stage , the muscle fibers have relaxed enough that you should have no problem with losing juices .
As shown in the graph , In a 1.5 - inch - thick steak , this translates to around 10 minutes .
For a prime rib , this may take as long as 45 minutes .
Congratulations :
Your meat is now seven percent more delicious !

Asia is frequently lambasted as a source of low cost ' slave ' labor by skeptics .
The standard notion is that armies of Chinese communist automatons are building faulty plastic toys and copy - cat products , undercutting far more skilled , educated , and innovative Western workers .
While this belief may have had some basis over the last few decades , it 's hard time for a reality check .
Emerging Asia , which does n't include Japan , now has more skilled researchers than any other economic unit in the world , as shown in the chart below from Citi based on UNESCO data .
As you can see , Asia made great strides in increasing its share of skilled researchers from 2002 - 2007 .
They will make even larger ones going forward since education levels are rapidly improving .
Thus , we can easily imagine that Emerging Asia will be immensely competitive very soon -- it will have lower cost labor ( since many Asians are still moving up the wealth chain ) , but at the same time it will have tons of highly skilled , educated ( and yes wealthy ) people at the same time .
Asian industries are likely to be competitive both at the low - and high - end in the not too distant future .
Ouch .
P.S. And by the way , hiding from the global economy wo n't be a successful long - term solution here .
It would just mean that 10 - 20 years forward Emerging Asian competitiveness would be even stronger while American and European competitiveness would have gone nowhere .
Double Ouch .

The topic of “ facials ” can be almost as controversial as anal sex .
So , of course you know I HAVE to write about it !
😆
Seriously though , this topic has been danced around on a couple of different articles here , so I figured I might as well just go ahead and bring it out into the light for all to discuss .
If you ’re sitting there wondering if I ’m talking about what you think I ’m talking about , then yes , I ’m talking about your husband ejaculating on your face .
There are no doubt many of you sitting there reading this article thinking “ Eeeww . ”
That ’s not an uncommon response .
I know that the thoughts of allowing your husband to finish on your face may not be the most romantic thing .
It ’s perfectly fine to say that you are n’t interested in that type of sexual play or that that specific act crosses a boundary for you .
We are simply discussing one activity , out of hundreds of things , which a couple can share together .
I ’ve read a couple of different sites that suggest semen as a great facial moisturizer .
I ’ve also read reports that say semen can tighten your pores / skin , helping to fight against wrinkles .
There could be a little truth to that .
I know from personal experience that if you leave it on your face it dries out much like egg whites .
It pulls your skin tighter & firmer .
But whatever firmness it seems to give you is all washed away when you shower .
So I do n’t really think that husbands will be able to use the line , “ Want younger looking skin ? ” 😎
To those of you who feel like this is strictly a porn activity .
Let me just say here that if any activity makes you think of pornography , or gives you flashbacks to pornographic images , then it ’s probably not a good idea to continue with that activity .
That being said , if you and your husband would like to experiment with this then you should feel free to do so , without guilt over whether or not this activity is done in pornographic movies .
( Let me remind you all that they also kiss and fondle and have intercourse in those movies too , so should we just stop having sex with our spouse altogether ? )
This subject has also been discussed on other marital forums such as TMB .
What has been interesting to me is to hear from the couples themselves as to why they like doing this .
Here is a quote from one man : “ I love that my wife is so easygoing and playful .
She is almost always willing to let me finish on her face when I ask to ( except when she has plans to go out somewhere and does n’t want her make up messed up ! )
For me , I love the visual of seeing my wife with her mouth open , trying to catch my come in her mouth .
And then I see it running down the sides of her mouth and chin .
I always aim for her mouth because one time it shot up her nose on accident and she snorted and we both got to laughing so hard !
So we try to not have that happen again ! ”
And here is a quote from a woman who engages in this activity with her husband : “ My husband knows that I want to please him in every way possible .
Although it does n’t happen often , when he asks me if he can go on my face , I usually say yes .
We will get him almost there by using oral or PIV and then I ’ll get into position .
I always make eye contact with him and smile really big to let him know that I ’m ready for him .
He ’ll smile back at me .
Sometimes I ’ll even talk to him at this point and tell him that I can’t wait to taste / feel his come on me .
When we ’re finished he always cleans me up himself with a washcloth and tells me how blessed he feels to have me as his wife . ”
So yes , there are actually couples who do this and like it .
I think that it probably depends on many different variables in the couple ’s life , including but not limited to : past sexual abuse , past sexual partners , past or current porn use , personal convictions , tolerance levels , openness , attitudes , level of trust in the relationship , vulnerability , etc .
I do n’t think there is any one thing that makes this activity okay or not , but rather a conglomerate of things .
If my husband had a history of making me feel cheap or degraded , then I do n’t believe I would entertain this idea at all .
If I knew that this was an activity he used to love to do with his ex wife , then I may not want to do it either .
If I knew that deep down I was disgusted with the thoughts of having my husband ’s semen all over me , then again , I would probably say no .
However , if we had a very open and trusting relationship with no issues of past partners , and we were both very playful and eager to try new things together , then I may entertain the idea of trying this once to see how it goes .
Just for the record ( if you have n’t already guessed ) we have indeed tried this in my marriage .
Let me go ahead and warn you that if you do decide to try this with your husband , make sure you tell him to please do not aim anywhere near your eyes !
Let ’s just say that one shot of that stuff will give you a blood shot eye for HOURS , and everyone around you will wonder if you ’ve got a hang over or something !
Yeah , try explaining that one ! 😳

Bipartisan Spring
Unnoticed amid the sniping inWashington over health care and the wailing about " broken government , " a broad and durable bipartisan consensus has begun falling into place in one unlikely area : foreign policy .
Consider the fact that on Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran — the most difficult , expensive , and potentially dangerous foreign challenges facing the United States — precious little now separates Barack Obama from most Republican leaders in and out of Congress .
Compared with recent decades , this much bipartisan agreement is remarkable .
Never mind the last divisive years of George W. Bush ’s administration , or the Bill Clinton years , when Republicans attacked the president even when he was bombing suspected terrorist sites in Sudan .
Democrats now wax nostalgic for the days of George H.W. Bush , forgetting that they attacked his administration across the board — for coddling China , fiddling while the Balkans burned , paying too much attention to foreign policy , and spending too much on defense .
And on the most important question of war and peace , they voted overwhelmingly against the first Gulf War .
Today , by contrast , a substantial majority of Republicans have supported President Obama ’s troop surge in Afghanistan .
Both the administration and the Republican opposition are committed to a stable , increasingly democratic Iraq .
Vice President Joseph Biden ’s recent remarks claiming Iraq as Obama ’s success may have annoyed Republicans , but it is good news : the most divisive issue since the Vietnam War has become politically uncontroversial .
On Iran , differences are rapidly narrowing now that engagement is giving way to pressure .
Republicans may complain , along with many Democrats , that the administration has been too slow to support the Iranian opposition and took too long to pivot to sanctions .
Yet some also realize that Obama ’s prolonged effort at engagement accomplished what George W. Bush never could : convincing most of the world , and most Democrats , that Iran is uninterested in any deal that threatens its nuclear weapons program .
As a result , France , Britain , and even Germany appear more determined than at any time in the past decade to impose meaningful sanctions .
A majority of Republicans , along with most Democrats , will support the administration as it toughens its approach to what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton now calls the " military dictatorship " in Tehran .
Partisan divisiveness will return only if the administration backs down from its own stated objectives .
These are pretty substantial areas of agreement .
There will still be plenty of carping by Republicans , of course , especially on terrorism and homeland security .
Perfect bipartisanship on foreign and defense policy is a lot to ask in an election year .
It is n’t even desirable because all administrations benefit to some degree from opposition critiques .
But by any reasonable reckoning , foreign policy is one area where the government is working — in the sense that the administration and opposition have been able to join together in common purpose on some of the day ’s most pressing issues .
How to explain this surprising if well - concealed comity ?
Some is due to the inevitable transformation that every party goes through when it moves from the opposition to the White House .
Being in power tends to breed responsibility , just as being out of power breeds irresponsibility .
Many Republicans during the Clinton years turned toward quasi-isolationism and opposed Clinton ’s policies — even his hawkish policies — simply because they hated Clinton .
Many Democrats showed great solidarity with Bush after September 11 , 2001 — a bipartisan moment that Bush helped squander .
But they soon came to oppose almost everything Bush did , even policies traditionally associated with the Democratic Party , such as democracy promotion and nation - building , and even when , as in the case of the surge in Iraq , the most likely beneficiary of success would be a Democratic president .
The Obama administration took office guided by the philosophy that whatever Bush did , it should do the opposite , and this policy of " un-Bush " dominated the first months , just as the policy of " un-Clinton " persisted even longer in the Bush administration .
But in both cases , " un - " policies eventually proved ineffective and no substitute for serious thinking .
On most issues , the Obama administration is now pursuing approaches closer to those of both Clinton and Bush than to those favored by the virulently anti-Bush partisans .
This is only natural because neither U.S. interests nor those of other countries change with the American electoral cycle .
The Democratic left , which seized the commanding heights of the public discourse during the party ’s period of irresponsibility , has predictably been relegated to the sidelines now that the Democrats control the White House and actually have responsibility for the country ’s well - being in a difficult world .
What about the Republicans , now that they are back in opposition ?
The desire to discredit and destroy Obama certainly fires Republican passions , and this desire has manifested itself on some national security issues , notably Obama ’s approach to the treatment of captured terrorists .
Republicans think that the administration ’s mishandling of the Christmas Day bomber helped Republican Scott Brown win the U.S. senate race in Massachusetts and that painting Obama as soft on terrorism will give them an advantage in coming elections .
But this partisan strategy has not bled over into other big foreign - policy issues .
On Afghanistan , Iraq , and increasingly on Iran , Republicans have held their fire and offered public support for the president ’s decisions .
This is partly because Obama has moved closer to their positions .
But it is also because Republicans are committed to success in Iraq and Afghanistan , genuinely fear a nuclear Iran , and for the most part are willing to abjure playing politics with those issues .
They are so far proving a more loyal opposition in this regard than were many Democrats during Bush ’s second term .
There are also larger forces at work shoring up this bipartisan consensus .
Above all there are the lingering effects of the September 11 attacks on the American psyche .
The continuing national anxiety about what most Americans still perceive as a dangerous world puts distinct limits on how far the administration and its opposition can depart from a stance that is both hawkish and internationalist .
Republicans understand this instinctively because they were in power for the first seven years after the September 11 attacks .
The Obama administration has now learned it , too .
As part of their initial " un-Bush " approach , Obama officials celebrated their abandonment of the " war on terror , " seen as a Bush - era mistake , and rhetorically at least , allowed the perception to develop that they placed more emphasis on righting legal wrongs done to captured terrorist suspects than on stopping terrorist attacks .
This gave Republicans a big target , and they have been dutifully firing away and scoring some direct hits on the proposed trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York , the unclear plans for the Guantánamo Bay prison , and the administration ’s mishandling of the Christmas Day bomber .
The irony is that in some ways Obama has been fighting the war on terror at least as vigorously as his predecessor .
He escalated the war in Afghanistan .
He greatly increased drone attacks on suspected terrorists in Pakistan .
Indeed , the Obama administration carried out more drone strikes in its first year than the Bush administration carried out in the previous five years combined , producing a record number of enemy casualties .
Although the Obama administration may be more generous in providing legal defense to captured terrorists than the Bush administration , it also makes a greater effort to assassinate them , thus obviating the need for trials .
For a while , this tough record was obscured by the administration ’s own soft rhetoric and softer policies toward captured terrorists .
But the administration has been compelled — by criticism from both parties — to shift toward a tougher public line .
Guantánamo remains open , and might stay open for the remainder of Obama ’s presidency .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will probably not be tried in New York .
After the attempted Christmas Day bombing , citizens from certain Muslim countries have been put on a watch list .
The USA Patriot Act has been renewed .
And we are likely to see more terrorists tried in military courts .
No president , no matter how liberal , can allow himself to be perceived as trading any degree of U.S. security to better protect the rights of suspected terrorists .
Even Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt , the most progressive U.S. presidents , far more egregiously impinged on individual rights — of German - Americans and anti-war socialists during World War I , and of Japanese - Americans during World War II — when perceived security interests were at stake .
One suspects Obama will not knowingly give the Republicans any more ammunition on this issue , which means that a bipartisan consensus even on the handling of suspected terrorists might be closer than many imagine .
But the president also cannot afford to appear weak on broader foreign and defense policies in an international environment that a majority of Americans consider threatening .
This has had ramifications not only for how he approaches the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq , but also for how he deals with Iran , and indeed , how he deals with any country deemed hostile or challenging to the United States , including , at times , China and Russia .
For the first year of his presidency , Obama generally placed improved relations with Moscow and Beijing ahead of most other considerations , including tending to nervous allies in Europe and India .
But it will be interesting to see what happens if these efforts to engage Russia and China do n’t bear fruit .
Here , too , a course adjustment might not be far off .
For Republicans , meanwhile , the ongoing effect of the September 11 attacks has been to check the isolationist tendencies that have periodically flared up in the party since the 1920s .
Conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan had a following in the early 1990s after the Soviet Union ’s collapse , when few Americans could see any overseas dangers .
But isolationism has not had a viable champion in the Republican Party since 9/11 .
Most Americans today simply do n’t believe there is safety to be found in a Fortress America .
The fact that deadly attacks can be hatched in faraway places , including in failed states that many Americans can’t find on a map , has discredited even more temperate calls for a retrenchment of U.S. overseas involvement .
Republicans are more interventionist today than they were a decade ago .
In 2000 , Condoleezza Rice , then candidate George W. Bush ’s top foreign - policy advisor , spoke for many Republicans when she denigrated " nation - building " and complained that the 82nd Airborne should not be used to help Bosnian kids get to school .
Today most Republicans support manpower - intensive counterinsurgency strategies that include nation - building in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The difference is 9/11 .
U.S. foreign policy has been broadly consistent for most of the past two centuries , of course , driven on the one hand by Americans ’ universalist ideology and belief in their country ’s special role — " our cause is the cause of all mankind , " as Benjamin Franklin put it — as well as by , on the other hand , their willingness to amass and use power .
There have been times when Obama appeared to want to depart from this tradition .
His early speeches and statements , in Cairo and Latin America — what conservative critics derided as his " apology tour " — did appear to disown not only the less savory aspects of America ’s historical world role but perhaps even the role itself .
By the time of his Nobel lecture in December , however , Obama was reaching again for the idiom of Democratic presidents from Harry Truman to John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton , extolling the special role of the United States , and of American power , in making the world a better and safer place .
He spoke of America ’s central role in helping " underwrite global security " with " the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms " since World War II .
He rejected the " false suggestion " that freedom and democracy " are somehow Western principles , foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation ’s development . "
And he bluntly declared that " Evil does exist in the world " and can neither be negotiated with nor appeased .
Obama had used such language before .
In the spring of 2007 , candidate Obama had also employed the rhetoric of American exceptionalism , declaring , à la Kennedy , that the United States must be the " leader of the free world " and lead the way " in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good , " and insisting that America ’s " larger purpose in the world is to promote the spread of freedom . "
But then that rhetoric was dropped .
Perhaps as the campaign developed and the need arose to distinguish Obama not only from Bush but also from candidate Hillary Clinton , the leftist critique was more useful , for that critique really encompassed the Clinton years as well as the Bush years .
Bill Clinton , after all , actively promoted democracy , often spoke and acted in terms of American exceptionalism — the " indispensable nation , " as his second - term secretary of state put it — and began the confrontation with Iraq , even bombing it .
This traditional Democratic interventionist hawkishness was married to an equally enduring Democratic tradition of idealistic globalism and institution - building ; it encompassed the use of force and arms control , " democratic enlargement , " and combating climate change .
Are we seeing a return to this approach now ?
The leftover campaign fight between the Obama and Clinton camps is the one discernible fault line in this administration and is generally thought to be strictly about personalities , not policy .
But has there perhaps been some policy content in the disputes after all ?
It is interesting to watch Secretary Clinton now seize the role of isolating , pressuring , and even demonizing Iran ’s rulers .
One wonders if Obama loyalists in the administration have been reluctant to acknowledge or perhaps even permit a readjustment of the president ’s foreign policy in a direction that could be interpreted as Clintonian .
Now that resistance seems to be fading , at least on some issues .
If so , we may be seeing the re-establishment of the informal and unspoken alliance between liberal interventionist Democrats and hawkish internationalist Republicans that provided working majorities throughout much of the Cold War and again during the Clinton years .
This coalition supported Clinton ’s policies in the Balkans , NATO enlargement , a " Europe whole and free , " and the strategy of democratic enlargement more generally .
It seems like ancient history now , but there was a time in the late 1990s when Republican Sen .
John McCain was a Democratic administration ’s most important ally — the leader , along with people like Joe Biden , of the coalition that held firm on Kosovo while many Republicans and some Democrats bolted .
That same coalition also supported confrontation and eventually war with Iraq , of course , which is what led to the coalition ’s unraveling .
In 2002 , Senators Hillary Clinton , Joseph Biden , John Edwards , and John Kerry all voted for the resolution authorizing the war , along with many other Democrats .
Nor did this seem at all strange at the time .
Clinton and Biden , along with Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman , were leaders of a liberal interventionist wing of the Democratic Party that had supported intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo , as well as the sanctioning and bombing of Iraq .
The Clinton era resurrected the hawkish Democratic liberalism of Truman and Dean Acheson , two decades after its burial in the swamp of Vietnam .
But just as Vietnam broke up the Democratic anti-communist establishment , so Iraq discredited Democratic liberal interventionism .
By 2005 , it had become difficult if not impossible for these Democrats to survive in their party without reinventing themselves .
Biden , after spending years pleading for more troops for Iraq , opposed the surge in 2007 .
But now , three years later , Biden is once again taking ownership of Iraq , a signal that the pendulum might be swinging back again .
This shift is epitomized by the long , strange trip of Lieberman , Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000 , ejected from the party in 2006 , now a critical Senate swing vote on so many issues both foreign and domestic , and central to the bipartisan coalition that has spearheaded support for the president on Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran .
That bipartisan consensus can be deepened and expanded to encompass much wider swaths of U.S. foreign policy beyond fighting terrorism and confronting Iran .
There is strong bipartisan support for a firmer stand toward China , for instance , a direction the Obama administration may already be taking .
But there is also support for closer ties to India , which the Obama administration has neglected .
In Europe , the administration needs to adjust its excessive tilt toward Russia , which has come at the expense of insecurity and feelings of abandonment in Eastern and Central Europe .
Ironically , given the media ’s caricature of them , it is the coalition of hawkish internationalist Republicans and Democrats that remains the most eager for close relations with America ’s European allies .
A Russia policy that better balanced engagement with a more visible commitment to defend the United States ’ allies and partners from Russian bullying would have very wide support in both parties .
It could even facilitate passage of a follow - on agreement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) , which is currently hampered by , among other things , the perception of administration overeagerness .
Of course , Republicans would then have an obligation to pass a new START agreement and not seize on it as an opportunity to deal the president a legislative defeat .
Finally , there is the question of promoting democracy .
The most absurd of the " un-Bush " policies of this administration has been its deliberate turn away from helping democrats against autocracies abroad .
The joke is that , despite all the rhetoric , Bush did precious little of that , especially in the last few years .
But there are signs of a shift here as well .
Now that Secretary Clinton is condemning Iran ’s " military dictatorship , " she could also take a stronger stand for political reform in countries like Egypt .
The administration could make support for democracy a bigger part of its policies toward Russia and China , both of which have amply demonstrated how unreliable autocracies are as international partners .
Nothing would do more to cement bipartisan support for Obama ’s foreign policies than a return to this old American tradition of making the world safer for democracy .
Obama therefore has a chance to place himself at the head of a renewed foreign policy tradition that enjoys broad support .
But the rebirth of the bipartisan consensus can easily be aborted by foolish or wrongheaded behavior on both sides .
Obama will have to leave his party ’s left wing behind , and perhaps some of his own predilections .
Republicans , meanwhile , will have to restrain a tendency to see in Obama ’s every action some betrayal of U.S. security , even when his policies , if not his rhetoric , move in the right direction .
There is nothing inherently virtuous about bipartisanship , of course .
Its desirability and its frequency are usually exaggerated — the most vicious partisan battles over foreign policy were fought by the founding fathers .
However , there are times when it is both possible and necessary .
Republican support for Harry Truman ’s policies was important , if short - lived .
Today , when America ’s ability to lead is being questioned at home and abroad , bipartisan unity on the major issues of foreign and defense policy will strengthen America in its dealings with both friends and adversaries .
Despite what the declinists believe , and thanks in part to Obama ’s election and the behavior of Iran , China , and Russia , more and more people around the world are looking to the United States to play that role again .
Thanks to enthusiastic World of Warcraft players shelling out a couple bucks apiece for an in - game Pandaren Monk pet , Blizzard just wrote a check for over a million dollars to the Make - A - Wish foundation .
The company made good on its promise to send half of its profits on vanity pet sales to charity yesterday , February 16th , at a ceremony involving 15 wish children at its enormous fenced compound in Irvine , CA .
“ We 've had a long relationship with the Make - A - Wish Foundation , and we 're proud to support the priceless work they do for children , ” said Mike Morhaime , Blizzard CEO and co-founder .
“ This donation also reflects the spirit and generosity of our players – their enthusiasm for World of Warcraft and for supporting a good cause made this possible . ”
If we 're going to be nickel - and - dimed for virtual items , we 're all for it going to a good cause .
Now if Blizzard would just make a donation to the United Way using a part of its general WoW profits , we can pretend that we 're grinding faction for charity .

MINNEAPOLIS --
The Minnesota
Twins suddenly have a glaring concern about closing games for the first time since Joe Nathan took over in 2004 .
Tests on Nathan 's right throwing elbow have revealed a significant tear in the ulnar collateral ligament , an injury that could require season - ending Tommy John surgery .
Nathan 's 246 saves over six seasons are the most in the majors during that span .
The Twins shared the grim news Tuesday in Fort Myers , Fla. , before their exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals .
General manager Bill Smith said the plan is to first give Nathan time to let soreness and swelling subside -- and build strength in the muscles around the joint -- before a final decision about surgery .
In the meantime , a second opinion will be sought from Dr. James Andrews , the noted surgeon who removed bone spurs and chips from the elbow in October .
The ulnar collateral ligament is replaced in the Tommy John procedure , which typically takes 12 to 18 months to recover from .
The Twins are looking at the strong possibility of a season without closer Joe Nathan , right .

Nathan will try to pitch again in two weeks .
If he can 't , the four - time All - Star will have surgery .
His season then would almost certainly be over , perhaps putting his status for next year in question , too .
An emotional Nathan said he 's prepared to try to pitch through pain .
" If I 'm able to go out there and throw , then I 'll definitely give it a shot , " Nathan told reporters in Fort Myers .
" The only reason that I would get a surgery done is if I 'm just unable to go out there . "
It is possible to pitch through the injury .
" I could be one of those guys .
I might not be , " Nathan said .
But if his elbow hurts like it did on Saturday , when he first felt discomfort and was removed from an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox ?
" Then there 's just no chance , " Nathan said .
Nathan and the Twins initially believed this weekend he was just dealing with general stiffness and soreness .
He flew to Minnesota to meet with team physician Dr. Dan Buss on Monday .
Babies can discern a voice 's emotional state by 7 months old , and they use adult - like mental processes to do it , suggests a new study .
The finding underscores the evolutionary importance of emotional communication -- " survival of the fittest " could , in part , be survival of the best empathizer .
Previous research has shown that babies develop sound preferences before they are even born .
Newborns as young as a couple days old prefer voices to random sounds , and can distinguish their own mother 's voice from that of another female's .
But the tactics of newborns are different than the mental processes used by adults , said the current study 's lead researcher Tobias Grossmann of Birkbeck College in London working in collaboration with colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany .
Newborns use the " baby teeth " of the brain to process sound until adult tools develop .
Hearing voices
To determine when adult processes come into use , researchers examined infants 4 and 7 months of age .
The babies sat on their caregivers ' laps in a dim room , while audio clips of voices and non-vocal sounds were played over a loudspeaker .
With the help of a comfy and technologically cutting - edge hat , their brains were monitored with near - infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , a non-invasive technique that measures the amount of oxygen being used by different areas of the brain .
Just as legs need more oxygen when running , areas of the brain increase their oxygen intake when exercising by , say , processing a sound .
NIRS captures these changes in oxygen concentration in a localized manner , allowing researchers to see which brain region is doing the work .
The brains of the 7 - month - old infants , but not those of the 4 - month - olds , responded to voice clips like adult brains , using the same regions of the brain as adults .
This suggests that between 4 and 7 months , adult - like processes for attending voices start taking over , Grossmann said .
Baby talk
Next , the researchers added emotion to the vocal clips by using strings of emotionally - loaded words said with inflection .
Again , the older infant brains reacted like adult brains .
A small region within the temporal lobe , which is associated with hearing , responded more strongly to furious voices than any other sound .
But the frontal cortex , which is involved with higher - order functions such as decision - making and planning , was more attuned to joyful tones than angry ones .
" Happy speech may be processed deeper than other types of speech , " Grossmann said .
The finding might give insight into the value of baby talk , also called " motherese , " suggest the researchers .
Motherese , when compared with adult conversation , is generally slow in tempo , rises and falls in pitch and , most importantly for this study , has cheery inflections .
Motherese has previously been found to aid an infant 's mental development , especially the learning of language .
" A happy tone of voice does something special to the baby 's brain , " Grossman said .
The ability to prioritize sounds of both rage and joy was likely selected for by evolution .
Anger signals a potential threat , while attending to friendly voices might help us learn about the world , form attachments and find advantages in relatively stable conditions , Grossmann said .
More research is needed to firmly link the brain responses measured in this study to behavior , he noted .
Being able to discern emotions , he said , " may have enabled the development of more sophisticated social processes . "
And it was likely critical to our success as a species .
The study is detailed in the March 25 issue of the journal Neuron .
He added : " Christ guides us towards goodness and does not let us be disarmed by ingratitude . "
He also spoke of how man can sometimes " fall to the lowest , vulgar levels " and " sink into the swamp of sin and dishonesty " .
Adesso è informazione consolidata e veritiera : tramite i canali ufficiali su Facebook e Twitter , infatti , NVidia rende noti i primi dettagli sulle nuove soluzioni grafiche next - gen basate su architettura NVidia Fermi .
Le prime VGA si chiameranno Nvidia GTX 470 e GTX 480 .
Risale a pochi giorni fa l'annuncio di NVidia sulle ultime novità inerenti l'architettura Fermi .
Nessun comunicato stampa ufficiale , solamente piccoli " piece of info " sugli account ufficiali Facebook e Twitter .
Stando infatti al post inserito su quest ' ultimo social network , infatti , emerge quanto segue :
<< Fun Fact of the Week : GeForce GTX 480 and GeForce GTX 470 will be the names of the first two GPUs shipped based on our new GF100 chip ! >>
Frase scritta dall ' account NVIDIAGeForce , che NVidia ha confermato essere al 100 % ufficiale .
Pochi i dettagli , ma perlomeno ci sono : risulta ovvio che NVidia preme per contrastare la soluzione HD5890 di ATI che attualmente regna sovrana nel segmento high - end del mercato delle schede video .
A partire da fine marzo assisteremo dunque al debutto di GeForce GTX 480 e GTX 470 , che integreranno 512 e 488 core Cuda rispettivamente .
Si tratta chiaramente di soluzioni top con supporto completo alle DirectX 11 ed integranti un memory bus da 384 e 320 bit di ampiezza rispettivamente .
La memoria GDDDR5 onboard raggiungerà quantitativi di 1,28 e 1,5 GB .
Torniamo a parlare di nomenclatura .
NVidia ha lanciato la serie 300 lo scorso anno ( modello GeForce 310 ) che in realtà era solamente un " distintivo OEM " della GeForce 210 .
In futuro , insieme alle nuove soluzioni 400 , NVidia potrebbe popolare anche la serie 300 con prodotti derivanti dalla GF100 , così come la serie 200 offre un mix di prodotti compatibili con DirectX 10 e 10.1 .
Per questo motivo hanno fatto comparsa sul web i nomi GTX 380 e GTX 360 , ancora da confermare .
Al momento non sono reperibili ulteriori informazioni da NVidia , neppure frequenze di clock o altri parametri che identificano una scheda in termini di prestazioni .
On the origin of the family
Marco Francesconi , Christian Ghiglino , Motty Perry
Why do people form long - lasting marital unions ?
This column presents new insights on what makes a family stick together .
Families dominate more promiscuous pairs , in the sense that they can achieve greater survivorship and enhanced genetic fitness .
The column suggests that this might provide an evolutionary explanation for the origin of religion as an institution to protect the family .
Why do humans live in families ?
The fact that only 3 % of avian and mammal species are known to be familial suggests that the emergence of the family cannot be taken for granted , even among humans ( Emlen 1995 ) .
Divorce is a common feature of modern life and non-traditional family structures are growing more common .
Families matter to economic policy .
In many nations , government policy takes explicit account of families in tax policies , welfare policies , housing policies , and pension allocations .
In many universities , family incomes affect eligibility for student aid .
Research consistently shows that family structure can affect children ’s lifetime performance .
Recently , the British Conservative Party suggested a tax break for as an effort to stop marriages from faltering .
What is a family ?
By family , we mean a “ fidelity family ” , which is any environment in which all the children share – and are raised by – the same parents .
Since families dominate human society over time and across cultures , it seems obvious that there must be something very powerful and very general promoting this particular form of social organisation .
One obvious explanation is the advantages of economies of scale .
But this explanation encounters problems since families thrive in across very different forms of economic activity .
Families are the dominate forms for people engaged in everything from hunting and gathering to investment banking .
Perhaps there is something deeper behind the family , something based on evolution .
Modelling the dominance of the family
In recent research ( Francesconi et al. 2010 ) , we address such questions within a simple framework .
We build on Hamilton ( 1964 ) suggesting males and females only care for the survivorship and propagation of their own genes , and there are no economies of scale associated with the family .
Two further assumptions are crucial :
Paternity is uncertain and males must resort to guard their opposite - sex mate if they wish to increase confidence in their being the biological parent of the children they feed , and
There are overlapping cohorts of dependent children ; at each point in time parents need to provide resources to successive generations of offspring .
Our model can be illustrated as follows .
Imagine two ancestral villages in which men and women plan to have more than one child and must choose the partner with whom they breed .
In both villages , there is full intra-household labour specialisation , with food being supplied by males and child rearing by females .
The two villages , however , are different in the sense that in one village an individual has all his or her children with the same partner in a stable family grouping , while in the other village an individual begets each child with a different partner in a “ promiscuous ” relationship .
In which of the two villages do men and women achieve greater fitness ?
Notice that , regardless of where they live , males will have to guard as well as to provide food twice .
That is , we impose neither economies of scale in food production nor a more efficient technology of guarding in association with a specific family configuration .
Our analysis indicates that the fidelity - based family dominates the promiscuous pair bonding , that is , the former can attain a higher probability of survival than the latter .
This result is driven by the fact that , in the promiscuous village , a male shares the responsibility of supporting his own children with another male , and thus ends up free riding on this other male 's food provision .
He , instead , devotes more of his time to guarding , increasing his paternity confidence .
But since every promiscuous male follows the same strategy and guarding is socially unproductive , children in promiscuous families receive less food and are less likely to survive than children in fidelity families , and therefore the ( population ) growth in the promiscuous village is bound to be lower .
When the notion of the family is extended to a more general context , in which kinship ties are accounted for , we find that food transfers from older to younger siblings enhance individual and societal fitness , because older males shift time from the unproductive activity of guarding towards greater food provision that is meant to support their younger siblings .
Moreover , such a fitness gain can only materialise in the context of the family and not in the context of the promiscuous pair bonding .
In an environment in which paternity is uncertain , two individuals who are highly confident that they share the same mother are likely to be genetically closer to each other than to their own offspring .
Essential to our theory is the notion that mate - guarding by males is unavoidable when fatherhood is uncertain , even though from society 's viewpoint it is a complete waste .
Therefore , any social “ institution ” that can , in equilibrium , reduce guarding will lead to a fitness gain at the individual level as well as at the group ( or society ) level .
One of such institutions is religious beliefs and norms that put the fidelity family at centre stage .
This reasoning will allow us to underpin why virtually all major world religions stress the role of the fidelity family – and , more specifically , marriage – as avoidance of casual sex .
Our research illustrates the extent to which family - centred religious beliefs can become a successful adaptation ( Wilson 2002 ) and deliver a more efficient equilibrium .
What are the implications ?
One important implication of this analysis is offered by the observation that the promiscuous family in our model shares a number of features with the contemporary “ blended ” family described in Ginther and Pollak ( 2004 ) .
Like our promiscuous partnership , the blended family is characterised by stepchildren ( born from an earlier marital union ) living together with their half - siblings who are the joint children from an ongoing union .
A vast empirical literature has documented that experience of life in a blended family is associated with unfavourable child outcomes ( e.g. , Duncan and Brooks - Gunn 1997 ) .
Such poorer outcomes are explained by a variety of mechanisms , including parental stress and family conflict after separation and remarriage , inferior maternal time allocation within blended families , and economic hardship allowing family disruption .
Our model instead suggests an explanation based on the free - riding over resources given to children by the first and the second father figures ; males in promiscuous unions undersupply resources to their children , while seeking to free - ride on each others ' provisions .
Related to this issue , future research may focus on the increasing importance of mothers ' contribution to household resources .
This will open up new avenues of analysis within the economics of the family .
Another implication of the model is related to the idea that norms and religious beliefs that are centred on the fidelity family can be seen as a successful group - level adaptation .
Societies which adopt a belief system that supports the family are likely to outgrow otherwise comparable societies that do not .
Our analysis predicts that , in societies with strong family - based religious norms , the family will be the dominant form of family life , whereas in societies in which family - centred norms are weak or not enforced , the fidelity family is expected to coexist with other family types .
It may not be a coincidence that virtually all the surviving world religions emphasise the centrality of the family .
It will be interesting to see whether or not the family continues to have evolutionary advantages over other forms of mating when religious beliefs are weak and fatherhood uncertainty can be at least partially resolved through DNA paternity testing .
This extension will have consequences for scientific studies of religions .
Moreover , in a world with perfect food storage ( as we have assumed in our analysis ) , parents can easily secure their youngest ( still needy ) offspring full access to resources even after their death .
But if food storage were not perfect , then this security is not automatic and parents will have to resort to other forms of intergenerational transfers .
One of such forms is extended kin ties .
When storage is impractical or impossible , parents will have to rely on kin transfers for the survivorship of their own non-adult offspring , and the food substitution from parents to kin will be complete .
The notion of kinship here should be fairly broad and , besides own children , future extensions could include other related kin , such as uncles and cousins .
This extension will lead to a new interesting interaction between economics and anthropology .
Finally , future work may also focus on other systems of parent - child transfers , which rely on goods that either are easier to store than food or can be bequeathed , and may or may not require support from kin other than own offspring .
An example is fiat money , i.e. , any object with no intrinsic value ( such as a collection of pieces of paper or certain types of seashells ) that can be used only as a medium of exchange ( Kiyotaki and Wright 1989 ) .
An extension concerned with fiat money will have to deal with the possibility of saving , as distinct from the ( in ) ability of storing resources , as well as with strategic interactions between elderly parents and adult children ( Lundberg and Pollak 2007 ) .
The presence of money may allow us to address new substantive questions by examining , for instance , the extent to which money reduces the need for parents to rely on extended kinship systems to transfer resources to their offspring .

" A female combat soldier needs to prove more … a female soldier who beats up others is a serious fighter … when I arrived there was another female there with me , she was there before me…everyone spoke of how impressive she is because she humiliates Arabs without any problem .
That was the indicator .
You have to see her , the way she humiliates , the way she slaps them , wow , she really slapped that guy . "
The Breaking the Silence organization on Friday released a booklet of testimonies by female soldiers recounting various abuse cases involving Palestinians in the West Bank .
Remnants of War Soldiers say received orders to shoot first , worry later in Gaza war Reuters Breaking the Silence activist group presents report of testimonies from Gaza offensive in which soldiers say destruction , civilian casualties were direct result of IDF policy .
Army : Testimonies are general , anonymous , and unreliable Soldiers say received orders to shoot first , worry later in Gaza war
According to the latest testimonies , many of these young women have trouble coping with the violent reality they are exposed to and find themselves facing situations that contradict their values .
Some of them end up engaging in acts , or turning a blind eye to acts , that will burden them years later .
Like their male counterparts , some of these females have a need to speak about what they saw .
" The girls have greater difficulties in telling the story , because they 're the minority to begin with " the organization 's director Dana Golan says .
' Each soldier would give them a pet '
In the framework of the latest project , Breaking the Silence gathered the testimonies of more than 50 female soldiers who served in various posts in the territories .
Ynet presents some of the highlights in this report .
Golan noted that female soldiers were not more sensitive to the Palestinians than their male comrades .
" We discovered that the girls try to be even more violent and brutal than the boys , just to become one of the guys , " she said .

A female Seam Line Border Guard spoke of the chase after illegal aliens : " In half an hour you can catch 30 people without any effort . "
Then comes the question of what should be done with those who were caught – including women , children , and elderly .
" They would have them stand , and there 's the well - known Border Guard song ( in Arabic ) : ' One hummus , one bean , I love the Border Guard ' – they would make them sing this .
Sing , and jump .
Just like they do with recruits …
The same thing only much worse .
And if one of them would laugh , or if they would decide someone was laughing , they would punch him .
Why did you laugh ?
Smack …
It could go on for hours , depending on how bored they are .
A shift is eight hours long , the times must be passed somehow . "
Most of the female soldiers say that they sensed there was a problem during their service , but did nothing .
Another female soldier 's testimony , who served at the Erez checkpoint , indicates how violence was deeply rooted in the daily routine : " There was a procedure in which before you release a Palestinian back into the Strip – you take him inside the tent and beat him . "
That was a procedure ?
" Yes , together with the commanders . "
How long did it last ?
" Not very long ; within 20 minutes they would be back in the base , but the soldiers would stop at the post to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes while the guys from the command post would beat them up . "
This happened with every illegal alien ?
" There were n't that many ... it's not something you do everyday , but sort of a procedure .
I do n't know if they strictly enforced it each and every time ... it took me a while to realize that if I release an illegal alien on my end , by the time he gets back to Gaza he will go through hell ... two or three hours can pass by the time he gets into the Strip .
In the case of the kid , it was a whole night .
That 's insane , since it 's a ten minute walk .
They would stop them on their way ; each soldier would give them a ' pet ' , including the commanders . "
' Child 's hand broken on the chair '
A female soldier in Sachlav Military Police unit , stationed in Hebron , recalled a Palestinian child that would systematically provoke the soldiers by hurling stones at them and other such actions .
One time he even managed to scare a soldier who fell from his post and broke his leg .
Retaliation came soon after : " I do n't know who or how , but I know that two of our soldiers put him in a jeep , and that two weeks later the kid was walking around with casts on both arms and legs … they talked about it in the unit quite a lot – about how they sat him down and put his hand on the chair and simply broke it right there on the chair . "
Even small children did not escape arbitrary acts of violence , said a Border Guard female officer serving near the separation fence : " We caught a five - year - old … ca n't remember what he did …we were taking him back to the territories or something , and the officers just picked him up , slapped him around and put him in the jeep .
The kid was crying and the officer next to me said ' do n't cry ' and started laughing at him .
Finally the kid cracked a smile – and suddenly the officer gave him a punch in the stomach .
Why ?
' Do n't laugh in my face ' he said . "
' Palestinian beaten before being released to Strip ' ( Photo : AFP )
Was there also abuse of women ?
" Yes " the same soldier replied .
" Slaps , that kind of thing .
Mainly slaps . "
From men ?
" Also .
From whoever .
It was mainly the female combat soldiers who beat people .
There were two who really liked to beat people up .
But also men , they had no problem slapping a woman around .
If she screamed , they 'd say , ' Shut it , ' with another slap .
A routine of violence .
There were also those who did n't take part , but everyone knew it happened . "
Sometimes an entire " production " was necessary to satisfy the violent urges .
" There 's a sense of violence , " a border policewoman in the Jenin area said .
" And yes , it 's boring , so we 'd create some action .
We 'd get on the radio , and say they threw stones at us , then someone would be arrested , they 'd start investigating him …
There was a policewoman , she was bored , so okay , she said they threw stones at her .
They asked her who threw them .
' I do n't know , two in grey shirts , I did n't manage to see them . '
They catch two guys with grey shirts … beat them .
Is it them ?
' No , I do n't think so . '
Okay , a whole incident , people get beaten up .
Nothing happened that day . "
An education noncommissioned officer from the Border Guard took her officers for a Sunday of culture – a show in Tel Aviv .
When they got back to their base in the Gaza Strip , they were appalled by the dissonance – one moment they 're clapping in a theater , the next moment they 're acting like beasts .
" Crossing the checkpoint , it 's like another world …
Palestinians walk with trolleys on the side of the road , with wagons , donkeys … so the Border Guards take a truck with the remains of food and start throwing it at them … cottage cheese , rotten vegetables … it was the most appalling thing I experienced in the territories . "
The soldier said she tried to protest , but was silenced by the commanding officers .
When she tried to go around them to higher authorities , she found a solution .
" Almost immediately I got into an officers ' course . "
' You do n't know which side you 're on '
Some of the testimonies document incidents of vandalism of Palestinian property , and even theft .
The same female soldier who recounted her time at the Erez checkpoint said , " Many times the soldiers would open the Palestinians ' food . "
And would they take it as well ?
" Yes .
They take things all the time at checkpoints in the territories .
You 'll never see a soldier without musabaha ( chickpea past similar to hummus ) .
And that is something they give many times …
They are so desperate to pass that they even sort of bribe the soldiers a little … "
A female Border Guard officer spoke of how Palestinian children would arrive at checkpoints with bags of toys for sale – and how the Border Guard would deal with them : " ' Okay , throw the bag away .
Oh , I need some batteries , ' , and they would take , they would take whatever they wanted . "
What would they take ?
" Toys , batteries , anything … cigarettes .
I 'm sure they took money as well , but I do n't remember that specifically . "
She also spoke of one incident in which the looting was caught by a television camera , and the affair blew up .
" Then , the company commander gathered us and reprimanded us : ' How did you not think they might see you ? ' "
No one was punished : " Really , it was an atmosphere in which we were allowed to hit and humiliate . "
Some of the gravest stories come from Hebron .
A Sachlav female soldier spoke of one of the company 's hobbies :
Toy guns .
" Those plastic pellets really hurt … we had a bunch of those … you 're sitting on guard and ' tak ' you fire at a kid , ' tak ' – you fire at another kid . "
She recounted an incident in which a Palestinian reporter took a picture of one of the soldiers aiming a gun at a boy 's head .
She said a " special patrol " went into Hebron , and came back with the pictures .
The soldier said they either paid the reporter , or threatened her .
And the pictures were circulated in the company ?
" No , they were destroyed the same day . "
What did the company commander say about it ?
" He said it 's a good thing they did n't reach the IDF Spokesperson 's Unit . "
Company commander reprimands , but no one punished ( Photo : Reuters )
Some of the testimonies from Hebron deal with the difficult position the soldiers find themselves in , between Palestinians and settlers – who they say are even harder to handle .
Some of the female soldiers were shocked with the level of violence the settlers ' children used against the Palestinians .
" They would throw stones at them , the Jewish kids , " a Nahal female soldier said , " and the parents would say anything … you see this every day in Tel Rumeida . "
Does n't it seem strange to you that one child throws a stone at another child ?
" Because the one child is Jewish and the other is Palestinians , it 's somehow okay … and it was obvious that there would be a mess afterwards .
And you also do n't really know which side you are on …I have to make a switch in my head and keep hating the Arabs and justify the Jews . "
In her frustration , the same female soldier told of how she once spit on a Palestinian in the street : " I do n't think he even did anything .
But again , it was cool and it was the only thing I could do to … you know , I could n't take brag that I caught a terrorists …
But I could spit on them and degrade them and laugh at them . "
Another female Sachlav soldier told the story of the time an eight - year - old settler girl in Hebron decided to bash a stone into the head of a Palestinian adult crossing her passing by her in the street .
" Boom !
She jumped on him , and gave it to him right here in the head … then she started screaming ' Yuck , yuck , his blood is on me ' " .
The soldier said the Palestinian then turned in the girl 's direction – a move that was interpreted as a threat by one of the soldiers in the area , who added a punch of his own : " And I stood there horrified … an innocent little girl in her Shabbat dress … the Arab covered the wound with his hand and ran . "
She recalled another incident with the same child : " I remember she had her brother in the stroller , a baby .
She was giving him stones and telling him : ' Throw them at the Arab ' . "
9 - year - old shot to death
Other testimonies raise concerns as to the procedures of opening fire in the territories , particularly crowd control weapons .
A female Border Guard detailed to protocol she called " dismantling rubber " – the dismantling of rubber bullets from clusters of three to single bullets , and peeling the rubber off of them .
She also said that , despite the clear orders to fire in the air or at the demonstrators ' feet , it was common procedure to fire at the abdomen .
A female Border Guard officer in Jenin spoke of an incident in which a nine - year - old Palestinian , who tried to climb the fence , failed , and fled – was shot to death : " They fired … when he was already in the territories and posed no danger .
The hit was in the abdomen area , they claimed he was on a bicycle and so they were unable to hit him in the legs . "
But the soldier was most bewildered by what happened next between the four soldiers present : " They immediately got their stories straight …
An investigation was carried out , at first they said it was an unjustified killing …
In the end they claimed that he was checking out escape routes for terrorists or something … and they closed the case . "
A female intelligence soldier who served near Etzion recounted an incident in which snipers killed a boy suspected of throwing a Molotov cocktail .
The soldiers coordinated their stories , and the female soldier was shocked , mainly by the happy atmosphere that surrounding the incident :
" It was written in the situation evaluation after the incident that from now on there will be quiet …
This is the best kind of deterrence . "
' They do n't know how to accept the women '
The female soldiers repeatedly mention the particular difficulties they had as women , who had to prove that to were " fighters " in the midst of the goading male soldiers on the one hand , and the Palestinians , who have a hard time handling women in uniform on the other hand .
The following story of a female Border Guard officer sums the matter up .
When the interviewer asked her if the Palestinians " suffer even more from the women in the Border Guard " , she said : " Yes .
Yes .
Because they do n't know how to accept the women .
The moment a girl slaps a man , he is so humiliated , he is so humiliated he does n't know what to do with himself …
I am a strong and well - built girl , and this is even harder for them to handle .
So one of their ways of coping is to laugh .
They really just started to laugh at me .
The commander looks at me and tells me , ' What ?
Are you going to let that slide ?
Look how he 's laughing at you ' .
" And you , as someone who has to salvage your self - respect …
I told them to sit down and I told him to come …
I told him to come close , I really approached him , as if I was about to kiss him .
I told him , ' Come , come , what are you afraid of ?
Come to me !'
And I hit him in the balls .
I told him , ' Why are n't you laughing ? '
He was in shock , and then he realized that … not to laugh .
It should n't reach such a situation . "
You hit him with your knee ?
" I hit him in the balls .
I took my foot , with my military show , and hit him in the balls .
I do n't know if you 've ever been hit in the balls , but it looks like it hurts .
He stopped laughing in my face because it hurt him .
We then took him to a police station and I said to myself , ' Wow , I 'm really going to get in trouble now . '
He could complain about me and I could receive a complaint at the Military police 's criminal investigation division .
" He did n’t say a word .
I was afraid and I said .
I was afraid about myself , not about him .
But he did n't say a word .
' What should I say , that a girl hit me ? '
And he could have said , but thank God , three years later I did n’t get anything and no one knows about it . "
What did it feel like that moment ?
" Power , strength that I should not have achieved this way .
But I did n't brag about it .
That 's why I did it that way , one on one .
I told them to sit on the side , I saw that he was n't looking .
I said to myself that it does n't make sense that as a girl who gives above and beyond and is worth more than some boys – they should laugh at me like that because I am a girl .
Because you think I can't do it … "
Today , when you look at it three years later , would you have done things differently ?
" I would change the system .
It 's seriously defective . "
What does that mean ?
" The system is deeply flawed .
The entire administration , the way things are run , it 's not right .
I do n't know how I would …
I do n't think I did the right thing in this incident but it was what I had to do .
It 's inevitable under these circumstances . "
You 're saying the small soldiers on the ground are not the problem , but the whole situation surrounding them ?
" Yes , this entire situation is problematic . "
The Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson 's
Office said in response to the publication : " These are anonymous testimonies , without any mention of a time or a place , and their reliability cannot be examined in any way .
The IDF is a controlled state organization , which learns and draws lessons , and cooperates with any serious body with the shared goal of exhausting any inquiry when such an examination is inquired .
" The forces in the Central Command are engaged in a daily battle against the terror organizations .
The soldiers undergo a professional training which includes a special reference to the contact with the Palestinian population , mental preparation led by professionals , a routine training by their commanders and ongoing control .
" Another aspect in the supervision over the IDF 's activity is the investigative - legal aspect .
The IDF includes a number of bodies whose job it is to probe incidents in which any activity against the orders is suspected .
Appealing to these bodies is the right , but also the duty , of any soldier or commander , who feels that any activity is being done against orders .
Female soldiers and commanders receive the same training given to the fighters . "

The American scientist who produced the " hockey stick graph " showing a sharp rise in global warming was largely cleared of misconduct by an academic investigation today .
The board of inquiry at Pennsylvania State University said it found no evidence that Michael Mann , a leading climatologist , had suppressed or falsified data , tried to destroy data or emails , or misused information .
It will convene a second panel to investigate whether he had violated academic practices , including those governing exchanges between scholars .
The university ordered the investigation by three senior faculty members after Mann 's name appeared in more than 375 of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia 's climate research unit .
Climate change sceptics jumped on one email which describes Mann 's solution to a problem as a " trick " , a shorthand among scientists and mathematicians , as evidence of an effort to distort data .
The panel dismissed the charge .
" The so - called ' trick ' was nothing more than a statistical method used to bring two or more different kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion by a technique that has been reviewed by a broad array of peers in the field , " the panel said .
It also cleared Mann of purposely hiding or destroying email relating to an IPCC climate change report .
It said it found nothing to support the charge that Mann had conspired with like - minded scholars to block competing scholars .
Mann said he was pleased with the decision .
" After a thorough review , the independent Penn State committee found no evidence to support any of the allegations against me .
Three of the four allegations have been dismissed completely , " he said .
" Even though no evidence to substantiate the fourth allegation was found , the university administrators thought it best to convene a separate committee of distinguished scientists to resolve any remaining questions about academic procedures .
This is very much the vindication I expected since I am confident I have done nothing wrong . "
Environmental organisations also welcomed the decision , saying the controversy over the climate hack had been a dangerous distraction .
" This is a step in the right direction that should help us move past the manufactured controversy over the stolen emails , " said Peter Frumhoff , director of climate policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" The truth is that global warming is here , it 's dangerous , and it is already affecting us . "
But Mann has become a favourite target of climate change deniers because of the powerful image of his hockey stick graph , which shows a sharp rise in average global temperature in the 20th century – and they are unlikely to stop now .
The graph assembled data from hundreds of studies of past temperatures using tree rings , lake sediment , and glacier ice cores .
It was first published in 1998 .

" The drifts are 15 feet deep over the roads , and highways can't move fast enough to keep them open , " said Marvin Hill , emergency manager for Randolph County .
Blowing , drifting snow blinded and stranded drivers in mountainous parts of West Virginia , shutting down countless roads , and National Guard troops were mobilized to help .
It was bad enough that mail service was suspended in six counties .
Friday 's storm made February the snowiest month ever for New Brunswick , N.J. ; it has gotten 37 inches so far .
This had already been the snowiest winter for Philadelphia and Atlantic City , N.J. , before the latest storm dropped another 4 to 5 inches by midmorning Friday .
Much of the region , particularly Philadelphia and southern New Jersey , only recently finished cleaning up from a pair of storms a few weeks ago .
A man was killed by a falling snow - laden tree branch in Central Park in New York City , one of at least three deaths being blamed on the storm .
Areas to the south , meanwhile , got their third heavy dumping of snow this month .
Monroe , N.Y. , received 31 inches , and New York City got more than 20 .
It was wind and rain rather than snow that wreaked havoc in that famously frigid state and its neighbor Maine .
Parts of southern Maine were hit with more than 8 inches of rain .
Power failures were so severe and widespread in New Hampshire -- 340,000 of the state 's roughly 800,000 customers -- that even the state Emergency Operations Center was operating on a generator .
Gov. John Lynch said it could take a week for all those lights to flicker back on .
Foster , who was working on one hour of sleep Friday , said one of his big concerns was getting more diesel fuel for his constantly running plows .
Many local gas pumps were inoperable because of widespread power outages .
" We 're buried , " said Graham Foster , highway superintendent in the town of Wappinger , one of the hardest hit areas in upstate New York .
" My men have been out since 7 yesterday morning and we 're not making much headway because there are so many trees down and wires down . "
Every form of travel was miserable if not impossible .
More than 1,000 flights were canceled , bus service across northern New Jersey was knocked out and roads from Ohio to West Virginia to Maine were closed .
State troopers used snowmobiles to reach motorists stranded for hours on an eastern New York highway .
ALBANY , N.Y .
— A slow - moving winter storm smacked the Northeast on Friday , unleashing heavy snow , rain and hurricane - force winds as it knocked out power to more than a million homes and businesses .
It turned Maine beachfront streets into rivers and piled on the misery in places hit by three major blizzards in less than a month .
Even skiers in the area got bad news .
Snowshoe Mountain Resort had boasted the best conditions in its 36 - year history this week , but a jackknifed tractor - trailer blocked the only road in Friday .
The highest wind reported was 91 mph off Portsmouth , N.H. -- well above hurricane force of 74 mph .
Gusts also hit 60 mph or more from the mountains of West Virginia to New York 's Long Island and Massachusetts .
In Epping , N.H. , howling winds crashed a tree onto Joe and Laurie Mantini 's rural home late Thursday night ; another tree crushed their parked recreational trailer .
On Friday , a tarp covered the right side of their home as a contractor and an insurance adjuster were at work .
" Luckily nobody was hurt , " said Laurie Mantini , 38 .
" I do n't know what we 're going to do tonight . "
In the coastal town of Hampton , N.H. , the unoccupied Surf Hotel caught fire , and the howling winds quickly spread the blaze to the rest of the block .
Five wood - frame buildings , including an arcade and a restaurant , burned .
The cause was unknown .
Downed trees were scattered along a residential street in Hampton , including an oak that punched a hole in the summer cottage Dick Paquin had just renovated last year .
The 62 - year - old semiretired consultant from Raymond was on the roof with a chain saw trying to clear the branches .
" You feel so helpless , " Paquin said .
In Maine , waves crashing ashore at high tide Friday morning flooded streets in Saco , where storms have claimed several homes over the years .
" Felt like the walls were coming in on the house , and the windows were rattling , and the trees were cracking .
It was pretty impressive , " said Mark Breton , who rode out the storm in his house a few blocks from the beach .
Water from a storm - swollen pond was spilling over a 300 - year - old dam in Freetown , Mass . ; about a dozen people were advised to temporarily leave their homes as a precaution .
At the peak of the outages early Friday , there were 260,000 customers without power in Connecticut , and 220,000 customers in New York , mostly in the Hudson Valley north of New York City .
There were 140,000 in Maine , 100,000 in Massachusetts , 25,000 in Vermont , and 11,000 in New Jersey .
Those numbers began falling Friday as crews got to work , in some places contending with toppled trees and deep snow that made it difficult to move around .
Thousands of schools were closed , including in New York City , where Mayor Michael Bloomberg acquiesced after vowing to keep them open .
About 1,000 flights were canceled in Boston , Philadelphia and the New York area , according to the Air Transport Association .
But by late morning , things began clearing up to the south , with three of Philadelphia International Airport 's four runways open .
The weather snarled traffic across the Northeast , including on some major highways .
A tractor - trailer jackknifed and as many as 20 trucks piled up on a mile of the Pennsylvania Turnpike , forcing closure of a 60 - mile stretch in the hills of central Pennsylvania .
Two injuries were reported .
Public transit also was a rough ride .
Rail service in New Jersey and Long Island was suspended or delayed , and New Jersey Transit has canceled morning buses that tens of thousands of people rely on to get to New York City .
In New York , a nearly 40 - mile stretch of snow - clogged Interstate 84 was closed for about five hours .
State police and emergency responders used snowmobiles and all - terrain vehicles Friday morning to reach stranded motorists .
There were no reports of serious injuries , a fact state Trooper John Gero in East Fishkill credited to the heavy snow .
" I do n't think they can go fast enough to get hurt , " he said .

The House overwhelmingly adopted legislation this week mandating the creation of a new kind of terrorist watchlist : a database of people who are n't terrorists , but are routinely flagged at airports anyway .
The U.S. government maintains a list of about a million names of suspected terrorists that is crosschecked with passenger names ahead of airline boarding .
The list has been dogged for years by sloppy name matches that have ensnared innocent travelers , children , prominent politicians and government officials , the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ' secretary of education and all men named David Nelson .
Under the new plan , approved late Tuesday 413 - 3 , innocent victims of the terrorist watchlist must prove to the Department of Homeland Security , through an undetermined appeals process , that they are not terrorists .
They would then get their names put on what the legislation calls the " Comprehensive Cleared List . "
The legislation is another attempt to assist wrongly flagged passengers and would supersede the troubled DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program , which has been criticized for being slow or unresponsive to flier complaints .
The FAST Redress Act , if approved by the Senate , requires the government to report within 240 days on its progress in implementing the new list .

Tuesday , Comcast announced a public trial that any Comcast cable Internet access user can participate in .
And a year from now , DNSSEC validation will be rolled out throughout all of Comcast 's DNS resolvers .
Comcast will also be signing all of the domains it hosts , including comcast.com , comcast.net , and xfinity.com .
The DNSSEC extensions to the DNS protocol make it possible for a validating server or a validating host to determine whether information in the Domain Name System is legitimate or not , the same way that it 's possible to determine whether a signed e-mail message did indeed come from the holder of the e-mail address .
In the past , it was trivial to inject fake information in DNS servers .
The most egregious holes were fixed , but 18 months ago Dan Kaminsky showed that it 's still possible to " poison " DNS servers , and this time the problem was n't completely or easily fixable .
DNS poisoning allows attackers to redirect HTTP and other requests to any address they choose .
The authentication in SSL ( used in HTTPS and other secure protocols ) can detect this and throw up a warning , but relying on SSL warnings against network attacks is about as effective as relying on abstinence against teen pregnancy .
A DNS server that validates DNSSEC on the other hand , filters out any fake information that may have been injected , and the user is never tempted to click away a warning .
In order for DNSSEC to work , the complete naming hierarchy must be signed .
So if a server wants to make sure that xfinity .com really maps to 68.87.85.132 , it needs to check the signature for the xfinity.com and also .com and " the dot " or the root of the DNS hierarchy .
As mentioned above , Comcast will take care of xfinity.com .
Verisign will sign .com and .net in 2011 and others , such as .org and .se , have already signed their " zones . "
The DNS root is expected to be signed in July .
At this point , two of the root servers already respond to RRSIG and DNSKEY queries for the root , but apparently some more work is necessary :
. 86400 IN DNSKEY 256 3 8 AwEAAa1Lh ++++++++++++++++THIS/IS /AN / INVALID /KEY /AND / SHOU LD / NOT /BE / USED/CONTACT/ROOTSIGN/AT/ICANN/DOT/ORG/FOR/MOR E/INFORMATION +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++8
Until everything is in place , Comcast will use an ad -hoc list of trust anchors maintained by IANA , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority .
( The people who keep track of protocol numbers for the IETF . )
Like adding IP v6 addresses to the root , adding DNSSEC information will make certain DNS responses larger , which old DNS servers may not like .
And if the responses are really big — not hard with all these signatures and keys — DNS queries have to be repeated over TCP , and firewall admins may be unaware of the fact that the DNS may use TCP as well as UDP .
For all the Comcast users that do n't want to wait until DNSSEC validation is rolled out on Comcast 's production DNS resolvers , you can participate in the trial by setting your DNS server addresses to 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76 .
( Those do n't work from outside Comcast 's network . )
Unfortunately , Comcast does n't identify any test cases that show a difference between a DNSSEC validated response and a regular DNS response .
Comcast provides some guidance :
We believe that the web error redirection function of Comcast Domain Helper is technically incompatible with DNSSEC
Comcast has always known this and plans to turn off such redirection when DNSSEC is fully implemented
The DNSSEC trial servers we are announcing today do not have Comcast Domain Helper 's DNS redirect functionality enabled .
Comcast is the first major ISP in the US to make DNSSEC validation available to its users .
An Election Debacle for Sarkozy French Voters Punish President
With record low turnout , French voters expressed their disillusionment with the country 's politics and with their president this weekend .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's conservative party trailed the Socialists and could face a debacle in a second round of voting next Sunday .
CANNABIS CULTURE – Members of Parliament from the Liberal , New Democratic , and Conservative Parties of Canada presented petitions today to the House of Commons with over 12,000 signatures asking the Minister of Justice to stop the extradition of marijuana activist Marc Emery .
In a show of cross - party MP support rarely seen in the House , Scott Reid ( Conservative ) , Libby Davies ( NDP ) , and Ujjal Dosanjh ( Liberal ) stood in succession and asked Conservative Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson to refuse to sign extradition orders sending Emery , a Vancouver entrepreneur and well - known activist , to the United States for a 5 - year prison term .
Conservative MP Scott Reid : “ I ’m presenting a petition today , quite a large petition as you can see from the pile on the table beside me , regarding Marc Emery , the leader of the British Columbia Marijuana Party , who is facing deportation to the United States .
The petitioners draw the attention of Parliament to a number of pertinent facts , I wo n’t go through all of them but I think some are relevant here .
Marc Emery ’s activities , the ones for which he is being extradited involve selling viable seeds , viable marijuana seeds , over the Internet .
It ’s worth noting that these activities were approved by Health Canada ’s referral of medical marijuana patients to his seed bank .
It is worth noting as well that courts in ruling on this subject , Canadian courts have ruled that a $ 200 fine is an appropriate punishment for this kind of activity as opposed to extradition to a country where he can face potentially life imprisonment .
Finally it is worth noting that , under the Extradition Act , the petitioners point out , the Canadian Minister of Justice shall refuse to surrender a person when that surrender could involve unjust or undue or oppressive actions by the country to which he being extradited . ”
NDP MP Libby Davies : “ I too have a very big stack of petitions to present , about 4000 petitions , along with other colleagues in the House who have received a similar number , and these are petitions from Canadians across the country who draw to our attention a matter of great urgency concerning the US call for extradition of Mr. Marc Emery as we ’ve heard just earlier .
Many dedicated individuals have collected approximately 12,000 petitions reflecting a strong belief that Mr. Emery or any Canadian should not face harsh punishment in the US for selling cannabis seeds on the Internet when it is not worthy of prosecution in Canada .
The petitioners call on Parliament to make it clear to the Minister of Justice that such an extradition should be opposed .
I am very pleased to present this ; I think it is a very strong reflection of Canadians ’ views on this matter and we hope that the Parliament of Canada will act on this , and certainly the Minister of Justice will take this into account . ”
Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh : “ I join my previous two colleagues with respect to this petition regarding Marc Emery .
I believe there is a certain degree of unfairness that is inherent in the process that has been used to deal with him , and these petitions urge the Minister , the Attorney General , to not surrender Marc Emery to the United States for extradition .
While I come from British Columbia , a former attorney general and former Premier of British Columbia , I have certain sympathies with Mr. Emery , not because of what he did , but because I believe that the process that was used to arrest him and punish him would n’t have been done in the case of Canadian authorities wanting to arrest him and punish him , and I believe that because of that unfairness , the Minister of Justice is urged by the petitioner to take another look at it . ”

Emery , known by fans as the Prince of Pot , is the president of the BC Marijuana Party and the former publisher of Cannabis Culture .
Emery ’s online seed business was raided and shut down in 2005 by DEA agents and Vancouver Police .
He was arrested and faced possible life imprisonment in the US before making a deal with American prosecutors for a 5 - year term in a US jail .
“ I thought it was very gracious of Ujjal Dosanjh to say as a former Premier and Attorney General he was sympathetic to my situation , ” Marc Emery told Cannabis Culture .
It was wonderful to hear Scott Reid of the governing Conservative Party articulate that Health Canada sent people to buy seeds from me .
Libby Davies was heartfelt in her support for me .
They all brought salient points forward and it was a wonderful moment . ”
Emery surrendered himself to Canadian authorities on September 28 , 2009 and was imprisoned at North Fraser Pretrial Centre awaiting the Minister of Justice ’s signature on the extradition papers .
While he was there , dozens of protestors held a permanent vigil on the edge of prison property .
Emery continued his activism work while locked up , recorded regular podcasts available through Cannabis Culture .
He was released on bail on November 18 , 2009 , awaiting the Justice Minister ’s signature , and remains temporarily free .
He expects to renew his bail this month .
Emery and his supporters say the 2005 DEA raid on his business was an overtly political act , and point to statements made at the time by DEA administrator Karen Tandy calling Emery ’s arrest “ a signficant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement . ”
“ His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $ 5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts , but those have gone up in smoke today , ” she said .
“ Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery ’s illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canda .
Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on . ”
The presentation of petitions in support of the activist , who has for years represented a growing culture of cannabis users , comes a day before Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper faces multiple questions about marijuana in an online question / answer poll sponsored by Google and YouTube .
“ It would be wonderful if Harper would answer truthfully , ” Emery said , “ but I expect to hear more disappointing answers to our legitimate questions . ”

Local politicians present petition to stop Marc Emery ’s extradition
by Jill Drews , News1130
VANCOUVER ( NEWS1130 ) – The Prince of Pot could be extradited to the U.S. any day , but it ’s hoped a petition will see the Federal Justice Minister reconsider .
MPs from three of Canada ’s major political parties present a petition in the House of Commons today which aims to keep Marc Emery in Canada .
Emery has pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge in the U.S. , after he was arrested in 2005 for selling marijuana seeds to American customers .
Emery faced a possible life sentence if the case went to trial .
He ’ll spend five years in a U.S. prison on a drug distribution charge if extradited .
Roughly 12,000 people have signed the petition asking Federal Justice Minister Rob Nicholson not to sign Emery ’s extradition order .
Liberal MP for Vancouver South Ujjal Dosanjh , the NDP ’s Libby Davies and Conservative Scott Reid will hand over the petition in the House of Commons .
Dosanjh says presenting petitions is something he is routinely asked to do .
“ You do n’t always agree with everything the petition says or anything that it says … We believe it ’s a function that we perform . ”
The Justice Minister has had the power to sign the document for over two months , but has n’t .
Dosanjh is n’t sure how the petition will impact the Justice Minister ’s decision .
“ I ’m hoping that the Justice Minister is having the same kind of considerations that are going through our heads while we present these petitions .
It ’s not necessarily that we agree with Mr. Emery completely or partially , it is that we sense a degree of unfairness in what ’s happened to him . ”
MPs back push to keep Prince of Pot in Canada
by Matt Kieltyka , 24 Hours
Marc Emery is still awaiting extradition to the U.S. on drug distribution charges , but there ’s a new push to keep the Prince of Pot in Canada .
Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh , NDP MP Libby Davies and Conservative MP Scott Reid presented the House of Commons with a 12,000 - signature petition Monday pleading with federal Justice Minister Rob Nicholson to reconsider handing Emery over to the U.S. , where he faces five years in jail for selling marijuana seeds online .
Dosanjh said he has an obligation to present petitions on behalf of constituents regardless if he agrees , but is glad to speak out in this case .
“ This is an obligation as a Member of Parliament , but I sympathize with Emery ’s plight , ” the Vancouver - South MP told 24 hours .
“ There is a certain degree of unfairness in how he has been treated . ”
Dosanjh said the marijuana activist should serve his time in Canada .
“ I would like the Minister of Justice to consider not surrendering Marc , ” he said , adding that the decision would n’t do anything to hurt relations between the two countries .
Emery has been out on bail since mid-November as he awaits extradition , but the order has yet to be signed by Nicholson .
His wife , Jodie Emery , ran against Dosanjh in the last federal election as a Green Party candidate .
Three MPs table petitions against Vancouver pot activist Marc Emery ’s extradition to U.S .
by Stephen Hui , The Georgia Straight
Three members of Parliament from three political parties have introduced in the House of Commons petitions signed by 12,000 people opposed to the extradition to the U.S. of Vancouver - based marijuana activist Marc Emery .
The stacks of petitions were tabled today ( March 15 ) by Conservative MP Scott Reid of Ontario , Vancouver East NDP MP Libby Davies , and Vancouver South Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh .
“ These are petitions from Canadians across the country who draw to our attention a matter of great urgency concerning the U.S. call for extradition of Mr. Marc Emery , as we ’ve heard just earlier , ” Davies told the House .
“ Many dedicated individuals have collected approximately 12,000 petitions reflecting a strong belief that Mr. Emery or any Canadian should not face harsh punishment in the U.S. for selling cannabis seeds on the Internet , when it is not worthy of prosecution in Canada .
“ And the petitioners call on Parliament to make it clear to the minister of justice that such an extradition should be opposed , ” Davies added .
According to Davies , the petitions offer a “ very strong reflection of Canadians ’ view on this matter ” .
Last summer , Emery agreed to a plea bargain with American authorities that will probably see him land in a U.S. jail for at least five years for distributing marijuana seeds .
Emery , also known as the Prince of Pot , is the president of the B.C. Marijuana Party .
Three MPs work to block pot activist Marc Emery ’s extradition to U.S .
by Andy Ivens , The Province
Marijuana activist Marc Emery ’s battle to avoid going to a U.S. prison got a boost Monday in the House of Commons .
Three MPs — Libby Davies of the New Democratic Party , Ujjal Dosanjh of the Liberals and Scott Reid of the Conservatives — presented a petition asking Justice Minister Rob Nicholson not to sign extradition papers that would send Emery south to serve a five - year sentence for selling marijuana seeds online in 2005 .
More than 12,000 Canadians signed the petition .
“ In Vancouver , everywhere I go , people make a point of expressing good wishes that I do n’t get extradited , ” Emery said Monday .
His removal order has been sitting on the justice minister ’s desk since Jan .
8 .
“ Nine weeks have passed and he has n’t made that decision , so something is keeping him from doing it , ” said Emery , who noted the Conservatives could score political points , especially with young voters , if his extradition is halted .
All three MPs told their fellow MPs Emery ’s extradition smacks of unfairness .
Canadian courts have established a person convicted of selling marijuana seeds should face a fine of $ 200 .
In the U.S. , a person could be sentenced to life in prison for the same crime .
Emery , 52 , and two employees were arrested in 2005 by Canadian police acting as agents for the U.S. department of justice .
He is not facing a charge in Canada .
Reid , an Ontario MP , told the Commons that the Extradition Act states the justice minister “ shall refuse to surrender a person when that surrender could involve unjust or undue or oppressive actions by the country to which he is being extradited . ”
Davies , the MP for Vancouver East , said she has found broad support for Emery .
“ People do n’t understand why Marc Emery should be extradited .
He was never prosecuted in Canada for these crimes , and I think people see it as a question of Canadian sovereignty , ” she said .
Dosanjh , MP for Vancouver South , said : “ It appears to me that we have assisted a foreign government arrest a man for doing something that we would n’t arrest him for doing in Canada .
“ As a former premier and a former attorney - general , I sense a certain degree of unfairness in the process . ”
MPs want to keep Prince of Pot in Canada
by Matt Kieltyka , Toronto Sun
VANCOUVER — Marc Emery is still awaiting extradition to the U.S. on drug distribution charges , but there ’s a new push to keep the Prince of Pot in Canada .
Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh , NDP MP Libby Davies and Conservative MP Scott Reid presented the House of Commons with a 12,000 - signature petition Monday pleading with federal Justice Minister Rob Nicholson to reconsider handing Emery over to the U.S. , where he faces five years in jail for selling marijuana seeds online .
Dosanjh said he has an obligation to present petitions on behalf of constituents regardless if he agrees , but is glad to speak out in this case .
“ This is an obligation as a Member of Parliament , but I sympathize with Emery ’s plight , ” the Vancouver - South MP told QMI Agency .
“ There is a certain degree of unfairness in how he has been treated . ”
Dosanjh said the marijuana activist should serve his time in Canada .
“ I would like the Minister of Justice to consider not surrendering Marc , ” he said , adding that the decision would n’t do anything to hurt relations between the two countries .
Emery has been out on bail since mid-November as he awaits extradition , but the order has yet to be signed by Nicholson .
His wife , Jodie Emery , ran against Dosanjh in the last federal election as a Green Party candidate .
Two former winners will line up later today at the Pwn2 Own hacking contest to take another crack at thousands of dollars in prizes for exploiting fully - patched browsers .
Charlie Miller , who has taken home cash two years running , and a German hacker known only by the first name Nils are scheduled to try their hands today at breaking into notebooks equipped with Safari and Firefox .
In a videotaped drawing last week to determine the order in which the contestants will try their luck , Miller , an analyst at Baltimore - based Independent Security Evaluators , grabbed the No. 2 spot .
Miller will attempt to hack into a MacBook Pro notebook running Mac OS X 10.6 , a.k.a.
Snow Leopard , equipped with the latest version of Safari .
Nils , a computer science student from Germany , drew the No. 3 and No. 9 spots , and will also try to break into the Snow Leopard MacBook if Miller falters .
Later in the contest , he 's slated to attack Mozilla 's Firefox 3.6.2 on a PC running Windows 7 .
In last year 's Pwn2 Own competition , which is in its fourth year at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver , British Columbia , Nils walked off with $ 15,000 after successfully exploiting Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox and Safari .
Miller took home $ 5,000 .
The rules for this year 's contest are slightly different .
In 2009 , 3Com 's TippingPoint security unit , which sponsors Pwn2Own , paid $ 5,000 for each unknown browser vulnerability exploited , with no limit on the number each hacker could use or how many times one browser could be breached .
This year , TippingPoint will pay $ 10,000 for each of the four browser challenges , with a limit of four winning vulnerabilities and a maximum of $ 40,000 in prize money .
Pwn2 Own newcomer Peter Vreugdenhil will attempt to exploit IE8 on Windows 7 today .
Vreugdenhil , a freelance vulnerability researcher from the Netherlands , apparently has an exploit that 's capable of bypassing Windows 7's DEP ( Data Execution Prevention ) and ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization ) security mechanisms , according to both the contest organizer and Vreugdenhil himself .
" Let 's hope ASLR in Vancouver works the same as in [ the Netherlands ] , " Vreugdenhil teased via Twitter last week after the placement drawing .
Vreugdenhil will go fourth in the contest .
Earlier , Aaron Portnoy , security research team lead with TippingPoint and Pwn2 Own 's organizer , said that a longtime contributor to the company 's bug bounty program , whom he did n't name at the time , would be armed with an IE8 exploit he called " impressive ... from a technical standpoint . "
Miller was suitably impressed .
On his own Twitter feed last week , he said , " If he pwns ie8 on win 7 w/ o jit spray , he 'll deserve [ single name status ] , " Miller wrote , referring to a type of heap spraying attack that has been used to bypass DEP and ASLR .
JIT spraying , however , requires Flash , which wo n't be available on the first day of Pwn2 Own .
Winners in the browser track also receive the machine they exploited .
This year 's models include a MacBook Pro 15 - in.
notebook , a Hewlett - Packard Envy Beats 15 - in. , a Sony Vaio 13 - in. and an Alienware M11x 11 - in .
The second track of Pwn2 Own is devoted to mobile operating systems .
In that phase of the competition , researchers will try to breach an iPhone 3GS , a BlackBerry Bold 9700 , a Nokia E72 and an HTC Nexus One .
The latter is the Google - branded phone sold online by the search giant and creator of the Android operating system .
In the mobile competition , each winning individual entrant or team will receive the hacked phone and $ 20,000 .
A pair of hackers , Vincenzo Iozzo and Ralf Philipp Weinmann , drew the No. 1 spot and will attack the iPhone .
Iozzo , an Italian college student , works for Zynamics GmbH , the company headed by noted researcher Thomas Dullien , better known as Halvar Flake .
Weinmann , a post - doctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Algorithms , Cryptology and Security at the University of Luxembourg , is probably best known for being part of a three - man team that demonstrated how to crack the Wi-Fi security protocol WEP much faster than previously thought possible .
Two more spots , one for the iPhone , the other for the Nokia device , have been reserved for anonymous entrants .
TippingPoint 's Portnoy said last week that he expected the iPhone to be only smartphone to fall during the contest .
Pwn2Own is scheduled to run through Friday .

Now thatis out of the way and headed for almost inevitable Oscar nominations , Quentin Tarantino is planning his next move .
What is it ?
Bad Taste caught Tarantino on Italian television where he went out of his way to lure the interviewer into asking him about the possibility of a third Kill Bill and then announced that yes , it ’s happening and “ The Bride will fight again .
” Of course Tarantino projects never happen quickly and sometimes the stuff he talks about never happens at all .
But he seems fairly adamant about gettingdone , even if it takes time .
He says , “ Kill Bill 3 will probably come out , I gotta wait a couple of years , but I want ten years to pass from the second one to the third one .
” So why ten years ?
Tarantino explains , “ Two reasons .
One , I think me and Uma needed a ten year break … .
And the second one , I loved the character a lot .
I think she deserved ten years to relax .
She deserved ten years of no fighting , she deserved ten years with her child Bebe , just of peace .
I put her through a lot those first two movies , I want her to have a nice , peaceful life for ten years .
I want her to set up her store , and have some peace .
But after ten years we ’ll make her fight again .
” The originalwas released in 2003 .
That could meanin 2013 except , even though he mentions needing a break from Uma , QT says he only has to wait a couple of years and the ten years he discussed seemed to be related more to the timeline taking place inside the film than the one taking place out here .
could show up at any time .
Watch the full interview on Italian television via the embed below .
It ’s long , in Italian , and for most of the interview Tarantino seems utterly confused by what ’s going around him until , that is , he starts pimping the Bride ’s next film .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A high - powered laser aboard a modified Boeing Co 747 jumbo jet shot down an in - flight ballistic missile for the first time , highlighting a new class of ray guns best known from science fiction .

The flying laser ’s long - awaited test on Thursday showcased a potential to zap multiple targets at the speed of light and at a range of hundreds of kilometers , the Pentagon ’s Missile Defense Agency said in a statement .
“ The Missile Defense Agency demonstrated the potential use of directed energy to defend against ballistic missiles when the Airborne Laser Testbed ( ALTB ) successfully destroyed a boosting ballistic missile , ” the agency said .
“ The revolutionary use of directed energy is very attractive for missile defense , ” the statement added .
It cited among other things a low cost per intercept compared with other technologies used to defeat missiles that could be tipped with chemical , biological or nuclear warheads .
Directed energy weapons use highly focused rays to attack a target rather than chemical - powered arms .
Those in control can tweak the strength involved , unlike a bullet or a bomb , allowing for less - than - lethal uses .
Lasers are well known from science fiction as a type of ray gun .
In the real world , they are used for sighting , ranging and targeting for guns .
The experiment marked both the first time a laser weapon has destroyed a ballistic missile and the first time any system has accomplished it in the missile ’s boost phase of flight .
A boosting missile is easiest to track because its exhaust is bright and hot , but the window lasts only from one to five minutes , meaning the interceptor must be in close proximity .
The modified 747-400 F jumbo jet took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California in an experiment that was unannounced before the outcome was made known early Friday .
A short - range ballistic missile was launched from an at - sea mobile launch platform off Point Mugu on the central California coast , the agency said .
Within seconds , the Airborne Laser used on board sensors to detect the missile , then a low - energy laser to track it .
After firing another laser to measure and compensate for atmospheric disturbance , on went its megawatt - class high - energy laser , “ heating the boosting ballistic missile to critical structural failure , ” the agency said .
The engagement took place within two minutes of the target missile ’s launch while its rocket motors were still thrusting , the agency said .
Boeing , the prime contractor and system integrator , said : “ With this successful experiment , the Airborne Laser Testbed has blazed a path for a new generation of high - energy , ultra- precision weaponry . ”
Michael Rinn , Boeing ’s program director , said in a statement : “ ALTB technology and future directed - energy platforms will transform how the United States defends itself and its friends and allies . ”
The successful test prompted calls for the Pentagon to restore funding for further development of the Airborne Laser , which President Barack Obama turned into a kind of science experiment last year rather than a development program headed for deployment .
“ This defense project should be made ready to protect our homeland at a moment ’s notice , ” said Rep. Todd Tiahrt , a Republican from Kansas , where Boeing had been expected to do modification work on the Airborne laser .
Riki Ellison of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance , a nonprofit funded partly by defense contractors , said the United States had spent about $ 5 billion on the Airborne Laser ’s development since the early 1990s .
“ Why would the US Congress and the Department of Defense not fully fund and further develop this system to have it ready to deploy to give our armed forces and allies protection against Iran and North Korea , ” he said in an email interview .
John Pike , director of GlobbalSecurity.org , a military information website , said the test had not proven anything to him about the system ’s real - world value .
“ The question is whether it can shoot down targets at long range and this test did n’t answer the question , ” he said .
Northrop Grumman Corp designed and built the higher - energy laser and Lockheed Martin Corp supplied the beam - and fire - control systems .
Dear Ms. Parker ,
This time , we do n't know what to say .
That pie .
The crust , so flaky .
The fruit , so sweet .
The little apron .
Thank you very much .
It 's been what , eight or nine years that we 've been together now ?
Through The West Wing , through Weeds — through it all , you 've always had time for us .
A few times now you 've given Esquire your image — your long platinum neck , your deep Guinness eyes staring out from the photos , your movie - star nose , twitched a little , your long body lounging on our pages .
You 've given us quite a lot of your writing , too , and it 's always really great and really funny and smart .
Usually you tell us you need three weeks to write a piece , and even that 's going to be tight , because you do n't know what you 're going to say — and then it pops into the in - box in half an hour , and we do n't change a word .
A good skill , that .
When you write , like when you talk , the words can be jarring , as if you pulled a knife on us and then laughed — that loud , wonderful , piano - bang laugh — when we froze with fear .
Heh .
But it makes us glad , not knowing what to expect .
It stings a little , but we 're glad .
So , on behalf of men everywhere , thank you for all the words and the pictures so far , and now the pie , which is really too much .
Lord knows , men are hardly worthy of such gifts .
Sincerely ,
Esquire
A Thank - You Note to Men

To you , whom it may concern :
Manly creature , who smells good even when you do n't , you wake up too slowly , with fuzzy , vertical hair and a slightly lost look on your face as though you are seven or seventy - five ; you can fix my front door , my sink , and open most jars ; you , who lose a cuff link and have to settle for a safety pin , you have promised to slay unfortunate interlopers and dragons with your Phillips head or Montblanc ; to you , because you will notice a woman with a healthy chunk of years or pounds on her and let out a wolf whistle under your breath and mean it ; because you think either rug will be fine , really it will ; you seem to walk down the street a little taller than me , a little more aware but with a purpose still ; to you who codifies , conjugates , slams a puck , baits a hook , builds a decent cabinet or the perfect sandwich ; you who gives a twenty to the kids selling Hershey 's bars and waits at baggage claim for three hours in your flannel shirt ; you , sir , you take my order , my pulse , my bullshit ; you who soaps me in the shower , soaks with me in the tub ; to you , boy grown - up , the gentleman , soldier , professor , or caveman , the fancy man with initials on your towels and salt on your chocolates , to you and to that guy at the concession stand ; thank you for the tour of the vineyard , the fire station , the sound booth , thank you for the kaleidoscope , the Horsehead Nebula , the painting , the truth ; to you who carries me across the parking lot , up the stairs , to the ER , to roll - away or rice mat ; to you who shows up every so often only to confuse and torment , and you who stays in orbit , always , to my left and steady , you stood up for me , I wo n't forget that ; to you , the one who can't figure it out and never will , and you who lost the remote , the dog , or your way altogether ; to you , wizard , you sang in my ear and brought me back from the dead , you tell me things , make me shiver ; to the ones who destroyed me , even if for a minute , and to the ones who grew me , consumed me , gave me my heart back times ten ; to most everything that deserves to call itself a man :
How I do love thee , with your skill to light fires that keep me warm , light me up .
How to Make a Pie
By Mary - Louise Parker
Turn your oven to 425 degrees .
Put three sticks of butter and a bowl of water that has ice in it in the fridge .
Cubes , not chips .
Put the food - processor bowl and the sharp blade thingy in the freezer .
When that stuff gets cold , take out the bowl and blade and put in 2 3 / 4 cups of flour , a teaspoon of sugar , and a teaspoon of salt .
Cut 2 1/4 sticks of butter into pieces the size of a camera battery and drop them in a couple at a time while hitting " pulse " on the machine till it all looks like coarse meal .
If you do n't know what that is , go look at the smaller pieces of gravel in your driveway .
Slowly pour , like , 7 or 8 tablespoons of the ice water in with the flour gravel and pulse it till it comes together into a ball that is n't sticky .
Take it out and knead it on a counter sprinkled with flour , but not too much or the molecules will get stretchy and the dough will be tough .
Form the dough into two big air - hockey pucks and cover with plastic wrap .
Put them in the fridge for at least an hour .
If you forget about the dough , you can throw it in the freezer ( but once the seasons have changed , chuck it ) .
Roll the pucks into circles bigger than a pie .
Drape one over the pie pan with a little extra hanging over , and fill it with cut - up fruit mixed with a little flour , cinnamon , and a drop or two of rum , and dot the top with butter .
Cover it with the other dough circle , pinch the edges together , and cut some little holes in the top of the pie with a knife .
Make a design or write a message to someone , code or otherwise .
For a yummy , richer crust , brush with heavy cream and sprinkle with raw sugar from the packets at Starbucks .
Put foil all around the edge so it does n't burn ; take it off after the pie has cooked for , like , 20 minutes and turn the temp down to 350 .
Cook for 25 minutes more or until juice is bubbling out of the Morse - code slashes .
Take it out and let it sit for as long as you can wait but not so long that it gets cold .

" Dexamyl is of significant value in depressed and verbally inhibited patients "
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the many consequences of obesity , as fat accumulates not only across the body and around the visceral organs , but inside the organ that helps break down fats , filter toxins from the bloodstream and create useable fuel from the food we eat .
About 3 in 10 American adults suffer from nonalcoholic fatty liver .
But it 's a population of patients that 's grown so fast , there is n't a lot known about their risks , and what factors aggravate those risks .
Researchers know those with nonalcoholic fatty liver are more likely than those without such fatty deposits to develop cirrhosis , liver cancer and liver failure requiring transplant .
Still , a minority of those patients will do so , and doctors wish they could identify what factors may push those with fatty liver toward those outcomes .
The development of tough scar tissue in the liver can be a sign that liver failure may lie ahead .
For heavy alcohol consumers , an alcoholic bender can cause scarring , or fibrosis , and lead to trouble .
That 's why those with signs of alcoholic fatty liver are urged to stop drinking alcohol .
A new study suggests that for those with nonalcoholic fatty liver , drinking a lot of beverages sweetened with fructose may do the same thing as liquor .
The study , published in the journal Hepatology , tracked 427 patients with fatty liver disease to see whether consumption of fructose made a difference in the progression of fatty liver to the organ 's failure .
The Duke University researchers asked subjects only about how many fructose - sweetened beverages a week they drank , including fruit juices and soft drinks sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup -- yielding a conservative accounting , since the stuff is also used in baking and other processed foods .
Though only 19 % of the fatty liver patients consumed few or no fructose sweetened beverages , 28 % drank at least one a day .
Best represented among the heavy fructose consumers were subjects who were younger , male and Latino , and who had a higher BMI .
Compared to subjects who drank the least fructose beverages , those who drank the most were significantly more likely to have the hepatic scarring that will more often progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer .
And older subjects who regularly consumed fructose beverages showed more signs of liver inflammation .
After they stripped out the effects of age , gender and body - mass index , the researchers also found that the heavy fructose drinkers also have lower levels of HDL ( or " good " ) cholesterol .
Duke University hepatologist Dr. Manal Abdelmalek said in a news release that high - fructose corn syrup , which was first introduced into the human diet in the 1970s and has accounted for an average of 10 % of Americans ' caloric intake over the last decade , " may not be as benign as we previously thought . "
While researchers have demonstrated clearly that the stuff has " fueled the fire of the obesity epidemic , " added Abdelmalek , " untill now , no one has ever suggested it contributes to liver disease and / or liver injury . "

The nation ’s schoolchildren have made little or no progress in reading proficiency in recent years , according to results released Wednesday from the largest nationwide reading test .
The scores continue a 17 - year trend of sluggish achievement in reading that contrasts with substantial gains in mathematics during roughly the same period .
“ The nation has done a really good job improving math skills , ” said Mark Schneider , a vice president at the American Institutes for Research and a former official at the Education Department , which oversees the test , known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
“ In contrast , we have made only marginal improvements in reading . ”
Why math scores have improved so much faster than reading scores is much debated ; the federal officials who produce the test say it is intended to identify changes in student achievement over time , not to identify causes .
In seeking to explain the lagging reading scores , some experts point to declines in the amount of reading children do for pleasure as they devote more free time to surfing the Internet , texting on cellphones or watching television .
Others blame undemanding curriculums .

And it turns out she 's wise .
Which is why we 'll just let her speak for herself .

That sex scene in The Pacific ?
You do n't get that on Fringe , do you ?
I do n't think anyone finds them easy .
It 's not that I 'm embarrassed about my boobs .
It 's just that some part of you really does n't want that out there .
At the same time , you want to get good at it .
In the moment , what you 're really thinking is , Shit , I need a mint .
I do n't find guys nervous around me .
But maybe guys do n't talk to me if they 're nervous .
They say Australians get that ten - yard stare .
It comes from the land and the horizon .
You can see all around you for as far as you can see .
So you just stare .
I do it all the time .
Sometimes there will be a line in the script and I just can't imagine saying it .
I 'll ask an American and they 'll say , " Oh , yeah .
That 's how we say it . "
We just say things differently in Australia — like torch .
I 'd ask , " Can I have the torch ? "
It seems to fall flat when I say , " Can I have the flashlight ? "
I do n't go to clubs or places where people go to be picked up .
But if I 'm out , I usually sit at the bar .
If someone carries your bag out in Australia , it 's like a favor .
I always feel sick when I forget to tip the guy carrying it here .
It 's a hard concept to get used to :
If I pay you more , you do it better .
I just can't bear to swallow Vegemite , and I do n't know how people do it .
It 's revolting .
If you want to try something from Australia , go with Tim Tams .
They 're sweet chocolate biscuits .
Depth .
I want somebody who 's gonna need me .
I 'm terrible at practical jokes .
I do them too well , so they 're not funny .
I end up saying , " Oh , no , I 'm joking , I 'm joking ... . "
I did n't know much about video games .
There are some awfully violent ones .
But Heavenly Sword is different .
I 've had huge conversations with a friend who made it .
I think what he wants to do is to make the player care .
Yes , there 's killing .
But the character I play in Heavenly Sword , Nariko , is ultimately protecting her family and this runaway girl .
It 's a beautiful game .
It 's beyond a video game .
The landscape is to protect and to care .
My friend is working toward a world where you get an emotion out of the people who are playing it .
See if you can make them cry if they could n't save the people who they were trying to protect .
This is n't Pac - Man .
It does n't necessarily matter what your answer is to the question :
What is art ?
So long as you have one .
A friend of mine says his two favorite artists are Picasso and Rembrandt .
Picasso because he paints the beautiful in such an ugly fashion .
And Rembrandt because he paints the ugly so beautifully .
I do n't feel like I 've hit my stride .
So I wonder what the moment will be when I get to be who I want to be .

Want to find out how to see all startup and login app launches and scripts on a Mac ?
This article will walk through that process .
Gone are the days of Mac OS System 9 where all startup items were sitting nicely in a system folder labeled ‘ Startup ’ , now with the Unix undercore of Mac OS X things are a bit more complicated , with some startup and login scripts and apps launching beyond the easily accessible ‘ Login Items ’ preference pane .
We ’ll review where these startup , login , and auto - launch agents , plists , daemons , and applications may reside in Mac OS X .
This can be helpful for troubleshooting , privacy , and security reasons .
Average Users : Startup & Login items in Mac OS X
For the average end user , most apps they want to configure to launch ( or not ) on boot are actually handled with a login event that ’s easily controlled through something like the Dock with a right - click or the “ Login Items ” listed under user accounts , if that ’s what you ’re looking for then the average user can see how to launch an application on system start in Mac OS X ( which is actually upon user login ) and that will likely cover their needs .
Advanced Users : Startup & Login items , apps , and scripts in Mac OS X
This part of the article is n’t for most users !
If you ’re an advanced user or a systems administrator , that aforementioned preference pane is rarely the end of your hunt to track down startup and login items in Mac OS X .
I recently was on a wild goose chase trying to find a rather obnoxious script a user had accidentally installed on a network machine , and knowing the proper locations made my job significantly easier , so for that reason I provide the list to you :
Applications that run on Startup :
/ Library / StartupItems
plist items running on startup :
/ Library / LaunchDaemons
/ System / Library / LaunchDaemons
Applications that launch on User Login :
* First check your “ Login Items ” for that user account within the Account settings of System Preferences
~/ Library / LaunchAgents
/ Library / LaunchAgents /
/ System / Library / LaunchAgents /
Applications that run on a set schedule :
Check your crontab with :
crontab -l
Check Kernel Extensions :
In the command line :
kextstat
Check Login and Logout Hooks
defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook for Login
defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook for Logout
or see both with :
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Print
If you do n’t know what you ’re doing , please do n’t mess around in the above directories or commands , you can easily cause more harm than good !
These locations serve the core functionality of Mac OS and should only be altered by advanced Mac users and Systems Administrators .
Do you have any other tidbits or interesting info for finding startup scripts , launch apps , daemons , kernel extensions , or other automatically loading apps and scripts ?

In the footnotes of a speech U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke would have given to the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 10 , lies a unique and startling disclosure .
Hosted on the Federal Reserve ’s own servers , the written testimony of the bank ’s chairman explains in plain text what expanding the Fed ’s powers will do .
“ The Federal Reserve believes it is possible that , ultimately , its operating framework will allow the elimination of minimum reserve requirements , which impose costs and distortions on the banking system , ” footnote number nine , at the bottom of the page , explains without additional qualification .

Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , who is not running for reelection , is currently pushing a financial reform bill that would grant the Fed unprecedented new powers to regulate financial markets , including insurance companies and small lenders , under the auspice of forcing such firms to lessen their exposure to risky investments .
Wondering how that would have prevented a collapse the likes of which nearly sank the financial system at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency , Forbes writer John Carney mocked Dodd ’s plan as “ incredibly stupid . ”
“ [ The ] Federal Reserve had regulators in place inside of Lehman Brothers following the collapse of Bear Stearns .
These in - house regulators did not realize that Lehman ’s management was rebuking market demands for reduced risk and covering up its rebuke with accounting sleight - of - hand .
When Lehman actually came looking for a bailout , officials were reportedly surprised at how bad things were at the firm .
A similar situation unfolded at Merrill Lynch .
The regulators proved inadequate to the task . ”
Yet , by the Federal Reserve ’s stated assumption , that it will one day be able to eliminate the requirement forcing financial institutions maintain even a fraction of their depositors ’ assets , it ’s proposed mass - regulation of the financial sector sustains a brand of logic , however skewed .
Unhinging banks from even basic deposit standards would essentially create a class above the daily requirements of capitalism , resting atop a pool of funds with infinite depth , removing the need for what ’s currently known as “ fractional reserve banking . ”

Such a system is described by Investopedia as such : “ A banking system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash - on - hand and are available for withdrawal .
This is done to expand the economy by freeing up capital that can be loaned out to other parties .
Most countries operate under this type of system . ”
What Bernanke is flatly stating is the need for that fraction , representing the actual wealth by which the bank ’s capital multiplies , could soon be eliminated for the U.S. Federal Reserve , making free - floating , infinitely self - replicating capital a pervasive reality .
Only a few other nations have endowed their fiat currency with such buoyancy , their numbers including Mexico , Canada , Australia and the United Kingdom .

“ The truth is that the financial system that we have created makes inflation inevitable , ” opined Business Insider writer Michael Snyder .
“ The U.S. dollar has lost more than 95 percent of the value that it had when the Federal Reserve was created .
During this decade the value of the dollar will decline a whole lot more .
“ That does n’t sound like a very good investment .

“ But that is what happens when you give bankers power to make money up out of thin air .
“ And things are only going to get worse . ”
In the op-ed , Snyder points to one member of Congress , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , as someone who “ realizes ” the alleged grievous failings of the Fed , quoting Paul from a recent hearing of the House Financial Services Committee hearing .

“ The Federal Reserve in collaboration with the giant banks has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen .
The foolish notion that unlimited amounts of money and credit created out of thin air can provide sustainable economic growth has delivered this crisis to us .
Instead of economic growth and stable prices , ( The Fed ) has given us a system of government and finance that now threatens the world financial and political institutions .
Pursuing the same policy of excessive spending , debt expansion and monetary inflation can only compound the problems that prevent the required corrections .
Doubling the money supply did n’t work , quadrupling it wo n’t work either .
Buying up the bad debt of privileged institutions and dumping worthless assets on the American people is morally wrong and economically futile . ”
Paul , who ran away with the top honors at the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference , earning the influential conservative activists ’ pick for the GOP ’s 2012 presidential nomination , was not shy about his feelings on the Fed ’s conduct during a Feb. 24 hearing , saving his harshest criticism for Chairman Bernanke .
Watch :
He accused the Federal Reserve Bank of laundering money connected to the Watergate scandal , and making loans to Saddam Hussein ahead of the first U.S. invasion : claims which Bernanke dismissed as “ bizarre . ”

At the end of Rep .
Paul ’s speech , committee chairman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) pledged that his committee would probe the claims .
Days later , Frank wrote a letter to Bernanke asking for an internal investigation .
“ According to a 2008 book , ‘ Deception and Abuse at the Fed , ’ by University of Texas Professor Robert D. Auerbach , then - Fed Chairman Arthur Burns tried to block lawmakers ’ probes into the source of $ 6,300 found on the burglars of the Democratic National Committee ’s offices in Washington ’s Watergate complex in 1972 , ” Business Week noted .
“ Burns , who served as Fed chief from 1970 to 1978 , died in 1987 . ”
The report also noted that , the book ’s author had investigated the Fed prior to the Gulf War and saw his probe repeatedly obfuscated , only to discover that the Fed had completely neglected oversight on more than $ 5.5 billion which was sent to Iraq from a U.S. - based branch of an Italian bank in the 1980s .

Citing the Fed chairman ’s objection to allowing any oversight of its activities , Rep .
Paul asked if the Congress could perhaps be allowed to go back 10 years and open the bank ’s books , to study how the institution operated .
“ Would you like to know … what kind of shenanigans they ’re involved in with foreign countries and foreign central banks ? ” he asked .
“ Possibly , you ’re working right now to bail out Greece , for all we know . ”
“ I have no knowledge of anything remotely like what you ’ve just described , ” Bernanke replied .
“ I think eventually though , because this system is not viable … we will get to the point where something will have to be done about this financial system , ” Paul said .
An audit of the Federal Reserve is one of Rep .
Paul ’s core issues , and he ’s pursued it for 30 years , according to his Web site .
Paul ’s Audit the Fed bill obtained bipartisan majority support in the House and is currently pending in the Senate .
Sen .
Dodd ’s financial reform legislation does not include a Fed. audit .

Tweeting is no longer only an earthly phenomenon .
A NASA astronaut made Twitter history on Friday by sending the first tweet from outer space .
Flight Engineer T.J. Creamer broadcast the following message directly from the International Space Station :
" Hello Twitterverse !
We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station -- the 1st live tweet from Space ! :)
More soon , send your ? s "
Take that , Neil Armstrong .
First Tweets : Space and Beyond
The first tweet from space happened thanks to a software upgrade rolled out by NASA this week .
The upgrade gave Space Station astronauts direct personal access to the Web -- something never before possible -- using what NASA calls " the ultimate wireless connection . "
Previously , tweets from astronauts had to be e-mailed down to Earth , then later posted to Twitter by ground - based workers .
Creamer 's inaugural space - tweet will undoubtedly be remembered .
Plenty of other Twitter firsts , however , are more easily forgotten -- and there may be a reason why .
Here 's a look at the first tweets sent by some familiar Twitter users .
As you 'll see , most of them are n't exactly monumental .
( Note : Famous tweeter @GuyKawasaki is not included in this list , mainly just because he sends out way too many messages .
By my calculations , it'd take approximately 4,413 hours to sort through them all . )
Not -So-Famous First Tweets
• @ev ( Evan Williams , Twitter co-founder )
" just setting up my twttr "
Evidently , he had n't yet set up his vowels .
• @biz ( Biz Stone , Twitter co-founder )
" Ok we are in the car "
Well , it 's a step up from @ev 's first tweet -- you 've gotta give him that .
• @billgates ( Bill Gates , Microsoft chairman )
" ' Hello World . '
Hard at work on my foundation letter - publishing on 1/25 . "
Not nearly as exciting as the tweets Bill 's going to send in the future .
• @oprah ( Oprah Winfrey , media mogul )

I 'm not on MySpace or Facebook , but I decided to start Twittering .
Yee Haw ! "
Another medium to keep up with Mr. Hilton 's musings -- just what the world needed .
• @ParisHilton ( Paris Hilton , sex tape star )
" in Vegas at the Hard Rock with my Prince ... "
The only Hilton arguably worse to follow than Perez .
• @alyankovic ( " Weird Al " Yankovic , musician )

" Since people are complaining I have n't tweeted enough , here 's the entire text of ' Moby Dick ' by Herman Melville 140 characters at a time . "
God bless Weird Al .
• @Starbucks ( Starbucks , coffee company )
" Welcome to Starbucks Twitter land ! "
Amazing they are n't charging $ 4 per tweet yet , eh ?
Now , if only they 'd incorporate that Starbucks menu translating technology into their Twitter stream ...
• @ActuallyNPH ( Neil Patrick Harris , actor )
" My first tweet , peeps .
I apologize in advance for my slow learning curve .
Nice to ( sort of ) meet you .

Well - played , sir .
• @KimKardashian ( Kim Kardashian , professional celebrity )
" Hey guys it 's Kim Kardashian !

As a home business professional , you should ask yourself : “ What business am I in ? ” The answer is quite simple .
If your business has anything to do with people – and ALL businesses do – you are in the business of BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS .
Now many of you out there just getting started will ask yourselves am I truly ready to start building a true foundation that may have many bridges of people looking for what I am selling .
Do I have what it takes to do a home business that will draw people to me and keep it going ?
The answer is yes you do .
If you have considered working from home and creating a successful business then you have made the first step into a larger world .
When I and my wife started looking for new ways to generate income from home I had to face the idea that if I was going to do my home business I had to be all in .
No short cuts or skipped steps as to how I wanted my business to run .
If you are starting out you have to be all in .
Being all in means doing everything above and beyond what may be required to see success .
Now in building your relationships you will find that at first you do not know everything or are not the greatest speaker as to doing things perfect .
The fact is none of us are nor do we have to be .
You will find that people are not looking for the perfect answer to every question .
However they are looking for some one who can answer what they want to know in a way they can understand and duplicate .
No business can survive if it is not duplicatible and easy to understand .
Also you will find that your business must have a product that is something real and that works for your targeted prospects .
It takes a smart business and good product to take an innovative thought into a successful venture and achieve true success .
Remember , you do n’t decide what business you are in ; the people you are building bridges with decides that for you .
People will only buy what they want to buy , or are afraid not to buy , at a given moment in time .
It is for this reason alone that if you call people that have not requested your product or information your success rate will fail .
The business you choose must be a business with a plan that is affordable and helpful to those that are seeking to do business with you .
It must be a truthful business that has a good long standing reputation for its products and the results those products offer to a variety of people .
From the customer ’s point of view , your company exists only by the value it creates to provide results for them .
Beware that the nature of value is changing , involving new ways to sell items .
You need to think in terms of offers , to merge products and services , and to be innovative to give customers what they need today and tomorrow and the future .
Your relationships that you are building must always be a valued experience to your customer so they keep coming back to you .
Above all do not be afraid to think out of the box in your advertising or idea ’s to make your product new and fresh to those looking to join in your success .

In my interview with Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett , he said something that 's stuck with me :
C&B : With all of the work that you did in bringing basketball to Oklahoma City , including bringing the New Orleans team in to play during Katrina and the aftermath and bringing a franchise to the city permanently , can we assume that this was one of your initiatives as well ?
Mayor Cornett : Well , in a sense .
I want Oklahoma City to have the best brand of hockey that it can support .
I feel like we 're a really good hockey market , we 've supported hockey in the past and I think our market has matured to the point where we deserve and can support a higher level of play .
We almost got an NHL franchise in 1998 .
We came right on the edge of getting one , but I think Columbus got the franchise .
We were in the final running for it but did n't get it .
I think that was reflective of the growing market and the fact that we 've supported hockey .
What would the the NHL look like today if Oklahoma City would have been awarded the expansion franchise rather than Columbus ?
via www.sportslogos.net
SB Nation 's Oilers vs Blue Jackets coverage
The Cannon
It 's well - known that Columbus is struggling financially .
Even with a large bump in attendance , they are n't going to find a profit without a new revenue stream .
The NHL is a gate - driven business , so additional revenue streams are n't easy to come by .
That stream is n't going to come from television - they are only drawing about 15,000 households per game and with their miserable performance this year , it 's unlikely to rise as the season comes to a close .
Columbus is the 24th largest market in the NHL , with a metropolitan population of 1,773,120 .
With a small population , expected attendance numbers are n't going to compete with the hockey hotbeds or the enormous metropolitan areas like New York or Washington D.C , and they are n't close to competing .
As with any new franchise , the Blue Jackets ' attendance numbers were very strong early in their existence , but after the lockout and the lack of playoff hockey in Ohio for four years , attendance took a hit in 2005 and has been in bad shape ever since .
Columbus is in a tight spot .
They can't turn a profit , and have n't been able to ice a winner .
The NHL has a losing team with declining attendance and sagging television ratings .
Scott Howson is trying to save the franchise by fixing the mess he inherited , but has had a tough go of it thus far , even with the Blue Jackets ' playoff appearance last year .
What would have happened if the NHL decided to award an expansion franchise to Oklahoma City instead of Columbus ?
Firstly , the decision would have been panned , as Oklahoma City would be the 27th largest market in the league , with a metropolitan population of 1,206,152 .
Had Gary Bettman passed on markets like Milwaukee , Las Vegas , Kansas City , Columbus , Indianapolis and Houston for tiny Oklahoma City , the media , especially the Canadian media would have trashed Bettman for years - like they still do for the decision to award a franchise to Nashville , the 27th largest market in the NHL .
Rather than land a hockey team , Oklahoma City was the beneficiary of the Seattle Supersonics failed arena negotiations .
The Oklahoma City Thunder took to the hardwood in 2008 in Oklahoma City after leaving Seattle for a better facility and arena deal .
Like expansion hockey in Columbus , the new NBA franchise in Oklahoma City has drawn well .
Unlike Columbus , the numbers are n't going to start to fall off in Oklahoma City .
The big difference in the story of the Oklahoma City Thunder will be a playoff appearance .
The Thunder are on pace to make the playoffs this year and are fighting to host the first round of the playoffs in Oklahoma City .
Success brings fans through the turnstiles and Oklahoma City will likely continue to outdraw Columbus because of playoff successes .
The Blue Jackets did n't reach the playoffs until 2008 - 2009 and even then were bounced in the first round by the Detroit Red Wings .
Essentially , the failures of the Blue Jackets on the ice , on television and at the gate boil down to one decision - JMAC Hockey , LLC hiring Doug MacLean as President and General Manager of the club in 1998 .
MacLean 's record should speak for itself , but MacLean refuses to allow that .
He 's too busy talking about how wonderful he is .
How he comes to that conclusion is a mystery , but a quote from an interview earlier this year tells you all you need to know about Doug MacLean :
" I would like to say I 've looked at all their acquisitions and I think the team has , with their fan base right now , less credibility than they 've ever had in the history of the franchise .
It is a disaster there right now .
And Scott Howson has made -- I look at the contracts he 's stuck with next year -- they 've got to dig themselves out of a hole . "
The hole is so deep because MacLean spent ten years digging it .
MacLean 's record as General Manager and President of the Columbus Blue Jackets over ten years and seven seasons : 165W - 263L - 33T - 31OTL , 394 points for an average of 69 points per year .
Columbus failed to appear in the playoffs under MacLean 's reign - the only expansion team of the same era to do so .
So would the NHL be better off with the Oklahoma City Blue Jackets rather than the Columbus Blue Jackets ?
Yes , of course .
But not because of attendance , or television ratings .
The league would be better off in Oklahoma City right now because there exists the chance that the ownership group in Oklahoma City would have hired someone other than Doug MacLean to run hockey operations .
Valve is known for making quality first - person shooters :
The Half - Life series redefined how players think about the FPS genre , while titles like Team Fortress and Left 4 Dead took team - oriented multiplayer action to a whole new level .
But among Valve 's stable of popular shooters , one game stands alone : the mind - bending puzzler , Portal .
A small - scale experiment that was squeezed into 2007's The Orange Box alongside some powerful heavyweights , the love Portal received from fans was beyond anything Valve could have imagined , winning it a full - fledged , standalone sequel .
Our 12 - page cover story gives you the first details on Portal 2's new gameplay mechanics , storyline , and some surprising new twists .
Other features in April 's issue include a celebration of The Sim's 10th anniversary with creator Will Wright , and an interview with Yoshinori Kitase and Motomu Toriyama about the making of Final Fantasy XIII .
We also talk to PopCap founder Jason Kapalka about the state of casual gaming , then grill some big name developers to find out why games do n't feature more female protagonists in our 4 - page feature , The Gender Gap .
Additionally , it would n't be an April issue without the return of our irreverent doppelganger , Game Infarcer .
Hands - on previews of Alan Wake , Red Dead Redemption , and Lost Planet 2 are just a few of the upcoming games this issue covers , while reviews of Just Cause 2 , Dragon Age : Origins – Awakening , and the highly - anticipated God of War III round out the issue .
There are two versions of the cover this issue – the second one reverses the portals .
Here 's what it looks like :
And here are both versions in all their wraparound glory :
Subscribers can expect to receive their copy in the near future .

Webapps on App Engine , Part 5 : Sessions
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , coding , app - engine , tech , framework
This is part of a series on writing a webapp framework for App Engine Python .
For details , see the introductory post here .
Sessions are another component that 's regularly required by webapps , but is n't really a core part of a framework .
In this post , we 'll discuss the session mechanisms available for App Engine and how they work , and settle on a recommendation for our own lightweight framework .
The basic mechanism behind a session library is straightforward : A random session ID is generated for the user , which is embedded in an HTTP cookie and sent to the user .
Meanwhile , a record is created on the server with the same ID , containing any data the webapp wants to store about this user .
When the user makes a subsequent request , the session library decodes the session ID from the cookie header , and loads the corresponding session record from permanent storage .
There are three major advantages of handling sessions this way , rather than naively storing session data directly in the cookie :
We can store data that the client should n't be able to modify , such as the user 's access flags .
We can store data the client should n't even be able to read , or should n't be sent in the clear , such as their credentials .
We can store more data than can be practically carried in an HTTP cookie .
There are , of course , situations in which some of these constraints do n't apply .
Sometimes none of them apply , such as in the case of preference cookies ; sometimes size is not an issue , but we want integrity and / or confidentiality .
In these cases , many session libraries provide " cookie only " sessions , which store the data entirely in the cookie , while adding signing and / or encryption to prevent tampering or reading of the cookie data by the user .
Using cookie - only sessions has one major advantage :
You remove the necessity to retrieve the user 's data from storage on each request .
This needs to be balanced with the limited storage on the one hand , and the need to embed a secret key in your code that can be used to sign and verify the cookies .
For non-cookie sessions , the session data needs to be stored somewhere .
Many systems use the local filesystem , but this is n't practical in the case of distributed systems like App engine .
On App Engine , that leaves us with two main options : Memcache , and the datastore .
Memcache initially seems like quite an attractive option , as it's substantially faster to query and update than the datastore .
This comes with a major caveat , though : Since memcache makes no guarantees about how long values will persist , there 's absolutely no guarantee that your session will still be around when the user comes back for it .
Losing the occasional user session does n't seem like to much of a problem at first , but there are several factors that need consideration .
If you 're using sessions to implement a shopping site , losing a user 's session is the absolute last thing you want to do :
A user who suddenly loses the contents of their shopping cart is quite likely to simply leave , costing you one or even multiple sales .
Even if sales are n't involved , if users regularly get logged out of their accounts , they may grow frustrated with your site and leave .
Ad - hoc testing is n't sufficient to establish how much of an issue this is , either : Problems may not come up when you test the system with a reasonable load , but may instead occur when the system 's under heavy load .
The other option , of course , is the Datastore .
At the cost of a little extra latency , we gain near perfect reliability .
With proper design , fetching the session should only require a single datastore get operation , too - no queries , which are much more expensive .
Hybrid approaches are of course also possible :
We can store to both memcache and the datastore , and fetch from one , then the other , thus minimizing latency whenever memcache is available .
Solutions
Enough theorizing - let 's take a look at the ready - made sessions libraries for App Engine .
The first one is Beaker .
Beaker is a standalone library for session handling , implemented as WSGI middleware .
It also includes caching middleware .
Beaker supports App Engine datastore sessions , though an open bug means that the library currently needs some modification to work on App Engine ( Edit : Now fixed ! ) .
Using Beaker is a matter of downloading and unpacking it into your app's root directory , then opening beaker / cache.py and deleting or commenting out lines 29 through 51 - the section dealing with pkg_resources , which is unavailable on App Engine - as well as line 10 , which imports pkg_resources .
To use Beaker , we simply insert it as middleware , like this :
router = WSGIRouter ( ) #... beaker_opts = { ' session.type ' : ' ext : google ' , } application = beaker .
SessionMiddleware ( router )
The session . type configuration option tells beaker what session storage to use - in this case , the Google datastore .
Beaker also supports memcached - although not App Engine 's implementation of it - and cookie - only sessions , which can be enabled by setting session .
type to " cookie " , and session .
secret to a secret key for hashing and encrypting the cookie .
Another sessions implementation is provided by gaeutilities .
gaeutilities supports datastore , memcache , and pure - cookie sessions .
Using gaeutilities ' sessions is even simpler :
session = appengine_utilities.sessions .Session ( ) session [ " keyname " ] = " value " # sets keyname to value print session [ " keyname " ] # will print value
As you can see , no middleware is required in this case - gaeutilities takes advantage of App Engine 's use of the system environment to retrieve session data .
gaeutilities also includes features such as token rotation to make session hijacking more difficult , while Beaker uses only a single session ID .
One quick caveat : Unlike beaker , gaeutilities does not encrypt or sign cookie - only sessions , so they should only be used for data where user tampering is not a concern .
Conclusion
We 've looked at two good sessions libraries for App Engine .
Either one would be a good choice for our framework .
Given the current state , however , gaeutilities seems like the better choice :
It does n't require modifications to work , it 's built specifically for App Engine , and if you need a lightweight library , you can easily take just the session handling code and not include the rest of the library .

Already Republicans plan on introducing a bill this week to repeal last night 's historic healthcare vote .
Obviously that 's going nowhere .
But looking out , Republicans will probably try to run on repeal in the runup until November .
It 's possible that will play okay at the ballot ( we do n't know ) but anyone who thinks this is a realistic prospect is smoking something illegal .
First of all , to repeal the vote would be just as difficult legislatively as passing healthcare was , so just think of how hard that was .
Republicans would need 60 pro-repeal votes in the Senate to defeat a Democratic filibuster .
And remember , they 'd need a President who would n't veto the bill ( i.e. not Obama or any Democrat ) .
But even that 's putting too fine a point on it .
Here 's the real story , and it gets down to the fact that this new bureaucratic superstructure is now permanently ossified into our federal government .
There 's just no way to repeal benefits .
Even if people do n't seem to like the new plan , there 's no way a politician successfully runs on some combination of : let 's go back to when insurance companies could exclude you for pre-existing conditions and let 's go back to when your kid gets kicked off your healthcare plan the moment he or she gets out of college .
See the problem ?
It 's the same reason no other benefit or entitlement will ever disappear .
Now do n't miss the 15 new taxes that The Democrats just foisted on America >
Yesterday we told you about a poll that showed Gumby -- theoretically -- locked in a tie against President Obama in the 2012 presidential election .
Today , another interesting poll ...
How would you describe the Tea Party movement ?
Well , if you went to MSNBC you 'd probably find something unflattering .
Over at FOX News , on the other hand , you 'd expect to see something quite positive about the group .
That 's what makes a poll on the FOX News website stand out .
Who are you ?
FOX asked its visitors :
What do you think the tea party movement is about ?
Of the nearly quarter million votes cast , the overwhelming majority of the respondents ( 80 percent ) clicked on the choice entitled : " Fruitless mix of racism , conspiracy theories . "
Only 13 percent chose : " Small government and fiscal responsibility , " while five percent selected : " Voicing outrage at out - of - touch politicians . "
The remaining two percent split their votes between : " Exposing Democrats ' Socialist agenda " and " Other . "
And this is the FOX News web site ?
Of course , it 's not a scientific poll and they clearly mention that on their site .
Poll hijacked
So what happened ?
Looks like the poll was hijacked .
Over at the conservative FreeRepublic forum , readers blame users of the social news website Reddit for sabotaging the results .
Under a post entitled , " Reddit Loonies Hijack FoxNews Poll , " outraged forum faithful expressed dismay at the losing battle .
But , it was technically flawed in the first place according to one user calling himself " BornToBeAmerican . "
" Whoever the dingbat is who put that poll up needs a flogging , " he / she writes .
" Only a complete idiot would put a poll up that let ’s the voter , vote more than once ( without at least changing subnet IP addresses ) . "
Ends justify the means
They have a point .
On a very active thread over on Reddit , users discuss how to overtake the poll by casting multiple times .
But , it 's all justified writes one Reddit user .
" Every poll we highjack is one less poll we can prevent Fox from saying ' Well the majority of Americans think .....'
It makes a small difference I think , " writes Phogasmic .
There 's not total consensus , though , that participation in the poll is a good thing .
" Honestly , the best thing to do is to IGNORE Fox news .
The more you idiots talk about how wrong they are , the more attention they get as a station .
Ignore them into oblivion , " counsels one participant .
" Talking about the makes them more powerful .
Not unlike Freddy Kruger , huh ? "
All for nothing
Anyone pay much attention to these polls ?
Not really .
Even if the scientific political polls are being ignored this time of year .
A presidential Gallup poll out yesterday was deemed almost worthless for its predictive value by a Gallup pollster .

Craig Ferguson is the late - night TV host who does n't think of himself as one .
He despises the suits he has to wear for the camera and enjoys fooling with the blueprint of a celebrity - driven talk show .
On a recent episode of his " Late Late Show " on CBS , he went without his usual studio audience and devoted the show to conversing with one guest , actor and writer Stephen Fry .
Before launching his late - night career in 2005 ( with help from David Letterman 's production company ) , the Glasgow native worked as an actor , a bartender and a punk - rock drummer , among other vocations .
Mr. Ferguson , who became a U.S. citizen in 2008 , ...
To create a day - by - day look at the city ’s traffic , officials crunched GPS information from nearly every yellow taxi trip taken in Manhattan ’s business district — from 60th Street to the Battery — between November 2008 and October 2009 .
In that 12 - month period , weekday traffic in the district moved at an average of 9.5 miles per hour — about the speed of a farmyard chicken at full gallop .
Thursday , Nov. 13 was the slowest weekday of the year studied , with an average speed of 7.5 m.p.h. — about the speed of the typical jogger in Central Park .
Excluding federal holidays , the fastest weekday : Monday , Sept. 28 , at a speed of 11.7 m.p.h .
The four fastest days to drive in Manhattan , in order of average speed : New Year ’s Day , Christmas , Memorial Day and July 4 .
( Thanksgiving Day ?
Hindered , presumably , by the Macy ’s parade . )
On weekdays , speeds predictably peak between 5 and 6 in the morning ( at a jaunty 16 m.p.h. ) , then decline sharply in the morning rush .
Not so predictably , speeds then stay low all day , even midday when commuters are at work .
Traffic barely improves until the evening rush wanes about 7 p.m. , hovering around 9 m.p.h. for much of the day .
Officials blame the midday congestion on a high level of commercial deliveries , which can clog side streets and stop up intersections .
The data has helped officials as they consider raising daytime street parking rates to ease traffic tangles in Midtown .
( CNN ) -- Hundreds of people were evacuated Sunday amid flood concerns after a long - dormant volcano erupted beneath a glacier in south Iceland .
It was the first time since 1821 that the volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier has erupted .
More than 600 people were evacuated as scientists monitored a fissure in the volcano from which lava was erupting .
The fissure measured about 1,640 to 3,281 feet ( 500 to 1,000 meters ) .
Despite the remote location of the eruption , if the fissure " develops further towards the glacier , the melting floodwater ... will create dangerous floods in a populated area in south Iceland , " said Gudrun Johannesdottir , a project manager for Iceland 's Joint Rescue and Coordination Center .
The country 's civil protection agency did not immediately record any injuries or damage .
Eyjafjallajokull is about 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) east of the capital , Reykjavik .
Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008
A report into the collapse of Lehman Brothers criticises senior executives and auditor Ernst & Young for serious lapses that led to the firm 's collapse .
The report says Lehman was insolvent for weeks before it went bankrupt , sparking a global financial meltdown .
It accuses management of " actionable balance sheet manipulation " and using accounting tricks to hide debts .
Ernst &
Young said that its last audit of Lehman was " fairly presented " according to accounting rules .
The collapse of the 158 - year - old investment bank in September 2008 was the world 's largest bankruptcy .
Wall Street , the City of London , and the US and UK governments tried to organise a rescue , fearing - rightly - that Lehman 's failure would set off a chain reaction around the globe .
Possible claims Friday 's 2,200 - page forensic analysis into what went wrong says there could be grounds for legal action against former executives .
Lawyer Anton Valukas , who led the inquiry , stops short of saying that there was systematic wrong - doing at the firm .
And he pointed out that senior executives had used their business judgment and were largely not liable for the firm 's collapse .
Repo 105 is about to enter the lexicon of shameful accounting and financial techniques
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog Nevertheless , Mr Valukas said creditors could have grounds for legal action for negligence or breach of fiduciary duty against its former chief executive Dick Fuld and chief financial officers Chris O'Meara , Erin Callan and Ian Lowitt .
Mr Valukas said there was also sufficient evidence to support a possible claim that Ernst & Young had been " negligent " and that Lehman 's liquidators could pursue claims against the firm for " professional malpractice " .
Repo 105
Much of the report , which took evidence from all the major parties involved in Lehman 's collapse and attempts to rescue the firm , contains allegations about an accounting " gimmick " known as " Repo 105 " .
This is a legal accounting device that involves shifting around assets to reduce the size of a company 's balance sheet , and effectively give the appearance that debts have been cut .
It was a gimmick that Lehman used increasingly as its problems mounted .
Mr Valukas said Repo 105 was used to " give the appearance that Lehman was reducing its overall debt " levels in 2008 when in reality it was not .
The report estimates that Lehman used the practice to temporarily remove $ 50bn of assets from its balance sheet in 2008 alone .
Lehman began using Repo 105 in 2001 , but the practice was " dramatically " ramped up from late 2007 , the report said .
An e-mail from Bart McDade , former head of equities , suggested Lehman was addicted to Repo 105 .
" I am very aware ... it is another drug we 're on , " he wrote .
London appears to have played a key role in approving Lehman 's use of Repo 105 .
The report says Lehman at first tried to find a US law firm that would approve its shifting around of assets .
Unable to get US clearance , Lehman turned to London law firm Linklaters , which advised that the practice was allowed under UK law .
So , assets Lehman wanted to " hide " were transferred to the London operation , which would " conduct the [ Repo ] transaction on their behalf , " the report said .
Wall Street 's role
The report says that Lehman had received warnings about the accounting device from Martin Kelly , the firm 's former global financial controller .

Yet , " certain of Lehman 's officers breached their fiduciary duties by exposing Lehman to potential liability for filing materially misleading periodic reports , and Ernst & Young was professionally negligent in allowing those reports to go unchallenged , " the report said .
An attorney for Mr Fuld said on Thursday that the former Lehman boss " did not know what those [ Repo ] transactions were " .
" He did n't structure them or negotiate them , nor was he aware of their accounting treatment , " his attorney Patricia Hynes said .
Ernst &
Young said in a statement : " Our last audit of the company was for the fiscal year ending November 30 , 2007 .
Our opinion indicated that Lehman 's financial statements for that year were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) , and we remain of that view . "
A Linklaters spokesperson said : " The US Examiner 's report into the failure of Lehman Brothers includes references to English Law opinions which Linklaters gave in relation to a number of Lehman transactions .
" The Examiner - who did not contact the firm during his investigations - does not criticise those opinions or say or suggest that they were wrong or improper .
We have reviewed the opinions and are not aware of any facts or circumstances which would justify any criticism . "

Should probably rewrite the recipe , but the one given here is a great base and probably worthy of the 4 forks on it's own .
As many of the reviewers I used a combo of white and dark bone in / skin on chicken .
For spices I used 1 1/ 4 tsp sweet paprika , 1/2 tsp. cumin , 1 / 4 tsp cayeene pepper , 1/2 tsp. ginger , 1/4 tsp. coriander and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon .
Followed the recipe prep but added 1 Tbsp. honey , cup of carrot coins and several quartered small turnips from my CSA bag along with the broth , wine and olives ( combo of green and kalamata because it was what I had on hand ) .
Served it with couscous cooked in chicken broth with dried cranberries and toasted almonds tossed in during fluffing .
Absolutely yummy !!
Only change I would make for next time would be to increase slightly the amount of preserved lemons ( homemade of course ) !
DALLAS — Texas Gov. Rick Perry rode a wave of anti-Washington sentiment to victory Tuesday in the hard - fought Republican gubernatorial primary , beating U.S. Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison .
Notching what he described as a victory for American conservatism , Mr. Perry also avoided an expensive and time - consuming runoff .
Ms. Hutchison conceded when it appeared almost certain he would get more than half the vote .

The father of civilisation : Alexander the Great 's hunger for knowledge gave us everything from the Old Testament to algebra and even robots
There is not , and has never been , another city to match it .
It was a glittering metropolis , home to the most sexually charismatic queen of all time , founded by a man whose megalomaniac ambitions knew no bounds .
It was a buzzing hub that boasted one of the seven wonders of the world , where intellectual geniuses from both East and West met to tussle and debate in a library containing all the knowledge on the planet .
Founded more than 2,300 years ago , and in its hey - day one of the most powerful places in the world , this is now a lost city , most of it buried beneath waves off the coast of modern Egypt .
Alexander the Great : The Greek leader made Alexandria a place of knowledge , discovery and sexual intrigues
This is the city of Alexandria .
By rights , Alexandria should be a household name , as famous as Athens or Rome .
Make no mistake , this was a metropolis as beautiful as Paris , as creative as London , as hip as New York and more learned than Harvard .
And yet , as I discovered while researching a new documentary , somehow this amazing urban experiment is just a footnote in history .
Luckily for us , the secrets of this wonder of the ancient world are being unearthed , as archaeologists uncover more and more from its lost treasures .
Alexandria is irresistible .
It aches with harsh romance .
It was home to sexual intrigues , to treacherous power - grabs and to the birth of religious fundamentalism .
Caesar , Cleopatra , Mark Antony , Euclid , Galen , Archimedes all walked its streets .
For its wild and heady festivals , Alexandrian inventors would construct brilliantly eccentric ' living machines ' that roamed the elegantly appointed , granite - paved streets .
Steam - powered lions , trees full of singing mechanical birds , once even a house - size snail that trailed fake slime on the flagstones as it slithered along - these were all created to wow the Alexandrian populace and dumbstruck visitors .
Here Cleopatra 's ancestors paraded an 80ft phallus tipped with stars towards a 120 ft round , gem - encrusted wreath .
Little surprise Alexandria was a city for such heady flights of fancy - given that it was founded because of a dream .
In around 332BC , the Greek leader Alexander the Great - so - called because his audacious plan was to take over the known world - had a vision .
Tossing and turning in bed one night , perhaps disturbing his bedmate ( a boy or a girl - Alexander 's prodigious sexual energy meant he loved both ) , an old , bearded man appeared to him .
The story went that this was the ghost of Homer , and he pointed the young Greek king towards a mysterious place called Pharos .
Alexander 's generals got out their maps .
Pharos was an island off the rugged coast of Egypt .
This was where the mighty conqueror would found the centre of his new world .
Treasures in the deep : Many ancient artefacts , like this statue , are submerged in Alexandria 's eastern harbour in Egypt
Alexander the Great had already won over Egypt , through a ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
Whereas the Persians had previously fire - stormed through the region , torching temples , beheading priests and intimidating locals , Alexander 's approach was softly , softly .
Worship your god in the shape of a mummified bull ?
No problem , he told the locals , I will too .
Believe your leaders are living gods ?
I can be the greatest living god of them all , he vowed .
As a result , his colonisation of Egypt was swift and absolute .
Within a few years , Alexandria was the capital of Egypt - and Alexander was its ruler .
And so Alexandria became a show city of the future .
Its architects had laid out the street plan by scattering barley - flour in a grid - pattern on the sand .
And when it was built , grand central avenue was lined with street lights fired with olive oil and flanked by theatres , markets , lecture halls and giant temples - one of which could be seen for miles out to sea .
Cisterns brought fresh water to all quarters of the city .
There was a zoo and the world 's first museum .
One visitor declared : ' It is impossible to describe it adequately , but the city is so adorned with immense columned courts , life - like statues , and a multitude of other great works that , save for the Capitol [ in Rome ] … the world can offer nothing more magnificent . '
But this was n't a city built just for display .
Because Alexander believed that he should , and could , conquer the world , his generals set about acquiring for him the kind of knowledge that would make him supremely powerful .
Anthony and Cleopatra :
The famous couple , immortalised on film by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor , were at home in the metropolis of Alexandria
As time went on , special agents were dispatched in ships to collect precious documents from far and wide .
Philosophies , plays and great works of literature were brought back .
But much of the information collected from the four corners of the world was brilliantly pragmatic .
And so here linguistic codes were cracked , water - clocks and steam - engines invented and great discoveries made .
Alexandrians built the first robot , which clanked its way through the theatres of the city , powered inside by carefully controlled falling sand .
They gave us the first automatic doors ( using a complicated system of hydraulics and pulleys , temple doors would ' magically ' swing open ) .
They developed a primitive form of jet power , using tiny steam - shafts that kept objects hovering in the air as if on invisible strings .
They even gave us the first slot machine , which dispensed holy water to delighted worshippers .
A huge library was built to house this sum of human knowledge .
At its height it contained between 500,000 and 750,000 books .
Scribes assiduously copied one tome after another .
The scratch of their reed pens on papyrus filled the air , and they came to be known as the ' chatterers ' .
With such intellectual stimulus on offer , the city soon attracted the finest minds from across the globe .
The mathematician Eratosthenes flourished here , and by simply watching the changing lengths of the Egyptian sun 's shadows , he measured the circumference of the Earth .
Bloodthirsty and hungry for knowledge : Alexander , seen here portrayed by Colin Farrell , planned to take over the known world
His calculation was 24,662 miles - just less than 200 miles short of the true figure .
Another sage , Aristarchus , proved that the Earth revolved around the sun and understood , way before others , that the Earth , sun and moon had to be seen in relation to one another if they were to be measured .
Soon after , Euclid devised the system of geometry that still torments our schoolchildren today .
This was also where the Old Testament was preserved for future generations .
It was said that 72 of the best scholars who spoke both Hebrew and Greek worked for 72 days in 72 separate cells to translate the old testament texts into Greek .
Their efforts - named then and today ' the Septuagint ' - were not wasted .
The Old Testament only survives into the 21st - century thanks to the men of Alexandria in the 2nd- century BC .
Medicine was pioneered here , too .
If you had walked through the public lecture rooms that pock - marked the city , you might have found eager young doctors performing unspeakable experiments on animals to prove their theories .
One man , Galen , revolutionised neuroscience under that hot Egyptian sun .
He proved that the brain is the pinnacle of the central nervous system , and that feelings stem from our mind rather than our heart .
These were breakthrough discoveries .
Galen ended up court doctor to the Caesars , operating on traumatised gladiators , whose wounds he described as ' windows into the body ' .
But it was Alexandria - with its unique mix of Egyptian , Roman , Greek and Eastern influences - that really allowed Galen to flourish .
Through much of the Eastern Mediterranean , people were a bit squeamish about human innards .
Tampering with all that oozy material was taboo : thought to infect the air , to create a miasma of pollution .
The brain , for instance , was viewed as rather disgusting .
But since Egyptians loved their mummification ( they would pull the brain out through the nose to stop it rotting in the skull ) Galen was able to indulge in high - end dissection .
Organs and body parts were easily available here .
His anatomical discoveries about the human body - and the aid this brought to thousands of sick men and women across the world - would not be bettered for 1,500 years .
Indeed , it is only by comprehending what an intellectually brilliant city Alexandria was that the famous story of Queen Cleopatra makes sense .
Although this ruler of Egypt clearly was a woman of enormous physical charisma , she was not just an ancient pin-up , but a highly intelligent philosopher and a mathematician .
It could be that Cleopatra killed herself not just because she did not want to be paraded through the streets of Rome as a prisoner of war , but because the idea of life in any city other than Alexandria was simply unbearable .
The theatricality of the great queen 's death is strangely appropriate for the city .
Today , to get up close to the Alexandrians your best bet is to descend 35 meters into the Earth to Alexandria 's necropolis - a city of the dead .
Down there , Alexander is almost certainly buried , and for centuries his body was on display within a crystal - cut coffin .
You can still walk through the catacombs , through subterranean rock - cut colonnades , gorgeously ornate , under the watchful eye of sphinxes , Medusas and Pharonic eagles ( the symbol for Egypt even today ) .
Tombs here are guarded by dog - headed centurions .
Cleopatra 's Needle : A piece of Ancient Alexandria that stands on the Embankment in London
But thanks to earthquakes and subsidence , vast areas of Cleopatra 's palatial complex have disappeared beneath the modern port of Alexandria .
When I was there just a couple of weeks ago , one archaeologist excitedly pointed to the torso of a 30ft high statue - lying , seaweed covered , on the sea bed .
There are many hundreds of other treasures , just eight metres or so beneath the surface of the water , waiting to be excavated .
But oddly for us Brits , there is a splendid fragment of Alexandria still visible in the UK , day in day out .
It is a red- granite Egyptian obelisk , now affectionately known as Cleopatra 's Needle , which stands on the Embankment in London .
Originally dating from 1,450 BC it was bequeathed to Britain by Egyptians grateful for Nelson 's part in quelling Napoleon 's ambitions to control Africa .
Cleopatra 's Needle was witness to both the brilliance and brutality of Golden Age Alexandria .
It was , in fact , witness to an horrific murder .
One of the neglected , mysterious characters of Alexandria , who is at last getting the recognition she deserves ( in books and a new film starring Rachel Weisz ) is a woman called Hypatia .
A mathematician and philosopher , Hypatia ran the great philosophy school of the city where pagans , Jews and Christians studied together .
She was a famed beauty , with a beautiful mind .
Obsessed with the journey of the stars , she used her mathematical and geometrical knowledge to try to map them , and deduce why the Earth revolved around the sun .
But as the years went on , and a new puritanical force appeared in the city , Hypatia 's studies were deemed dangerous - an unnatural , demonic pursuit .
Although Alexandria had been a remarkably tolerant place , men and women from East and West , pagans , Christians and Jews allowed to work alongside one another , one faction of the fledgling Christian church wanted total political control of the city .
Hypatia was on her way back to her house one afternoon , when she was dragged from her carriage and stripped naked .
For a noble - born woman this was a terrible disgrace .
But then things got worse .
The mob pulled her into the nearby temple - originally built for Caesar and recently converted into a church - where they flayed her alive with pieces of broken pot and roof tiles .
Still not satisfied , they tore her limb from limb and burnt her body parts at the edge of the city .
To all intents and purposes this was a witch 's death .
Hypatia 's assassination marks the end of an epoch .
The end of the ancient , pagan world - and the beginning of the troubled , modern era .
From the death of Hypatia onwards , rival factions battled for control of the city .
In 641 AD , as Arab forces swept along the coast , what was left of Alexandria 's great libraries were burnt in a whirlwind of battle fires .
Today , we have just 1 per cent of its contents .
The rest has been lost for ever .
Alexandria begins as a fairy tale and ends a horror story .
For this reason alone , we should not bury its memory .

TECHNIK -HAUS DER ZUKUNFT
Intelligente Öfen , lebende Teppiche , Roboter - Butler und Betten , die Sie daran erinnern , Sex zu haben … Willkommen in Ihrem Zuhause von morgen .
Schnappt euch die Schlüssel und packt eure Kisten aus .
Es ist Zeit , in die Zukunft zu gehen .
Aber bevor Sie die Schwelle überschreiten und Ihrem Roboter - Butler befehlen , den Wasserkocher aufzusetzen , nehmen Sie sich einen Moment Zeit und bewundern Sie diese technische Meisterleistung .
UMWELT IN DIE MODERNE TECHNIK EINBEZIEHEN
Zuerst einmal sind die traditionellen Lehmziegel draußen .
Zukünftige Häuser dürften umweltfreundlich sein und auf CO² - belastete Herstellungsprozesse verzichten .
Ihr Haus kann Bausteine enthalten , die aus natürlichem Zement bestehen , der von Bakterien produziert wird oder aus Pilzen hergestellt werden – in der Tat erforschen mehrere Unternehmen wie MycoWorks und EvocativeDesign das Potenzial von Materialien auf Pilzbasis .
Alternativ , wenn Retro - Chic Ihr Ding ist , scheinen super isolierende Strohballen - Paneele eine Renaissance zu erleben .
Auch an den Dächern wird man hart arbeiten .
Zu den Innovationen , die sich durchsetzen könnten , gehören super - reflektierende Ziegel für Menschen in sengenden Klimazonen und für den Rest von uns Biosolardächer , die Lebensraum für Bestäuber mit energieerzeugenden Platten kombinieren .
Selbstreinigende Oberflächen , die bereits auf dem Markt sind , werden ebenfalls aufgerüstet .
Aufbauend auf den bewährten grimmigen Eigenschaften von Titandioxid entwickeln die Forscher Farben , die auch bei Kratzern , Schürfwunden oder Schürfwunden den Glanz des Äußeren erhalten .
Diese geschwungene Einfahrt wird übrigens nicht aus knirschendem , knirschendem Kies bestehen .
Oh nein .
Ausgehend von den niederländischen Plänen für Autobahnen , die aus Kunststoffabfällen aus dem Meer gebaut wurden , könnte Ihre Auffahrt beheizt werden , um das Schneeschaufeln im Winter zu vermeiden und Ladestationen für Ihr selbstfahrendes Elektroauto ( hier ist der Beitrag zu den Autos der Zukunft ) zu haben .
DIGITALFARBTÖNE – GARDINENFARBE AUF KNOPFDRUCK ÄNDERN
Ihr Garten wird wahrscheinlich auch eine Verschmelzung von Tradition und Technologie sehen – Geräte wie Blossom überwachen bereits Wetterberichte , um die Bewässerung Ihres Rasens zu regulieren , während Roboter - Rasenmäher ihn sauber schneiden – aber das aufkeimende
Feld der digitalen Kunst könnte es Ihnen endlich ermöglichen , das hässliche Wasserspiel abzuschütteln und Ihren Rasen mit schönen und veränderbaren Statuen und Klanglandschaften zu bereichern , die in virtuellen Räumen entstehen .
Für die Blumenliebhaber werden Multisensor - Geräte wie die seltsam geformte Parrot Flower Power und der Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor alles von der Bodensäure bis zur Temperatur im Auge behalten , obwohl , da die Pflanzen auf diesem Planeten seit mehr als 700 Millionen Jahren ohne sie auskommen , Sie auch mit einem Trug und einer Tasse Kaffee bedient werden können .
Und wenn
Sie sich immer noch Sorgen machen , mit den Joneses Schritt zu halten , können Sie zumindest aufhören , die Gardinen zu knistern : Firmen wie Sonte behaupten , ihre WiFi- fähigen Digitalfarbtöne könnten auf Knopfdruck von opak auf transparent umgestellt werden .
So könnten Häuser der Zukunft aussehen :
TECHNIK IM SCHLAFZIMMER
Technik und Schlaf sind unwahrscheinlich wichtig : Seit Jahren zeigen Wissenschaftler mit den Fingern auf diejenigen , die in Begleitung der strahlend blauen Lichter ihrer angeschlossenen Geräte ins Bett gehen .
Aber wenn es um den Snooze - Modus geht , muss Technologie kein Alptraum sein .
Weiße Rauschgeneratoren wie die von Ectones sind bereits erhältlich und bieten die Möglichkeit , verspielte Füchse , zwitschernde Vögel und zankende Kinder mit dem beruhigenden Geräusch eines Ventilators oder prasselnden Regens zu übertönen .
Aber das ist ein Tropfen auf den heißen Stein im Vergleich zu dem , was die Zukunft bringen könnte .
3D-KLANGLANDSCHAFT ZUM WOHLFÜHLEN
Anstatt eines Lautsprechers in der Ecke , warum nicht in eine eindringliche , selbstgeformte 3D - Klanglandschaft abtauchen – Wellen , die zu Ihren Füßen flattern , Palmen , die über Ihrem Kopf rascheln , Ihr linkes Ohr , das von der Kuh eines Papageis gestreichelt wird , während der Schlag eines Kolibris in Ihrer Rechten flattert ?
Es mag himmlisch klingen , aber wie Installationen von Klangkünstlern wie Martyn Ware gezeigt haben , ist es auch praktisch möglich .
Besser noch , mit dem Aufkommen von direktionalen Audiogeräten , wie denen von Dakota Audio , die in der Lage sind , den Klang mit laserähnlicher Präzision zu strahlen , könnte Ihr Begleiter gleichzeitig in eine ganz andere Umgebung transportiert werden , sei es eine stürmische arktische Tundra , eine bukolische Weide oder das Innere ihres Traumautos .
Und wenn
Sie dann auch noch tief durchatmen wollen , dann werden Sie froh sein , dass auch die Luftqualität verbessert werden soll : Intelligente Monitore wie der Foobot und Birdi stehen bereits zum Verkauf , die von toxischen Gasen über Pollen bis hin zu flüchtigen organischen Verbindungen alles aufspüren können .
Wann diese an Reinigungssysteme angeschlossen werden , liegt noch in der Luft .
Dies ist ein Beitrag von der WohnInspiration .
An aggressive secular agenda has forced several major church denominations to withdraw from the Government ’s advisory body on religion .
The Times reports that The Religion and Belief Consultative Group is on the brink of disbanding following what the Church of England called an “ impasse ” in meetings between secularists and religious believers .
“ The British Humanist Association and the National Secular Society use the group to argue for the exclusion of religious voices from public life ” , Dr Malcolm Brown , the Church of England ’s representative on the group , said .
Degenerated
Dr Brown added : “ Despite the most careful chairing , every meeting has degenerated into an impasse between the secular and the religious voices .
“ The group is not fit for purpose as a consultative body . ”
The Church of England , the Roman Catholic Church , the Methodist Church and the Salvation Army have all left the group .
Representatives of the Islamic faith had already departed and now only Hindus , Baha ’is and secularists remain .
Assumption
The forum consults with the Equality and Human Rights Commission on a “ semi- formal ” basis .
Dr Brown , the Church of England ’s Director of Mission and Public Affairs , said the EHRC “ needs to find ways to consult with all its stakeholders without assuming that we can sit around a table with those whose objective is to remove us from that table ” .
Keith Porteous - Wood and Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society ( NSS ) , accused the Christian denominations of leaving because they were “ not getting their way ” .
The religious forum receives no public money and attendance is voluntary .
Campaign
Last year two prominent writers warned that an influential elite class of secularists is attempting to push faith out of the public square .
Daily Telegraph commentator Ed West said groups like the NSS are gaining success in their campaign for a “ state where religion is only allowed in private ” .
And Tim Montgomerie , the editor of a Conservative blog , warned of “ a secular fundamentalism that is trying to push people of faith outside the public square ” .
Here ’s a bit of interesting news from a Dutch newspaper .
WUWT readers may recall this story :
Scientist quits : ‘ I do n’t want to remain a member of an organization that … screws up science that badly . ’
Henk Tennekes Resigns from Dutch Academy .
Now there is a new twist to the story .
From Lawrence Solomon : De Telegraaf , the Netherlands ’ largest daily newspaper , has totally vindicated the country ’s most prominent global warming denier in a prominent article entitled “ Henk Tennekes – He was right after all . ”
Tennekes was the director of the Netherlands Meteorological Institute , KNMI , until the early 1990s , when his skepticism of the climate science coming out of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change led to his forced resignation .
A translation into English of De Telegraaf ’s vindication appears here .

Stephen Hawking plans ' to leave Britain over Government cuts in science '
Professor Stephen Hawking is planning to abandon Cambridge University after nearly 50 years and move to Canada in protest at Government cuts .
The world 's most famous physicist has become frustrated with falling university budgets , which he believes are scuppering scientific discoveries .
The departure of Professor Hawking , who began work in Cambridge in 1962 , would be a massive blow to the university and to British scholarship .
Famed : Professor Stephen Hawking , best - selling author of A Brief History Of Time , believes falling university budgets are scuppering scientific discoveries
The 68 - year - old - who has made key advances in theoretical physics while almost completely paralysed by motor neurone disease - said restrictions in grants mean scientific research in Britain is increasingly focused on its industrial application rather than the pursuit of knowledge and discovery .
The best - selling author of A Brief History Of Time is to spend two months at the Perimeter Institute , in Ontario , this summer and , if all goes to plan , hopes to make the move permanent .
Yesterday his spokesman said Professor Hawking ' remained heavily critical of the Government 's policy on science funding ' , saying it risked ending Britain 's history of world - class thinkers .
In an attempt to reduce the Government 's deficit , cuts to higher education amounting to roughly £ 1 billion over three years have been announced .
His graduate assistant Sam Blackburn said : ' Professor Hawking is considering a move but it would depend on whether his trip to the institute is successful . '
However , a move abroad would present Professor Hawking with difficulties as his disability means he requires an entourage including carers and a graduate assistant to operate his voice synthesiser .
New move ?
Prof Hawking will spend two months at the Perimeter Institute in Ontario this summer
And he would leave behind his adapted home and members of his family from his first marriage to Jane Hawking , with whom he was reconciled in 2007 after a divorce from second wife Elaine Mason .
Professor Hawking would follow his former colleague Neil Turok , an authority on mathematical physics , who left for the institute in 2008 .
Professor Turok has said the ' door is open ' for Professor Hawking to join him permanently and has stated that the physicist 's summer visit ' is the first of many ' .
In contrast to Cambridge , the Perimeter Institute - set up seven years ago by Mike Lazaridis , the creator of the BlackBerry handheld device - has raised substantial funding from private donations .
It is ironic that Professor Hawking would leave Cambridge , which has arguably done more to advance the understanding of science than any university in the world .
It is where Charles Darwin formulated the theory of evolution and Francis Crick and James Watson identified the structure of DNA .
Professor Hawking 's distant predecessor as its Lucasian Professor of Mathematics , Sir Isaac Newton , founded modern science with his laws of motion and gravity .
A spokesman for Cambridge University , said : ' Professor Hawking has no plans to leave Cambridge at present .
However , he will be a regular visitor to the Perimeter Institute for research purposes . '
Alert Archive : August 2009 August 2009 ILLEGAL ALIEN AMNESTY THREAT LOOMS AS FALL APROACHES
The battle over health care reform may be grabbing all the headlines during recent months , however , President Obama and the open border advocates are getting ready to push new amnesty legislation through Congress as early as September .
During a recent trip to Mexico , President Obama said that he wanted to give “ an opportunity for those who are already in the United States to be able to achieve a pathway to citizenship so they do n’t have to live in the shadows . ”
BALANCE knows that “ a pathway to citizenship ” is Washington DC code for Illegal Alien Amnesty !
Illegal Alien Amnesty promoter Senator Chuck Schumer from New York , who recently assumed control of the Immigration sub-committee of the Senate Judiciary Committee , believes Congress will have a bill ready by Labor Day .
Senator Schumer has held numerous meetings with the pro-amnesty lobby since late April .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has also said that he would like to see a bill brought to the Senate floor in September .
With the credible threat of a new amnesty bill on the horizon and certain Members of Congress looking to provide more incentive to the law breakers by rewarding illegal behavior and unnecessarily adding to population growth , we must do all we can to stop this attack on our country and its laws .
There is no better time than now to contact your Congressional Representatives and say NO to amnesty for illegal aliens and demand a zero - net - immigration Moratorium .
Demanding a Moratorium will help stabilize America ’s population and thus , preserve as well as protect our environment for future generations .
Given the increasing unemployment rate in our country ( 20.5 % per ShadowStats.com ) , and the tens of billions in additional tax - payer funded health care and welfare programs , along with education and numerous other costs legalization would cause , this amnesty would be a disaster for American workers , the economy and the environment .
So we very much need you to help BALANCE stop all attempts to grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally to exploit what our country has to offer .
Please donate as much as you can today .
Visiting our website at www.balance.org makes donating quick and easy .
If amnesty is given to the millions of illegal aliens already in the country it will only further jeopardize our national security and contribute to making our problems worse in the future by encouraging illegal entry into the country .
We must put a stop to it now !
Tell Members of Congress :
NO to Illegal Alien Amnesty !
YES to a Moratorium on Mass Immigration !
Only BALANCE and its ASAP !
Coalition allies push for a five year zero - net - immigration Moratorium .
We earnestly ask you to make a most generous Special Donation to support the # 1 population and environment organization in the United States of America … Population - Environment Balance !

This shocking tale can be found in the women 's rights section of the website belonging to the organization change.org .
The story was also carried by Nerve and pointed to by Harper 's Magazine on Feb.
16 .
Apparently , in Iowa it can be regarded as a crime ― in this case attempted feticide ― if a pregnant woman gets unwell and falls down the stairs .
In any case , it may be regarded as a possible crime if this happens a few months after she considered having an abortion .
The simple fact of this weird tale are as follows :
In the beginning of her pregnancy , the woman considered abortion but decided against it .
After a meeting with her estranged husband , she became unwell and fell down the stairs .
Medics in the hospital told her the child she was carrying was fine .
She was elated to hear this .
After the fall , however , she mentioned she had previously thought of terminating the pregnancy .
Soon after , she found herself in jail because someone interpreted her falling as an attempt to " intentionally terminate a human pregnancy , " an act which is the legal definition of feticide .
BBC Four 's recent three - part documentary Women was enough to make any seasoned feminist weep with despair .
After sitting through the obligatory first instalment on celebrity second - wavers , and cringing through the second week on post - feminist consumerist mothers , I looked forward to the finale .
" Activists " promised to celebrate the resurgence of feminist activism in the contemporary UK .
How disappointing , then , that this new feminism turned out to be nothing more than a small group of London - based women who have attracted media attention over the past couple of years with their single - issue campaigns on violence against women .
There is not a feminist on the planet who is n't outraged at sexual and domestic violence , as well as the overwhelming evidence of the complicity of governments , police forces and justice systems in perpetuating this violence and protecting its perpetrators .
Violence against women is rightly a major focus of any feminist movement .
But this serious problem cannot be understood , or challenged , in isolation from other forms of violence and oppression , such as racism , restrictive labour and migration laws , and poverty .
Yet the groups featured in " Activists " – Object and the London Feminist Network – treat violence against women largely in isolation .
They have lots to say about the media objectification of women but , bizarrely , little to say about consumerism or capitalism .
The favourite topics of these organisations seem to be lap - dance clubs , pornography , lads ' magazines and the sex industry in general .
This is part of a growing trend in middle - class feminism .
Feminist writers and bloggers can't seem to get enough of prostitution and pornography these days .
But these are not the most important issues for the majority of women .
Why should a sex worker be a symbol of sexism any more than a competent professional woman denied promotion in favour of a younger male colleague ?
Or a teenage girl who does n't get the education she deserves because her family are too poor to play the postcode lottery or pay tuition fees ?
Or a migrant woman whose children are locked in a detention centre ?
The serious issues of violence against women , and sexist oppression generally , are grossly simplified when they are constantly associated with the sex industry .
Feminist campaigns to eliminate sex work by claiming that it is the same as violence against women are not only bad for the sex workers they aim to protect .
They 're also bad for feminism .
The contemporary feminist focus on male violence against women is bad for feminism because it positions women primarily as victims , while giving power to male police and politicians to " protect " us from " bad men " .
It returns us to the tired old model of two opposing genders : man=masculine =aggressive v woman=feminine=passive .
It offers no analysis of , and therefore no effective political opposition to , the ways violence against women relates to other forms of violence that women ( and men ) experience .
But most of all , it 's bad for feminism because it defines women 's experiences of sex and sexuality exclusively in terms of fear and danger , and reserves for men the privileged terrains of desire and pleasure .
Anyone who 's been around for the past 25 years will hear echoes in these debates of the feminist " sex wars " of the 1980s .
What 's most depressing about this sense of history repeating itself is that groups such as Object and LFN ignore the wealth of feminist theory on representation , desire and sexuality , as well as the scholarship on the intersections between sexism , racism and class produced over the past few decades .
But the blame for this lack of theoretical reflection cannot be placed on activists alone .
It must be shared by feminist academics , many of who have abandoned the wider public sphere of political debate and activism in recent years .
That too is bad for feminism .
A return to feminist academic dialogue with activism might help us to understand why so many young women today are attracted to forms of feminism that emphasise male violence against women above other forms of sexism .
Other people have noted that young feminist groups in the UK today are " predominantly white , middle - class and university - educated " .
Why are these privileged women so drawn to a movement that positions them first and foremost as victims of patriarchy ?
Luckily there are lots of other feminists out there , from different generations and backgrounds , making links between violence against women and other oppressions .
One group recently posted a Manifesto for 21st - Century Feminism that emphasises women 's exploitation in all areas of the labour market , not just the sex industry , and recognises the sexualisation of society as part of contemporary consumer capitalism .
That 's the kind of feminist resurgence we need .
Fox News has generously placed the full , unedited conversation between Bill O'Reilly and Jon Stewart online , so we can see precisely how unfairly and deviously Fox edited the interview in order to weaken Stewart 's case : A lot !
Last night on his show — Part Two of a ludicrously overhyped " faceoff " between O'Reilly and Stewart in which Stewart attempted , among other things , to present a critique of Fox as a fear - mongering GOP messaging operation —
O'Reilly boasted that his edit of their 42 - minute interview for broadcast was " a fair cut " and invited viewers to have a look at the unedited version online to judge for themselves : " Some of these idiots in the press who hate us , ' O ' Reilly cut the interview to make Stewart look ' — OK , all of that is bull .
It 's a fair cut .
And then when you watch the cut and watch the whole interview you 'll see it . "
So we took him up on the offer , and guess what ?
If by " fair cut " O'Reilly means " cut in a manner that left some of Stewart 's best lines , most effective arguments , and most convincing evidence out of the interview and hidden from the broadcast audience , " then he 's absolutely right .
Here 's the best exchange of the whole interview , in which Stewart gets O'Reilly to admit that he thinks Barack Obama believes in " tyranny and socialism , " and then asks him why Obama 's most generous spending has been to bail out banks .
He closed with this unanswerable question : " How many tyrants do you know that really suffer because they can't get cloture ? "
O'Reilly rejoindered with a lame joke about NBC , because what else could he do ?
None of this made the air :
There were also plenty of sharp points from Stewart that were edited down to , um , duller points .
Take this exchange , from the Fox News cut :
STEWART : Here 's the brilliance - here 's the brilliance of Fox News .
What you have been able to do , you and Dr. Ailes , have been able to mainstream conservative talk radio .
O'REILLY : Why would n't John McCain come on this program during the last campaign ?
Why did he dodge us and not come on if you - ( inaudible ) , if we 're in business to help the GOP , he would n't come in .
STEWART : But you 're not in the business of John McCain .
He is not GOP enough for you .
You 're in the business to help Sarah Palin .
Here 's the unedited version , which includes Stewart 's cogent analysis of how Fox introduces noxious GOP talking points during Fox and Friends — he cites specific examples that the Daily Show has mocked , like Gretchen Carlson 's handwringing over the Russian derivation of the word " czar " — and then picks them up during the so - called " hard news " shows under the guise that it 's something people are talking about :
And to watch the Fox News cut of this exchange , you 'd think O'Reilly scored a minor point by mocking Stewart 's repeated use of the word " cyclonic "
O'REILLY : Cavuto sane ?
STEWART : Being the thinnest kid at fat camp .
So let 's just get that straight .
Here is what Fox has done through their cyclonic , perpetual ...
O'REILLY : We 're back to the cyclonic .
STEWART : Their cyclonic perpetual emotion machine that is a 24 - hour a day , 7 - day a week .
They 've taken reasonable concerns about this president and this economy and turned it into a full - fledged panic attack about the next coming of Chairman Mao .
Explain to me why that is the narrative of your network ?
Here 's what Stewart really said about Neil Cavuto 's practice of raising " Is Obama a Stalinist ? " - style questions :
I know what this is .
I come from Jersey — it 's the same thing : " I 'm not saying your mother 's a whore .
I 'm just saying she has sex for money .
With people . "
[ F ]ox News used to be all about , you do n't criticize a president during wartime .
It 's unacceptable , it 's treasonous , it gives aid and comfort to the enemy .
All of a sudden , for some reason you can run out there and say , " Barack Obama is destroying the fabric of this country . "
Of course , Fox had to cut something .
But they left in a lengthy and stupid bit about Jon Stewart being O'Reilly 's vice president , and all sorts of lame O'Reilly banter .
To his credit , O'Reilly did repeatedly point his viewers to the full interview online , so it 's not like he 's exactly trying to hide anything .
More like he wants to look good on TV , which is basically the only thing he 's ever cared about aside from smearing deep - fried chickpea balls on naked underlings in the shower .
UPDATE : Here are some more clips , none of which made air .
The most on - point is this one , in which O'Reilly goes after Stewart for " taking a clip , cutting it up , and making someone look like an idiot . "
Stewart used a clip of O'Reilly for instance , " criticizing the Bush protesters — but you did n't use the whole clip . "
Because in order to fairly represent the views of a commentator , you have to use the full clip .
( No , the O'Reilly edit did n't unfairly present Stewart — it just deliberately removed his most effective arguments . )
Stewart also ( genially ) went after O'Reilly personally , as opposed to critiquing Fox News .
Here 's a particularly spectacular moment that did n't make the cut because , we assume , Stewart made O'Reilly look stupid for claiming to live among " the folks . "
O'REILLY : Do you know any Tea Party people ?
STEWART : Yes , I do .
O'REILLY : Really ?
Down in Greenwich Village there are Tea Party people ?
STEWART : Down in Greenwich Village ?
Let me tell you something , Bill — I 'll give you four blocks of Greenwich Village , and I 'll put that up against four blocks around your house —
O'REILLY : Levittown ?
STEWART : No , your house now .
O'REILLY : Oh , Levittown is where I was brought up .
STEWART : Well , you do n't live there any more brother .
Here , O'Reilly tries to make the case that Stewart would require bodily protection if he went to Charleston , S.C. , presumably because he 's Jewish or something ?
Stewart calls the " real America " meme " idiotic " :
Stewart on Fox News ' " hyperventilating " about Khalid Sheikh Muhammad being tried in the U.S. : " He 's not Magneto — Khalid Sheikh Muhammad is n't going to sprout wings and fly out and start shooting buildings with lasers . "
And here 's how he tries to compliment O'Reilly on what he sees as his relative level - headedness in the midst of the maelstrom of white rage that is Fox News :
Thanks go to Gawker video interns Aman Ellis and Jessica Poolt for carefully logging the full interview .
In the current recall frenzy , automakers are very quick to announce recalls , and I personally think it ’s a good thing .
Just yesterday , Honda announced a recall for brake issues with the Element and Odyssey vehicles .
The recall includes some 2007 - 2008 Elements and Odysseys .
Read on for more details .
Approximately 344,000 Odysseys and 68,000 Elements are being recalled , for a total of about 412,000 vehicles .
The issue stems from the Vehicle Stability Assist modulators , also known as VSA , which modulates the brakes as well as other systems to help prevent rollovers .
According to Honda , a defect during the manufacturing process can cause a “ miniscule amount of air ” to get into the brake system during a self - check .
Over time , usually months or years , those small bits of air can add up to a soft brake pedal feel , or worse , the pedal getting closer and closer to the floor before the brakes effectively slow the car .
The reason the air causes such problems in a braking system is because of the extreme pressures in a car ’s brake lines and the fact that the brake fluid used in cars compressed less than air .
When the air is compressed , the driver is left with a soft pedal and required pedal pressure in order to slow the car , whereas a system with no leaks would react more quickly .
Owners should expect to be notified via mail in the second half of April .

The host was Franz Aliquo , 32 , a lawyer who styles himself Supreme Commander ( Supreme for short ) when he ’s presiding over what he calls “ flavor tripping parties . ”
Mr. Aliquo greeted new arrivals and took their $ 15 entrance fees .
In return , he handed each one a single berry from his jacket pocket .

“ You pop it in your mouth and scrape the pulp off the seed , swirl it around and hold it in your mouth for about a minute , ” he said .
“ Then you ’re ready to go . ”
He ushered his guests to a table piled with citrus wedges , cheeses , Brussels sprouts , mustard , vinegars , pickles , dark beers , strawberries and cheap tequila , which Mr. Aliquo promised would now taste like top - shelf Patrón .
The miracle fruit , Synsepalum dulcificum , is native to West Africa and has been known to Westerners since the 18th century .
The cause of the reaction is a protein called miraculin , which binds with the taste buds and acts as a sweetness inducer when it comes in contact with acids , according to a scientist who has studied the fruit , Linda Bartoshuk at the University of Florida ’s Center for Smell and Taste .
Dr. Bartoshuk said she did not know of any dangers associated with eating miracle fruit .
During the 1970s , a ruling by the Food and Drug Administration dashed hopes that an extract of miraculin could be sold as a sugar substitute .
In the absence of any plausible commercial application , the miracle fruit has acquired a bit of a cult following .
Sina Najafi , editor in chief of the art magazine Cabinet , has featured miracle fruits at some of the publication ’s events .
At a party in London last October , the fruit , he said , “ had people testifying like some baptismal thing . ”
On Feb. 19 , New York Times reporters David Sanger and William Broad filed a story about the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s latest report [ .pdf ] on its inspection and monitoring work in Iran .
The lead of story , " Inspectors Say Iran Worked on Warhead , " announced the Feb. 18 report ’s shocking discovery :
" The United Nations ‘ nuclear inspectors declared for the first time on Thursday that they had extensive evidence of ‘ past or current undisclosed activities ’ by Iran ‘s military to develop a nuclear warhead , an unusually strongly worded conclusion that seems certain to accelerate Iran ’s confrontation with the United States and other Western countries . "
If that is n’t disturbing enough , the story then revealed that the IAEA has " concluded , " contrary to America ’s intelligence agencies , that Iran has been working feverishly on a nuclear bomb without interruption :
" The report , the first under the new director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Yukiya Amano , also concluded that Iran ’s weapons - related activity apparently continued ‘ beyond 2004 , ’ contradicting an American intelligence assessment published a little over two years ago that concluded that work on a bomb was suspended at the end of 2003 . "
If this story is true , everyone should be frightened .
The IAEA has had extensive evidence that Iran was building a nuclear weapon , but it inexplicably withheld that information from the world until now .
More troubling , the combined intelligence resources of the United States not only failed to discover the evidence available to the IAEA , but they also reached the erroneous conclusion that Iran had stopped all work on any nuclear weapon years ago .
The prospect is terrifying : Iran is creating a nuclear arsenal , and nobody can or will warn us in time to avert annihilation .
That ’s the bad news .
The good news is that none of it is true .
The Times imputes to the IAEA report statements , declarations , and conclusions that just are not there .
One can see this easily , just by reading the report and comparing it to the story .
You do not need a degree in nuclear physics or chemical engineering to see that the New York Times story is , quite simply , false .
The Times was not alone in fabricating content for the IAEA report .
The overwhelming response of American media grossly overstated its significance and rewrote it beyond recognition .
The Times ‘ story , however , is transparently dishonest , and it raises the legitimate question :
Is America ’s " paper of record " consciously misrepresenting facts to " accelerate confrontation " between Iran and the West ?
The Times wasted no time with facts .
It got down to the business of distorting the report right away – in the headline itself , followed by the near - hysterical lead paragraph .
Contrary to the Times , the IAEA inspectors do not " say Iran worked on warhead , " nor do they for the " first time declare … that they had extensive evidence of past or current undisclosed activities by Iran ‘s military to develop a nuclear warhead . "
Instead , the report ( paragraph 41 ) summarizes information that the IAEA has discussed in over a dozen reports beginning four years ago , making no new " declarations , " referring to no new circumstances .
See February 2006 report [ .pdf ] , paragraph 38 .
It then states :
" The information available to the Agency in connection with these outstanding issues is extensive and has been collected from a variety of sources over time .
It is also broadly consistent and credible in terms of the technical detail , the time frame in which the activities were conducted and the people and organizations involved .
Altogether , this raises concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile .
These alleged activities consist of a number of projects and sub- projects , covering nuclear and missile related aspects , run by military related organizations . "
( Emphasis added . )
The Times ‘ story does not quote the language of the report in bold above until the 15th paragraph .
Even then , it does not explain that this sentence is the sole basis for the sensational – and sensationally false – claim that the IAEA says , declares , and concludes that Iran had and has a nuclear weapons program .
Two relevant points are obvious from comparing the 10 - page IAEA report and the Times ‘ story .
First , the story ’s lead attributes to the report statements of fact that the IAEA does not make – and has never made .
Instead of stating that " Iran Worked on Warhead , " the IAEA says that it is concerned about the possible existence of past or current activities related to the development of a nuclear payload .
No matter how much spin even the masters at the New York Times can put on it , information giving rise to concerns about the possibility of a weapons program is not a " statement , " " declaration , " or " conclusion " that Iran has a weapons program .
To say that one is concerned about the possibility of something is not to say that the something exists .
When speaking of weapons that can destroy civilization , most people would agree that the difference is important .
Not so the Times , apparently .
Sanger , Broad , and the editors of the New York Times surely know the difference between the possible and the actual .
Why then did they describe the IAEA ’s statements of possibility as conclusions of fact ?
Second , the report does not state or claim that the IAEA has any new information about the possibility of a nuclear weapons program .
The report contains no relevant new or different facts , evidence , conclusions , or " declarations . "
On the contrary , the IAEA ( at paragraph 40 ) is emphatic that it is summarizing information about potential military application previously reported in detail :
" [ T ]he Agency needs to have confidence in the absence of possible military dimensions to Iran ’s nuclear program .
Previous reports by the Director General have detailed the outstanding issues and the actions required of Iran , including , inter alia , that Iran implement the Additional Protocol and provide the Agency with the information and access necessary to : resolve questions related to the alleged studies ; clarify the circumstances of the acquisition of the uranium metal document ; clarify procurement and R&D activities of military related institutes and companies that could be nuclear related ; and clarify the production of nuclear related equipment and components by companies belonging to the defense industries . "
( Emphasis added . )
This litany of issues and questions not only contains nothing new .
It is a virtual cut - and - paste from prior IAEA reports going back at least two years .
See the IAEA report of May 2008 [ .pdf ] , paragraph 14 :
" In addition to the implementation of Iran ’s Additional Protocol , for the Agency to provide assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran , Iran needs to , inter alia : resolve questions related to the alleged studies … ; provide more information on the circumstances of the acquisition of the uranium metal document … ; clarify procurement and R&D activities of military related institutes and companies that could be nuclear related … ; and clarify the production of nuclear equipment and components by companies belonging to defense industries . "
The Times ‘ claim that the report " declares " " extensive evidence " of a nuclear weapons program for the " first time " is a crude misconstruction designed to hype the report as news that is " certain to accelerate Iran ’s confrontation with the United States and other Western countries . "
The only relevant differences between current and past reports are completely non-substantive .
As noted , the current report ( paragraph 41 ) characterizes the IAEA ’s information as " extensive , " coming from multiple sources , " broadly consistent , " and " credible , " then states that , " [ a ] ltogether , this raises concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile . "
The IAEA has said the same thing in substance over and over again , for years .
For example , the August 2009 IAEA report [ .pdf ] states ( paragraph 19 ) :
" [ A ]s the Director General has repeatedly emphasized , the information contained in that documentation appears to have been derived from multiple sources over different periods of time , appears to be generally consistent , and is sufficiently comprehensive and detailed that it needs to be addressed by Iran with a view to removing the doubts which naturally arise , in light of all of the outstanding issues , about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran ’s nuclear program . "
( Emphasis added . )
In another context , the two statements would be close enough to give the author of the August 2009 an excellent claim for copyright infringement .
More importantly , there is no substantive difference between the punch line in the August 2009 report and its rephrasing in the current report .
The current report , " raising concerns " about the " possible existence " of activities to develop " a nuclear payload for a missile , " merely restates , in mirror image , the earlier report ’s unresolved " doubts … about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran ’s nuclear program . "
Doubts about the " exclusively peaceful nature " of a nuclear program mean questions about possible military application .
In any event , the basis for both formulations , as stated explicitly in the current report , is an identical list of issues and questions discussed at length in the reports for several years .
It is difficult to believe that veteran reporters from the New York Times would misconstrue the IAEA ’s summary of long - standing questions as an earth - shattering new " conclusion " about Iran ’s development of a " nuclear payload " that seems " certain " to bring the U.S. and Israel closer to war with Iran .
Does the Times want a war ?
Whatever its motives , the Times ‘ distortions and misuse of the IAEA ’s report look like the product of an agenda .
In the second paragraph , for example , Sanger and Broad claim that the IAEA has " also concluded that Iran ’s weapons - related activity apparently continued ‘ beyond 2004 , ’ contradicting an American intelligence assessment published a little over two years ago that concluded that work on a bomb was suspended at the end of 2003 . "
This statement is blatantly misleading .
The National Intelligence Estimate [ .pdf ] issued in late 2007 expressed the judgment that Iran discontinued a nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
In other words , American intelligence concluded that Iran had conducted an undisclosed nuclear weapons program up until 2003 .
Since commencing work in 2003 , however , the IAEA has never expressed a conclusion – including in the current report – that Iran has ever had a nuclear weapons program .
See report GOV / 2003 - 75 [ .pdf ] , paragraph 52 ( Nov. 10 , 2003 ) : " To date , there is no evidence that the previously undeclared nuclear material and activities referred to above were related to a nuclear weapons program . "
Nobody – not even the IAEA – can " contradict " a proposition without a contradiction .
In any event , the report actually states ( paragraph 43 ) : " Addressing these issues is important for clarifying the Agency ’s concerns about these activities and those described above , which seem to have continued beyond 2004 . "
The " activities " refer to same list of " alleged activities " ( the existence of which Iran disputes and which the IAEA still questions ) or those that Iran claims solely concern civilian application ( but may have a " military dimension " ) , all of which have been discussed in detail in earlier reports .
Whether some activities ( e.g. , theoretical " dual use " material ) that raise questions or concerns about the " exclusively peaceful nature " of Iran ’s nuclear program continued " beyond 2004 " does not establish that they involve efforts to develop a " nuclear payload " before , during , or after 2004 .
The Times ‘ agenda here is to contribute to the near - relentless public ( and undoubtedly private ) pressure on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other key intelligence agencies to scrap the 2007 NIE .
The ink was not dry on that report before it came under blistering attack from every quarter in the anti-Iran camp .
Since then , the " debate " over the 2007 NIE reflects a complete national amnesia over the politicization of intelligence responsible for the Iraq invasion and all the later chest - beating about " stove - piping " that consumed dozens of committees and commissions .
Quite unlike Cheney ’s subterranean Office of Special Plans , the politicization of the Iran NIE has taken place in the middle of Main Street at high noon .
With a new NIE reportedly in the pipeline and opponents of the 2007 estimate striving to get it changed , the Times ‘ Feb. 19 story does its bit by claiming falsely that even the IAEA ’s " conclusions " " contradict " it .
Protect the independent judgment of intelligence services ?
Forget it .
The rest of the Times ‘ story continues in the same fashion , taking the equivalent of firecrackers in the IAEA report and converting them through the magic of journalism into 25 - megaton nukes .
Another of its frightening revelations is that the " report indicated that for the first time Iran told inspectors it was preparing to make its uranium into metallic form – a step that can be explained by some civilian applications , but is widely viewed as necessary for making the core of an atom bomb . "
Near the end of the story , the authors return to this point , noting that the report " disclosed Iranian work on uranium metal at … Isfahan , where it said Iran planned to build several production lines .
The Institute for Science and International Security … said in a report on Thursday that the new lines at Isfahan ‘ raise suspicions that Iran could use them to make metal components for weapons ’ " ( emphasis added ) .
The trouble with this claim is that Sanger and Broad should have put " this decade " after " first time . "
That is because , as the IAEA reported in 2003 , " the design information provided to the Agency in July 2000 described the purpose of [ the Isfahan ] facility as the conversion of uranium ore concentrate ( UOC or U3O8 ) into natural UO2 , UF6 , and uranium metal " ( emphasis added ) .
This seven - year - old report adds that the Iranians disclosed that the facility would have " the following process lines " – and then lists the same processing lines , including those for uranium metal , that the Times now says the Iranians did not disclose until 2010 .
Compare the 2003 report [ .pdf ] , Annex 1 , paragraphs 3 and 4 , with the Feb. 18 report [ .pdf ] , paragraph 25 ( both list the same seven processing lines , including those for producing " uranium metal enriched to 19.7 % U - 235 " from UF6 and producing " depleted uranium metal " from UF4 ) .
For almost seven years , the IAEA has been issuing reports roughly every quarter on the findings , issues , and open items from its inspections of Iran ’s nuclear activities .
Three basic facts can be found in its reports .
First , all of Iran ’s nuclear material has been and remains under IAEA " containment and surveillance . "
Second , Iran does not have nuclear weapons or the means to make them .
Third , there is no definitive evidence that Iran in fact has or ever had a nuclear weapons program .
For as long as the IAEA has been issuing its reports , however , the major American media have been doing their utmost to twist , torque , and torture them into a nightmarish revelation of ghoulish mullahs feverishly building a doomsday machine as they plan to create a nuclear empire , wipe Israel from the face of the map , and conquer the world .
A couple of years ago I suggested that everyone should read the IAEA reports because an educated public might help avert another unnecessary war based on lies .
That , however , probably was n’t inspiring enough .
So let me suggest this :
If you read the reports and then read the newspaper accounts of them , you can experience firsthand that galvanic shot of astonishment from discovering just how bad – how shamelessly bad – the American media has become .
Engineered Virus Causes Tobacco Plants to Grow Solar Cells
Tobacco , once the glory crop of the South Atlantic region of the United States , has fallen in stature as health problems associated with smoking the plant have come to light .
Now tobacco may be able to redeem itself by producing solar cells , according to researchers at the University of California at Berkeley .
By infecting tobacco plants with a genetically engineered virus , scientists have been able to “ produce artificial photovoltaic and photochemical cells ” which are biodegradable and may end up being “ more environmentally friendly than traditional methods of making solar cells ” .
By altering a few genes in the tobacco mosaic virus and spraying it on tobacco plants , scientists are able force “ the plant to create artificial chromophores , structures that turn light into high powered electrons ” .
Scientists then have to extract the structures and spray them “ over a glass or plastic substrate coated with molecules that secure the rods to the plastic . ”
Discovery News reports on the environmental benefits of using plants to create solar cells :
Using live organisms to create synthetic solar cells has several advantages over traditionally made solar panels .
No environmentally toxic chemicals are required to make biologically derived solar cells , unlike traditional solar cells .
Growing solar cells in tobacco plants could put farmers back to work harvesting an annual crop of solar cells .
Bio - based solar cells would n’t last as long as the average silicon solar cell , but they could act as a cheap , transportable , and temporary biodegradable power source .
A solution of them could even be sprayed over plastic or glass to harvest energy .
Should we really be messing around with viruses in order to solve our energy crisis ?
What if we release some super virus that would affect agriculture negatively or attack human immune systems ?
It is true that plants are “ already very efficient at turning the sunlight into sugar and other forms of chemical energy ” that we need for sustaining life .
It is exciting to think that instead of sugar they could create “ hydrocarbons that could power cars or aircraft ” , but what unseen consequences may result from “ tweaking ” virus genes ?
Of course , scientists are also creating viruses that heal , so we may have nothing to fear , and tobacco farmers could use a break .

Well , at least you learned the power of love and true friendship .
# 001 : Bulbasaur
Chris :
I think it 's important to note that when the makers of Pokemon needed to decide who got to be #001 , they picked a dinosaur made of trees .
David : Man , everyone knows Bulbasaur .
He 's ... the flower bulb ... wait , I just realized he 's supposed to be a dinosaur .
He looks nothing like a dinosaur !
Chris :
Sure he looks like a dinosaur .
He 's got that big friendly smile .
David :
He looks like someone glued a tulip to a cat and painted it to look like a lizard .
Chris :
Twenty words into this article and I 'm already sensing some friction here , Dave .
You should know that I straight up love Bulbasaur and I am not afraid to admit it .
I am a 27 year - old man who loves Bulbasaur .
I love his stumpy little legs , I love his ... well , I guess they 're more head - points than actual ears .
David : I am afraid of his adorable , mischievous smile .
And the tulip krazy - glued to his back .
Honestly , of the original ones I was always more of a Squirtle or Psyduck fan .
Chris : Squirtle has the edge in evolutions .
I mean , Bulbasaur just turns into a bigger dinosaur with a bigger tree , and that 's pretty cool , but Squirtle eventually turns into a giant tortoise that is also a tank with actual cannons in his back .
But I still love Bulbasaur .
David : I ai n't hatin ' !
But compared to the brilliance of Bronzong ...
# 437 : Bronzong
Chris : Nice segue .
So you like Bronzong , the ceremonial temple bell with a face on it that shoots lighting out of its ...
I do n't know , are those technically arms ?
David :
No , seriously , Bronzong is awesome .
It 's like a Final Fantasy random encounter built out of a Jack Kirby / Osamu Tezuka joint design for a Dalek .
Chris :
Well when you put it that way , yeah , he 's pretty awesome .
But I 'll admit it :
The way that it looks like it 's always asking for a hug freaks me out more than a little .
David :
Aw crap , now I can't un - see that .
Chris :
There 's a real " COME TO HATEMOTHERRR " vibe to it .
# 225 : Delibird
David : SANTY CLAUS !
Chris : According to Bulbapedia , Delibird is n't just a bird that looks like Santa Claus , he 's actually one of the Pokemon that Santa Claus owns .
And really , I can barely get my head around the fact that Santa has Pokemon , let alone that he has a little one that looks just like him but is also a penguin .
David : Santa Claus exists in the Pokemon universe ?
I was not aware of that , although I suppose it makes sense .
I 'd thought maybe it was just a coincidence .
The name 's weird , though .
Like , delicatessen ?
Or is it a Deli - bird because it tastes so delicious ?
Chris : Santa does , in fact , exist in the world of Pokemon .
He has eight tiny Stantlers that can fly , and delivers toys to good trainers every Christmas .
David : STANTLERS !
That 's ADORABLE !
David : Bells in the antlers !
Actually , they pretty much look like regular reindeer .
Chris : I gotta say though , as much as I love Christmas , I just do n't know what to think about a Santa Claus who spends the off - season taking little animals out and making them fight each other so that they can get stronger .
I 'm not sure if it 's the worst thing I 've ever heard ... or the best .
David :
Well , it 's all they know .
That 's the circle of life for the Pokemon .
I mean , Santa had to have given out enough copies of " Lion King , " he 's seen that damn scene .
Sometimes , adorable Pokemon must die so we all may live , and that is the greatest Christmas gift of them all .
# 221 : Piloswine
David :
What is he hiding ??
Chris : Piloswine is the Pokemon most likely to refer to his wife as " My old lady . "
David :
Yeah , totally , that Pokemon looks like the avatar of resigned existential defeat .
But why even bother with tusks that low ?
What 's it going to do , cut your ankles ?
Chris : Believe it or not , he has an amazing vertical leap .
But does n't he just look like he'd ask to crash on your couch for a few days , just ' til the settlement comes through ?
David :
He 'd ruin it with those damn tusks !
And he'd shed everywhere !
Piloswine would have a house outside if that was required .
Chris : " Yeah , okay .
I mean , I 'm used to livin ' rough , y'know , ever since my old lady gave me the boot .
I do n't guess I could get a five off you for bus fare ? "
David : I 'm getting depressed just looking at this guy .
Chris :
You think that 's bad , wait for the next one .
# 424 : Ambipom
David : " Ambi " is right , man .
Whoever designed this is obsessed with symmetry .
Chris :
If you 're unaware , some of the Pokemon can " evolve " into other Pokemon .
Now , I ai n't Chuck Darwin or nothin ' , but I 'm not sure what evolutionary advantage one gains from having no hands , a massively disturbing clown face , and two tails that end in a trio of truly horrifying sex toys .
David :
At this point , I think it 's safe to say we 're dealing with a messed - up offshoot of LaMarckian adaptive evolution and nothing Darwin ever came close to postulating .
Either way , this guy looks awesome .
I 'd want to keep him around , just to scare the crap out of people at parties .
Chris :
Even the way he 's standing , with that little half - shrug with his flipper arms .
He 's like " Yeah , I guess I 'm a horrible sex monkey !
Who 's first ? "
David : Maybe those ... appendages ... have other uses .
I dunno .
Maybe they 're magic markers .
Or erasers .
Maybe they secrete a venom that causes chlamydia but cures cancer !
Chris : I can't look at this thing any longer .
But the next one ...
Yeesh .
# 238 : Smoochum
David :
So needy - looking .
Like , go away .
Chris : Smoochum is the " baby " version of Jynx , the Pokemon that looks like a drag queen in blackface .
David : I .... what ?
That is one racist - ass opera queen .
Wait a second , Jynx is just the Eggplant Wizard in a wig !
Well , and two eyes .
MINOR DETAILS .
Chris :
So someone looked at Jynx and was like " You know what this needs ?
A younger version . "
David :
Well , this is Japan .
Chris : Yeah .
It 's like , I do n't even know what to say about it other than " This exists . "
David : Maybe it 's the fact that I just read it , but it reminds me oddly of Penny from " Phonogram : Singles Club . "
Chris :
I have no idea how you got that , but hey , thanks a lot Dave .
I was hoping someone would come along and just thoroughly ruin the idea of a pretty girl dancing to the Pipettes .
No really , that 's great .
That 's just great .
David : I live to serve , Chris .
And completing this metaphor , Kid with Knife is the next guy .
# 204 : Pineco
Chris : I call Shennanigans !
Look , I understand that they have to design like a hundred and fifty of these for each game , and that some of them are n't going to be that creative .
But come on , guys , you can't just look out the window and put eyes on the first thing you see .
David :
Ah , the patented reverse Batman .
< stares out the window >
I shall become ... a pinecone !
Chris :
Maybe the guy who designed this worked all night trying to come up with something totally boss , like a dragon , and then the guy at the meeting right before him pitched Charizard .
Then they go to this guy and it's like " So what do you have ? " "
" Uhhhhh Pineco .
He 's .. a pinecone . "
And then everyone gets real quiet .
David : A slow clap rises ...
Chris : Yeah .
Seriously though : Pineco .
Was this really the best you could do , Pokemon ?
David :
Well , you 're gonna have some clunkers out of ... what is it , 400 , 500 now ?
They 're even making up colors now .
What the hell is " SoulSilver ? "
Is that like True Blood ?
Chris :
I think it's what Scott Pilgrim 's sword is made of .
So we agree that Pineco was phoned in , right ?
David : Yeah , perhaps literally over the phone .
Chris :
Because this next one is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum .
# 323 : Camerupt
Chris : Camerupt : A big fat camel with volcanos for humps .
David : I 've heard less badass ideas .
I dig the perfect concentric blue circles on the side .
What do they mean ?
I have no idea !
Chris :
It 's like the perfect synthesis of what a fourth grader would come up with in biology class .
" Camels store fat in their humps so that they can go days without sustinence . "
" Yeah ?
Well what if they stored MOLTEN LAVA that they shot at STUPID PINECONES ?! "
David :
Where does the lava come from ?!
I mean , does it absorb magma through its paws ?
What does it evolve into ?
Does it like , grow more volcanoes ?
Chris :
You 're not far off :
It evolves from Numel , which only has a little bump on its back .
A bump that turns into two volcanoes .
David :
That 's one painful puberty .
# 325 : Spoink
Chris :
I have no joke for this one , I just legitimately think it 's adorable .
David :
Is that a tail ?
Also , is the ball between its ears part of it on a biological level , or is it just holding it in a completely adorable fashion ?
Chris :
It is a pearl that increases its psychic powers .
Because of COURSE the spring - pig is going to have psychic powers .
David :
That ... is adorable .
Whoever came up with this one deserves a raise , seriously .
Or an extra bag of whatever they were doing .
Chris :
In the world of Pokemon , there are so many websites with pictures of this thing asking horribly misspelled questions .
" I can haz psychic powrz ? "
David : I can totally see that .
Honestly , I just want one for a friend now .
Chris :
Dave , I want you to buckle up , because I 'm about to take you on an emotional rollercoaster .
From Bulbapedia : " It possesses no hind legs and motion is achieved by bouncing on its spring like tail .
However , the bouncing serves a far more vital function in that it keeps its heart beating ; if it 's stopped from bouncing , it will go into cardiac arrest and die . "
David : AND KIDS PLAY THIS ?!
Chris : I know , right ?
But wait , it gets adorable again : " It is able to constantly bounce , even while sleeping " EVEN WHILE SLEEPING !
Dawwwwwwwww !
David :
But you could just ... accidentally ... through ignorance ... kill it , by trying to hold it .
Chris :
And if you take away its pearl , it gets sad :
Chris : Bawwwwwwww !
David : Incredible .
I 'm pretty sure you could use that image to make domestic terrorists talk .
How could you say no to that face ?
Chris :
All right , our final entries ...
# 431 & 432 : Glameow and Purugly
Chris :
I will guarantee you the guy who designed this is in an unhappy marriage right now .
David :
Does one evolve from the other , or are they just two sides of the same thing ?
Is this like the chick in that Seinfeld episode that only looked good in certain light ?
Chris : Glameow evolves into Purugly .
David :
Oh wow , that is pretty misogynist .
Chris :
She starts out sleek and slim , and then one day you wak eu and the whiskers are frayed , the smile 's gone , it does n't take care of its ears like it used to , it keeps saying you spend too much time drawing monsters , starts nagging when you stop off for five lousy minutes to get a drink on your way home from the Nintendo offices ...
David :
All at once , too .
Why is Pokemon evolution not incremental at all ?
Seriously , did these guys not read a book ??
Chris :
And just in case you missed the message , they named it " Purugly . "
David :
Does it get angry if you then catch another Glameow ?
Chris : I would not doubt it .
Also , if your Glameow knows the ability " Limber , " when it evolves the ability changes into " Thick Fat . "
Which means there is an ability called " Thick Fat . "
David :
That 's not even subtle .
Chris :
It 's pretty rough , but seriously , how funny is Purugly 's " shirt ? "
David :
Oh wow , I had n't even processed it that way .
I wonder sometimes if this subtext is intentional , and then I realize it almost definitely is .
Green spaces with trees or some grass can help our brains reboot , improving our psychological health , researchers are finding .
Scientists have discovered the female sex hormone progesterone in a walnut tree , shaking up what 's known about the different between plants and animals .
Until now , scientists thought that only animals could make progesterone .
A steroid hormone secreted by the ovaries , progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy and maintains pregnancy .
A synthetic version , progestin , is used in birth control pills and other medications .
" The significance of the unequivocal identification of progesterone cannot be overstated , " write Guido F. Pauli and colleagues in the American Chemical Society 's Journal of Natural Products .
" While the biological role of progesterone has been extensively studied in mammals , the reason for its presence in plants is less apparent . "
They speculate that the hormone , like other steroid hormones , might be an ancient bioregulator that evolved billions of years ago , before the appearance of modern plants and animals .
The new discovery may change scientific understanding of the evolution and function of progesterone in living things .
Scientists previously identified progesterone - like substances in plants and speculated that the hormone itself could exist in plants .
But researchers had not found the actual hormone in plants until now .
Pauli and colleagues used two powerful laboratory techniques , nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy , to detect progesterone in leaves of the Common Walnut , or English Walnut , tree .
They also identified five new progesterone - related steroids in a plant belonging to the buttercup family .
As the furor over the State Board of Education ’s ideological rewriting of social studies standards has exploded nationally in recent weeks , a primary narrative has emerged : that whatever 15 politicians in Texas ( or at least the rightest - leaning half of them ) decide will be published in textbooks nationwide for years to come .
That fear has already stoked a political backlash : One California state senator is drafting legislation to keep any hint of the Texas version of U.S. history out of California textbooks .
“ The de-emphasis on civil rights in so many areas — reducing the scope of Latino history , especially in a state like Texas — is just mind - boggling , ” said Adam Keigwin , chief of staff for San Francisco Democrat Leland Yee .
But Yee and his liberal - to - moderate contemporaries in other states need not fret , textbook industry experts say .
Though Texas has been painted in scores of media reports as the big dog that wags the textbook industry tail , that ’s simply no longer true — and will become even less true in the future , as technological advances and political shifts transform the marketplace , said Jay Diskey , executive director of the Association of American Publishers .
Diskey calls the persistent reports of Texas dominating the market an “ urban myth . ”
Yet the myth persists .
“ I ’ve been in this job about three and a half years , and I see it reported all the time , ” Diskey said .
“ I give my explanation to reporters , and about half of them believe me and half of them do n’t . ”
Rather than tailoring history books to Texas , then trying to peddle them nationwide , publishers today will start with a core national narrative and edit to suit the sensitivities and curriculum standards of various states and districts , said David Anderson , an industry lobbyist , former publishing sales executive and Texas Education Agency curriculum director .
The irony in the current history wars :
The more the state board makes a political circus out of the process , the less likely any of its ideology will seep into books for other states , as the California backlash makes clear .
“ The core narrative is very similar ” nationally , Anderson said .
“ If you can customize a book for Texas , and un-customize it for the Midwest — and Texas is controversial — then that ’s what you ’re going to do . ”
Because of their sheer buying power , large states with statewide textbook adoption processes did once indeed influence what went into the books , which used to be printed almost exclusively in national editions , Diskey and other industry experts said .
But since the mid-1990s and the rise of the state curriculum standards and testing movement , publishers have increasingly been forced to customize their books for different states , as well as for larger school districts in the roughly 30 states without statewide adoptions .
Simultaneously , advances in publishing and printing technologies allow far more customization at lower cost , much like large newspapers that issue several geographically customized editions every day .
What ’s more , rapidly shifting politics and the digital revolution in instructional materials promise to dilute the power of state school boards even further — both here in Texas and nationally .
Texas remains one of only two states that have shunned the national standards movement being pushed out of Washington , which , if it progresses as expected , would no doubt dwarf the market influence of even giant states .
And here in Texas , new legislation that impinges on the board ’s previously well - guarded curricular turf allows Commissioner of Education Robert Scott , who does not report to the board , to create a separate list of approved digital materials over which the board has no say .
The new law only requires that schools buy one " classroom set " of board - approved textbooks , rather than one for every student .
The power of deletion
All told , such factors may represent the beginning of the end of what some call the board ’s outsized influence on what students here and elsewhere learn .
That ’s not to say the standards do n’t matter :
In Texas , they still heavily influence what questions will go on standardized tests , and thus what teachers , at minimum , must cover in classrooms .
And perhaps even more than what state board members add to the curriculum , what they have deleted , including references to church - state separation and minority and feminist figures , may end up having more effect on what students do — and do not — learn from their history books .
Consider the cases of feminist Betty Friedan , the entire genre of hip - hop , tales of Mexicans being abused by Texas Rangers and segregated from schools , and the Hispanic civil rights groups MALDEF and LULAC .
All were proposed for inclusion in the curriculum by liberal or moderate members of the state board , and all were rejected by conservatives .
Publishing houses will have no incentive to go through the trouble of including them , only to risk getting blacklisted by irritated conservative board members who later will approve the books one by one .
Ultimately , the school districts choose which books to buy .
And in rare cases , publishers might include figures or events not included in the standards to market to districts in particular regions of the state .
But the board remains the primary gatekeeper : Districts buy books from the board - approved lists of “ conforming ” and “ nonconforming " books ( which do not sell well ) .
“ Nobody in a district is going to say , ‘ Where ’s Betty Friedan ? ’ and not buy the book , ” Anderson said .
“ The incentive for publishers to go beyond the standards is driven by market forces , but they also face the question of whether it creates a problem on the state board .
They ’re only supposed to reject books on the basis of errors , but we ’ve seen cases where they cited ‘ errors ’ and rejected books without any documentation . ”
What gets tested
Texas , like many other states , still operates with an “ iron triangle ” of standards , textbooks and tests , said Gloria Zyskowski , deputy associate commissioner for student assessment for the Texas Education Agency .
After the state board completes its work on the standards , expected in May , teams of teachers will scour them to identify “ critical ” concepts that will appear in test questions .
Those will include about 60 percent of the standards , Zyskowski said .
And test questions will be developed from those critical components .
But despite the heated , word - by - word editing battles among members on the state board , it 's not so clear how much of the hot - blooded ideology reflected in the current standards draft will get translated into test questions or included in the manner that board social conservatives might prefer .
Many of the standards that drew the most heat on the board seemed to call for value judgments — judgments not easily or even desirably turned into test questions .
Consider the civil rights standard , proposed by conservative firebrand Don McLeroy , R - Bryan , that sought to praise Martin Luther King Jr. and denigrate more “ adversarial ” civil rights figures : “ Analyze the effectiveness of the adversarial approach taken by some civil rights groups , such as the Black Panthers , versus the philosophically persuasive tone of Dr. Martin Luther King ’s ‘ I have a Dream ’ speech , and his letter from the Birmingham Jail . ”
It ’s not like that will translate into a test question reading : “ Martin Luther King ’s approach was more productive than that of the Black Panthers .
True or false ? ”
Standards that start with verbs like “ explain ” and “ analyze ” — including many of the most controversial — can’t easily be written into multiple - choice test questions , the only kind that appear on state social studies exams , Zyskowski said .
And for that reason , they often get thrown out entirely , judged not “ critical . ”
“ To contrast the effectiveness of two movements , that really does n’t lend itself to multiple choice questions .
It ’s more of a thought piece , a research paper , ” Zyskowski said .
If a test question were derived from such a standard , Zyskowski said , the test might , for instance , call for a student to read two passages , one from King , another from a Black Panther , then ask , “ Which of the following statements best describes ” each philosophy , with a choice of summaries .
In other words , the test would likely treat the movements neutrally and academically , rather than calling for student value judgments as McLeroy apparently intended .
“ Free enterprise ” at work
So what would publishers do with the Black Panthers ?
Probably as little as possible , as carefully as possible , said Ron Reed , an Austin - based sales and marketing consultant to publishers , a former textbook company executive and the founder of a company providing content to publishers .
“ Your first translation of the standards would be to write about the accomplishments of Martin Luther King ” — the kind of figure textbook publishers love because he causes little if any controversy among any ideological stripes , Reed said .
“ Would you then discuss the Black Panthers as an example of ineffective dissent ?
You might choose to find another way to look at it . ”
In most book publishing , controversy is mother ’s milk , growing sales .
In textbook publishing , it ’s kryptonite , driving books out of print , if they ever get printed in the first place .
The capitalist forces — or , rather “ free enterprise ” forces , in sanitized , Texas - state - board parlance — have a leveling , almost deadening effect when applied to textbooks .
If you want to get books approved by the state board — and sell as many as possible to both Hispanic liberals in El Paso as to social conservatives in Fort Worth — the path to success lies in avoiding irritating anyone .
In other words , producing boring books .
That might explain why none of the spokespeople from the three major textbook publishing houses in America — Pearson , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and McGraw - Hill — returned calls for this story , lest they trip up and say anything to irk a Texas politician holding the purse strings .
Diskey , from the publisher ’s association , said they usually refer all the calls to him .
Eric Foner , a historian and professor at Columbia University , wrote one of the most popular U.S. history textbooks in the country , Give Me Liberty !
It ’s used mostly in colleges , but also in many high schools , often in Advanced Placement courses .
Foner recently appeared on The Colbert Report ’s satirical take on Texas history standards .
In an interview later , he called many of the changes “ absurd . ”
“ No self - respecting historian would change their version of U.S. history just because the Texas school board says so , ” he said .
But that ’s the thing :
Most history textbooks are not written by historians — self - respecting or otherwise .
Foner 's book , a cohesive narrative researched and written by one scholar , is the exception .
Most elementary and secondary texts are written by committees of a dozen or more writers , hired hands who do n’t own their work and ca n’t object to any changes multiple publishing house editors make to appease whichever politicians or bureaucrats control the millions being spent .
They are cooked quickly and to order , pressed together from hundreds of standards that reflect , in many ways , the lowest common denominator of thousands of opinions .
They are , in short , the chicken nuggets of the literary world .
In a major demographic shift for a neighborhood that has long been " synonymous with black urban America , " the majority of Harlem residents are no longer black , according to the Times .
In a decade when Harlem 's population grew more than it has since the 1940s , the number of black residents has fallen to its lowest point since the 1920s .
In 1970 , black people made up 64 percent of the residents living between East 96th Street , West 106th Street , and West 155th Street .
As of 2008 , blacks constitute just 41 percent of the population .
The paper notes that " [ c ] hange has been even more pronounced " in Central Harlem — an area north of 110th Street bound by Fifth and St. Nicholas avenues — where the Latino population has surged by 27 percent while the white population has more than doubled since 2000 .
While gentrification is certainly one way to characterize the neighborhood 's changing demographics , some say it 's not an entirely accurate way to describe the community 's transition .
They argue that newcomers have n't needed to dislodge longtime residents because the Harlem was in such bad shape that many denizens moved out on their own accord before gentrifiers arrived .
" This place was vacated , " said Howard Dodson , director of Harlem 's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture , who himself recently moved to Newark .
" Gentrification is about displacement . "
Fighters for justice welcomed the guilty plea by a New Orleans police lieutenant Feb. 24 that he spearheaded a massive cover -up of the police shooting of six unarmed Black civilians as they walked across the Danziger Bridge Sept. 4 , 2005 , in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
“ I ’m happy the case has finally come to this stage , ” said Sakura Kone , a grassroots activist in the battle to rebuild New Orleans .
“ I ’m glad it ’s out in the public light .
Here in New Orleans we ’ve known this was a police cover - up since it happened . ”
Kone credited the courageous stand taken by the families of those slain and wounded that “ kept the case alive . ”
They debunked the racist lies that the seven police officers , all white , had been fired upon and returned fire in self defense that day .
At the time , the shooting shocked the nation since it coincided with KKK - style vigilante actions aimed at blocking an exodus of mostly African American evacuees fleeing the flooded city .
Killed in the police fusillade was Ronald Madison , 40 , a developmentally disabled man who was on his way to his brother ’s dentist office .
Police shot him four times in the head .
Police also shot to death James Brissette , 19 , who was walking with his family at the base of the bridge in search of a grocery store .
Four others were seriously wounded including Susan Bartholomew , who lost her arm due to police gunshot wounds .
Police shot her husband in the head .
Jose Holmes , 23 , sustained gunshot wounds to his stomach and wore a colostomy bag for years .
The families of the victims crowded the courtroom , Feb. 24 as the officer , Lt. Michael Lohman , admitted that he had been assigned to orchestrate the cover - up including drafting a bogus 17 page report and coaching the other officers so their alibis had a single narrative .
He admitted that another police officer “ planted a handgun ” beside one of the victims to buttress the lie that the police had come under fire .
Lohman admitted he made sure the firearm was “ clean ” and could not be traced back to the police .
Asked by the prosecutor if he “ knew that the civilians on the bridge had not actually possessed guns , ” Lohman nodded and told the court , “ Yes , sir . ”
After the hearing , Dr. Romel Madison , said his brother was shot by police just yards from his dentist office .
At the scene , police handcuffed another brother , Lance Madison , and charged him with attempted murder .
Those charges were later thrown out by a judge .
Dr. Madison told reporters , “ We have some kind of closure .
The people of New Orleans should be relieved that there is still justice . ”
Kone cautioned that Lohman , will not be sentenced until May 26 and indictment of the other officers involved in the shooting has not been announced .
Kone linked the police brutality to the continuing crisis of New Orleans as the fifth anniversary of Katrina approaches .
“ More than 200,000 evacuees have not returned home , ” Kone said .
“ The essentials for people to provide for themselves are denied .
Living wage jobs , affordable housing , health care and education are all non-existent . ”
The billionaires , descended from slaveowners , members of the so - called “ Boston Club ” have a master plan for New Orleans , Kone said : “ a smaller footprint , reduced population , less working class , less Black . ”
De-populating New Orleans ’ overwhelmingly African American Lower 9th
Ward is also key to their scheme to turn Louisiana from “ Blue to Red ” ( Democrat to Republican ) he charged .

More ' out - of - field ' teachers in two districts
Out - of - field teachers are certified teachers , despite what the category may suggest .
I confessed some wanderlust a few weeks ago , though “ some ” is a bit of an understatement .
See , parents get paralyzed a bit in the beginning — in the early days , just getting a cup of coffee in the morning is kind of a triumph — thus even when the kid hits a half year old ( which once - Wee Jacob did this week , sniffle ) and you ’ve got a good routine down , you still know you ’re not ready to pack everything the three of you will need for one week into suitcases and then willingly relocate to a 180 square foot stateroom for a so - called vacation .
But we ’re doing it anyway and I cannot wait .
The prospect of “ whee ! vacation ! ” is officially less terrifying than the number of diapers , burp cloths , types of infant first aid , teething rings and onesies we are packing into suitcases , thus , it is now or never : we ’re getting on a boat .
And guess who is coming with us ?
Do n’t worry , this tart travels too .
Sure , it sounds and may look like a traditional bakewell tart , but oh , I want to take it places .
For example , my initial ambition had been to take it to Spain ( for that aforementioned tapas party ) with marcona almonds and either a Seville orange marmalade or membrillo ( that I ’d cook down until jam -y ) base .
Alas , I gave up quickly when I realized that finding unsalted , not already roasted marconas was going to be more effort than I was willing to put out on a Friday afternoon but in theory , this tart will travel nicely to Spain .
Or Hawaii — macadamia nuts and pineapple , anyone ?
Or Vienna , with walnuts and a sour cherry jam .
And heck , I ’ve already taken it to Thanksgiving dinner .
However , even if it never leaves its original home — lovely old Bakewell , in Derbyshire , England — this is a delicious thing , a buttery tart shell and a slick of bright raspberry jam underneath a toasty baked almond frangipane filling .
I find it impossible not to like .
This week :
We ’re sailing the deep , blue sea ( or , I have heard that it is both deep and blue and will be very upset if I have been misled ) thus comment responses will be slow .
But new recipes will still magically appear as we work through my cooking backlog .
See ?
Everyone wins .

Port -au - Prince , Haiti -
A short while ago , the world was full of buzz over the story of the ten Baptist missionaries from the United States who have been charged with child kidnapping offenses after they were caught by Haitian police trying to take undocumented children out of the country .
Today , it 's their lawyer causing the sensational stir .
Turns out the man who called himself Jorge Puello is wanted for sex trafficking of women and girls under the name of Jorge Torres Orellana .
Using the name Jorge Puello , Orellana posed as a lawyer and volunteered his services to the Baptist group .
Orellana first came to light in early February when he announced he had fired the Haitian lawyer , Edwin Coq after Coq allegedly attempted to bribe Haitian police to secure the release of the 10 Baptists .
It was Orellana 's charitable act that brought him to the attention of El Salvadoran police , who saw a photograph of the wanted man in news stories about the case earlier this month .
Not only is Orellana not registered as a lawyer in the Dominican Republic , the man is wanted in four different countries for sex trafficking , counterfeiting documents and violating parole .
And now , since he has disappeared , there is a manhunt going on in the Dominican Republic in an attempt to apprehend the man .
Police in El Salvador had said they could n't say Puello was Orellana until they had been able to compare fingerprints .
However , Orellana admitted to the Associated Press that he was indeed the same person wanted by the El Salvadoran police .
Orellana claimed he was innocent of the trafficking charges , that he was only helping some girls .
Orellana also told the Associated Press that he would return to El Salvador to face the charges .
Orellana talked to the Associated Press on Monday by telephone .
A woman claiming to be his mother , living in the Dominican Republic , arranged the call .
The Baptists , who have all along claimed they were innocent of human trafficking charges , are now facing greater scrutiny from the Haitian judicial system , which is investigating the ten missionaries .
They are reportedly attempting to distance themselves from Orellana .
Puello had a website , Puello Consulting , where he advertised his business as a The original website has been taken down sometime shortly after January 29th for unknown reasons .

I do n’t blame Dennis Kucinich for changing his mind and deciding to vote for Obama ’s health care reform bill .
The bill does have its merits :
It greatly expands Medicaid coverage , it increases funding for community health centers , and it subsidizes people who do n’t have a lot of money to buy health care insurance .
And depending on the fine print , the bill may end discrimination against people with preexisting conditions .
Plus , Obama and the Democratic leadership were putting enormous pressure on him , and I ’m sure he did n’t want to hand the Republicans an undeserved trophy .
But the bill is still grossly inadequate , as Kucinich himself recognizes .
The bill is still a giant giveaway to the insurance companies , as Kucinich has said many times .
The bill is nowhere near as good as single - payer , which Kucinich has campaigned for time and time again .
Most of the benefits of the bill would kick in until 2014 .
And the bill does a grave disservice to women , not only by restricting abortion coverage but by allowing insurance companies to discriminate in their pricing against women , as Dr. Sheila Levitt of Physicians for a National Health Program recently wrote .
Even though Kucinich now gives this bill his blessing , that does n’t mean that all progressive citizens need to follow suit .
Howard Zinn , a couple of years before he died , put the issue perfectly : “ When a social movement adopts the compromises of legislators , it has forgotten its role , which is to push and challenge the politicians , not to fall meekly behind them , ” he wrote .
He added : “ The mantra ‘ the best we can get ’ is a recipe for corruption .
We are not politicians , but citizens .
We have no office to hold on to , only our consciences . ”
So let ’s hold on to our consciences and demand better .
The explosive story of chemistry is the story of the building blocks that make up our entire world - the elements .
From fiery phosphorous to the pure untarnished lustre of gold and the dazzle of violent , violet potassium , everything is made of elements - the earth we walk on , the air we breathe , even us .
Yet for centuries this world was largely unknown , and completely misunderstood .
In this three - part series , professor of theoretical physics Jim Al - Khalili traces the extraordinary story of how the elements were discovered and mapped .
He follows in the footsteps of the pioneers who cracked their secrets and created a new science , propelling us into the modern age .
In the final part , Professor Al - Khalili uncovers tales of success and heartache in the story of chemists ' battle to control and combine the elements , and build our modern world .
He reveals the dramatic breakthroughs which harnessed their might to release almost unimaginable power , and he journeys to the centre of modern day alchemy , where scientists are attempting to command the extreme forces of nature and create brand new elements .
CANNABIS CULTURE – A new California state - sponsored study has found that medical cannabis can reduce pain for patients suffering from HIV / Aids , multiple sclerosis , and cancer .
“ This study confirms all of the anecdotal evidence that those of us who have been in the midst of this epidemic for many decades now , ” San Francisco Democratic State Senator Mark Leno told Capital Public Radio , “ how lives have been saved and pain has been eased as a result of medical marijuana . ”
Researchers at The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at UC - San Diego say the experiments , which involved two - hundred people participating in five different test groups , show that cannabis was just as good or better than traditional pain medications .
A news release from The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research says the group “ was created in 2000 ( through the passage of SB847 ) to conduct clinical and pre-clinical trials of cannabinoids , including smoked marijuana , to provide evidence , one way or the other , to answer the question ‘ Does marijuana have therapeutic value ? ' ”
“ We focused on illnesses where current medical treatment does not provide adequate relief or coverage of symptoms , ” said Dr. Igor Grant , CMCR director and Executive Vice - Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the UCSD School of Medicine .
“ These findings provide a strong , science - based context in which policy makers and the public can begin discussing the place of cannabis in medical care . ”
“ These scientists created an unparalleled program of systematic research , focused on science - based answers rather than political or social beliefs , ” Senator John Vasconcellos said in the release .
Vasconcellos was the original author of The Medical Marijuana Research Act of 1999 ( SB847 ) , which led to the creation of the CMCR .
The study ( PDF ) was presented to the California legislature and public on February 17 , 2010 .
They have an answer for ( almost ) everything .
Whether it ’s the writers of “ Mad Men ” calling to ensure the hit show ’s portrayal of the city in 1963 is accurate , or a fourth - grader stumped on her science project , the research librarians at the New York Public Library are the question authorities .
Created in the 1960s as the telephone reference desk , the team of six senior librarians in the catalogue area of the stunning Rose Reading Room now take hundreds of questions each day by phone , e-mail , online chat — and , as of a few weeks ago — by text message .
Most of the requests relate to mundane matters such as obtaining a library card , but each day there are several dozen juicy “ cherry questions , ” senior librarian Bernard van Maarseveen told The Post .
“ These are our bread - and - butter questions — the ones that keep us coming in each day and keep us from calling out sick , ” he said .
“ These could take days or weeks . ”
The writers of “ Mad Men , ” for instance , call frequently while working on the show .
For example :
“ Right now on taxi cabs you have lights that say ‘ off duty , ’ and they wanted to know if those lights were on in 1963 , ” said Maarseveen , whose desk is piled with books filled with such Big Apple arcana .
“ They also wanted to know what was scheduled to be on TV the day of the Kennedy assassination , ” he said .
Some of the questions are beyond the reach of Google , which often generates more results than answers , said Samantha Thompson , who manages ASK NYPL .
“ We ’re there for those times when what you find on the Internet is insufficient , ” she said .
The librarians are sometimes referees as well as references .
“ A golfer called to settle an argument — for which there was clearly money on the line , ” Thompson said .
“ He asked what is the rule if a bird picks up a golf ball and moves it off the green . ”
After consulting the game ’s rule books , she settled their bet .
“ As long as it ’s not a trained animal , moving the ball counts as a hazard of the course . ”
There are some questions the librarians will not answer .
“ No personal questions such as ‘ What are you wearing ? ’ — which we do get , ” Thompson said .
“ We also do n’t answer medical or legal questions — although we will point you to a resource . ”
Although the librarians often do information grunt work for academics and novelists , they draw the line at children ’s homework .
The free service is available 24 hours a day , with a consortium of librarians as far afield as Australia picking up the slack during off hours .
While 90 percent of the text - message questions have been pretty basic , some have been genuinely thought - provoking , Thompson said .
“ My favorite so far was : ‘ What would happen if the moon exploded ? ’ ” she said .
“ That needed some clarification .
He meant , if the moon were to disappear , would the lack of reflected light on earth cause the planet to freeze ? ”
The answer , she texted back , is no .
“ The tides would be a problem though , ” she said , “ It would not be good for surfers . ”

Lately I ’ve been thinking a lot about continuous deployment for reasons I ’m not quite yet at liberty to disclose .
This has inspired me to improve the XOM release process , to make it more of a one click process , or , to be more accurate , a one ant target process .
I can now release a new version simply by typing :
$ ant - Dpassword = secret - Dwebpassword=other_secret release
This not only builds the entire project .
It tags the release in CVS , uploads the zip and tar.gz files to IBiblio , and uploads the documentation to my web host .
It does n’t yet file a bug to upload the maven files , but I ’m working on that .
During the process of setting this up , I realized that my organization is a little backwards .
In particular , I ’m pushing all the artifacts from my local system .
Instead , I should merely be committing everything to the source code control repository ; tagging a release ; and then having the further downstream artifacts like the zip and tar.gz files and documentation pulled from source code control onto the Web servers .
There are some commercial products that are organized like this , including ThoughtWorks ’s Cruise , but none of the major open source hosting sites such as SourceForge and java .
net work like this .
Certainly , SourceForge and similar sites have been major contributors to the open source revolution .
They have enabled hobbyist developers working in their garages to use tools and techniques of software development that were previously limited to corporations .
They have it enabled far - flung developers around the world to collaborate with each other far more effectively than they could do by e-mailing each other tar files .
They have removed the burden of system administration from many programmers , thus enabling them to devote more time to writing code .
Make no mistake .
Source Forge et al. are real force for good in the community .
That said , the state of the art in software development has moved forward significantly since these sites were founded .
CVS has mostly been replaced by Subversion .
On some projects , Subversion has been been replaced by distributed version control systems such as git and Mercurial .
Unit testing and test driven development have moved from extreme practices to standard operating procedure .
Continuous integration using products like Hudson and Cruise Control is routine .
Nonetheless , most project hosting sites still offer little beyond a source code repository , a bug tracker , and some webspace .
Not that that ’s not important , but we can do so much more .
It ’s time to think about what a modern project hosting site might want to offer and what it might look like .
Continuous Integration
The first step forward , and possibly the hardest , is to add continuous integration capabilities to the existing project hosting repositories .
Every time code is checked into SourceForge or Java.net or code.google.com , the project should be built and the tests should be run .
Technically , the hard part is understanding every project ’s unique build infrastructure .
Some projects use ant ; some use make ; some use maven ; and some roll their own .
Maven is probably the most constrained of a lot .
For the others , it will be necessary to ask project owners which targets to run for which tasks .
It ’s probably a good idea to auto generate basic ant or maven or make scripts for new projects .
Beyond merely building the code , running the tests has some very serious security implications .
Currently project hosting sites do not run third - party code .
They store it ; they display it ; they make it available and bundle it up as tar and zip files ; but they do n’t even compile it , much less run it .
Running arbitrary third - party Java and C code submitted by any random teenager with attention deficit disorder somewhere on the Internet is begging for trouble .
10 years ago I would ’ve thought this was insane and impossible .
But now , just maybe we can do it .
In fact , there are several services on the Internet today that will run arbitrary third - party code for all comers .
Amazon ’s EC2 service lets anybody with a credit card run what amounts to a complete rooted Linux box on Amazon ’s network .
Google ’s AppEngine let ’s more or less anyone , credit card or no , run Python and Java code inside Google ’s cloud .
And these are hardly the only such services .
Advances in virtualization and security sandboxing have made this possible .
That said , it certainly helps to have a real user attached to any code that you run so you know who to blame when it starts spamming the world .
However when an application goes rogue whether through malice or incompetence , it is possible to shut it down quickly .
It is possible to limit the resources used by anyone test suite , and to limit what else I can see on the same filesystem and the same network .
Codehaus uses Atalassian Bamboo to provide continuous integration , including test running , for their projects .
However they ’re a relatively small site that ’s somewhat picky about the projects they host .
They do use a separate server for the continuous integration .
I ’m not sure what other , if any , security precautions they put in place .
Launchpad builds Ubuntu packages , but I ’m not sure of they run tests .
JavaForge builds Java code and runs the unit tests , apparently on top of Amazon EC2 .
Assembla will build and run tests , and also uses Amazon EC2 .
Both of these thereby delegate some of the security issues to Amazon ’s virtualized systems .
submit queue
Once we ’ve solved the problem of running continuous integration servers on project hosting sites , the next step is to flip them around .
The usual process is to commit code to the repository and have the continuous integration server pull the code out of the repository .
Then , if the build or tests fail , the continuous integration server goes into red mode and sends out alerts .
Would n’t it be better if the server never turned red in the first place ?
What should happen is that new code gets sent directly to the continuous integration server rather than to the source code repository .
The continuous integration server pulls the latest known good build from the repository .
then it patches the new code into the build and runs the tests .
If the tests pass , the continuous integration server commits the code to the repository .
If the tests fail , the code is never committed at all .
So far as I know , no current project hosting sites offer this ; and it ’s a relatively uncommon feature even among self hosted projects .
However , it ’s a critical one , especially when accepting contributions from the wide world of programmers , not all of whom have yet learned the importance of test driven development .
I suppose such a site could also perform other checks on the source code .
For example , it could verify coding conventions or measure the incremental code coverage before and after the check - in .
It could automatically reject any patches that did not meet some predetermined measures of quality .
That said , automated checks tend to be better used as additional data for humans to evaluate rather than as hard and fast rules .
One way this can happen is by offering code metrics to code reviewers .
This brings us to the next improvement in the code hosting ecosystem .
Code Reviews
Committing code , even assuming all the tests pass , is still a serious operation .
Most open source projects do n’t want to allow just anyone to commit code willy - nilly .
Usually there ’s a core group of committers that reviews all incoming patches and decides whether or not to accept them , to reject them , or to send them back for further work .
This is somewhat labor - intensive both on the reviewer and the reviewee .
However , if we move to a submit queue - based system , this can become somewhat more straightforward .
The continuous integration server can check every incoming patch regardless of the submitter ’s status .
If the tests pass , it can send an automatic request for review to a project commiter .
If the commiter approves the change , then the continuous integration server can commit it to the source code control repository .
Indeed , it ’s probably a good idea to require code reviews for all submitted changes , not just those from new users .
After all , it ’s not like the project ’s owners are immune from introducing bugs .
In fact , they probably introduce more than anybody else , if for no other reason than that they commit more code than anyone else .
Code reviews are well known for increasing the quality of a code base and avoiding stupid errors , yet they ’re one of the lesser used software development practices among open - source programmers .
It ’s time for that to change .
Web - based code review interfaces such as Guido von Rossum ’s Rietveld have the potential to really move the community forward here .
We should integrate this technology or something equivalent into project hosting sites .
code.google.com already offers code review , and a few others like BitBucket do too .
The rest should follow .
One - button deployment
The final stage of software development is deployment .
Eventually the software has to ship to and be installed by its intended users .
Here is one area where open source projects have a significantly easier time than a lot of commercial projects , especially enterprise projects .
The deployment process for many open source projects consists of little more than uploading a few jar files and some documentation to the right directories on the right Web servers .
This should become a one - button operation .
All of project owners should have to do to release a new version is choose a version number and push a button .
The server should pull all the code , documentation , and configuration information out of the source code repository ; build everything ; and put all the finished artifacts in the right locations .
No further manual work should be required .
This does require that absolutely everything needed to release goes into the repository ; not only code but also HTML files , images , config files , and more .
The only things that do n’t go into the repository are the artifacts that are built from these components : jar files , zip files , Javadoc , etc .
Maven comes close to this , but it still builds and deploys from a local system rather than from the version control repository .
This should be turned around .
Ideally , maven deploy should work with nothing more than a pom.xml file .
Deploying should n’t need to access the local maven repository or the local copy of the source code at all .
Summary
There might even be a startup idea in here somewhere .
Open source projects are n’t the only ones that would like to offload some of the routine system administration tasks involved in running source code control repositories , continuous integration servers , bug trackers , and deployment pipelines .
More likely , what ’s really needed are some tweaks in and additions to the existing project hosting services .
Or perhaps we can even take advantage of the advances in virtualization technology to install these services on top of Amazon EC2 and similar platforms .
But one thing is for certain : if open source projects are to keep pace with and surpass closed systems , then their software development practices need to be at least as good and probably better than the state - of - the - art in the overall software development community .
In order to do that , it ’s time to upgrade our tools .
Chalomish denies two counts of intent to supply the drug A rabbi financed a drug - dealing business and offered cocaine to girls in exchange for sex , a court heard .
Rabbi Baruch Chalomish , of Upper Park Road , Salford , rented an apartment where he could " relax and have a party " , Manchester Crown Court heard .
Police raided the Salford flat and discovered a total of 101 grams ( 3.6 oz ) of cocaine and more than £ 17,000 .
Chalomish , 54 , admits two counts of possessing cocaine but denies two of possession with intent to supply .
His business partner Nasir Abbas , 54 , has failed to turn up for the trial and is being sought by police , the court was told by Michael Goldwater , prosecuting .
He faces one charge of possessing cocaine and one of possession with intent to supply .
' Commercial supply '
Mr Goldwater said police found both defendants at the one - bedroom apartment during a raid on 5 January .
Forms showed that it was rented from the firm Premier Apartments in the name of Mr Abbas .
He said : " Our case is that Abbas and Chalomish were dealing in controlled drugs .
" They were running , we say , a commercial cocaine supply operation from an apartment - hotel in Shudehill , Manchester .
" Rabbi Chalomish also had a substantial store of drugs , cocaine , and cash at his home address . "
Drugs paraphernalia was found in the bedroom , including about 6g ( 0.2 oz ) of cocaine , rolled up banknotes and credit cards .
He said Shell [ the rabbi ] wanted to relax and have a party at the flat
Michael Goldwater , prosecuting Mr Goldwater said the purity of the cocaine varied in strength from 29 % to 82 % .
Cutting agents to dilute the drug were also discovered , along with about £ 2,400 in cash , he said .
Mr Goldwater told the jury that the purity of the cocaine was higher than the UK average of 28 % , a fact they might find " significant " .
The jury heard that when interviewed by police , Mr Abbas said he knew the rabbi as " Shell " and rented the apartment on his behalf .
Mr Goldwater said : " He said Shell wanted to relax and have a party at the flat .
" He said there had been a lot of people come through the flat in the last 10 days , most of them girls . "
Mr Abbas told detectives that Shell did not sell drugs - but did not mind if others wanted to take them .
" He said he had seen Shell putting white powder in a glass dish and mixing it with another substance , and anyone visiting was free to help themselves . "
Sexual services Mr Goldwater told the jury that Mr Abbas had a previous conviction for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs in March 1996 .
During his final police interview , Chalomish told officers he bought large quantities of cocaine for himself and often used it when he could not sleep , the jury heard .
Mr Goldwater said the prosecution did not exclude the possibility that there might be some truth in what Mr Abbas told the police .
" That some of the drugs were given to young women who came to the flat and that one or more of those young women may have provided sexual services , " he added .
" We do say that it was essentially a commercial operation .
" Nasir Abbas had the know - how , knew the drugs business , had the contacts , he would know where to obtain the drugs , how much to pay and how to find customers .
" Rabbi Chalomish would not have necessarily had the knowledge , we say Chalomish was the financier , he put up the money . "
The trial was adjourned until Thursday .

His most popular music video , Life in Quarantine , has amassed more than 280,000 hits on his YouTube channel and several hundred thousand more on CollegeHumor.com .
More than 6000 people have signed up to be van Vuuren 's fans on Facebook , while close to 2000 follow him on Twitter .
" The only ways I 'd use the internet when I came in here was for email and whereis.com and finding out where I have to go , what I have to do , but now as a result of being in here in quarantine and [ physically ] separated from the rest of the world , I ... am more accessible and in touch with the world than I ever have been before , " he said in a phone interview .
He now gets a constant stream of supportive messages from people all over the world , and some fans have been so caught up in his " Fully Sick Rapper " alter - ego that they send him photos of themselves acting out scenes from his videos .
" It 's made my time in here so much easier because the thing I was most worried about with this is I could potentially waste months of my life and I 'm glad that that has n't been the case , " he said .
He says he only started making the videos to pass the time in hospital and keep in touch with his mates on the outside .
But he had to upload his first clip , I 'm not sick , but I 'm sick sick , to YouTube because it was too difficult to send it around on email .
" In that first video you can just see how bored I am - I 'm dancing around with my hospital gown as a cape , stomping around the room , " he said .
The clip began racking up thousands of hits within days .
" I 've had girls offer to send me naked photos of themselves to keep me company in hospital ... people have sent me messages on the chat lines telling me that they 're touching themselves and they'd love to just be in here and keep me company and that they'd be more than happy to wear a mask if they can stay in the same bed as me , " he said .
But beneath his newfound celebrity , van Vuuren is battling serious issues .
The outdoor advertising sales rep was rushed to hospital on December 9 after continuously coughing up blood during a work meeting .
He knew immediately that his condition was serious .
" I thought , I 've seen this in the movies before and it's only when someone 's taken a bullet in the stomach or an arrow in the back or something , " he said .
After detecting a hole in his right lung the size of a 50 - cent piece , doctors identified the disease as tuberculosis , suspecting he contracted it during his travels to South Africa or South America .
He was released from hospital on January 1 but within weeks was called back in after doctors realised he was infected with a strain of the disease that was resistant to many drugs used to treat it - a rarity in the developed world .
He has remained in hospital ever since and doctors are unable to tell him when he will be released .
Loading
In the meantime , he plans to continue churning out his YouTube raps .
He has also begun selling T - shirts online , promising all proceeds will go towards the World Health Organisation 's fight against TB .
" I 've got to stay in here as long as it takes to get a clean result from the tests ...
I could be out of here in three weeks , I could be out of here in six weeks , I could be out of here in six months , " he said .

Javascript development in the browser is all about the Elements .
Manipulating the DOM happens every few lines of code .
It ’s important enough that some libraries provide little more than DOM enhancements .
Not to worry though , MooTools provides greatly in this area as well .
$ and $ $
Most of you probably know the two document methods getElementById and querySelectorAll ; because if you do , you understand how we select elements with MooTools methods .
For those of you that do n’t , you provide an ID string of an element in to getElementById , and a CSS selector string to querySelectorAll .
The functions $ ( which is an alias to document .id , see this post on Dollar Safe Mode for details ) and $ $ are basically equivalent to getElementById and querySelectorAll , respectively .
Of course , since it ’s MooTools , they ’re more than that .
The dollar function , if given a string , will basically call getElementBy Id on the document .
If passed an element , it will just return the element , and if you pass an object with a toElement method , it will try to convert it to an element ( we ’ll explore that more a couple sections down ) .
A key difference you ’ll find between MooTools ’ dollar function and jQuery ’s is this : MooTools ’ $ ( ) will only ever return 1 Element , and it will return null if no matching element is found .
This means unless you ’re absolutely 110 % certain the element will exist , you ’ll need to check the returned value before starting to call Element methods on it .
var loginEl = $( ' Login ' ) ; if ( loginEl ) { loginEl.fade ( ' in ' ) ; }
The MooTools Team prefers two separate methods for the selecting elements ; to remove any doubt about what a certain function call may be returning , we have one method for individual elements and another for multiple elements .
In this case , it ’s preferable to be explicit , instead of relying to ambiguous auto -magic .
When we see $ , we expect an element if it exists .
When we see $ $ , we expect an array of elements ( which , as you know , an array can always be empty ) .
The double dollar function has some neat tricks that are explained in its own section below .
All this talk about Elements , but only about how to select them .
MooTools also provides an excellent Element construction API .
new Element ( )
With vanilla JS ( mmm , vanilla… ) , you ’d use document .
createElement whenever you wanted to create and add a new element to the DOM .
MooTools tries to make the JavaScript API more pleasant to use ; part of that is a more consistent and easy to use syntax and part of it is using more Object - Oriented programming practices .
It feels a lot more OO when creating objects using the new keyword , whereas the standard way is more procedural .
It turns out that every element you could create inherits from the Element prototype .
Specifically , the elements you create through document .
createElement would be HTMLDivElement , or HTMLParagraphElement , or whichever element you create .
Like I said , they all inherit from the base Element prototype , and then HTMLElement , and so on .
MooTools extends the base Element class , so that all elements receive some MooTools love .
MooTools augments the Element native , providing a super - duper sweet constructor .
You can provide the tag name , and then an object of properties to set on the new element .
The returned object is of the same type as the $ method mentioned above .
The properties you can set are fairly extensive , so check out the documentation to learn more about them , but here ’s a demonstration .
toElement
The dollar method provides another function : converting the instance of class into an element ( - al ? ) form .
This is similar to a toString function , which converts objects into strings when needed .
You can define a method in a class called toElement , and return an element to “ represent ” the instance .
Let ’s take a look at a snippet from a Person Class :
Several extensions in MooTools
More take advantage of this , like Form .
Request , Form .
Validator , HtmlTable , and others .
And many plugins in the Forge use this approach as well .
This means that after creating an instance of one of these classes , you can just hold on to the instance in your code .
Whenever you want to affect the element that the instance is controlling , you just use $ ( instance ) to retrieve it .
Aaron even cooked up a ToElement mixin , and wrote a bit more about this over here .
Elements
I pointed out earlier that $ $ returns an array - like object containing Elements .
It actually returns an object called exactly that : Elements .
Behind the scenes , MooTools gets an array of all the elements that meet the selector ( so it 's still an array ) , and then extends the array with all the Elements methods .
Why would we want that ?
All the methods that MooTools adds to the Element native are added to the Elements class as well .
You can do some pretty nifty chaining because of this .
First of all , you do n’t have to check that it did n’t return null .
This is because any method you call on Elements , will loop through the array and try to call the method on each individual element .
Even with an empty array , the loop wo n’t cause an error .
And any method you call that would normally return a value , will return an array of the values from each element .
An example should make this clearer :
$ $( 'a ' ) .addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( e ) { e.preventDefault ( ) ; alert ( this .href ) ; } ) ; var ids = $ $ ( ' div[ id ] ' ) . get ( ' id ' ) .sort ( ) ; $ $ ( ' div > ul ' ) .getParent ( ) .addClass ( ' has - list ' ) ;
While you could put together long chains acting on all the elements you ’ve selected , I ’d advise against this .
It certainly looks cool , and will work fine one or 2 methods out on the chain .
But every method call will cause another loop through all the elements .
If you ’re doing a lot of things to every element , you might as well do it all in a single pass .
I ’ll show you what I mean .
$ $( 'li a ' ) .addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( e ) {}).addClass ( ' alertable ' ) . fade ( ' in ' ) ; $ $ ( 'li a ' ) .each ( function ( link ) { link.addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( e ) { alert ( this . title ) ; } ) ; link.addClass ( ' alertable ' ) ; link.fade ( 'in ' ) ; } ) ;
Still , when doing something simple , you can skip the each call , since Elements will handle that for you .
Concluding
MooTools provides a lot of expressive power when working with the DOM .
It 's consistent API makes it a snap to add events , change styles , create elements and more .
The object oriented nature of its implementation makes it so that you can extend Elements for your own purposes .
Look forward to my next post where I 'll talk about extending Elements in various ways and cover best practices for when you decide to bend Elements to your own will .

THE problem with wind power is that is cannot always be relied upon .
The wind — and other transient , environmental energy sources such as solar — must either be used when it is harvested or stored expensively in batteries or specially designed hydroelectric schemes that use the resulting energy to pump water uphill .
Alternatives would be extremely welcome .
Alexander Slocum , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , thinks he has one .
Observing that the fashion among wind - power fans is to build turbines out at sea , where the wind blows strongest , he proposes a pumped - storage system that uses seawater .
Dr Slocum 's scheme involves anchoring a hexagonal array of hollow , 31 - metre - diameter concrete spheres to the ocean floor at a depth of approximately 350 metres .
Floating turbines would be tethered to these spheres and surplus power from these turbines , generated during periods of high wind and low electrical demand , would be used to pump water out of the spheres , evacuating the central chamber .
When the wind faltered or the lights went back on , water forced into the central chamber by the pressure of the surrounding ocean would pass through a turbine and generate electricity .
Each sphere would provide a five megawatt turbine with four hours of storage capacity .
An all - concrete structure would simplify the manufacturing process and allow experience garnered exploiting the oil fields of the North Sea to be used , says Dr Slocum .
This knowledge , he thinks , should allow the structures to have lifetimes of about four decades .
The load - smoothing effect of the system will also allow the transmission lines linking the turbines with the shore to be cheaper ( because they will not have to cope with peak capacity ) and deliver power that , being better matched to demand , is worth more .
In combination , he thinks , these things will bring the price of offshore wind power into line with that of its onshore cousin .
They will also make an electricity grid supplied primarily by renewable sources a technically feasible proposition by reassuring customers that the lights will never go off .
His system would , for example , make it possible for a bank of several hundred thousand offshore turbines dotted along the 800 km of America 's eastern seaboard from Maine to New Jersey to meet the electricity needs of the eastern United States as reliably as existing coal - based generators .
It would not be as cheap as coal , of course .
Nothing is .
But it would eliminate the argument that “ alternative ” is not merely expensive , but also unreliable .

( CNN ) --
With allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests piling up in Germany and Ireland and surfacing in Austria and the Netherlands , Europe appears poised to face church abuse in the broad , wrenching way the United States did in the last decade .
But because Europe is home to the Catholic Church , new revelations of abuse there could have different -- and more serious -- consequences for the church and Pope Benedict XVI .
" Is he likely to resign ?
No , " Vatican analyst John Allen told CNN , referring to the pope .
" The last pope to resign was in the 12th century .
To date , very few Catholic bishops of any sort have resigned over mishandling the crisis . "
" Does this do enormous damage to him and his papacy , does it damage his moral credibility and his reputation ? "
Allen continued .
" There is a risk there . "
In recent weeks allegations of abuse by priests have been accumulating fastest in Germany , Benedict 's home country .
On Friday , the archdiocese of Munich revealed that it had allowed an abusive priest to continue pastoring in the early 1980s , when Pope Benedict -- then known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- was archbishop there .
It was the first incident of the handling of a case of priestly sexual abuse to possibly implicate the pontiff himself .
The Vatican responded swiftly to the disclosure , with the archdiocese 's number two official from the time claiming full responsibility for allowing the priest to continue ministering .
But more sexual abuse allegations are expected to emerge across Europe .
" It is like a tsunami or an extensive fire , " said Father Andreas Batlogg , editor of the German Jesuit magazine Stimmen der Zeit .
" The estimated number of undetected cases seems to be far higher than the yet known ones . "
Nearly every day since the end of January , more Germans have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests , with roughly 170 reporting such abuse .
Two self - identified German victims were connected to a boy 's choir that was directed by Father Georg Ratzinger , the pope 's brother , from 1964 to 1994 .
The accusations in Germany emerged just as the Vatican was responding to the sex abuse scandal in Ireland , where a 2009 government report found that the church for decades covered up widespread sexual abuse by priests there .
The pope met with Irish bishops last month to discuss the scandal and is expected to issue a letter on the matter as early as this week .
Many Vatican watchers now expect that letter to address the church abuse allegations roiling broader Europe .
Last week Catholic bishops in the Netherlands announced an independent investigation into allegations of child abuse by clergy after hundreds of reports flowed in following revelations about such abuse at a Dutch boarding school in the 1960s and 1970s .
Accusations of sex abuse have also begun mounting in Austria .
" There 's certainly a domino effect , a kind of momentum building , " said David Gibson , a Vatican expert and Benedict biographer .
" Once allegations come out , two things happen : it emboldens other victims to speak up and it emboldens the authorities , because the public outrage about these crimes make the church less of a sacred cow . "
In some ways , the fallout from the sex abuse scandal in Europe may be less dramatic than in the U.S. , where the Catholic Church has paid out $ 2.5 billion to victims of sexual abuse since the scandal broke in Boston in 2002 .
The church in Europe may be more difficult to sue because it receives state support in many countries and because of statute of limitations laws .
And the continent is already much more secular than the United States .
But the Vatican appears sensitive to damage that the new sex abuse allegations could inflict , especially as the charges get closer to the pope .
The Vatican pushed back with unusual speed against suggestions that the pope mishandled the abusive priest in Munich 's archdiocese .
" [ O ]ver recent days some people have sought -- with considerable persistence ... [ to ] personally involve the Holy Father in questions of abuse , " a Vatican spokesman said Saturday .
" To any objective observer , it is clear that these efforts have failed . "
But the allegations in Germany and across Europe are likely to keep coming .
" It 's a very volatile and dangerous time for the Vatican , " said Gibson .
" How can he ask bishops ( who chose to retain abusive priests ) to resign in Ireland if it comes out tomorrow that he did similar things ? "
Until now , Benedict has been praised in some quarters for his handling of the church 's sex abuse crisis .
He is the first pontiff to meet with victims of church abuse in the United States , for instance .
" This is not just another crisis story about the papacy that has had plenty of crises , " Allen said .
" It 's happening in the one area where even Benedict 's critics have been willing to give him credit . "
Standing Silent Nation
What does a family have to endure to create a future for itself ?
In April 2000 , Alex White Plume and his Lakota family planted industrial hemp on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota after other crops had failed .
They put their hopes for a sustainable economy in hemp ’s hardiness and a booming worldwide demand for its many products , from clothing to food .
Although growing hemp , a relative of marijuana , was banned in the U.S. , Alex believed that tribal sovereignty , along with hemp ’s non-psychoactive properties , would protect him .
But when federal agents raided the White Plumes ’ fields , the Lakota Nation was swept into a Byzantine struggle over tribal sovereignty , economic rights and common sense .

The Iditarod plans to test mushers for drugs and alcohol in March , a change many mushers have no problem with -- but one that three - time champion Lance Mackey scoffs at .
" I think it 's a little bit ridiculous , " Mackey said Wednesday night from his home near Fairbanks after a training run .
" It is a dog race , not a human race .
It ( using a drug ) does n't affect the outcome of the race . "
Mackey , a throat cancer survivor who has a medical marijuana card , admits to using marijuana on the trail and thinks his success has made some of his competitors jealous .

Hello , my name is Diana , and I am obsessed with cheese .
I ’ve stood for a full 30 minutes in front of a cheese case , not speaking or touching anything , simply staring at the abundance and variety of amazing cheeses .
I ’ve taken a plate full of cheese samples to a corner all by myself so I can savor the nuances of each bite completely without distraction .
My current favorite is a lovely orange cheese called Mimolette , which I got hooked on when my friends Todd and Diane brought it on our trip to Mexico .
But I have to tell you , Mimolette has a dirty little secret .
Do you see those little holes near the rind of the cheese ?
They ’re not air bubbles , they did n’t somehow happen while the wedge of cheese was being cut .
No , nothing that simple or palatable .
They were made by mites , yes that ’s right , I ’m talking about little creatures , burrowing in the cheese .
If you want to see a picture of cheese mites , well beware !
But the good news is that they ’re gone by the time you eat the cheese !
According to several cheese experts I spoke with , the mites are introduced to add flavor to the cheese ( which gets its beautiful orange hue from a natural dye called annatto ) .
Basically , as they burrow through the cheese and devour the rind , they promote air flow and flavor development as the cheese ages .
The mites are gone before the cheese is sold , and you do n’t really eat the cheese rind anyway because it ’s rock hard !
Mimolette typically has three stages , demi-vielle which is “ half old ” or around six months of aging , vielle which is “ old ” and about a year aged , and tres - vielle or “ very old ” at 18 months .
At two years it gets thrown away .
Sad !
As the cheese ages , its flavor profile changes dramatically .
At the demi vielle stage it ’s VERY hard ( hurt my teeth ! ) and has an oily quality to it .
The mimolette vielle starts out mild but has a complex after taste .
I had Eric try some right before we went on a walk .
He said , ” It ’s good , tastes like a mild cheddar or something .
Nothing special . ”
Then 3 minutes away from the house he said “ Wow !
That cheese has a great aftertaste ! ”
It has a nutty quality to it , and sometimes hints of fruit or caramel as well .
I like to gnaw on the inside of the rind where the flavor is the strongest !
I have n’t tried the tres-vielle but hear that it has a much stronger nuttiness .
It would be expensive to buy a whole pound ( do n’t think I have n’t considered it ! ) , but my wedge was under $ 5 .
One of our favorite ways to eat is high quality ingredients used simply .
A wedge of cheese , a loaf of crusty bread with oil and vinegar for dipping , some grapes and apples and we ’re good to go !
I highly recommend this for a cheese platter to start a party .
You could grab some brie , and maybe a blue cheese , a couple of baguettes thinly sliced , and some olives to have a starter course for 10 that ’s only about $ 2 a person .
Plus it ’s a great way to weed out the timid eaters ( and have more for yourself ! ) .
Just wait until everyone ’s tried the cheese , tell them about the mites , and see how many people avoid it after that .
Quite a conversation starter !
My plan for my next wedge of Mimolette is to make macaroni and cheese , if I can keep from eating it first 🙂

Somehow we do n't think that the evil hedge funds that were excluded from participating in Greece 's most recent round of issuance are spending their nights weeping over this snub .
The 6.25 % bonds maturing in 2020 , which priced at 98.942 are now trading at their lows of 98.36 , with a corresponding yield of almost 6.5 % , compared to the issuance yield of 6.35 % .
Due to the perception of yield " stickiness " in the eyes of investors , and as any new issuance will likely have to contend with the stigmata of resulting in underwater status within a few weeks of the break , we fully expect the next round cash coupon to be about 6.5 % .
Unfortunately , even as Greece does all it can to prevent over 10 % of its GDP being paid out to foreign lenders in the form of bond interest , it will have no choice but to price the next bond issue in the mid 6 % range , making its economic predicament increasingly more dire .
And the worst thing is Greece is running out of both time and options , a ticking time bomb very much appreciated by savvy bond investors who can tell the underwriters during interest inquiry that anything below a 6.5 % yield is a non-starter .
If there were any doubt that our constitutional protection has been lost , that doubt should be removed by the congressional vote subjecting the personal health care decisions of every American to central governmental authority .

By an extremely narrow majority , the House of Representatives has crammed a profoundly unpopular and unconstitutional measure down the throats of the American public :
And not only unpopular and unconstitutional , but expensive enough to virtually ensure our nations eventual bankruptcy .
Unless it is overturned , nationalized health care will complete the process of changing the Founders system of a government dependent on the people to one where the people are dependent on the government .
Citizens will be thoroughly re-molded into subjects .
The unseemly legislative conduct ( the Founders would have called it  corruption ) leading up to the vote have communicated even to those previously not paying attention that federal politicians are now absolutely , utterly out of control .
The majority in Congress has rendered it perfectly clear that there is no constitutional or legal restriction they will not violate .
As congressional rumblings about the recent Citizens United decision have suggested , protections for free speech may be next .
There is no good response to these outrages  that is , good in the sense of easy and foolproof :
After all , the very people who perpetrated them also control Americas nuclear arsenal .
There are only responses that , while difficult , offer real hope of success .
Here are a few :
Widespread court challenges , on every colorable constitutional , legal , and technical ground we can think of .
State governments can take a leading role in this , by virtue of the fact that state governments are more likely than individuals to have standing in federal court .
State governments and officials also have much to lose if the feds are allowed to complete their health care takeover .

Ostrowski , James Best Price : $ 0.47 Buy New $ 5.75 ( as of 09:05 EST - Details )
Health care provider non-compliance :
To the extent they can , physicians and other providers should opt out of the system .
Their choices include partial or complete refusal to participate in Medicare , Medicaid , and other government programs ; refusal to take any but direct - payment patients ; reduced work hours ; and even career change and early retirement .
Students considering a medical career should now reconsider .
Given the ominous nature of the federal health care coup dtat , my guess is that a lot of this will happen anyway .
State constitutional amendments .
One excellent idea is the amendment proposed in many states guaranteeing that the state will never participate in any system that denies patients and physicians the right to their own health - care decisions .
Civil disobedience .
This should include state non-compliance with federal health - care mandates and peaceful resistance by providers and citizens at every level .
The model here should be the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s .
Redoubling efforts for the 2010 elections .
The people responsible for this bill should be cleaned out of Congress  all of them .
In addition , we need to gear up for 2012 and ensure that state lawmakers elected in 2010 fully understand their constitutional obligations .
Amend - to - Save .
A clean sweep of Congress is not enough .
There is now no escaping it  we need amend our Constitution to save it , or we will not have any Constitution left .
There is nothing new in this last proposal .
Our fathers , grandfathers , and their predecessors all adopted constitutional amendments designed less to change the system than to preserve it .
Again and again , the American people adopted formal amendments to rein in the politicians and restore or reinforce Founding principles .

Thus , the Ninth Amendment made clear that federal powers were not to be interpreted too expansively .
The Tenth Amendment clarified that the central government had no authority other than that granted by the Constitution .
The Eleventh reversed a Supreme Court opinion that conflicted with the dominant understanding of the ratifiers .
The Twenty - First Amendment restored control over alcoholic beverages to the states , where the Founders had left it .
The Twenty - Second Amendment restored the two - term presidential tradition set by Washington , Jefferson , and Madison .
The Twenty - Seventh , although not finally adopted until 1992 , had been proposed by James Madison and sent to the states by the First Congress .
The Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth ( the post - Civil War amendments ) were more radical , but also principally fulfilled the ideals of the Founding .
Now we need a Twenty - Eight , Twenty - Ninth , and Thirtieth Amendment  not so much to change the Founders Constitution as to restore it .
How ?
Congress will not reform itself .
Fortunately , the Founders recognized that when Congress veered completely out of control , there had to be a way to amend without its consent .
Hence , they wrote into the Constitution a procedure whereby two - thirds of the states could propose amendments , which would then be drafted by a convention , and approved only if three - quarters of the states ratified them .
We now have no choice :
We are going to have to use that method .
That s why state legislative races are so important this year .

Peru studio 51 - 1 Arquitectos and Colombian architects Ctrl G have won a competition to design an extension to the Modern Art Museum of Medellin , Colombia .
Drawing on the brick structures of the local barrios , the new building will be made up of stacked boxes .
These will create a series of terraces that visitors will access by internal or external circulation .
The information below is from the architects :
Modern Art Museum of Medellin second phase
51 - 1 arquitectos ( Supersudaca Peru ) & Ctrl G ( Colombia )
Medellin is a very steep valley and the city settles on its slopes .
You are always going up or going down .
With the typical growth pattern of Latin - American cities , informal barrios settle in impossible geographies of very difficult access .
Piled on top of each other , brick constructions from the barrios , go terracing and generating thousands of public interstices and small squares where people exercise their urbanity in flexible and ingenious ways .
Medellin's successive governments have invested in exceptional infrastructure projects in those barrios , aiming to structure and integrate them into the ' formal ' city with such series of public equipment as library parks , schools , squares , cable cars , bridges , etc .
The city has arrived to the barrio .
After those successful emblematic interventions in the urged barrios of the North and Center of the city , Medellin now proposes itself to intervene in more affluent areas of the South .
The dismantled premises of the former steel factory SIMESA , have been turned into the ' Ciudad del Rio ' ( River City ) : a rigid urban development of housing and office towers dependent of a shopping mall .
Public space has been reduced to a narrow park and to the new venue of the Modern Art Museum ( MAMM ) in a recycled industrial building .
If the informal barrios had soul and its structure what have been given , the new Ciudad del Rio has structure but lacks soul .
That task the new MAMM shall do .
The international invited competition called for the proposal of an extension of the museum next to the industrial building .
If formality of the city was exported to the barrios , to the excessive formality of the new Ciudad del Rio could be imported the vitality of the barrios .
A Yin yang Dadaist .
As in Duchamp 's urinal taken to the museum , in this case we take the Medellin sloped barrio to the Ciudad del Rio .
The alternative to the shopping mall as leisure space - MAMM 's role - must happen from the generation of a barrio .
The program for the museum competition consisted of series of rooms without any relationship among them .
For us it seemed more important the relationship between the exterior public spaces that would activate the neighborhood than between the interior spaces .
This condition allows to stop thinking of the project as in a conventional building .
The organization logic is based then on the basic rules of each program component having an address to the circulation and the flexibility to growth over time ( just like the barrios ! )
This way the project for the new museum is an informal ( but strategic ) pilement of blocks that create enormous potentialities in the multiple terraces generated at the interstices .
Also those terraces can be seen as spatial reserves for the future growth of the enclosed spaces of the museum .
We see it as an incomplete museum .
A museum which can be completed ephemerally with tents and kiosks or definitely by building the terraces until the whole building turns into an impenetrable cube .
This is not a defined and finished building , it is a barrio .
The project is planned as the new main entry of the museum articulating the new spaces of the extension with the existing ones , and with this gesture the MAMM opens itself to the neighboring ìel Pobladoî district .
The project has a vertical circulation through the interior of the blocks , thus controlled and weather protected , but also ( and specially ) an exterior circulation that connects one terrace with the other , bringing the public on a path from the street up to the upper platform .
Each one of these terraces can be conceived as a small square , making the museum ' a cascade of plazuelas ' .
This double circulation ( indoors and outdoors ) allows great flexibility both for exhibitions and simultaneity of events .
For instance , the temporal gallery in the third level can be accessed from the external circulation while the one in the fourth can be reached independently from the internal passages .
The lower level 's vocation is to be integrated to the adjacent park .
In a simple manner , the theater can be incorporated to it and become a stage that interacts with it .
Towards the center of the museum , the piling of blocks generate a vertical central atrium that allows for a great diversity of uses .

What Alcohol Does to Your Mind : Attentional Myopia
Alcohol makes us attentionally ‘ short - sighted ’ — this helps explain its popularity and its variable effects .
We tend to think of alcohol as primarily a disinhibitor , but this ca n’t really explain its varying effects .
Sometimes it seems to make us loud and boisterous , sometimes quiet and contemplative , sometimes sad and depressed , along with all the shades and combinations of these , and other emotions .
Similarly psychologists have found that alcohol can have all sorts of counter - intuitive effects .
Studies have even shown that after drinking people can become less aggressive and less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours .
Does n’t sound like alcohol does it ?
So , how can we understand and explain all these different states ?
Spiked drinks
Folk psychology ( and research ) tells us that some of the varying effects of alcohol come from culture and individual differences .
There are violent drunks , depressive drunks , sleepy drunks , amorous drunks and all the rest .
Culture and social norms also pitch in with their own influences .
We have certain expectations about how alcohol will shift us into parallel states of consciousness and , hey presto , so it does .
One study gave participants a fizzy drink and told them it contained vodka ( Assefi & Garry , 2003 ) .
They were soon acting drunk , complete with inflated egos , despite having had nothing more toxic than tonic water .
The problem with the expectations explanation is that we ’re not reliably shifted into the same parallel state of consciousness .
If culture and personality mostly explained the psychological effects of alcohol , then how come we can have quite different experiences while drinking ?
So clearly alcohol ’s effects must depend on the exact situation in which we drink .
But which features of a situation nudge our feelings and behaviour in one or other direction , one time towards depressive introspection , say , and another time towards joyous extraversion ?
Alcohol myopia
According to a growing body of evidence collected over the last three or more decades , people ’s Jekyll and Hyde behaviour while drinking can be understood by a simple idea which has some intriguing ramifications .
The alcohol myopia model says that drink makes our attentional system short - sighted and the more we drink , the more short - sighted it becomes .
With more alcohol our brains become less and less able to process peripheral cues and more focused on what is right in front of us .
It ’s this balance between what is right in front of us and what we do n’t notice around the edges that determines how alcohol affects us in different situations .
Here are a few effects which imbibers will recognise immediately :
An ego boost : when people drink , they often feel better about themselves .
This may be because the attentional short - sightedness induced by alcohol makes all our shortcomings float away and so we feel closer to our ideal selves .
This is probably one of the reasons it is so potentially addictive , it is self - actualisation in bottle form .

Pleasure in the moment : the flip - side of this attentional focus is that if , while drinking , we are doing something enjoyable , we find it easier to ignore any nagging doubts or stray worries wandering through our minds .
We can be totally in the moment listening to music , watching sports or talking with a good friend .

In the zone : it ’s even possible that for some types of task it may increase performance as we let go of our insecurities .
Perhaps that ’s why so many writers wrote with a glass of whisky at their side .
More than just disinhibition
The fact that the effect of alcohol on the human mind is more than just disinhibition is supported by studies showing how , when environmental cues are manipulated , alcohol can have counter - intuitive effect .
Here are three neat studies :
Alcohol can lower levels of aggression : participants were asked to administer electric shocks to a fictitious opponent ( Giancola and Corman , 2007 ) .
Those who were intoxicated and moderately distracted from the task were less aggressive than participants who had n’t been drinking .
In certain circumstances , then , alcohol can make drunk people less aggressive .
Alcohol can induce less risky sexual behaviour : people in a nightclub were asked whether they would engage in unprotected sex ( MacDonald et al. , 2000 ) .
Those who had been drinking indicated they would be less likely to do so when they had the following message stamped on their hand : AIDS KILLS .
Alcohol can increase anxiety about giving a public talk : intoxicated people about to give a public presentation were more nervous about their upcoming ordeal than those who had n’t been drinking ( Steele & Josephs , 1988 ) .
This is the complete reverse of the received wisdom .
So the effects of alcohol come down to how our minds interact with the situation when our attentional systems have started operating with a kind of tunnel vision .
Free from distraction
This model does n’t explain everything and it would be wrong to say that psychologists agree that it does .
But what the alcohol myopia model does provide is a very intuitive and easily understood way of thinking about how alcohol affects us , for better and worse .
The next time you have a drink , see what you think : does your attention narrow to what ’s right in front of you ?
One of the reasons so many people enjoy its effects when socialising is that it allows us to live in the moment , without distraction , focusing purely on the conversation we ’re having together , freed from our own negative self - evaluations and the intrusive minutiae of everyday life .
While alcohol may well cause disinhibition under certain circumstances , there is more going on than just that .
Attentional tunnel vision provides a useful way of thinking about the many and varied effects of the demon drink .

Imagine you are the goalkeeper .
Your team is leading by two goals to one in an important league encounter .
Suddenly , a player of the opposing team makes a nice cross , you gather the ball , but it slips away from your fingertips and a striker of the opposing side tucks the ball away .
Of course , you are deeply frustrated and you shout " God . "
The referee did n't hear you , but through lip reading techniques , some Italian FA officials figure out through the replay that Juventus ' goalie , Gigi Buffon , said " Dio " — in vain , may I promptly add .
In 21st century Italy this is enough to get a red card and / or a suspension for more than one game .
The rule is quite an upgrade if you look back some centuries ago and see that people were executed because of similar actions .
According to the new " Blasphemy Law , " the Italian FA allows referees to send off any player who says God 's name in vain .
The player could also get suspended by the FA if the referee did not punish him .
In this case , all you need is a replay , which confirms the player was saying " God . "
Buffon promptly explained the misunderstanding by saying that he spoke out the word " Zio " ( Uncle ) and not the word " Dio " ( God ) .
" The idea may be be fair , but let 's see who can prove that the player said Dio , Zio or Dino , " said Buffon .
Well , the lip - reading market is going to reach new heights in Italy , that is for sure .
Of course , punishing blasphemy is still not enough .
According to the Italian FA 's new rules , players who show t- shirts with personal messages to their family or their girlfriend , or which make a reference to their religious beliefs will also be punished .
Which means that those celebrations accompanied by diabolical messages such as " I belong to Jesus , " " Jesus Loves You , " " Happy Birthday Jimmy , " or " Get well soon , Grandpa " are going to be banned from Italian stadiums .
In other news , the Italian FA is also planning on burning players who commit adultery at the stake .
( John Terry , you just got lucky that Capello has n't heard of this method . )
CANNABIS CULTURE –
The state - funded California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research announced that its studies have shown marijuana to have therapeutic value in a report released on February 17 .
The ten - year , $ 8.7 - million medical marijuana research program , established at the University of California in 2000 , reported positive results in six different human clinical trials regarding chronic pain , spasticity and vaporization .
Four of the CMCR studies found cannabis effective in treating painful HIV neuropathy , ( Ellis , 2009 ) , neuropathic pain ( Wilsey , 2008 ) and migraine headaches ( Meng , 2003 ) ; and as a “ modest analgesia ” in capsaicin - induced pain ( Wallace , 2007 ) .
Using notoriously low - grade marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi , researchers were able to test cannabis with different THC contents .
One study showed improved benefits with higher doses ; another showed 4 % and 7 % THC were equally good , and better than placebo .
In a study injecting a substance into the skin that mimics pain , the medium dose worked best , and the higher dose made it worse , suggesting a therapeutic window , CMCR director Igor Grant told KZYX radio in Ukiah .
“ The findings are very consistent , ” remarked Grant , “ There is good evidence now that cannabinoids may be a good adjunct or even first line treatment . ”
Neuralgia is a type of pain caused by damaged nerves that is particularly resistant to other therapies .
Some 10 % of the population are said to be affected by neuralgia .
A fifth CMCR study found marijuana effective in reducing muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients .
Grant suggested larger trials in the future , perhaps supported by the National Institutes of Health , which enrolls a more diverse group of patients , with respect to ages and backgrounds , who might respond differently to cannabis as they do other drugs .
Alternative delivery systems are also a potential area for further research , said Grant , particularly vaporization and oral forms of medication .
A CMCR study has demonstrated the efficacy of smokeless vaporizers as an alternative delivery system to smoked marijuana .
Meanwhile , an excellent review of recent clinical studies conducted worldwide on the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids has been published by Arno Hazekamp and Franjo Grotenhermen in the journal of the International Association for Cannabis Medicines .
( Cannabinoids 2010 ; 5 ( special issue ) : 1-21 . )
Picking up from a 2006 study by Canadian Ben Amar that summarized known cannabinoid studes from 1975 through June 2005 , the authors summarize 37 different controlled studies involving 2563 patients in the period July 1 , 2005 – August 1 , 2009 .
Eight specifically involved smoked marijuana , all of which indicated medical efficacy .
Guzman et al. ’s 2006 study showing inhibited tumor cell formation in brain cancer patients also showed cannabinoids could be safely delivered .
A study of 71 Hep C patients smoking cannabis on their own account found modest use could help them adhere to their challenging medication regimen .
Of 15 studies conducted on neuropathic , chronic , or experimentally - induced pain , cannabis or cannabinoids were most effective on chronic , rather than acute or post - operative pain , with only mild or moderate adverse effects .
Previous animal and human studies showing a synergistic effect between cannabinoids and opiates on pain control were not firmly confirmed in the more recent trials .
The largest patient cohort ( 1300 ) participated in 9 studies on multiple sclerosis and spasticity .
Studies showed that Sativex , a sublingual whole plant extract , is effective in treating symptomatic pain , spasticity , and bladder control in MS patients , and can be used effectively in long - term care .
Pathways by which cannabinoids work on pain were studied , and a 2009 Italian study showed Sativex did not induce psychopathology nor impair cognition in cannabis - naïve patients .
Serum levels of 100 MS patients taking Sativex did not find significant anti-inflammatory effects , which may be useful in treating MS , which is considered an autoimmune condition .
Oral Cannador and dronabinol caused a significant reduction in incontinence in a study of 630 MS patients , and oral Nabilone provided significant reduction of pain but not spasticity in 11 MS patients with chronic upper motion motor neuron syndrome .
Four studies with 110 total patients have been conducted on HIV / AIDS in the last 5 years , all in the U.S. , where dronabinol ( oral THC ) can be prescribed for AIDS wasting syndrome .
In two studies , Haney found both smoked cannabis and oral dronabinol were well tolerated and produced substantial increases in food intake .
Abrams et al found that smoked cannabis reduced daily pain significantly compared with a placebo , and Ellis found it significantly reduced neuropathic pain intensity .
In a British study , sublingual cannabis extract high in THC was shown to decrease intraocular eye pressure in a small number of glaucoma patients ; a CBD - rich extract did not reduce IOP , and in a large dose actually increased it ( Tomida et al , 2006 ) .
Two studies of the effects of dronabinol on the intestinal dysfunction in healthy volunteers were conducted by Esfandyari et al. in the U.S. Both observed that THC significantly slowed gastric emptying , especially in females , and was associated with colon relaxation .
The results could help explain marijuana ’s anti-emetic effect , and lead to better treatment of irritable bowel syndrome .
An incomplete study by Strasser et al. did not find significant effects on appetite and quality of life in cancer patients with either oral THC and Cannador .
Dronabinol , ondansetron ( Zofran ) , and their combination was studied in post - chemotherapy patients by Meiri ( 2007 ) .
Either drug was equally effective , and combining them was n’t beneficial and caused more dizziness and fatigue .
Patients receiving THC had the most improved quality of life .
A preliminary study by Leweke ( 2007 ) compared oral CBD with the standard antipsychotic amisulpride ( Solian ) in schizophrenic patients and showed similar effectiveness and fewer side effects with CBD therapy .
Intravenous THC had transient positive and negative effects on schizophrenic patients in a study by D’Souza et al ( 2007 ) , which found that schizophrenics are also more susceptible to cognitive effects of THC .
The authors add that at least 110 human studies on medical cannabis have been published since 1975 .
Many more have been conducted in animals .
Paul Armentano , deputy director of NORML , has published an updated edition of his booklet , “ Emerging Clinical Applications for Cannabis and Cannabinoids : A Review of the Recent Scientific Literature 2000 - 2009 . ”
Armentano got a standing ovation for his presentation on the subject at the recent NORML conference in San Francisco , and is teaching courses at Oaksterdam University .
He notes that over 1000 studies have been published on cannabinoids in the year 2006 alone , and 2100 in 2008 , versus 1996 when only 258 scientific journals published cannabinoid studies .
The death of Michael Foot was announced shortly after 12 pm today .
I 'll be reporting on the tributes to one of the giants of Labour postwar politics as they come in .
1.04 pm : Michael
Foot is now remembered principally for his short and ill - fated period as Labour leader in the early 1980s , but he was a leading figure in Labour politics throughout the postwar period and one of the outstanding orators of his time .
Today politicians from all parties are paying tribute to him .
1.23 pm : This is from Peter Hain , the Welsh Secretary .
Foot was n't a Welshman , but he was MP for Ebbw Vale , which made him an honorary Welshman .
Michael was perhaps Wales 's most brilliant adopted son .
A good friend , he gave me much personal support over 40 years , from the Anti-Apartheid Movement to our work together on the Tribune newspaper .
He will be sorely missed .
Never again will we see such soaring oratory , socialist passion and wit .
Wales and Welsh Labour are in mourning .
1.27 pm : Gordon Brown has described Foot as " a man of deep principle and passionate idealism " .
1.28 pm : This is from Ken Livingstone on Sky News .
He was the nicest person I ever met at a senior level in politics .
He had time for everybody .
It is amazing that someone that nice gets to the top of the Labour Party but perhaps not too surprising that someone that nice did n't win the election .
1.29 pm : This is from Ray Collins , the Labour 's party 's general secretary .
Michael Foot 's passing is very sad news for the Labour Party and the wider movement .
As leader of our party , a Labour Minister , a writer and a man he was a tireless campaigner for social justice , whose intelligence , charm and courage will be remembered for years to come .
As Michael Foot himself said , government by consent is the most sacred cause of all .
As a young man I was fortunate to see at first hand Michael 's own skill in government , when as Secretary of State for Employment , with Jack Jones of the T&G , he forged the Health and Safety at Work Act which protected millions of working people from injury and illness .
It is a mark of Michael Foot 's quality as a man and th e scale of his contribution to public life over almost seven decades that it is hard to summarise in a single sentence .
He was possibly one of the few writers who could .
As well as pivotal biographies , Labour Party members will remember the clarity and passion of his writing against the appeasement of the 1930s , nuclear weapons , or Apartheid and in support of social justice .
Michael
Foot will be missed by many but most of all by those who knew him best , his family and friends , and my thoughts and condolences are with them today .
1.32 pm : I 've now got the full text of Gordon Brown 's tribute .
It 's long , but I 'll post the whole thing because I can't find it on the web .
( The Labour website has n't got a word about Foot yet . )
It 's also heartfelt , as you can tell .
Like Brown ,
Foot was an intellectual , a historian , a writer , a tribal Labour loyalist - and a football fan .
Michael Foot was a man of deep principle and passionate idealism and one of the most eloquent speakers Britain has ever heard .
He was an indomitable figure who always stood up for his beliefs and whether people agreed with him or not they admired his character and his steadfastness .
The respect he earned over a long life of service means that across our country today people , no matter their political views , will mourn the passing of a great and compassionate man .
All his life , Michael campaigned and fought for the ideals he believed in .
I remember fondly my time with him and Jill Craigie , the love of his life - they both inspired me with their passion and kindness .
They leave behind so many people whose grief overwhelms us today .
While Michael was a brilliant thinker – a first rate journalist and a celebrated biographer – he always knew that for the people and causes he had entered politics to represent , the Commons was not simply a forum for debate but the theatre of change .
As Leader of the Labour Party in the most difficult circumstances he was a respected and unifying figure who sought to steer it through turbulent times .
And his record as a Labour minister and champion of working men and women will always be a tribute to his convictions and a source of pride - leading through Parliament the Health and Safety at Work Act .
He served the communities of Plymouth and Ebbw Vale with distinction .
But Michael was n't just a great parliamentarian - a historian , a journalist and an author , he showed the same skill as one of the youngest editors of a national newspaper in his twenties as he did when writing articles and books well into his nineties .
A founder member of CND , he is often remembered for being a self - proclaimed " inveterate peace - monger " although his determination to break the rise of Fascism in Europe in the 1940s was demonstrated in his hugely influential book , " Guilty Men " .
A lifelong Plymouth Argyle fan who continued attending Home Park well into his 90s , his love of his football club mirrored his love of the Labour Party : sticking by the Pilgrims through thick and thin , no one could ever doubt his loyalty and determination to see them reach the summit of success .
We will never forget his good humour , his passion and above all his enduring values and determination to fight for them - as , one of his favourite poets , Shelley proclaims " Ye are many — they are few " .
Michael Foot was a genuine British radical - one who possessed a powerful sense of community , a pride in our progressive past and faith in our country 's potential for a radical future .
1.40 pm : John Reid , the former cabinet minister who was a Labour official in the 1980s , is on BBC News recalling trying to make a television broadcast with Michael Foot .
He says it took him and Helen Liddell all day because it was hard to get Foot to adjust to the medium .
He was a studious type of man in an age of slick soundbites .
He was a master orator in an age of the television interview .
1.43 pm : Lord Steel has just been on BBC News too .
He was the Liberal leader at the time of the Lib - Lab pact .
Steel said :
He was without question the master , spell - binding orator in the House of Commons in my day .
When his name came up on the ticker - tape , people would come to hear him .
He had this capacity for immense passion laced with humour .
Steel was being generous .
He did not mention the fact that Foot 's humour was sometimes turned against Steel himself .
In one Commons speech ( at the end of the no confidence debate in 1979 , I think ) , Foot famously described Steel as someone " who passed from rising hope to elder statesman without any intervening period " .
1.50 pm : Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , has just been on BBC News .
Rather tackily , I thought , he he tried to make an anti-Cameron point while he was paying tribute to Foot .
A lot of people will mourn his passing today ...
If we have a choice between appearance and substance , I think a lot of people will give us substance every time , because ultimately that is what politics [ is about ] ...
If we can have more focus on the substance , the real choices that we 've got , and less on the appearance - if you like , the choice between an airbrushed politics and a real politics - I think we could do with that .
1.57 pm : Brown is giving an interview outside Downing Street .
He says Foot is mourned as someone who was good and compassionate .
Asked if Foot held the Labour party together , Brown says he was a " great unifier " .
Foot is held in great respect " for the conviction with which he put his views " , Brown says .
Foot was " a good man and a very compassionate man " .
2.01 pm : If anyone has any personal memories of Michael Foot they want to share , please write about them in the comments section below .
2.03 pm : Thanks to DavidSt for posting , in the comments section below , this extract from a speech Foot gave in the Commons in 1980 .
Jack Straw mentioned it in the Commons about 90 minutes ago .
Straw was opening a debate on the Bribery Bill and he started with a tribute to Foot and a reference to this speech .
Straw tried to tell the magician joke , although his version was n't half as good as the orginal .
In my youth , quite a time ago , when I lived in Plymouth , every Saturday night I used to go to the Palace theatre .
My favourite act was a magician - conjuror who used to have sitting at the back of the audience a man dressed as a prominent alderman .
The magician - conjuror used to say that he wanted a beautiful watch from a member of the audience .
He would go up to the alderman and eventually take from him a marvellous gold watch .
He would bring it back to the stage , enfold it in a beautiful red handkerchief , place it on the table in front of us , take out his mallet , hit the watch and smash it to smithereens .
Then on his countenance would come exactly the puzzled look of the Secretary of State for Industry .
He would step to the front of the stage and say " I am very sorry .
I have forgotten the rest of the trick . "
That is the situation of the Government .
They have forgotten the rest of the trick .
It does not work .
Lest any objector should suggest that the act at the Palace theatre was only a trick , I should assure the House that the magician - conjuror used to come along at the end and say " I am sorry .
I have still forgotten the trick . "
The joke works even better if you know that the trade secretary at the time was Keith Joseph .
2.10 pm
I 've been trying to find some footage of Foot on YouTube and I 've found this .
It 's from a speech Foot delivered in 1942 , when he was acting editor of the Evening Standard and the government was threatening to censor the Daily Mirror .
It 's wonderful - richly comic , but passionate and serious at the same time .
2.18 pm : This is from David Blunkett .
In the 47 years that I have been a member of the Labour Party , I have rarely come across anyone as gracious , thoughtful and intellectually sharp as Michael Foot .
It was a privilege to have known him and to have learned from him – not simply as a politician , but as that rare breed : an intellectual and a thinker .
Everybody recognises that he was the greatest parliamentarian of his generation .
In many ways , his time as leader of the Labour Party allowed his opponents to diminish the enormous stature which his life - long contribution to the well - being of his fellow man enabled him to achieve .
2.20 pm : And this is from the TUC general secretary Brendan Barber .
Everyone will be saddened by the death of Michael Foot – a man who personified decency and integrity in politics .
Simply to mention his name is to be taken back to an era when every politician needed to be an orator and command an audience .
But we remember him as well as a great employment secretary at a time when the economy was under real pressure .
2.22 pm : Neil Kinnock has written a tribute to Foot for Comment is Free .
Here 's the opening :
Michael Foot , who has died aged 96 , was a supreme parliamentary democrat who used his great gifts as an inspiring speaker and writer to urge peace , security , prosperity and opportunity for humanity and punishment for bigots and bullies of every kind .
His bravery and generosity were unsurpassed .
He used both to ensure that the Labour party survived as a political force when self - indulgent factionalism could have doomed it to irrelevance .
2.47 pm : Kate Hudson , the chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , has issued this statement .
Michael Foot 's principled position on nuclear disarmament has long been used to explain Labour 's defeat in 1983 , and justify pro-nuclear policies from the Labour Party leadership .
But the 1983 election was not an endorsement of Mrs Thatcher 's nuclear policy .
We deplore the dirty tricks campaign carried out at that time against Michael , designed to undermine his campaign .
Opinion polls show that his views on nuclear disarmament are today shared by the majority of the British electorate across the political spectrum - a fact that our politicians would do well to recognise as they head into a general election .
2.49 pm : Tam Dalyell , the former Labour MP and father of the Commons - and a wonderful obituary writer for the Independent - has issued this tribute , which includes a nice anecdote that I had not heard .
Michael Foot would have been a first - class Prime Minister , because he was a shrewd chooser of people and an imaginative delegator of colleagues .
When I was elected to Parliament in June 1962 , I was told by colleagues ' You will never see Michael Foot again ' .
He had had a dreadful car accident from which they did not expect him ever to recover .
The sheer courage of that man coming back is astonishing .
Ironically , the accident prolonged his life - it stopped him chain - smoking .
2.53 pm : Alastair Campbell , who knew Foot well - Foot was a very old friend of the parents of Fiona Millar , Campbell 's partner - has written a tribute to him on his blog .
The whole thing is worth reading , but here 's a flavour of it .
On the Old - New Labour - ometer , fair to say that Michael might be placed closer to the old than the new .
But he was a phenomenal support .
He took as much pride in the three election wins under Tony Blair as anyone and was delighted to celebrate his 90th birthday in 2003 at a party in Downing Street garden surrounded by family and friends from across the political spectrum .
And whenever we were under the cosh , Michael would always be on with a word of support , advice or encouragement .
The last time he came to our house for lunch , he was barely able to walk .
Yet he sat and gave his views on all the big issues of the day , illustrated by colourful tales of the past .
' Was there really as much division in the Wilson Cabinets as the books suggest ? '
I asked him .
' Oh far more , ' he said .
2.57 pm : John Prescott has paid tribute on Twitter .
So sad to hear about Michael Foot .
A great man has died .
He was the heart of our movement
2.59 pm : Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , has said this :
Michael Foot was a great parliamentarian , a great intellectual and a great idealist .
He always stood up for what he believed in , even if that meant inviting unpopularity at times .
His intellectual integrity is an example to everyone in politics .
3.01 pm : Here are some of the things people have said in the comments section .
This is from sarflondon ( or Ed Davie , judging by the way he 's signed off ) :
I trained as a reporter at the South Wales Argus with a patch that included Foot 's former constituency in Ebbw Vale .
As a result I interviewed him at his house in Hampstead where he was fascinating , charming , wise and generous .
He gave me a copy of his book on Nye Bevan which he painstakingly ( given his poor eyesight ) inscribed with a quote from Hazlitt .
He also invited me to his 90th birthday party at the Gay Hussar - where else ?
- which had the most eclectic collection of guests I 'd ever seen .
He told me then that he would n't die until his beloved Plymouth Argyle made it to the Premiership - sadly he did not see that day .
Foot has been a great inspiration to me journalistically and politically and despite his great age will be missed - Ed Davie
This is from elsbaer :
I used to see Michael Foot regularly at Home Park .
He was old and frail , with a zimmer frame and someone to help him along , but he had a kind word for everyone .
I 'm too young to remember him as a politician , but he was absolutely mad about the Argyle .
The whole city of Plymouth will be in mourning today .
This is from PatriciaGrumbling :
I remember , years and years ago , while fishing on Hampstead Heath , he would always say Good Morning as he walked by and inquire as to how the fishing was going .
3.09 pm : This is from Lord Mandelson :
There will be a huge sadness across our party and across politics at this news .
I first met Michael in the early 1980s when I worked for Albert Booth , who also sadly passed away recently .
No-one was closer to Michael than Albert on the Labour frontbench and it is was there that I first discovered the stresses and strains that fall on anyone leading Labour , especially at that time in the 1980s .
Michael was one of Labour 's favourite sons and his name will be forever synonymous with the cause of social justice .
An historian , writer , orator and parliamentarian of the first rank , Michael was one of the giants on whose shoulders today 's generation of Labour politicians stand .
3.12 pm : Daniel Hannan , the Tory MEP - and the Labour party 's villain - of - choice for much of 2009 - has written a lovely tribute to Foot on his blog .
Seriously .
It 's terrific - one of the best pieces I 've read about Foot all afternoon .
Foot , of course , was a Eurosceptic .
But he was also a bookish , romantic , intellectual , English parliamentarian .
Hannan probably feels they had a lot in common .
I was lucky enough , as an undergraduate , to listen to one of Michael Foot 's last great orations , when he spoke to a spell - bound Oxford Union about the iniquities of the EU .
True heir to the English radical tradition , he had little time for " - isms " of any sort , and was one of the few Lefties of his generation never to have flirted with either Mussolini or Stalin .
Although he was wrong about many things – his economic policy would have ruined us every bit as comprehensively as Gordon Brown 's wastrel clottishness – he got the big issues right , eschewing fascism , Communism and Euro - integrationism as intrinsically un-English doctrines .
At around that time , he was accused , outrageously , of having collaborated with the KGB .
I remember , even as a student , becoming angry on his behalf : was there ever a politician less likely to betray his country ?
Men of power have not time to read ; yet the men who do not read are unfit for power , " said the great man , and it was truer than he knew .
Foot 's introduction to the Penguin edition of Gulliver 's Travels is , for me , one of the finest essays ever written about Swift , and will be remembered long after Foot 's political career is forgotten .
Yet he was ill - suited to the politician 's trade .
Cerebral , incorruptible and curiously innocent , he represented a noble and exalted tradition on the British Left .
How small his successors appear by comparison .
3.34 pm : David Miliband has posted a couple of tributes to Foot on Twitter .
First he sent this :
Michael Foot led a remarkable life .
I remember meeting him on the Tube in the 80s ; for a famous speaker he really listened .
And then he followed it with this :
Ironic to hear news of Michael Foot 's death while welcoming south african president .
He hated apartheid with a vengeance .
( Actually , being pedantic , ironic 's not quite the right word , is it ?
But we know what he meant . )
3.41 pm : Alastair Campbell is on Sky now .
[ Foot ] was able to have an argument without ever making it personal .
Campbell says
Foot would have liked to have been remembered as a writer , as someone who was passionate about politics and as someone who believed in big causes .
3.44 pm : Foot was a humanist , and the British Humanist Association has just issued this tribute .
We remember Michael and celebrate his life not just as the life of an intelligent and principled politician but as a great British Humanist .
A good life for all is a humanist aspiration , and Michael was one humanist who worked hard to make that a reality for every man and woman .
His steadfast dedication to humanist and progressive ideals of freedom , peace , social justice was pursued in a life of both thought and action – another humanist ideal .
3.46 pm : Peter Tatchell , who fought and lost a byelection for Labour in Bermondsey in 1983 after being selected against Foot 's wishes , has issued this statement .
Michael Foot was wrong to condemn my advocacy of extra-parliamentary protests and to initially block my endorsement as parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey .
But this error of judgment , under pressure from SDP turncoats , does not diminish his stature as one of the most outstanding British socialists and democrats of the twentieth century .
He had the grace to later apologise to me - an apology that I accepted .
I have never waivered in my view that Michael Foot was a great humanist and humanitarian , and a true champion of social justice and human rights .
Sadly , Michael became Labour leader too late in life .
He was at his peak in the 1940s and 1950s , and would have been an even better Labour Prime Minister than Clement Attlee .
A brilliant orator , who was equalled by few other politicians anywhere in the world , his speeches were magical and inspirational .
3.51 pm : As John Rentoul has recalled on his blog , one of Foot 's achievements was to help Tony Blair get into parliament .
Foot wrote a complimentary letter about Blair after Blair stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Beaconsfield which helped him to get selected in Sedgefield .
3.56 pm : George Galloway has paid a Twitter tribute too .
Farewell Michael Foot : Great orator , editor and thinker - the most decent leader Labour ever had #fb
3.58 pm : Alex Salmond , Scotland 's first minister , has issued this statement :
Michael Foot was a man of enormous principle , with a political career founded on a passion and commitment to the party and causes he loved .
He was a remarkable and dedicated man , held in the highest regard across the political spectrum over a period of many decades .
Michael Foot was in the House of Commons after my election , in the 1987 - 92 Parliament , and was a wonderful speaker to listen to - a fantastic old - style debater .
My thoughts are with his many friends , colleagues and family .
Michael
Foot will be greatly missed , and his memory treasured by his party and the country .
4.01 pm : There are a couple of other blogs reporting the tributes to Foot .
Here they are :
BBC website
LabourList
4.10 pm : Lady
Thatcher 's office has just issued this tribute to Foot from the former prime minister :
I was very sorry to hear the news .
He was a great parliamentarian and a man of his priniciples .
4.31 pm : This is from Tony Lloyd , the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party :
Michael
Foot passing away signals the end of a great life and an era in politics but his memory will live on in the work of those inspired by him and in those who will read his writings .
Michael was at the heart of the Labour Party and was inspired by the values of democratic socialism ; in turn , he inspired those around him to work to promote those ideals .
He will be missed by his many friends and admirers from all walks of life .
4.35 pm : Here are some more memories of Foot from the comments section below .
This is from Zoonie :
The last time we both saw Michael Foot was at Joan Lestor 's funeral .
Joan was another great champion of fairness .
Another anti-fascist campaigner who stood shoulder to shoulder with her great friend Barbara Castle but has somehow not been recognised in history so much .
This was in 1998 and Michael was already physically frail .
He stood , carefully but well and after a fairly blank political waffle of a speech by John Prescott , Michael Foot delivered a strong eulogy to his friend in halting tones , as his condition allowed .
But nobody cared .
We would have stayed all afternoon to listen .
Everyone in the room loved him , you see .
With his death , those great political warrior names from the 20th century sink further from view .
They were energised by the fight against acute poverty and fascism , and they just do n't make them like that anymore .
This is from smackhead :
used to see him walking his dog on Hampstead Heath , he used to get the 24 bus down to Westminster and use his OAP pass
This is from Pyrrhic :
My late uncle , a senior civil servant , very , very rarely spoke about politicians or politics .
The only time I ever heard him comment on a politician was to do with Michael and you could tell that he was genuinely in awe of the man and greatly respected his intellect .
A sad loss to Britain and a shame that we will probably never see another man of his integrity as a leader of a major politic party in this country .
4.49 pm : I 've just been looking at the comments on Mike White 's story about Foot 's death .
There 's a lovely story there from David Warnes .
My favourite memory of Michael is a recollection of him chasing down the road , at high speed for a man of his age , because we had been arguing over the correct spelling of the word ' fricassee ' .
The main bone of contention was the appropriate number of esses .
We could agree on the final double 'e ' .
Demanding to know what was right , rather than necessarily prove himself right ( of course he was right as it turned out ) .
We hurtled ( again , relatively ) towards the nearest bookshop in search of a dictionary , debating the pourquois and wherefores of french orthography , completely oblivious to the genteel crowds through which we made our way .
A unflinchingly charming , erudite and decent man .
4.53 pm : David Cameron has now issued a full tribute .
My first thoughts are for those he leaves behind , the friends and the family .
He was a remarkable man and in many ways , almost the last link to a more heroic age in politics .
You think of him in the 1930 's fighting fascism and Hitler alongside Winston Churchill and the great giants of that age .
I also very much admired his great defence of our parliamentary democracy and the House of Commons which he absolutely loved , obviously we come from very different political persuasions but also his idealism , there was never any doubt that he was in politics because he loved his country , he believed in public service , he wanted to make it a better place .
I think he 'll be remembered as a great speaker , a fantastic orator , a beautiful writer .
A very passionate man who was part of this more heroic age of politics where we were fighting fascism and the rise of fascism in Europe and he was on the right side of that argument and wrote such a brilliant book .
Obviously he knew both victory and defeat and obviously people will remember the defeat as Labour leader , but above all he was an idealist , someone who was in politics for the right reasons and someone who wrote and spoke beautifully .
5.04 pm : Plymouth Argyle have paid tribute to Foot .
Argyle chairman Sir Roy Gardner said this :
It is with great sadness that the club learnt of the death of Michael Foot .
Michael was a highly valued director of the club , helping to pave the way for the success that Argyle has enjoyed since 2001 .
Much more than that , he was a much - loved member of the Green Army , who stood on the terraces in the days of legends like Sammy Black and Jack Leslie , and was passionate about spreading the Green gospel .
5.06 pm : Tony Blair still has n't issued a tribute .
His office says he 's on a plane .
He 'll issue something when he lands , in the next hour or so .
5.12 pm : It 's time to call it a day .
There will be more in the Guardian tomorrow , but after an afternoon reading tributes to Foot I find myself just wishing that YouTube had been around in the 1950s and 1960s .
It would be great to be able to hear more of his oratory .
But radio broadcasts from the House of Commons did not start until the late 1970s and so many of his best speeches are not available in audio form at all .
What a terrible loss .
Thanks for the comments .
8 pm Update : I 've now seen the tribute from Tony Blair .

At least five people were killed and 12 injured in a massive gas explosion that tore apart an unfinished US power plant and rattled windows miles ( kilometers ) away .
However officials cautioned that they did not know how many people were in the Kleen Energy plant , which was still being constructed , and therefore they could not immediately account for everyone who may have been present .

“ We know that 12 individuals have been injured .
Five individuals are known to have lost their lives , ” Sebastian Giuliano , the mayor of Middletown in Connecticut , told a news conference .
Terrorism had been ruled out , according to the mayor , who said the accident happened during a testing procedure .
Rescue workers helped by search dogs scoured the rubble at the plant where a brief , but fierce fire following the accident sent flames and black smoke billowing skyward .
“ There was like a fireball going up and a lot of smoke .
The explosion was strong enough to break one of our windows .
Our neighbors had also their windows destroyed , ” said Scott Harmann , 44 , whose father lives in a house just across the Connecticut River from the plant .
Nearby resident Mike Woronoff said he heard “ a loud boom ” at his house some two miles ( 3.2 kilometers ) from the plant .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I have friends that live 15 miles from here that called me because they could hear it .
Then we could see the smoke .
It went on for a mile and a half , then stopped , ” he said .
Amid confusion over the number of casualties local officials immediately warned of the potential for carnage .
“ There was a massive explosion , there are multiple injuries and possible fatalities , ” Middletown police spokesman George Yepes told AFP soon after the blast .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The reports vary from a few to possibly as many as 50 dead , ” Brian Albert from the Middlesex hospital , which was treating several of those injured , said in the immediate aftermath .
Uncertainty as to the final toll seemed set to continue until contractors working on the site were able to compile an accurate roster of those present .

A Middletown fire official said it was “ initially thought there was approximately 50 employees ” there at the time and that “ it ’s unknown how many people are missing . ”
Giuliano said “ there could be anywhere from 100 to 200 people working on the site on any given day .
Exactly what ’s that number , that ’s the starting point and that ’s the number they can’t nail down today .
“ Fortunately what I was told is that most of the people working there were evacuated from the building when they ran the test , ” he said .

A local resident told the Hartford Courant newspaper that the explosion took place during a test of the plant ’s power generating systems .
The 620 - megawatt Kleen Energy plant , said to be one of the largest power facilities to be planned in New England for many years , was still under construction .
The future gas - fired energy production plant is located on the outskirts of Middletown , close to residential housing .
A company called Energy Investors Funds recently acquired 80 percent of the plant , which had been due to go online sometime in 2010 .

The American Red Cross said it had set up a phone number — ( 860 ) 347-2577 — for “ anyone concerned for the well - being of a relative or a friend that was working at the Kleen Energy plant . ”
CARACAS , Venezuela —
Standing at the corner of one of Venezuela ’s most historic squares , the Francia building always looked a little incongruous among the Spanish colonial mansions .
But for many , this late art deco construction holds fond memories — it housed Caracas ’ largest gold market for more than half a century .
Many came to buy engagement or wedding rings for their sweethearts , confirmation bracelets for their children or watches or trinkets for themselves .
That was until last week when the edifice caught the eye of President Hugo Chavez as he presented his weekly television show , “ Hello President , ” from Plaza Bolivar , Caracas ’ most famous square .
“ And this building ? ” he asked the local mayor , pointing at La Francia .
“ It ’s a building that has private jewelry businesses , ” the mayor replied .
“ Expropriate it , ” ordered the president .
Turning to another corner of the square he explained that someone had told him Simon Bolivar , Venezuela ’s liberator , had lived there when recently married .
“ That little house you can see there with two balconies and where there are some businesses — expropriate it ! ”
“ We need to convert this into a great historical center , ” Chavez said .
“ It already is but we need to recover the historical and architectural project in this , the historic heart of Caracas . ”
Within two days of the broadcast of his program , the president ’s demands had been met and traders had evacuated almost the entire building afraid that their goods would be seized .
There had been 91 gold and silver shops over nine floors .
Standing among empty glass counters and chain smoking cigarettes , Gad Abayor — who had owned a small shop selling gold and silver jewelry since 1979 — said he felt the market was as much a part of Caracas ’ historical heritage as the building itself .

( Charlie Devereux / GlobalPost )
“ Everyone knew this building , ” Abayor said .
“ Entire boats of tourists came here .
All sorts came here because they knew we sell a gram of gold or silver at much lower prices than other shops . ”
Abayor , who employed three women who had worked for him for more than 14 years , said he did not know where he would relocate his shop .
But others applaud the government ’s actions .
At the opposite corner of the square , outside the house where Simon Bolivar is said to have lived , retired policeman Edgar Luis Urdaneta related his passion for 19th - century history .
“ That ’s what laws are for , ” he said , clutching a book of the Complete Works of Bolivar .
“ Bolivar said , ' If the law authorizes it , nothing is impossible . ’ ”
The government has yet to announce what it plans to do with La Francia , although several projects have been proposed .
Jari Nunez , an architect at the city government 's conservation office , said two projects would be presented to the president within the next week .
Those include converting the ground floor into a cafe and the remaining levels into spaces for artisanal jewelry makers .
They hope to begin restoring the building within weeks .
Conservation is not just about giving a building a new lick of paint , said Nunez .
“ If you go inside La Francia there ’s nothing left of what was there originally , ” she said .
“ They ’ve taken down adjoining walls , they ’ve removed windows and added air conditioning units .
They ’ve gutted it inside and what ’s left is basically the facade . ”
Bolivar ’s former home would be converted into a museum , she said .
Nunez said La Francia ’s market dealt in stolen gold , an accusation strongly refuted by workers of the building , who claim that gold hawkers on the corner outside the building have nothing to do with the market .
In recent years there has been a push to preserve Venezuela ’s historic buildings but also considerable controversy about how that conservation should be executed .
In the 1950s , when the oil - producing country was undergoing a boom , many of Caracas ’ colonial buildings were demolished to make way for new constructions , a fraction of which are now architectural classics in their own right .
“ Caracas is one of the cities in Latin America that has the least vestiges of colonial times , ” said Hannia Gomez , director of the Foundation for Urban Memory , a local NGO dedicated to architectural conservation .
“ There were many demolitions here and not much is left . ”
Chavez , an enthusiastic amateur historian who often quotes Venezuelan historical heroes such as Francisco de Miranda and Simon Bolivar , appears bent on restoring Caracas , a city better known for crumbling concrete monstrosities , to its former glories .
Last year the Institute of Cultural Patrimony published a list of 1,216 buildings in the city center that must be conserved for their “ exceptional historic and artistic value . ”
Those include private homes and even one of Venezuela ’s first gas stations .
Nunez said the expropriation of buildings such as La Francia formed part of a plan to restore 25 blocks in the old center .
“ The important thing is to rescue our memory , ” she said .
“ Cities and their buildings educate and by eliminating a historic building you are erasing a collective memory . ”
However , some fear losing their homes and businesses to the government ’s grand scheme .
Gomez points out that La Francia was already a protected building and questions the need to expel businesses that had become a part of the area ’s history .
“ People see the heritage laws as a way of undermining private property , ” she said .
“ It ’s very difficult to launch a patrimony campaign in these circumstances when you have a president on television shouting ‘ expropriate it ! ’ ”
The government hopes the restoration of the city center will rejuvenate the area , lowering crime in an area that empties completely at night because of a lack of security .
But , for the about 500 workers of La Francia , a piece of history has been lost and they see no way of negotiating a compromise with the government .
“ How do you find a solution to something that happened in seconds ? ” said Freddy Chacon , a store owner who first worked in the building as a messenger boy in the 1960s .
“ You ’re relaxing at home and someone calls and says ‘ look at the television — they expropriated your business . ’ ”
A running question is why should we put up with , or pay any attention to , those who will not reveal their identity ?
Some argue making people honest about who they are will improve the " quality " and tone of online debates in arenas such as Comment is free .
Trolling , flaming and a host of other bad online behaviour have led to calls , most often from outside or above comment threads , to prevent people posting under pseudonyms .
Leo Hickman recently complained that " it is impossible to trust the motives of this army of DIY auditors . "
Yet while we know the challenges anonymity presents us , we must also consider the effect of forcing people to identify themselves .
I would argue any benefits are outweighed by what we would lose .
Anonymity online sets us free .
The facility to create our own content and comment on websites would be far less valuable to us were it restricted to posting under " real " names .
Journalists smile proudly from profile pictures having earned positions from which they feel confident to commit thoughts of varying controversy to print and web .
Yet not everyone can write so freely – although their words are no less valuable .
Michel Foucault once wrote : " If the prisoner is never sure when he is being observed , he becomes his own guardian . "
His dystopic vision of a panopticon filled with " docile bodies " relied on the omnipresent threat of surveillance and the conformance it provokes .
His thinking built upon Jeremy Bentham 's architectural vision of a watchtower from which inmates of every prison cell were never sure when they were being observed .
In our online panopticon where forum posts , Guardian comments and political blogs can all be found by employers via a simple Google search , what might be the result of forcing people to specify their offline identity ?
Would commenters – good , bad or rabid – take the time to stop by and debate an environment story , the Chilcot inquiry , or women 's place in the workplace if they thought their opinion was instantly traceable ?
Would they self - censor , keen to keep their online reputation free of political opinion .
Would they just participate less ?
The Anonymous Liberal explains on his blog : " Who am I ?
For what it 's worth , I 'm a litigator at a large national law firm ( at least until I figure out how to make a living doing this ) .
Until then , I 'll just have to go by AL . "
Some might consider the loss of a few nervy corporate stooges worth it to dampen the deafening noise in the loudest threads .
Yet we must remember those most keen on manipulating the debate are best at sophisticated fabrications – and most likely to have the greatest resources at their disposal .
If we tied every person 's real name to their online commentary , those who benefit most from steering conversations would simply construct false identities in order to spout their sponsored verbiage .
While those toiling away as public servants , headmasters , advertising executives , postal workers , or even just married to those in the public eye would be loathe to contribute when it could jeopardise careers , relationships or friendships .
And our debates , and their potential to inform and inspire readers and participants , would be less for it .
Anonymity has a glorious history .
Works by Voltaire , Benjamin Franklin , Zoe Margolis and other great thinkers were all published under assumed names .
The first amendment to the US constitution recognises its importance and grants substantial protection to anonymous speech .
Illegal contributions can be , and always have been , dealt with by the law or by moderators trained in dealing with illegal content .
And as for the rest of it – deep inside comment threads people deal with anonymity and trust in their own way .
Most who indulge in participatory media are well aware of the potential existence within conversations of people paid to contribute in a duplicitous way .
Commenters often speculate about or deliberately ignore suspected lobbyists intent on posting commercial messages or vexatious , repetitive tirades .
Yes , debates are often heated .
But although it may seem combatants are all talking past each other , in reality they are often learning from one another .
And then there are those edifying moments when a pair at loggerheads find common ground and move forward , not in total agreement , but with a shared understanding nonetheless .
Last month Ethan Zuckerman of Global Voices said : " Online anonymity is under threat and is unlikely to remain substantially the same in the next decade … there 's a concerted effort to eliminate anonymity to address concerns about criminal behaviour , fraud , spam and terrorism .
Because there 's not an organised anonymity lobby , I fear this is a battle the anonymous will lose . "
We must not lose .
Online anonymity gives us so much more than we would gain from stripping it away .
It gives us the freedom to know what people really think , for better or for worse .
It is the essence of democracy for us to be able to conduct the difficult debates out in the open , where they can be challenged .
Rather than trying to chain people to their names , we should be seeking to protect the current capacity we have to deliberate without fear of reprisal , and putting our efforts towards superior architecture for displaying , moderating and encouraging constructive behaviour in large - scale online discussions .
I may not like what some of our mysterious online acquaintances have to say , but I defend their right to say it under whichever name they please .
Back Home , with Debian !
By the end of 2004 , I 'd been running Debian ‘ testing ’ on my laptop since around early 2003 .
For almost two years , I 'd lived with periodic instability — including a week in the spring of 2003 when I could n't even get X11 started — for the sake of using a distribution that maximally respected software freedom .
I 'd had no trouble with ‘ potato ’ for its two year lifespan , but after 6 - 8 months of woody , I was backporting far too much and I could n't spare the time for upkeep .
Running ‘ testing ’ was the next best option , as I could pin myself for 3 - 6 months at a time on a particularly stable day and have a de-facto “ release ” .
But , I slowly was unable to spare the time for even that work , and I was ready to throw up my hands in surrender .
At just about that time , a thing called ‘ warty ’ was released .
I 'd already heard about this company , Canonical , as they 'd tried earlier that year to buy a domain name I technically own ( canonical.org ) , but had long since given over to a group of old friends .
( They of course had no interest in selling such a “ hot property ” ) .
This new distribution , Ubuntu , was Debian - based , and when installed , it “ felt ” like Debian .
Canonical was committed to a six - month release schedule , so I said to myself : well , if I have to ‘ go corporate ’ again , I might as well go to something that works like the distribution I prefer .
And so , my five year stint as an Ubuntu user began .
Of course , I had n't always been a Debian user .
I started in 1992 with SLS and quickly moved to Slackware .
When the pain of that got too great , I went “ corporate ” for a while back then , too .
I used Red Hat Linux from early 1996 until 1998 .
I ultimately gave up Red Hat because the distribution eventually became focused around the advancement of the company .
They were happy to include lots of proprietary software — indeed , in the later 1990s , Red Hat CDs typically came with as many as two extra CDs filled with proprietary software .
Red Hat ( the company ) had earlier made some efforts to appease us harder - core software - freedom folks .
But , by the late 1990s , their briefly - lived RMS ( aka Red Hat Means Source ) distribution had withered completely .
By then , I truly regretted my 1996 decision to go corporate , and fell in love quickly with Debian and its community - led , software - freedom - driven community .
I remained a Debian user from 1998 until 2004 .
But , by the end of 2004 , the pain of waiting for ‘ sarge ’ was great .
So , for technical reasons only , “ going corporate ” again seemed like a reasonable trade - off .
Ubuntu initially looked basically like Debian : ‘ main ’ and ‘ universe ’ were FaiF , ‘ restricted ’ was like ‘ non - free ’ .
Sadly , though , a for - profit , corporate - controlled distribution can never remain community - oriented .
A for - profit company is eventually always going to put the acquisition of wealth above any community principle .
So it has become with Ubuntu , in my view .
The time has come ( for me , at least ) to go back to a truly community - oriented , software - freedom - respecting distribution .
( Hopefully , I 'll also never be tempted to leave again . )
I did n't take this decision lightly , and did n't take it for only one reason .
I 've gone back to Debian for three ( now ) seven specific reasons :
( Updated on 2010 - 02 - 17 : As can be seen above , my mere list of three reasons posted just one month ago has now more than doubled !
It 's as if Canonical made a 2010 plan to “ do less software freedom ” , and is executing it with amazing corporate efficiency .
As Queen Gertrude says in Hamlet , One woe doth tread upon another 's heel , so fast they follow . )
When considering all this and taking a step back and look at the status of major distributions , my honest assessment is this : among the two primary corporate - controlled - but - dabbling - in - community - orientation distributions ( aka Fedora and Ubuntu ) , Fedora is clearly much more software - freedom - friendly .
Nevertheless , since I 've twice gone corporate and ultimately regretted it , I decided it was time to go back home — back to Debian .
So , during the last week of 2009 , I took nearly two full days off to reinstall and configure my laptop from scratch with lenny .
I 've thus been back on Debian since 2010 - 01 - 01 .
Twelve days in , I am very impressed .
Really , all the things I liked about Ubuntu are now available upstream as well .
This is n't the distribution I left in 2004 ; it 's much better , all while being truly community - oriented and software - freedom - respecting .
It 's good to be home .
Thank you , Debian developers .
For more information on the danger that proprietary network services pose to software freedom , please see the Franklin Street Statement .
Ruling the roost :
Hen that thinks it 's a dog adopts litter of puppies
You'd be forgiven for thinking that chickens and dogs were not natural bed fellows .
But a one - year - old hen that thinks it 's a dog has adopted a litter of puppies much to the bemusement of their canine mother .
Mabel has taken to keeping the small dogs warm by snuggling up to them while their mother , Nettle , sits out in the yard at a farm in Shrewsbury .
Mabel the hen adopted the litter of puppies and jumped into the dog basket to keep them warm
The chicken , who was saved from the pot by Mr Tate , has taken to roosting on a litter of puppies
Owners Edward and Ros Tate saved Mabel from the pot and now the hen has taken to roosting on the litter of puppies .
Mr Tate said : ' Mabel was hatched here about a year ago .
She would have gone onto someone 's dinner plate but we saved her .
' Unfortunately , she got into an accident with a horse , which accidentally trod on her foot .
' Because of that , she gets terribly cold during the winter so we decided to bring her into the house .
' We have a dog , Nettle , which has just given birth to a litter of pups .
Within a few days of giving birth , Nettle was up and about , prowling in the yard .

' Mabel observed Nettle 's behaviour and , as soon as there was a chance , she hoped into the dog basket to roost on the pups .

10 ( Trap and Rocket Spear ) Ammunition Spear Upgrades Zoom Increase ,
Damage Increase ,
Faster Mechanics Used by Subject Delta
Subject Sigma
The Spear Gun is the seventh weapon in BioShock 2 , replacing the Crossbow in function .
Compensating for Subject Delta 's inability to use a traditional scope , a set of refractive glass ' plates ' gives the Spear Gun the ability to zoom in over large distances .
It fires spears which can impale enemies as well as nail them to walls and objects in the environment .
It is first found in Siren Alley .
Contents show ]
Basic Upgrades Edit
Zoom Increase
Additional scope provides increased zoom , allowing you to aim with pinpoint accuracy .
This upgrade increases the Spear Gun ’s scope ability , granting the player improved accuracy over long distances .
Damage Increase
A rotary mechanism adds spin to the spear , resulting in greater penetration and damage .
This upgrade increases the Spear Gun 's damage output .
Final Upgrade Edit
Faster Mechanics
A reinforced firing spring and retooled barrel allow for much faster spear travel and decreased refiring time .
Spears will reach their targets much faster and pin enemies over longer distances .
This upgrade increases Spear velocity and decreases the time it takes to load between shots .
Spear - Standard ammunition for the Spear Gun .
Deal a high amount of piercing damage .
These can be recovered after use , in a way similar to the Crossbow 's Bolt , though without the risk of the spears breaking the way a Crossbow Bolt might have .

Strategy Edit
Spears are among the most powerful single - shot forms of ammunition in the game , and a single headshot will kill any normal Splicer on any difficulty .
The Spear Gun is arguably the best anti-Alpha - Series weapon .
If one has purchased the Damage Increase upgrade , any Alpha Series ( except the first one and Subject Omega , which both have significantly more health ) will fall in two headshots ( one , with the headhunter tonic ) , regardless of Research bonuses and difficulties .
As Spears can be recovered after use , this is also one of the most cost - effective ways of taking out an Alpha Series .

Spears can be shot while not zoomed in .
Shooting too many Spears into the scenery will cause a few of them to disappear .
Spears take time to travel through the air , so it 's recommended to aim ahead of the target rather than directly at them .
Spears also tend to dip over long distances , so it is advised to aim above the target 's head if one wishes to score a headshot .

Spears also tend to dip over long distances , so it is advised to aim above the target 's head if one wishes to score a headshot .
Rocket Spears are even slower than Spears , but do n't dip .
As such , it 's not as necessary to zoom in when using this ammo type .
Rocket Spears can do even more damage if Electro Bolt is used before it explodes .
Very good for Big Daddies , as it leaves them with a chunk of health missing and on fire .
The recommended timing for Electro Bolt is one second after the Spear hits .
Rocket Spears are best used against groups , where they will cause the most damage .
A single Rocket Spear fired into a group will set them on fire and eventually explode , killing every non-boss enemy in its vicinity .
Rocket Spears are also one of the most powerful ammo type in the game .
Firing a single Rocket Spear at a Brute Splicer , Big Daddy , Alpha Series or Big Sister will tear out a huge chunk of their health .
On the downside , each Rocket Spear can only be used once .

Rocket Spears will set everything around them on fire , including environmental hazards and nearby enemies .
Aligning several Splicers around the Spear 's travel path will allow the player to ignite them all .
Firing a Rocket Spear at a corpse , ice block or object will cause the Spear to spiral across the area at random , setting everything around it on fire before exploding .
Trap Spears will always deploy in a horizontal line when fired .
This makes their deployment pattern easy to predict .
Trap Spears are a very versatile form of ammunition , and have several uses , as follows :
They can be used as defensive traps .
While an apparently obvious fact , there are many ways to set a trap .
One can simply deploy a Trap Spear in a passage or , if the player is feeling more strategic , they may deploy a Trap Spear in the way of a hotspot , e.g. an unhacked Health Station or a body of water if the player is setting Splicers on fire .
( Hacked Health Stations already poison enemies who try to heal there , so placing a Trap Spear there would be redundant . )
They can be shot directly to enemies , doing less base damage than a normal Spear , in addition to a certain amount of electrical damage .
The total amount of damage done is higher than that of normal Spears .
Considering Trap Spears cannot be recovered , this strategy is a waste in the campaign .
However , it is also very effective in The Protector Trials DLC , as some trials only provide Trap Spears , along with other trap - type ammunition .
A costly but effective strategy involves laying several Trap Spears in a passage , and provoking a Bouncer into charging through .
Usually six or seven Trap Spears are necessary to kill a Bouncer instantly .
Trap Spears , even friendly , will damage the player upon contact , unless the player prepares against this occasion ( see recommended tonics , below ) .
Why Specialize ?
Edit
Unlike the original game , it is impossible to fully upgrade every weapon through the course of the campaign .
Each upgrade choice will affect the player 's experience , and may or may not be suited to their combat style .
The following is a brief guide to the strategic advantages and disadvantages associated with this weapon :
Advantages Edit
The Spear Gun is capable of killing any non-boss enemy in a single headshot on any level in the game and on any difficulty .
Spears are recoverable .
The Faster Mechanics upgrade eliminates two of the Spear Gun 's most frustrating weaknesses : the Spears ' travel time and the weapon 's low rate of fire ; effectively turning the weapon into a sniper rifle of sorts .
Two of the weapon 's ammo types can be directly boosted through Gene Tonics .
The Zoom Increase upgrade can be used to scout faraway areas for enemies and traps .
Mastery of this weapon allows the player to clear a wide area without getting attacked .
Disadvantages Edit
Most of the game 's areas are n't well suited for long - range sniping .
Mid-range combat with this weapon is inefficient and overly difficult compared to most other weapons .
Shooting an enemy 's head in the middle of combat is hard to accomplish , usually requiring the use of Plasmids .
Trap Spears are one of the rare ammo types capable of harming the player ( although this can be avoided with the Electric Flesh gene tonic ) .
Sniping efficiently with this weapon requires the player to zoom in , preventing the use of Plasmids and leaving one open to surprise attacks .
Big Daddies ( save for the Alpha Series ) are immune to headshots , nullifying this weapon 's primary use .
Summary Edit
The Spear Gun is the perfect sniping weapon , and its secondary ammo types are both powerful and versatile .
If one possesses enough twitch - aim capabilities , one may even use it in direct combat to deadly effect .
However , this weapon is also difficult to handle both inside and outside of combat , and in the hands of a less experienced player may even lead to more harm than good .
While a veteran sniper will be able to pin the entire contents of a room to the wall without ever getting attacked , most others will end up wasting ammunition , EVE and First Aid Kits in an attempt to score a headshot .
As such , it is only recommended to specialize in the Spear Gun if one knows how to handle a long - range weapon well .
Telekinesis can be used in many ways with this weapon : one can use it to pull a Spear out of an enemy or the scenery and fire it again ad infinitum , at a small cost in EVE and virtually no reload time .
Alternatively , it can be used to reposition Trap Spears , both friendly and unfriendly .
, at a small cost in EVE and virtually no reload time .
Alternatively , it can be used to reposition Trap Spears , both friendly and unfriendly .
Electro
Bolt can be used to lock the enemy in place , allowing for an easier headshot .
Winter Blast achieves the same effect , although killing an enemy frozen with Winter Blast 1 will shatter them , leaving no loot .
Decoy will attract all nearby enemies towards it , rendering them all vulnerable to a well - placed Rocket Spear .
Placing a single Trap Spear above a Cyclone Trap , regardless of whether the latter has been charged with another Plasmid , will kill any normal Splicer on any difficulty and on any level .
Natural Camouflage will allow the player to snipe without risking getting attacked by a nearby enemy ( unless said enemy bumps into the player ) .
Walking Inferno will increase the damage dealt by Rocket Spears .
Electric
Flesh , in addition to granting the player complete invulnerability to electricity , will also increase the damage dealt by Trap Spears .
Damage Research increases the effects of damage bonuses earned through research .

Behind the Scenes Edit
It is India ’s doomsday vault .
If the land lies cracked and barren waiting for the rain , if the sea swallows coastal paddy fields , if plagues of pests wipe crops out of existence , India has an insurance policy – a set of seeds carefully preserved in permafrost , ready to be restored , that can be cultivated and sown to feed its people .
Nestled 17,500 feet high on a cliff top in the Himalayas , Chang - La has the sub zero temperatures and low humidity necessary to suspend seed life for future generations .
It is a site carefully chosen .
It is far from rising seas and tectonic plate movement but around 75 km from the Leh aiport , it is close enough to human civilisation today to deposit the country ’s agricultural heritage with ease .
“ India is a herbal garden … .
It is now getting threatened or endangered or extinct …
There is a dire necessity to preserve this rich wealth of biodiversity , which exists in India to give it to the next generation , ” W. Selvamurthy , distinguished scientist and Chief Controller ( R&D ) , Ministry of Defence , told The Hindu .
Chang - La , opened last December , now holds 5,000 seeds from the Ministry of Defence , prioritised for qualities such yield or resistance to temperature , pests or humidity .
But its total capacity is 10 times that and , says Selvamurthy , government departments , research organisations and more are welcome to store useful and viable seeds for free .
Their qualities will be digitally indexed and available through open access software to further science globally .
This facility aims to rival that at Svalbard in Norway , which can hold up to 3 million seed varieties , by opening up its vaults to the international community .
For that to happen , India will have to install a cooling system for the 15 days a year when the temperatures peak to - 4 degrees .
So even if something happens at high latitude in Norway , there will be a back up at high altitude in India .
Crop seeds , developed slowly and carefully over thousands of years , are not only the source of sustenance for humankind but the best repository of genetic material scientists can use to help develop food resistant to the vagaries of climate change .
Transgenic cropping to ensure that our grains , pulse and vegetables can reproduce at high altitudes , in salty water , less water and high temperatures , is essential to provide future generations with the same opportunities of today , he says .
In a decision issued today ( here is an alternate link to the decision ) , the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a Wisconsin prison ’s rule forbidding inmates to play Dungeons & Dragons or possess D&D publications and materials [ HT : Josh Blackman ] .
The prison ’s rationale for the ban is that playing D&D might stimulate “ gang activity ” by inmates .
But the government conceded that there is no evidence that Dungeons and Dragons actually had stimulated gang activity in the past , either in this prison or elsewhere .
The only evidence for the supposedly harmful effects of Dungeons and Dragons were a few cases from other states where playing the game supposedly led inmates to indulge in “ escapism ” and become divorced from reality , one case where two non-inmates committed a crime in which they “ acted out ” a D&D story - line , and one where a longtime D&D player ( not an inmate ) committed suicide .
Obviously , almost any hobby or reading material might lead people to become divorced from reality , or in rare cases commit suicide .
And disturbed individuals could potentially “ act out ” a crime based on a scenario in almost any film or literary work .
Should prisons ban The Count of Monte Cristo on the grounds that it might encourage escape attempts ?
Moreover , the “ escapism ” rationale conflicts with the gang argument .
People who become engrossed in escapism and retreat from society are presumably less likely to become active gang members .
That said , the Seventh Circuit decision may well be legally correct .
It is based on the highly deferential standard under which most prison regulations are to be upheld against constitutional challenge so long as they are “ rationally related ” to some legitimate goal of prison administration .
And , as lawyers know , when courts apply such a “ rational basis ” test , that usually means that almost anything goes .
The test is mandated by Supreme Court precedent , and the Seventh Circuit judges had little choice but to follow it .
UPDATE : I should perhaps mention that the court also cited statements by a “ gang expert ” who argued that playing D&D might stimulate gang activity because Dungeons and Dragons has a structure similar to a gang :
The sole evidence the prison officials have submitted on this point [ the connection between D&D and gangs ] is the affidavit of Captain Muraski , the gang specialist .
Muraski testified that Waupun ’s prohibition on role - playing and fantasy games was intended to serve two purposes .
The first aim Muraski cited was the maintenanceof prison security .
He explained that the policy was intended to promote prison security because cooperative games can mimic the organization of gangs and lead to the actual development thereof .
Muraski elaborated that during D&D games , one player is denoted the “ Dungeon Master . ”
The Dungeon Master is tasked with giving directions to other players , which Muraski testified mimics the organization of a gang .
This argument is , I think , too weak to bother refuting – even if it is just barely compelling enough to pass muster under the rational basis test .
By this “ reasoning , ” you could ban the “ cooperative game ” of football because “ during football games , one player is denoted the ‘ quarterback . ’
The quarterback is tasked with giving directions to other players . ”
Berlin Takes On Washington German Foreign Minister Pushes for NATO Nuclear Drawdown
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has been vocal in his demands that the US remove its nuclear weapons from German soil .
Now he is calling for NATO to discuss the issue at an upcoming meeting , despite outspoken American opposition to his proposal .
The saying " You 're only as old as you feel " really seems to resonate with older adults , according to research from Purdue University .
" How old you are matters , but beyond that it 's your interpretation that has far - reaching implications for the process of aging , " said Markus H. Schafer , a doctoral student in sociology and gerontology who led the study .
" So , if you feel old beyond your own chronological years you are probably going to experience a lot of the downsides that we associate with aging .
" But if you are older and maintain a sense of being younger , then that gives you an edge in maintaining a lot of the abilities you prize . "
Schafer and co-author Tetyana P. Shippee , a Purdue graduate who is a research associate at Purdue 's Center on Aging and the Life Course , compared people 's chronological age and their subjective age to determine which one has a greater influence on cognitive abilities during older adulthood .
Nearly 500 people ages 55 - 74 were surveyed about aging in 1995 and 2005 as part of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States .
In 1995 , when people were asked what age do you feel most of the time , the majority identified with being 12 years younger than they actually were .
" We found that these people who felt young for their age were more likely to have greater confidence about their cognitive abilities a decade later , " Schafer said .
" Yes , chronological age was important , but the subjective age had a stronger effect .
advertisement
" What we are not sure about is what comes first .
Does a person 's wellness and happiness affect their cognitive abilities or does a person 's cognitive ability contribute to their sense of wellness .
We are planning to address this in a future study . "
Schafer also said that the current study 's findings have both positive and negative implications .
" There is a tremendous emphasis on being youthful in our society and that can have a negative effect for people , " Schafer said .
" People want to feel younger , and so when they do inevitably age they can lose a lot of confidence in their cognitive abilities .
" But on the other hand , because there is such a desire in America to stay young , there may be benefits of trying to maintain a sense of youthfulness by keeping up with new trends and activities that feel invigorating .
Learning new technologies is one way people can continue to improve their cognitive abilities .
It will be interesting to see how , or if , these cultural norms shift as the Baby Boomer generation ages . "
Other studies have shown that women are prone to aging stereotypes , so Schafer expected to see that women who felt older about themselves would have less confidence in their cognitive abilities .
" There is a slight difference between men and women , but it 's not as pronounced as we expected , " Schafer said .
" This was surprising because of the emphasis on physical attractiveness and youth that is often disproportionately placed on women . "
Schafer also is studying how stressful events , such as family members ' health issues , affect aging , as well as how happiness and aging relate .
These finding were published in January 's Journal of Gerontology : Social Sciences , and the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

YAOHNANEN , Vanuatu —
In a jungle - clad village on a South Pacific island , a group of tribesmen produce their most treasured possessions : three signed portraits of the Queen of England ’s husband .
“ Can you tell Prince Philip we are waiting for him ? ” asks the village chief , Siko Nathuan .
“ We are his family and we really want him to come home . ”
Improbable as it seems , the prince — whose royal title is Duke of Edinburgh — is worshipped by the inhabitants of Tanna , one of 83 islands that make up the nation of Vanuatu , formerly the New Hebrides , an Anglo - French territory .
The islanders believe he is the descendant of one of their ancestral spirits , and that he will one day return to live among them .
One of dozens of “ cargo cults ” found around the South Pacific , the adulation of the 88 - year - old prince is thought to date back to 1974 , when he and the queen traveled to Vanuatu on the Royal yacht Britannia .
While they did not alight on Tanna , news of their visit reached its shores , and was woven , it seems , into an ancient story .
The heart of the Prince Philip movement is the village of Yaohnanen , on Tanna ’s upper slopes , reached via a tortuously winding , rutted track .
Here , children in ragged clothes play hide and seek among giant banyan trees , and men in nambas — traditional penis gourds — hunt wild pigs with bamboo bows and arrows .
Nathuan shows off a simple hut with a thatched roof and dirt floor .
Like other dwellings in Yaohnanen , it has no electricity or running water .
Next to it is a carefully tended garden .
“ I ’ve been preparing this place for Prince Philip , ” declares the village chief .
“ I know that in England he has a palace and servants .
But here he will just live simply , like us . ”
After waiting nearly four decades , the locals believe the Duke ’s return is imminent .
The key date is June 10 , when he will turn 89 .
“ He made a promise that in 2010 , on his birthday , he will arrive in Tanna , ” says Nathuan .
“ I ’ve read it in a document somewhere .
We know he is a very old man , but when he comes here , he is going to be young again , and so will everyone else on the island . ”
For now , the hut serves as a shrine to this unlikely deity , best known in the English - speaking world for a string of indiscreet gaffes .
Most recently , the prince asked an English naval cadet whether she worked in a strip club .
In the past , he has quizzed Australian Aborigines on whether they still throw spears , and warned British students in China : “ If you stay here much longer , you ’ll all be slitty - eyed . ”
Buckingham Palace , aware the prince is revered in this obscure corner of Melanesia , sent out the three photographs .
They include a black - and - white print delivered by the British Resident Commissioner in 1978 , two years before a group of islands known as the New Hebrides became the independent nation of Vanuatu , and a framed color picture of Prince Philip grasping a ceremonial pig- killing stick , a gift from the islanders .
Kirk Huffman , an Australian anthropologist who has studied Vanuatu for decades , recounts the story of two spirit figures — one dark - skinned , one lighter - skinned — who , long ago , emerged from a still active volcano on Tanna .
The former is considered the ancestor of the island ’s tribal clans , the latter the forebear of the world ’s white races .
“ That [ second ] figure disappeared overseas , ” says Huffman .
“ So the clans have been thinking : ‘ Where has that guy gone , and who are his descendants ? ’ ”
Then came the royal visit , and the vision of the prince resplendent in his white naval uniform .
The islanders also heard that the queen ’s husband was from neither England nor France , nor Australia nor the United States .
“ They ’ve heard about these islands , and if he ’s not from there , there ’s only one place he can be from : Tanna , ” explains Huffman , who dislikes the term “ cargo cult . ”
He says : “ I would call it a visionary movement .
It ’s just one aspect of an incredibly sophisticated and very profound culture . ”
Elsewhere on Tanna , certain tribes venerate a shadowy American figure called John Frum — possibly a legacy of the U.S. servicemen stationed in the New Hebrides during World War II , who brought with them large quantities of equipment and material goods .
Hundreds of Tanna men were recruited to build roads , airstrips and bases .
Decades on , John Frum ’s followers daub “ USA ” on their chests , don GI - style uniforms and march barefoot around a parade ground , beneath a Stars and Stripes .
Huffman believes such movements originally took root as a reaction against efforts by Presbyterian missionaries to ban traditional customs and beliefs .
“ These cultures are taking elements of the outside world and slotting them into their own belief systems in a way that ’s useful to them . ”
According to various stories that have become tangled over time , Nathuan ’s grandfather , Jack Naiva , met Prince Philip when he visited Vanuatu and presented him with a pig , or vice versa — a highly significant gesture in Vanuatu .
It is also said that when the prince went ashore in the capital , Port Vila , he shook hands only with dignitaries from Tanna .
Naiva died in 2008 and is buried on the outskirts of Yaohnanen .
A photograph of him holding a picture of the royal couple is embedded in his tombstone .
Describing what the islanders believe will happen when the prince returns , Huffman once wrote : “ At the very moment that he sets foot ashore , mature kava plants [ from which the local spirit is brewed ] will sprout all over the island ; all the old people will shed their skin like snakes and become young again ; there will be no more sickness and no more death ... a man will be able to take any woman he wants . ”
On June 10 , the islanders will stage a feast , traditional dancing and kava drinking .
“ Every year we celebrate his birthday , ” says Nathuan .
“ We get together and talk about him .
We feel happy .
We can feel his presence .
Now we ’re waiting for him to honor his promise to come back in 2010 . ”
Anatoly Zenkov provides this nifty tool ( Mac and PC ) to track your mouse pointer .
Really simple .
Just start it , let it run , minimize the window , and carry on as usual .
In the end , you get this image that looks something like a Pollock .
Circles show areas where the pointer did n’t move while the tracks show movement .
The above is my own activity during the past couple of hours .
I was just randomly browsing while watching the Laker game , so it ’s kind of all over the place .
Run while using a single application for a while , and you might see something like Zenkov ’s tracks on Photoshop .
What do your tracks look like ?

MPEG LA has announced plans to extend the duration of no-cost h264 licensing for free Internet video until 2016 .
This move lifts some of the immediate ambiguity about h264 licensing and will allow the codec to continue to gain broad traction on the Internet .
The patents that cover the various essential principles behind h264 video compression and streaming were obtained by a broad number of companies including Microsoft , Apple , LG , Sony , Samsung , and many other major players in the media and consumer electronics markets .
These companies collaboratively pooled the patents through MPEG LA , an organization that sells patent licenses on behalf of its members .
The pool makes it possible for users of the codec to obtain many of the requisite patent licenses from one place rather than having to go to each company individually .
This approach to patent licensing is very common and is often used in other technical fields , such as telecommunications , where implementors need to license an assortment of patents in order to adopt a specific technology .
It 's important to note , however , that there is no guarantee that every company with relevant patents is participating in the pool — meaning that licensees still have some exposure to the risk of infringing submarine patents .
The terms under which MPEG LA sells h264 licenses are relatively complex and highly nuanced .
The cost will differ depending on the specific context in which the codec is being used .
Different licenses are needed for distributing codec implementations and distributing h264 content .
Those two categories include a spectrum of scenarios with different licensing terms .
For example , the cost of distributing a codec differs depending on whether it is integrated into an operating system or shipped with a piece of software .
For h264 content distribution , there are different licensing schemes for Internet streaming and broadcast television .
Although few users realize it , the codec implementations that are included in professional multimedia software often do n't cover all possible uses .
If you encode h264 media with Final Cut Pro and sell it on a physical medium , for example , you have to pay an additional license fee to MPEG LA .
A common practice among technology patent - holders is to offer cheaper or more permissive terms during an introductory period and then increase the costs later .
Discounted introductory licensing lowers the initial barrier to adoption and helps to build a market for a technology so that the patents will be worth more later .
When the codec was first introduced , MPEG LA did not require a licensing fee for the privilege of streaming free h264 - encoded content over the Internet .
These terms , which were to expire in 2010 , made it feasible for streaming video Web sites like YouTube to adopt h264 .
With the approach of the expiration date , a lot of questions were raised about the future of h264 licensing .
The ambiguity was a major concern for many of the companies that used the codec for Internet video .
They feared that MPEG LA would saddle Internet video with the same kind of costly licensing terms that the organization currently applies to television broadcasts — - $ 2,500 per transmission or $ 10,000 per year for every million households that can receive the broadcast .
MPEG LA 's decision to extend the no-cost terms for free Internet video distribution will effectively defer this issue until 2016 , the new expiration date .
It 's still unclear what the licensing terms will be after the new expiration date — MPEG LA could choose to apply hefty fees at that time .
For now , however , the absence of licensing costs for Internet streaming will likely contribute to expanding the acceptance of h264 in the world of Web video .
The need for a competitive royalty - free codec
Although the immediate need for a royalty - free alternative to h264 is perhaps less urgent now , it does still exist .
A royalty - free codec with competitive performance is essential to the success of standards - based open video .
New capabilities brought to the Web by HTML5 will make it possible for browsers to natively support video without having to depend on a proprietary plugin that is controlled by a single vendor .
Unfortunately , the viability of the HTML5 Video element as a replacement for plugin - based streaming video solutions will largely be predicated on whether the browser vendors can agree on a codec .
A compelling royalty - free codec that meets the needs of all of the major stakeholders in the Web video ecosystem would be advantageous for HTML5 video .
If there was an option that could be implemented uniformly in all browsers , it would make it easier for the browser vendors and content distributors to reach consensus .
At the present time , HTML5 video implementations do not all consistently support the same codecs .
Apple and Google favor h264 while Opera and Mozilla favor the royalty - free Ogg Theora codec .
Although Apple and Google would both likely welcome a viable royalty - free codec , they do not believe that Theora is capable of meeting their needs .
Google is concerned about the adequacy of Theora compression for streaming video and Apple is concerned about the general lack of support for hardware - based Theora decoding .
Mozilla is unwilling to commit to a proprietary codec that can't be freely redistributed to end users .
The fact that h264 codecs can't be distributed in open source software has implications for video consumers , but it also impacts producers .
Beyond the need to supply an acceptable option for open Web standards , a competitive royalty - free codec would also be beneficial because it would prevent patent costs from disenfranchising independent media creators .
The development of open source video production and editing software is currently hindered by the patent encumbrances that prevent such applications from supporting proprietary codecs .
Consumers who want to use free and open source software to produce video are locked out of the formats that are supported in practically everything else .
The path towards a royalty - free h264 alternative
Although Ogg Theora still has some technical limitations , it is advancing rapidly and could have the potential to become a competitive alternative to h264 .
It already fares better than many people realize in the context of Internet streaming video .
In order to accelerate the development of Theora , Mozilla has contributed funding to Xiph.org , the group that is building and maintaining the codec .
Another possible contender is Dirac , a royalty - free video codec developed by the BBC that uses wavelet - based compression .
The BBC has already successfully used the codec internally for transmission of HDTV content .
A practical real - world implementation called Schrödinger is available and can be used today in several applications , including the VLC media player and software that uses the GStreamer framework .
There is also the possibility that Google could come to the rescue .
The search giant recently made a deal to acquire On2 , a company that is well known for developing sophisticated multimedia software .
On2's VP8 codec reportedly offers better compression and performance than h264 .
There is considerable speculation that Google could potentially be planning to open up VP8 and make it available under royalty - free terms in order to accelerate the growth of standards - based Internet video .
Assuming that VP8 is as good as On2 claims , opening it up would make it a very compelling rival to h264 .
Google has not yet made clear what it intends to do with On2's intellectual property , so it 's still too early to say whether VP8 will actually become royalty - free .
It 's possible that at least one of these options will become viable by the time that the extended term of h264's no-cost Internet streaming license expires .
One can hope that it will happen sooner rather than later , however , because the viability of standards - based video streaming and open source video editing really need a boost .
This was a big blow to U.S. biodiesel producers , and was one of the factors leading to a disastrous 2009 for U.S. biodiesel production .
But there were other factors as well , which I will describe in this post .
One of my Top 10 Energy Stories of 2009 involved the actions taken by the EU against U.S. biodiesel producers .
U.S. tax dollars had been generously subsidizing biodiesel that was being exported out of the U.S. European producers could n't compete against the subsidized imports , so the EU effectively cut off the imports by imposing five - year tariffs on U.S. biodiesel .
How disastrous was 2009 ?
Per the National Biodiesel Board ( NBB ) , here are the statistics from the past 6 years of biodiesel production :
2004 : 25 million gallons
2005 : 75 million gallons
2006 : 250 million gallons
2007 : 450 million gallons
2008 : 700 million gallons
2009 : 300-350 million gallons ( estimate )
The NBB also reports that domestic biodiesel capacity is now operating at only 15 % .
There have been a number of stories in the past few days covering these developments :
Bad start to 2010 after ' rough year ' for entire biofuel industry
A federal tax credit that provided makers of biodiesel $ 1 for every gallon expired Friday .
As a result , some U.S. producers say they will shut down without the government subsidy .
A one - year extension of the biodiesel tax credit was included in a bill that was approved by the U.S.
House recently , but it never made it through the Senate .
Politics and Energy Policy
I have often complained about the chaos that political leaders cause with inconsistency on energy policy .
I will get into the wisdom of this biodiesel tax credit in a moment , but government policy makers need to send clear , long - term signals so energy producers can plan .
This has long been a problem for planning energy projects .
Wind and solar developers have lived with this uncertainty for years .
It seemed like at the end of every year , there was a tax credit that may or may not be extended .
The uncertainty often froze project developers , and created unnecessary delays .
The same has long been true in the oil and gas industry .
One of the reasons that it has been difficult to get a gas pipeline built in Alaska was government refusal to commit to long - term tax rates .
Imagine that you are contemplating spending $ 26 billion on a gas pipeline , but the government can't tell you what your tax rate is going to be .
If my state income tax doubles , I can move to another state .
But it is n't like you can pick that pipeline up and move it , so it is important that you know that the government can't double the tax rate in the event of a budget shortfall .
Recap of Government Interference
A different kind of government interference - a tendency to attempt to pick technology winners - resulted in cancellation of what I believe was a promising 2nd generation renewable diesel process .
I documented the saga in several posts .
To recap briefly here , there are two different types of renewable diesel that can be produced from vegetable fats .
One is biodiesel , which is normally produced by reacting methanol with animal fats or vegetable oil .
The product is actually an alkyl ester , which contains oxygen , and is structurally different from petroleum diesel .
This is the 1st generation type of renewable diesel .
But biodiesel changes consistency in cold weather , limiting the amount of biodiesel that can be blended into petroleum diesel .
The other type of renewable diesel is green diesel , which is chemically equivalent to petroleum diesel , and has promise as a 2nd generation renewable diesel .
This product contains no oxygen and can be blended in any proportion with petroleum diesel .
It can be made via gasification from any biomass or by hydrocracking the same fats and oils that you use to produce biodiesel .
Besides the structural differences in the product , biodiesel results in a glycerin by - product whereas green diesel from oils or fats results in a propane by - product .
My former employer , ConocoPhillips ( COP ) , developed a process for making green diesel that was both more efficient and more cost - effective than conventional biodiesel production , but still required the biodiesel tax credit to be profitable .
But because an oil company was involved , Congress voted to specifically deny the biodiesel tax credit for the process .
By killing the credit , COP was placed at a $ 42 / bbl disadvantage relative to biodiesel producers who received the credit , and because of this decided to cancel the project .
I documented that sorry saga here .
I explain the differences between ' green diesel ' and biodiesel more fully here .
Where to Now ?
So where to go from here ?
We now have a classic dilemma created by the government .
Through government fiat , an industry was created .
Investments were made and infrastructure was put in place .
The problem is that the particular industry that sprang up had little hope of ever really competing without the subsidy .
The reasons are alluded to in the link above :
" By the time you buy the feedstock and the chemicals to produce the fuel , you have more money in it than you get for the fuel without the tax credit , " Francis said .
" We wo n't be producing any without the tax credit . "
I have long believed that there is no future for 1st generation biodiesel .
I wrote in an August 2007 essay : " I have said it before , and I reiterate : Biodiesel 's days are numbered . "
Note that the year after I wrote that the U.S. biodiesel industry had their best year ever .
But the handwriting was on the wall for very fundamental reasons , and the prediction I made in 2007 is playing out now .
There are multiple problems that will make it difficult for biodiesel to ever compete without subsidies .
In a nutshell the key problem is that the feedstock costs are linked to fossil fuel prices .
The feedstock is generally a vegetable oil and methanol - an alcohol typically produced from natural gas .
A second big problem is that biodiesel is an inferior fuel to hydrocarbon diesel ( especially in cold weather ) .
Further , the by - product of the biodiesel process is glycerin , which has limited value ( especially at the volumes produced when biodiesel production is ramped up ) .
But this story is worse than simply a fuel that can't compete .
As evidenced by the opposition of the National Biodiesel Board to the extension of the tax credit for COP ’s 2nd generation process , 1st generation biodiesel is n't even a bridge to 2nd generation biodiesel - it is a barrier .
Not only is biodiesel chemically different , but 1st generation producers have pulled out the stops to protect themselves against 2nd generation competition .
So now we have a 1st generation industry that was already in trouble even with the subsidies that it was receiving , and a 2nd generation industry that could have been much further along were it not for 1st generation interference ( which was aided by Congress ) .
If instead of picking technology winners , Congress had simply raised fossil fuel taxes , we would n't be in this dilemma .
With the high level of embedded fossil fuels , biodiesel would have been unable to compete , and an industry with no future would not have been created by the government .
Green diesel , on the other hand , would start to look a lot better because of the lower level of fossil fuel inputs ( particularly for gasification ) , and we might find plants starting up to produce green diesel from both hydrocracking vegetable oils ( the COP process I described ) and gasification of biomass ( described here ) .
What I expect to happen is that Congress will eventually extend the credit , and it will be applied retroactively .
But there are no guarantees , so producers are once again left with uncertainty .
What should happen - in my opinion - is announcement of a phaseout schedule .
I would n't simply eliminate the tax credit cold turkey .
That would be a blow to producers who invested on good faith that government support would be continued .
But they also need to receive a message that this tax credit will be phased out over the next 3 - 5 years .
At that point , prospective investors will be fairly warned that projects whose economics hinge on continued government subsidies are to be avoided .
This , by the way , is the sort of metric I try to apply to projects .
I am looking for projects that can be viable without government support and can operate with low / no fossil fuel inputs .
The first item means that governments have much less ability to wreck my project by withholding support , and the latter means that the project should become more attractive in the higher oil price environment that I expect .
That does n't mean that initial government support is n't often helpful , but unless the underlying economics are sound then government support is a crutch I will never be able to throw away .
In my opinion this is the case for most U.S. biodiesel producers , which helps explain why industry capacity is presently at 15 % .
Disclosure : I worked for ConocoPhilips at the time that it developed green diesel using left over chicken fat .
I now work for a company ( not a petroleum company ) that has partial ownership of a company that is involved with the development of green diesel by gasification of biomass .
SAN FRANCISCO
NAOMI MOST , a devoted brewer of a fermented tea called kombucha , keeps her “ big momma ” in the garage .
The big momma in question is a 20 - pound pancake of gelatinous and , well , rather gross - looking bacteria and yeast floating atop a vat of kombucha , a drink that enthusiasts tout as a tonic for digestion , hair loss and all manner of bodily ailments .
It ’s not for everyone .
“ I live with my boyfriend and he finds it really weird , ” said Ms. Most , 30 , a manager for a nonprofit group in Palo Alto , Calif .
“ He does n’t like the smell . ”
Looks and aroma notwithstanding , kombucha is gaining popularity among those who favor organic beverages , and it is showing signs of turning into a gold mine for some companies .
While the poor economy and worries about health and the environment have diminished the national thirst for soda and bottled water , sales of kombucha and other “ functional ” juices in the United States topped $ 295 million last year , up 25 percent over a two - year period , according to SPINS Inc. , a market researcher .
In 2009 Americans bought more than a million bottles of GT ’s Kombucha , the leading commercial variety made by Millennium Products .
The chief executive , G. T. Dave , started the company as a teenager in his parents ’ kitchen in Beverly Hills , Calif . , but the drink has grown beyond the mom-and - pop scale .
Recently major companies like Red Bull and Honest Tea ( of which Coca - Cola owns 40 percent ) began distributing their own brands .
On NBC ’s critically acclaimed — and little watched — series “ Friday Night Lights , ” a high school principal , who happens to be married to the football - crazed Texas town ’s football coach , fights a losing battle between athletics and academics .
There ’s plenty of money and support for a new Jumbotron scoreboard for the football stadium in the down - and - out town .
But not much for academics .
In Woodbury , the football field at the new high school , which opens next year , awaits the action .
An enclosed press box and lights are part of the amenities .
It sits in the shadow of spiffy — and expensive — new baseball diamonds , right next to more than a dozen baseball fields and soccer fields at the city ’s Bielenberg sports complex .
In today ’s economy , are these luxuries ?
Is there still a worthwhile purpose for high school sports ?
Woodbury has not one , but two youth athletic leagues which run in - house and traveling programs for the major sports .
Kids in the city have no shortage of avenues to sports participation .
That ’s not always the case , especially in rural areas of the state .
But a Star Tribune story offers a reminder why schools do n’t want to get rid of sports , aside from their status as the most sacred of sacred cows .
Minnesota allows open enrollment — school choices .
They can go to school wherever they want .
Tuesday ’s story raised questions about whether some schools —
Hopkins was the focus of the story — essentially employ “ ringers . ”
If you do n’t live in a district , or you only moved their to play sports — does the whole “ community identity ” excuse for high school sports still exist .
Woe be to the school district that does n’t offer sports .
Their athletic students will jump to another district , taking state funding with them .
Clearly , some district are looking to save money by cutting high school sports .
The Minnesota State High School league , at the request of some central Minnesota school districts , considered reducing the number of games the schools play , eliminating classes and divisions in some sports , and getting rid of some tournament games .
In the end , it decided to do nothing , at least not yet .
Mark Rusinko , a governor ’s appointee to the Minnesota State High School League board of directors , suggested that if schools want to cut costs by cutting the number of games played , they could do so .
It ’s a complicated process , Wally Shaver of Let ’s Play Hockey pointed out .
One school may save money by eliminating a game .
Another school may lose $ 20,000 in gate receipts because of the lost game .
Some schools are raising the fees for participating .
Others are scheduling sports doubleheaders so two sports teams can ride the same bus .
But there ’s tremendous pushback — especially in hockey — when the subject of reducing the number of games comes up .
But some districts have cut high school sports .
Even the liberal Minnesota 2020 , which might be expected to lead the cut- athletics - save - academics parade , lamented the loss of football , baseball , track , wrestling , and dance line in the Crosby Ironton district .
On Monday night , the school board in Marshall considered $ 600,000 in cuts .
None of which — except for cheerleading , which was proposed for elimination — involved team sports programs .
Should school districts rethink the role of sports ?
Should Minnesota high schools eliminate sports ?

Sulphur in silence ( Image : NASA / SPL )
THE footprint of life on Mars may have been plain to see all along in the sulphurous minerals that litter the planet ’s surface .
What ’s more , the next Mars lander should be able to detect the evidence .
No mission to Mars has ever found complex carbon - based molecules , from which life as we know it is built .
But sulphur is everywhere on Mars – it is more abundant there than on Earth – and it could contain one of the signatures of life .
On Earth , the activity of some microbes converts one class of sulphur - containing compounds , …
Yesterday , when I mentioned the student - loan provisions of HCR with regard to the reconciliation process , several of you commented , what are student - loan changes doing in the health bill anyway ?
The fact is that many big bills end up with other things attached to them .
A big bill that people think is going to pass is just an irresistible target for legislators : hey , that thing is going to pass , and the vote will really be about A , so if I can get a provision about B or C or D attached to it , it 'll sail through cuz no one 's going to vote against the whole thing just because of my little provision .
Happens all the time -- and yes , in this case , on both sides .
It just so happens that student loan reform has been a big priority of the Obama administration .
Under it , private lenders will be out of the student loan business .
All the lending will be issued and managed directly by the Department of Education .
Proof of Obama 's mad hunger to have the government control every aspect of our lives ?
Either that , or a sensible response to the massive and hideous student loan scandal we 've had in this country in recent years .
Here 's what happened in a nutshell , via the New America Foundation :
The roots of the 9.5 student loan case go back to the 1980s when Congress guaranteed non-profit lenders , which use tax - exempt bonds to finance their loans , a minimum rate of return of 9.5 percent on federal student loans made with these bonds .
As interest rates on all other student loans fell in the 1990s , policymakers became concerned that these nonprofit student loan providers were making a killing .
So in 1993 , Congress rescinded that policy , but grandfathered in loans made from the old bonds , believing that the volume of 9.5 loans would decline as they were paid off and the bonds retired .
Instead , beginning in 2002 , a small group of lenders devised a strategy to aggressively grow the volume of loans that they claimed were eligible for the 9.5 guarantee .
This was a goldmine for lenders in the existing low interest rate environment ( at the time , the borrower interest rate on regular loans hovered around 3.5 percent . )
They accomplished this scheme by transferring loans that qualified for the 9.5 subsidy payment to other financing vehicles and recycling the proceeds into new loans that they claimed were then eligible for the subsidy .
The lenders repeated this process over and over again .
Crooked lenders cost taxpayers many hundreds of million dollars .
And the artificial economy the loans created are considered to have added to tuition costs .
There 's a moral in here about liberalism that one can never get conservatives to believe , but it 's true , so , so be it .
And it 's this .
Believe it or not , liberals would be perfectly happy in a world where regulation were n't needed and government did n't need to run student loans .
It would be great , because it would cost taxpayers less , which we 're actually quite fine with , and it would mean that people in the private sector were being honest .
But that ai n't the world .
Polluters dump crap into rivers and the air .
Employers in dangerous workplaces cut corners , resulting in death and injury .
Car companies knowingly put gasoline tanks in dangerous places .
Lenders rip people off .
When conservatives ask , how much regulation exactly do you advocate ? , I say , no set amount -- enough to protect the public weal .
Yes , there will be problems under the new system , probably most likely to occur in the servicing realm .
But it wo n't steal people blind .
The Tea Party convention kicked off today in Nasvhille , and former Rep. Tom Tancredo ( R - Colo . ) opened up the convention with some controversial remarks about the 2008 election .
" People who could not even spell the word ' vote ' or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House , " Tancredo said during a speech , according to the Cleveland Leader .
Tancredo also said Obama won because " we do not have a civics , literacy test before people can vote . "
This is n't the first time Tancredo has made controversial statements .
The Colorado Republican has long been a striden opponent of illegal immigration , and liberals have accused him of racial insensitivity .
He launched a presidential bid in 2008 based on an anti-illegal immigration platform .
While explaining his opposition to Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination , he called the group La Raza " a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses . "
Feel the flow : Hyung - Tae Kim designs around fat
By Brandon Sheffield
Hyung - Tae Kim is perhaps the best - known Korean game developer -- even if his name is n't known by all , his art is very recognizable , as seen in the later entries to the War of Genesis series , and Magna Carta for PC and PlayStation 2 and its sequel on the Xbox 360 .
His style exaggerates the female , while also promoting the masculine .
His characters straddle the line between Japanese minimal lines and Western emphasis on musculature and detail .
I 've long been impressed with his work , especially his willingness to go outside the constraints of human physicality to make appealing characters .
All of his characters , male or female , are soft and curved in ways that make sense , even if they are not tied to real anatomy .
For Kim , it 's all about flow , and in the past most of his actual art was relegated to 2D .
Now that he 's working on Blade & Soul , NCSoft 's next big MMORPG after Aion , he has the chance to completely control his work in 3D as an art and technical director on the game .
In this interview , conducted in his native Seoul , we discuss his process , his thoughts on anatomy and character , and his influences .
Can you tell me , step by step , your process for character design ?
When you 're designing one character , how do you go from envisioning that character to the actual process of making them into full illustrations ?
Hyung - Tae Kim :
First of all , you have to decide the direction of the character , in concert with the design teams .
You have to know where the character will be used , and in what manner .
And then I have to actually begin the sketch , which is the most difficult part of the process .
What I take into greatest consideration when doing my sketches is first , whether this style reveals the personality of the character , and then if it will be attractive in three dimensions .
It did n't really matter when I was working on War of Genesis though , because it was 2D .
Then after the sketch is finished , we start the color planning , deciding which colors we want to use .
If the process goes well , it can end in two days .
Sometimes it can take as along as three weeks .
Then for a final illustration , we would polish by zooming in and fleshing out all the details .
Do you have assistants drawing in your style , or are all illustrations in your games by you ?
HTK : Until recently , all illustrations were completely done by me .
But for Blade & Soul , which is an MMORPG , it 's a game that requires a lot of characters and a lot of design .
So now there 's a team doing our drawings .
Besides me , we have eight artists working on the images you see .
And are they drawing your style , or adding elements of their own ?
HTK : When we hire people , I try to recruit artists who naturally can understand and draw the kind of image I need .
It 's not that I need them to draw exactly in my style , it 's more important that when it transitions into 3D it 'll be up to my standards and fit my direction .
So at first the artist 's style could be different , but since the beginning of the Blade & Soul project I 've had everyone practice drawing these characters and images in a certain style .
Everyone 's pushing for the same end result with the 3D models .
That 's actually what I did from the beginning .
I provided a 3D polygon model so that everyone had a specific goal to move toward , and the direction to get there .
It 's all basically an attempt to maintain a consistent style .
I 've noticed with 2D illustrations in Korea that there 's a more frequent use of vibrant color .
I 'm wondering if you have any theory why that is , why color is so well used ?
HTK : One of the characteristics of Korean digital art is that it 's pretty energetic .
I guess that 's something to do with the cultural background of Korea .
Of course I can't speak for others , but in my case , I 'm not really comfortable with a stable kind of picture , with something balanced , because what is average is so well - represented in reality .
You see it anywhere you go .
I want to express through my artwork something that 's not possible in reality , something that cannot exist .
One thing that 's very distinctive about your style is how you draw women .
How do you approach this ?
HTK : I 'll preface this by saying that when you 're drawing something that 's related to culture or region , it 's incredibly difficult , because trends change so often .
This is the hardest thing to depict with character , for me .
For example , there are people who like strong characters , weak characters , innocent characters , feeble characters , on a region - by - region basis .
But that sort of thing changes very often .
It becomes very complicated .
So I try to simplify everything by erasing all the cultural elements , and try to make it more internal or instinctive .
In other words , it 's the natural identification of what we really like since birth , before cultural context .
I try to exaggerate all those aspects and then tie it to some of the more complex or deeper emotions , and then just draw something that people will really like innately .
Is that " back to basics " approach why the women that you draw tend to have an emphasis on chest and hips ?
Kind of an Earth Mother element ?
HTK : To put it simply , you have to first look at how the body is actually connected .
Of course , the chest and hips sort of stand out a lot because they 're , you know , the biggest parts I guess .
But the most important part of the character is actually fat .
Any character we create is composed of bones , muscles , and of course fat .
Despite the beauty of bones and muscles , those aspects tend to not be particularly feminine , and lend themselves to something more male .
But if you focus more on the fat of a character , and then you sort of create a flow into the chest and the hips and form the body around it , how force and physics can change a body , including fat , it becomes more beautiful for people who can appreciate that innate nature .
In books that explain the body , there are n't that many explanations of fat , so it 's really hard to find this kind of information actually .
I was wondering how much you pay attention to anatomy .
Sometimes , it feels like you may stretch people a little bit , altering their actual skeletal structure .
HTK : I do try to exaggerate my characters , but only to the point of still being able to perceive them as human .
But then I try to exaggerate those parts that people will find most attractive , like when a man looks at a woman , or a woman looks at a man .
Especially , for example , as you mention , the pelvis or the hips in women .
I do accentuate the bones and the fat around the body , which makes it a lot more attractive .
One problem that I have through this process is that when I exaggerate this to the maximum , the character starts to become inhuman .
And then there 's a clash between the two thoughts of what I 'm trying to draw .
I 'm constantly having this tug - of - war between these two ideas when I 'm making new characters .
I noticed that in Magna Carta , you also drew the main male character with feminine hips .
Does your approach change for male characters as well ?
HTK : That was just in the case of Magna Carta , because the main character was supposed to kind of make the audience feel a little awkward .
That is why the clothing and also the anatomy of that character was more feminine than usual .
I think that 's not the most attractive element of male characters .
I would n't draw a normal male the way I drew him .
What is the kind of essence that you try to bring out for male characters usually ?
HTK : Of course , everybody knows that the attractive aspects of male characters are different when seen from the perspective of a man or a woman .
One thing that people tend to miss is the importance of the waist .
People say that the shorter the waist , the better it looks .
But the actual thing is the more detail you add to the muscles , how the waist or stomach moves and how it changes when the muscles move , that 's one thing that 's really attractive when looking at a male character .
How did you wind up developing your style ?
HTK : Well , I really took a lot of things from Japan , not only comic books and games .
In my early days I really liked a lot of things from Japan .
When I started studying art though , I actually preferred Western styles of painting .
I tried to combine both that Western painting style with Japanese style content , and that 's pretty much how I got here .
How do your goals change , if they do change , from 2D illustration to 3D model ?
HTK : To be straightforward , it 's not exactly that 3D is our goal .
To be more precise , in 3D I 'm trying to express the attractiveness of the 2D paintings that I made .
By moving my art from 2D to 3D , I open up the audience for my work .
In the past , my true artwork was only on the cover of the game - inside it was n't necessarily my work .
Now , I have larger audiences through actually representing my characters in my own way in 3D .
With 2D , it 's obviously easier to direct the eye of the viewer because you 're completely controlling what they see .
With 3D , how do you make sure they see what you want in a character ...
Or can you even do that ?
HTK : Once it becomes 3D , it is true that there are limits to the kind of structural exaggeration I like to insert in my characters .
It 's especially hard to visually express what I want when it 's put into gameplay , because it 's not so much about looking cool , it 's about how people can enjoy the game , how they play it .
So what we try to do is simply input camera technology and light technology that can make the structure of the image as beautiful as possible .
What do you feel is the ideal background scenario for your characters ?
Is the background meant to be a main feature , or does it just accent the characters ?
HTK : Regarding backgrounds , I provide the direction of the concept art .
For the most part it 's drawn by our specific background artists .
In this case , more than with characters , I try to leave it to them rather than doing it myself .
But I do try to set the background in relation to the culture and character of each race in the game , and once I provide the direction and the details of how it should be drawn , then the artists who are in charge of the background tend to work on it .
Would you ever be interested in making a game that 's completely in 2D , where you would have complete control over how the characters would look ?
HTK : I 've been thinking of different ways to express my 2D art .
One of them , of course , would be a 2D game .
But I 'm also thinking of what else I can do .
I can't mention anything in detail though .
Right now , the first objective for me is to shape Blade & Soul in my own style .
You have said that these characters are fantasy oriented .
Sometimes these exaggerated , really attractive characters can create an unrealistic expectation for a player when they view reality .
HTK : Exaggeration of certain points is really important , but overall the character must be understandable .
In other words , it must be human .
The person who looks at it must be able to understand it .
In some ways , this is the case with the art style of Japan , where the attractiveness of characters are sometimes symbolized .
Yes , it can often be idealized .
HTK : Yeah .
When people see something , it looks really attractive , but they 're not sure why .
This is because the symbol of attractiveness is hidden within the character .
I do n't want to make that attractiveness as impenetrable as in the Japanese style .
When a person sees a character and thinks it 's attractive , he 'll know why it 's attractive .
It will be right there on the surface .
I think it 's alright as long as it's feasible .
It does n't really have to be able to exist in reality .
But there does need to be a balance in between .
Do you have certain character archetypes that you rely on ?
HTK : I try not to do that because the character becomes symbolized , which is something I 'd rather avoid .
But it would certainly make things easier .
I think the reason is that I 'm not just creating a character when I create these people .
I 'm creating a painting , a piece of digital art .
There are times when we need a lot of flashy characters .
So I can't just work from a template .
You need these characters to have , well , character !
This is really important to the quality of the game overall .
What artists do you personally admire ?
HTK : Too many of them actually .
For example , among painters , Jeffrey Jones , Range Murata , Masamune Shirow ... but actually , the artist who influenced me the most was the illustrator of Lineage 2 , Juno Jeong .
I 've known him for 20 years , since I was in middle school .
His kind of painting and drawing have really influenced me a lot .
We actually have painted together over the years .

OK , it 's clear to me that we 're going to have to work on this mythology a bit because the literal origin story given above does n't take into account the psychic energy of the goat that influenced Terry to select those images .
I 'm sure this group can create a better back - story than " Terry thought they looked funny . "
Ponies are pretty , but goats get the job done .

To meet the Obama administration ’s targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , some researchers say , Americans may have to experience a sobering reality : gas at $ 7 a gallon .
To reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector 14 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 , the cost of driving would simply have to increase , according to a report released Thursday by researchers at Harvard ’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs .
The research also appears in the March edition of the journal Energy Policy .
The 14 percent target was set in the Environmental Protection Agency ’s budget for fiscal 2010 .
In their study , the researchers devised several combinations of steps that United States policymakers might take in trying to address the heat - trapping emissions by the nation ’s transportation sector , which consumes 70 percent of the oil used in the United States .
Most of their models assumed an economy - wide carbon dioxide tax starting at $ 30 a ton in 2010 and escalating to $ 60 a ton in 2030 .
In some cases researchers also factored in tax credits for electric and hybrid vehicles , taxes on fuel or both .
In the modeling , it turned out that issuing tax credits could backfire , while taxes on fuel proved beneficial .
“ Tax credits do n’t address how much people use their cars , ” said Ross Morrow , one of the report ’s authors .
“ In reverse , they can make people drive more . ”
Dr. Morrow , formerly a fellow at the Belfer Center , is a professor of mechanical engineering and economics at Iowa State University
Researchers said that vehicle miles traveled will increase by more than 30 percent between 2010 and 2030 unless policymakers increase fuel taxes .
[ From Andy R. : ] Rush Limbaugh weighed in on this post yesterday , as some may have surmised given the spike in comments , and the tenor of many .
Some important points were raised by his audience , including a listener calling from his car in Nebraska to say how a gas tax would unfairly burden workers in sprawling states with no public transportation options .
I ’ll be posting more from the research team on some of this .
In this two - year - old classified Army Counterintelligence Center report ( hosted on wikileaks.org , where else ? ) , American spooks set out to destroy Wikileaks by intimidating its sources .
They cite as justification for this the fact that Wikileaks has outed American embarrassments and crimes including " US equipment expenditure in Iraq , probable US violations of the Chemical Warfare Convention Treaty in Iraq , the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah and human rights violations at Guantanamo Bay . "
The governments of China , Israel , North Korea , Russia , Thailand , Zimbabwe , and
several other countries have blocked access to Wikileaks.org - type Web sites , claimed they have
the right to investigate and prosecute Wikileaks.org and associated whistleblowers , or insisted
they remove false , sensitive , or classified government information , propaganda , or malicious
content from the Internet .
The governments of China , Israel , and Russia claim the right to
remove objectionable content from , block access to , and investigate crimes related to the posting
of documents or comments to Web sites such as Wikileaks.org .
The governments of these
countries most likely have the technical skills to take such action should they choose to do so
Wikileaks.org uses trust as a center of gravity by assuring insiders , leakers , and
whistleblowers who pass information to Wikileaks.org personnel or who post information to the
Web site that they will remain anonymous .
The identification , exposure , or termination of
employment of or legal actions against current or former insiders , leakers , or whistleblowers
could damage or destroy this center of gravity and deter others from using Wikileaks.org to make
such information public .
All sorts of entertainment media use the concept of secrets to add intrigue and evoke a powerful emotional reaction .
A strong effect of unveiling a secret can be the validation of the observer ’s perceptiveness and reasoning ; a wink wink , nudge nudge for being such a smart cookie .
However , most forms of media tend to be strictly passive .
Aside from the occasional dabbling in interaction , the audience exerts no direct influence over the medium ’s content .
Games — and videogames in particular — are inherently different .
They are interactive and require players , not just observers .
There are plenty of lists online cataloguing the “ best secrets in videogames , ” but before we delve into this discussion , let ’s actually define the term :
secret , n . Something kept hidden from others or known only to oneself or to a few .
Designed to elude observation or detection .
Now let ’s apply this denotation to design in videogames .
By definition , the secret needs to be explicitly known by someone , namely the person (s ) implementing it in the game .
It is also suggested that the implementation should be somewhat veiled and not immediately identifiable by the player .
Since the implementation itself requires time and effort — possibly from various people responsible for design , production , programming , art , audio , QA , etc. — it should not be a wasted effort .
In other words , the player should be able to discover the secret on account of all the work that went into creating it .
Furthermore , to maximize the number of individuals who can access the secret , it can be assumed that it should be intrinsically tied to the default software and hardware and not rely on any arcane knowledge of the product .
Given the above , we can now define the “ videogame secret ” :
videogame secret , n . A hidden part of a videogame purposefully included by its creators with the intention of being discovered by the audience without any aid outside of the game itself .
This is not in any way official , but rather a clarification on my own definition of the concept .
Using it to go forward , we can immediately strike down a bunch of entries in the above “ best secrets in videogames ” lists .
First , let ’s eliminate anything that relies on outside interference .
Mods , Game Genie / Pro-Action Replay / GameShark codes , special controllers and disk / cartridge swapping is out .
As much attention as Hot -Coffee received , Rockstar did not want it exposed to the player .
Well , unless you subscribe to the theory that it was always their intention for the content to get out , but that ’s a whole other can of worms .
Second , glitches do n’t count .
Glitches are unintentional bugs that got past the QA process .
Although certainly fun and interesting in some cases , as with Metroid ’s secret worlds , they are the opposite of deliberately placed secrets .
Third , emergent gameplay is not a secret .
Sure , combos are an integral part of Street Fighter II , but , as the story goes , they were not an intentionally designed mechanism .
Fortuitous or not , emergent gameplay belongs more in the dynamics category than anything else .
Fourth , more often than not , cheat codes are simply debugging aids for the development team .
Sure , the player can still access the ones left in , but most get disabled before the release of the title .
The ones that make it through tend to be a consequence of the developer ’s / publisher ’s quality assurance practices .
If the QA department uses cheat codes to help them do their job , then at the end of the project there might be weariness when it comes to removing them as it might introduce all new bugs .
Now some cheat codes like the Konami Code have become quite famous , but how many of you would ’ve known about them if it was n’t for magazines , cheat books , internet sites and schoolyard gossip ?
It can be a bit of a gray area , but even intentional cheat codes are usually targeted at only the hardcore player .
They tend to rely on communication and knowledge separate from the base product , therefore it could be said that they fall more into the fanservice category .
Oh , and password - restored game states and other rewards doled out directly by the game are not really cheat codes .
At least not in my book .
With that out of the way , let ’s talk about what I consider actual videogame secrets .
There are plenty of famous ones such as Metal Gear Solid ’s battle with Psycho Mantis , Diablo II ’s cow level and the original “ easter - egg ” in Adventure , but I ’d like to discuss three of my favourites ( in no particular order ) .
Reptile in the Original Mortal Kombat
So why was this secret so good ?
A couple of reasons :
The game explicitly dropped clues for the player without disclosing the whole mystery .
This encouraged deductive work and experimentation , and helped to generate even more excitement about the game ( which it certainly was n’t lacking with its digitized graphics and bloody fatalities ) .
It teased the player with the character himself — a green version of two of its most popular cast members : Sub -Zero and Scropion — and the promise of encountering him somewhere in the game .
The player did n’t know anything about Reptile ’s abilities , where the encounter would take place , how it would play out , etc. , letting his imagination fill in the blanks with tantalizing possibilities .
Getting to fight Reptile involved nothing more than using existing game mechanics , and it was not a prerequisite to completing the game or enjoying it on any other level .
The actual Reptile fight took place at the bottom of The Pit , an area that was only briefly shown during another secret of sorts : the stage fatality .
This is significant because it ’sa location that the player only got a glance at , but was never able to explore .
Setting the fight in this area is an excellent example of wish - fulfillment due to the common desire to experience such teased locales first - hand .
Defeating Reptile earned the player not only bragging rights , but also a huge points bonus that would skyrocket him to the top of the high - scores charts .
Too bad he was n’t playable , huh ?
( Incidentally , the honour of being the first secret playable character in a “ vs ” fighting games goes to Akuma . )
Reptile also worked well because everything surrounding him did n’t really require any new resources .
All his art consisted of a simple palette swap .
Likewise , his moveset was just a combination of Sub - Zero ’s and Scropion ’s , with a bit of speed thrown in .
Even his custom stage was already there , just never previously used as the background for an actual fight .
The Inverted Castle in Castlevania : SotN
SotN is filled with all sorts of secrets : random item drops , hidden rooms and passages , artifacts that grant special abilities , etc. , but the inverted castle has to be the most significant of them all .
The idea of flipping a tilemap upside - down is n’t new , but this secret had a lot more going for it :
To gain access to the inverted castle , Alucard had to go through a series of steps culminating in a battle against Richard Belmont , the protagonist of the previous games .
Even without knowing the series ’ history , though , this should seem suspicious .
The game starts off with the player controlling Richard Belmont and squaring off against Dracula , a brief reenactment of the previous entry in the series .
If the game ’s finale turns out to be a fight against Richard , it ’s easy to come to the conclusion that something was overlooked .
After all , Alucard ’s mission was to destroy the ancient vampire , not his friend and ally .
Up until the fight between Alucard and Richard , it is impossible to fill out all of Alucard ’s various spell / morph form / familiar / etc. slots .
This might seem like a fairly insignificant fact , but it ’s a clear indicator that the player has n’t done everything there is to do in the game .
Not even close .
SotN encourages exploration of every nook and cranny , and this should easily result in the player finding two distinct rings .
The rings ’ descriptions read “ Wear … Clock … ” and “ … in… Tower ” respectively .
Unlike many other items in the game , acquiring these rings is also accompanied by story events in which Maria , one of game ’s pivotal characters , informs Alucard ’s of Richard ’s mysterious disappearance .
The Clock Tower is located right in the middle of the castle , and is a unique area not duplicated anywhere else in the game .
Adding to its significance is the fact that it is the only place in SotN where background elements automatically move just a single time .
What I mean by this is that whenever Alucard enters the Clock Tower , slaps of concrete magically slide in to close off possible paths of exploration .
This happens every time the area is visited , and although it relates to another secret in the game , it helps to make the room feel that much more important .
Bringing and equipping both rings ( most players seem to miss that second part ) to the Clock Tower opens up a new passage .
In this secret area , Maria informs the player that Richard is being controlled by Shaft , another old villain in the series .
In order to defeat Shaft and save Richard , she gives the player a pair of Holy Glasses that , when equipped , allow Alucard to see and attack a green orb floating above his friend ’s head .
Destroying Shaft ’s mind - controlling orb unlocks the passageway to the inverted castle where lots of new enemies , bosses , items and abilities await Alucard , almost doubling the content of the game .
As far as rewards for discovering secrets go , nothing has topped SotN ’s enormous wealth of content in its wholly optional inverted castle .
The First Warp Zone in Super Mario Bros .
Quite possibly the most recognizable videogame secret is the hidden warp zone at the end of level 1 - 2 in SMB .
Now Super Mario Bros. was a somewhat surreal game , but much of that was due to the kind of reactions it tried to evoke from the player .
It ’s a topic that deserves its own article , so for now I ’ll just cover how it made the warp zone so great :
In various parts of the first stage , the player can reach — and “ break through ” — the ceiling of the level .
This teaches him that , unlike the pits , there ’s no penalty for going outside the top part of the map .
In level 1 - 2 , there are numerous locations where the player ( provided he ’s in the powered - up Mario state , which is always in his best interest ) can smash through the brick ceiling .
This ensures that the player thinks of it as a barrier he can breach .
Furthermore , if the player experiments a bit , he can actually get over and on top of it where he can freely maneuver .
The level ends with a pit area filled with an endless stream of upwards - moving platforms .
The platforms overlook the level ’s exit and a continuation of the brick ceiling .
Based on the player ’s experience , he knows he can make the jump from the platform to the top of the ceiling provided there ’s no invisible wall blocking him .
Furthermore , if he misses the jump , it ’s apparent that he ’ll land in a safe place as the ceiling does n’t extend as far toward the platforms as the ground area .
Upon making the jump and — while overlapping the HUD — running past the exit pipe , the player finds himself in the warp zone .
This area allows him to enter any one of the three pipes leading to their corresponding worlds , effectively allowing him to skip ahead in the game .
Not only was this secret memorable as it allowed the player to finally breach the end - level area ( from what I recall , jumping over the flag - pole was nigh - impossible as it was an unintended bug ) , but it also rewarded him with the ability to fast - forward through the game .
This was a feature all the more significant as SMB did not contain a password or save system allowing similar functionality .
What ’s really interesting here is that all of these secrets have a few things in common :
They ’re not explicitly revealed to the player , but they ’re not overly obfuscated either .
All the hints required to discover the secrets are also presented to the player in the games themselves .
The hints — and the promise of potential secrets — encourage the player to experiment .
Through deduction and some general “ messing around , ” the player can discover the secrets by himself using gameplay mechanics that are already familiar to him .
The secrets are wholly optional .
One might make a case that SotN ’s “ true ” ending cannot be reached without exploring the inverted castle , but an ending still exists regardless of whether Richard Belmont is saved or defeated .
The secrets are rare , and their sparing use only adds to their significance .
All the secrets present a notable reward for their discovery , helping to give the player a great sense of accomplishment once they are unveiled .
Now these points are n’t golden rules — there are , for example , good secrets in videogames that are repeated over and over again — but they all help to make the above entries stand out .
Secrets themselves are not required to create great games either ; a wholly static , linear and transparent experience can still be quite enjoyable .
Secrets can , however , add that extra bit of magic .
By allowing the player to explore the game ( no matter how much actual exploration can take place ) , we imbue it with a sense of wonder and adventure .
This helps to highlight the interactive aspect of videogames .
It gives the player the choice to see what ’s around the corner — we just have to make it something good .

The military junta that ousted Niger 's president raised transparency expectations and sent stocks sliding over the weekend with the announcement that it would audit all uranium and gold contracts .
The announcement came just days after a coalition of pressure groups petitioned the junta to renegotiate mining contracts awarded under ousted President Mamadou Tandja .
The world ’s third - largest uranium deposit lies in northern Niger , the poorest zone in what the UN calls the world ’s poorest country .
With more governments backing clean , uranium - fueled nuclear energy to replace coal - burning power , foreign investors from China , Australia , South Africa , America , and Canada have flocked to the landlocked Saharan state .
Niger 's authorities have awarded at least 50 uranium exploration permits in the two years since government officials busted a 40 - year mining monopoly held by France ’s Areva SA , according to mining officials .
But government watchdogs say these opaque contracts illegally enriched Mr. Tandja and his family , even while food shortages plagued the Saharan state .
Until recently , little has been known about expanded uranium prospecting in northern Niger , which has become a flashpoint between insurgent Tuaregs and the southern - based government over mining rights .
In the chaos surrounding the 2007 armed Tuareg rebellion , Tandja ’s administration implemented a media blackout in the northern zone , banning foreign journalists , censoring local reporting on uranium and the northern rebellion , and even suspending Radio France Internationale broadcasts for one month on accusations of sympathizing with rebels .
As Tandja ’s ouster in February allows light to be shed on the cloistered northern region , new details of corruption and devastation inflicted on mainly Tuareg civilian populations are emerging .
Land mines and radioactive contamination
The seeding of land mines throughout the Air Mountains – which the armed forces and rebels on each other – has rendered villages such as Iferouane and Elmeki uninhabitable .
The entire seminomadic population of Elmeki ( an estimated 600 - 1,000 families ) was forced to flee to Agadez , according to Igor Rugengeka , a Burundian coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Agadez .
A once - thriving tourism industry that sustained local businesses and artisans is now decimated in the Saharan caravan capital Agadez , reduced to little more than a stopover for African migrants and internal refugees heading north toward Libya and , for a lucky few , Europe .
On average , 2,000 refugees a month pass through Agadez , driving up food prices and unemployment , according to Mr. Rugengeka .
Meanwhile , scientists documented dangerous levels of radioactive contamination still present in water and dirt in a survey of uranium mining villages Arlit and Akokan conducted by Greenpeace International and France ’s CRIIRAD , an independent watchdog group .
A full report of findings is due later this month .
Seeking benefits for local populations
Disputes over uranium have fanned tensions between Tuareg rebels and authorities since the early 1990s .
Nevertheless , hopes are now running high that the ouster of Tandja will pave the way for a binding resolution , ideally one that will reinvest uranium profits into northern economic development .
Tuareg rebel leaders are at present gathered in the capital Niamey , where splintered rebel factions have reunited for negotiations with the junta , hoping to hammer out a road map to accelerate the peace process , according to rebel chief Aghaly ag Alembo .
“ We hope to implicate all of the people of the region in the economic spin - off of mining in the north , and that there will be a benefit as well for the nomadic populations in these regions , ” Alembo said by phone from the capital .
“ Peace would not have lasted with the former regime , ” Ahmed Akoli , political secretary of the Niger Movement for Justice ( MNJ ) , said by phone from Paris .
The stakes are high , according to Akoli , who said 6,000 rebels remain armed pending a written resolution .
A sensationalized television news report about a Tennessee Muslim community may have spurred vandalism on a Nashville mosque .
Middle Tennessee ’s WTVF Channel 5 this week ran a heavily hyped two - part series : “ Inside Islamville : Is a Local Muslim Community Tied to Terrorism ? ”
Go here and here to see the series .
Islamville is the nickname for a private community ( or “ compound , ” as reporter Nick Beres described in the report ) that has existed near Dover , Tennessee since the early 1980s .
The reason for the series is a video called Homegrown Jihad , made by PRB Films and the Christian Action Network , which accuses the community of being one of 35 terrorist training grounds in the country .
Beres bases his entire report on the unfounded accusations raised in the video .
Well , that and the fact that a couple local people say that Islamville residents keep to themselves , which they find suspicous .
The reporter also went to visit the place with a local sheriff .
The sheriff , the lone voice of reason , says he has never had a problem with the community , nor has he received any complaints .
That ’s it .
No FBI reports , no government FOIAs .
Just a whole lot of B - roll featuring Arabic - looking people blowing up buildings and American soldiers shooting back as Beres narrates : “ The war to seek out and destroy terrorists is never ending .
That means overseas and , disturbingly enough , also here on American soil .
The domestic terrorist threat is real and some believe it ’s nurtured in remote areas of this country , including middle Tennessee . ”
The news piece also includes a clip from Homegrown Jihad , which makes the unchallenged assertion : “ Overwhelmingly , the vast majority of Muslim organizations inside the United States are affiliated with terrorist groups overseas . ”
After teasing the results of his investigation throughout the story , Beres concludes at the end that he saw no evidence that Islamville was a terrorist training camp , nor did he see any “ anti- government signs or flag desecration .
What ’s really troublesome is that the reporter never bothered to provide any sort of context about whether Christian Action Network ( CAN ) is a credible source .
If he did , he might have mentioned that in addition to a vehement anti-Muslim crusade , CAN also promotes an extremist anti-gay agenda and once ran a commercial that said , “ There are rumors that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian . ”
Following the series this week , vandals spray - painted a Nashville mosque and youth center unconnected to the Islamville community .
According to the Nashville Scene blog :
“ Muslims Go Home ” and a Crusade - style cross were scrawled across the front of Al - Farooq Islamic Center on Nolensville Road , says Salaad Nur , a spokesman .
He says the mosque , which primarily serves members of the Somali community , has contacted the police and the FBI .
“ They also left a letter at the youth center that says Muslims are friends of Satan and we are here to destroy the United States and to destroy Israel and things of that nature , ” he says .
“ We ’re a little bit shaken up .
I hope this is just a scare and things do n’t get any worse than this .
“ It ’s unexpected , ” he adds .
“ The only thing I can think of is the sensationalized reporting [ by Channel 5 ] over Sunday and Monday .
That ’s the only thing I can think of .
Even after 9/11 we have never had any vandalism . ”
When reporting like that of Channel leads to threats and vandalizing , as it appears this one may have , it becomes a bigger problem than just sensationalistic , phony “ controversies . ”
It really should n’t have to be said , but it ’s not a reporter ’s job to further the hate propaganda of an extremist organization in the name of “ fair - and - balanced ” journalism .
Try to imagine for a moment the outcry if a news team reported on an “ alleged ” terrorist training camp in some rural white community .
The reporter barges into a church service with a camera and then intersperses the piece with video of the Oklahoma City bombing .
Unfortunately , that ’s what we ’re dealing with here .

Now you can extend that truism about oil and water to water and itself .
Water and water do n't always mix , either .
The textbooks say that water readily comes together with other water , open arms of hydrogen clasping oxygen attached to other OH molecules .
This is the very definition of " wetness . "
But scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have observed a first : a single layer of water - - ice grown on a platinum wafer -- that gives the cold shoulder to subsequent layers of ice that come into contact with it .
" Water - surface interactions are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in many technological applications such as catalysis and corrosion , " said Greg Kimmel , staff scientist at the Department of Energy lab and lead author of a paper in the current issue ( Oct. 15 advance online edition ) of Physical Review Letters .
" It was assumed that one end of the water molecule would bind to metal , and at the other end would be these nice hydrogen attachment points for the atoms in next layer of water . "
A theory out of Cambridge University last year suggested that these attachment points , or " dangling OH's , " did not exist , that instead of dangling , the OH 's were drawn by the geometry of hexagonal noble - metal surfaces and clung to that .
Kimmel and his co-authors , working at the PNNL - based W.R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory , tested the theory with a technique called rare gas physisorption that enlists krypton to probe metal surfaces and water layers on those surfaces .
They found that the first single layer of water , or monolayer , wetted the platinum surface as they had expected but " that subsequent layers did not wet the first layer , " Kimmel said .
" In other words , the first layer of water is hydrophobic . "
The results jibe with an earlier Stanford University study that used X - ray adsorption to show that rather than being fixed pointing outward in the dangling position , wet and ready to receive the next water layer , the arms of a water monolayer on a metal surface are double - jointed .
They swivel back toward the surface of the metal to find a place to bind .
To the water molecules approaching this bent - over - backward surface , the layer has all the attractiveness of a freshly waxed car 's hood .
The second layer beads up , but that 's not all : Additional water 's attraction to that first hydrophobic water monolayer is so weak that 50 or more ice - crystal layers can be piled atop the first until all the so - called non-wetting portions are covered -- akin to " the coalescence of water drops on a waxed car in a torrential downpour , " said Bruce Kay , PNNL laboratory fellow and co-author with Kimmel and PNNL colleagues Nick Petrik and Zdenek Dohnálek .
Kimmel said that self - loathing water on metal is more than a curiosity and will come as a surprise to many in the field who assumed that water films uniformly cover surfaces .
Hundreds of experiments have been done on thin water films grown on metal surfaces to learn such things as how these films affect molecules in which they come into contact and what role heat , light and high - energy radiation play in such interactions .
