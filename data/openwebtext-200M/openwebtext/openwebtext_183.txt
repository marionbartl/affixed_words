Will smaller companies stand a better chance of survival during the coming financial turmoil ?
( Back to list )
Posted by Peter Blue on 2007 - Sep - 19 15:28
It cant have escaped anyone 's attention that things are afoot in the financial world , the sub - prime lending crises , Northern Rock 's bank run , Oil prices breaking through the $ 80 per barrel for the first time in 20 + years , Mortgage lenders imploding and stock market jitters .
I expect everyone will have their take on the reasons for all the current problems and I expect most of it will boil down to greed , stupidity , dishonesty and lack of confidence .
Here are some more reasons why I think small , local companies ( " Dingoes " ) will have a better chance of survival than larger companies .
Trust
When everyone is under extreme financial pressure who are you going to trust ?
the small , local and reachable businessman or the huge corporation hiding behind an army of lawyers and call center drones ?

Localisation
When oil reaches $ 100 / barrel ( 2008 ~ 2009 ) who will have to raise prices the most ?
the local shops who can get their products easily from local suppliers / farms or the huge global corporation who has to transport their products from half way around the world ?

Flexibility
If market conditions change , who can adapt the fastest ?
I will add more to this list as they occur to me or you can add yours below .
In the meantime the Cluetrain Manifesto ( The End of Business as Usual ) might give you some interesting ideas .
Here is a small snippet :-
A powerful global conversation has begun .
Through the Internet , people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed .
As a direct result , markets are getting smarter and getting smarter faster than most companies .
These markets are conversations .
Their members communicate in language that is natural , open , honest , direct , funny and often shocking .
Whether explaining or complaining , joking or serious , the human voice is unmistakably genuine .
It ca n't be faked .
Most corporations , on the other hand , only know how to talk in the soothing , humorless monotone of the mission statement , marketing brochure , and your - call - is - important - to - us busy signal .
Same old tone , same old lies .
No wonder networked markets have no respect for companies unable or unwilling to speak as they do .
But learning to speak in a human voice is not some trick , nor will corporations convince us they are human with lip service about " listening to customers . "
They will only sound human when they empower real human beings to speak on their behalf .
While many such people already work for companies today , most companies ignore their ability to deliver genuine knowledge , opting instead to crank out sterile happytalk that insults the intelligence of markets literally too smart to buy it .
However , employees are getting hyperlinked even as markets are .
Companies need to listen carefully to both .
Mostly , they need to get out of the way so intranetworked employees can converse directly with internetworked markets .
Corporate firewalls have kept smart employees in and smart markets out .
It 's going to cause real pain to tear those walls down .
But the result will be a new kind of conversation .
And it will be the most exciting conversation business has ever engaged in .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Altering a gene in the brain of female worms changed their sexual orientation , researchers said on Thursday , making female worms attracted to other females .

Altering a gene in the brain of female worms changed their sexual orientation , researchers said on Thursday , making female worms attracted to other females .
REUTERS / Jamie White / University of Utah / Handout
The study reinforces the notion that sexual orientation is hard - wired in the brain , said Erik Jorgensen , scientific director of the Brain Institute at the University of Utah .
“ They look like girls , but act and think like boys , ” Utah researcher Jamie White , who worked on the study published in the journal Current Biology , said in a statement .
Researchers in Jorgensen ’s lab switched on a gene in female worms that makes the body develop male structures , but they only activated the gene in the brain .
As a result , the female worms still had female bodies , but they behaved like males .
“ It suggests sexual behavior is encoded in our genes ” and not caused by extra nerve cells specific to males or females , Jorgensen said in a telephone interview .
Animals such as nematodes , fruit flies and mice share many of the same genes as humans and are often used as models to understand human genetics .
But Jorgensen said the study is not likely to resolve the burning question about the genesis of sexual orientation in humans .
“ A human ’s brain is much more complex than a worm ’s brain , ” he said .
Many scientists think a host of factors such as genetics , hormones and environment may play a role in determining sexual orientation in humans , but this has not been proven .
Jorgensen said the study is interesting because it suggests rather than being caused by extra , sex - specific nerve cells , attraction behaviors are part of the same brain circuit .
The finding was part of a study looking at areas in the worms ’ brains involved in sexual attraction .
LIVE IN DIRT , EAT GERMS
Nematodes , or C. elegans , are tiny worms about one millimeter long that live in the dirt , chomping bacteria .
They have no eyes and rely on smell for navigation and propagation .
There are few males , only one in 500 , so most of these female nematodes are hermaphrodites , meaning they have both male and female sexual organs .
This gives the female worms the ability to fertilize their own eggs and produce offspring in the absence of a male .
“ For the most part they are females , ” Jorgensen said .
“ It ’s really hard to tell that they are hermaphrodites , but they do make these few sperm . ”
When they do mate with males , female worms produce 1,200 progeny , compared with just 200 when they produce their own sperm .
The researchers were trying to understand the underpinnings of sexual attraction in the male nematodes .
They reasoned it could arise from four extra smell - related nerve cells found only in male worm brains , from four core nerves found in both males and females or from a mix of both .
When they systematically neutralized the male - only neurons , mature male worms still responded to the females .
The findings imply nerve cells common to both male and female worms are central to sexual attraction and sexual orientation .
“ They have genes for both male behavior and female behavior in them , ” Jorgensen said .
“ It suggests the brain determines behavior . ”
The study expands on prior studies suggesting a genetic component to sexual orientation .
“ This is one more observation .
We ’ve seen this in flies and in mice , ” he said .
“ The difference is we know what cells are involved . ”
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation .

UPDATE : Scroll Down for More Minot Air Force Base Deaths
– – – – –
Remember the one about the B - 52 bomber that , according to legend , had six nuclear weapons loaded onto it by accident , which , of course , could not have happened — by accident — for a dozen different reasons , or more .
Airman 1st Class Todd Blue was assigned to the unit that provides security for that bomber wing at Minot Air Force base .
He died while on leave in Virginia .
No further details have been released .
Coincidence ?
Was he on duty when those nuclear weapons were loaded onto the B - 52 , “ by accident ” ?
If anyone has any further information on this , please let me know .
I expected to see many more deaths of Minot and Barksdale Air Force personnel in the wake of this incident .
Have I missed any others ?
Via : KXMC :
Authorities are investigating the death of a Minot Air Force Base airman who died while on leave in Virginia .
Base officials say 20 - year - old Airman 1st Class Todd Blue died Monday while visiting family members in Wytheville , Virginia .

U.S. Air Force General , Thomas L. Tinsley , Dead from Gunshot Wound to Chest
Via : AP :
The officer who commands an air force wing in Alaska has died of a gunshot wound that likely was self - inflicted , authorities said Monday .
Brig .
Gen. Thomas L. Tinsley suffered a gunshot wound to his chest late Sunday night and was pronounced dead within a half hour , said Col. Richard Walberg , who assumed command at Elmendorf Air Force Base after Tinsley ’s death .
The weapon was likely a handgun , Walberg said .
Medical responders who rushed to Tinsley ’s home on base were unable to save him .
Tinsley ’s wife and college - age daughter were home at the time .
Tinsley was named base commander in May 2007 .
He had served as an F - 15 instructor pilot , F - 15C test pilot , wing weapons officer , exchange officer and instructor with the Royal Australian Air Force .
His previous 22 - month assignment was executive officer to the Air Force chief of staff , Gen. T. Michael “ Buzz ” Mosely , who resigned in June under pressure in an agency shake - up .
Mosely , the Air Force military chief , and Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne , the agency ’s civilian head , were held accountable for failing to fully correct an erosion of nuclear - related performance standards .
One concern was a cross-country flight in August of a B - 52 carrying armed nuclear weapons .
Walberg said Tinsley was not under investigation or undue stress .
“ As far as stress , sir , this job , by nature of being an Air Force officer in a nation at war , is stressful , ” he said .
“ Undue stress , no . ”
Representatives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology will do a report and declare whether Tinsley ’s cause of death was suicide , Walberg said .
Such reports take about 30 days .

No matter what they say , experts tell it like it is .
One of the things you ’ll hear them saying is that if you want a puppy or two for your home you ’d best be prepared to roll your sleeves up for a little hard work .
Some say that rearing small , curious and playful little puppies , always craving for attention , is much harder than bringing up kids .
Perhaps then , becoming a pet mom or dad is not for them .
The thing is , no matter how hard you try , there ’s just no getting around the mess they make at that young age .
Those who can afford the service are making use of exceptional canine breeders so that they can come as close as possible to having the perfect canine specimen under their roof .
Those who just cannot manage or stand the rate at which dogs in general molt , might be interested in paying a visit to the non-shedding puppies castle rock co kennels .
Non-shedding puppies ?
Did someone just mention non-shedding puppies ?
And immediately everyone ’s ears perked up and , given that they ’re probably sitting in front of their PCs right now or poring over their mobiles , their eyes lit up too .
This sounds interesting .
Non-shedding puppies .
Folks , there is just no easy way to say this .
These puppies have , without a doubt , been genetically modified .
It ’s like a canine factory that is generating supreme , near - perfect breeds .
But there it is ; near to perfect .
Not perfect .
If you ’re going to rear a young pup into a handsome and well - mannered and well - behaved man of the yard , you ’re still going to have your work cut out for you .
You need to be attached to the dog , joined to the hip almost .
But look on the bright side .
There ’s a good reason why he ’s been called man ’s best friend .
This brain map shows differences in reactions to erotic and neutral visual materials .
Red zones represent the largest differences measured in the study , suggesting that circuits in the frontal parts of the brain are particularly sensitive to erotic content and the fastest to detect the difference .
Erotic images elicit faster and stronger electrical responses in a woman 's brain than other images ranging from pleasant to disturbing .
The finding might not sound surprising , but researches did not expect responses to erotic images to emerge so quickly , apparently involving different circuits than the processing of other images .
" That surprised us , " said study leader Andrey Anokhin of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
" We believed both pleasant and disturbing images would evoke a rapid response , but erotic scenes always elicited the strongest response . "
The test involved 264 women who were shown 55 images of water skiers , snarling dogs , partially clad couples in sensual poses , and other scenes .
Electrodes on the subjects ' scalps measured brain activity .
The signals begin firing long before a subject was conscious of what she was seeing , the researchers reported recently in the journal Brain Research .
Erotic images elicited neuron firing within 160 milliseconds — about 20 percent faster than occurred with any of the other pictures .
The stimulation then branched out to different brain regions for erotic images compared to the others .
Previous research indicated men are more aroused by erotic images than women , so Anokhin and his colleagues expected women to respond with lower levels of brain activity compared to men .
" But that was not the case , " Anokhin said .
" Women have responses as strong as those seen in men . "
The monitoring method , called electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , was used because it could distinguish tiny time differences .
But it can't pinpoint specific brain locations where the activity occurs .
Such accuracy would require similar studies using MRI and PET scans .
The next question on Anokhin 's mind :
Whether or not the human prefrontal cortex contains special neurons tuned for sex .

A Houston oil trader pleaded guilty yesterday in New York to federal fraud charges in connection with illegal profits and kickbacks involving the United Nations oil - for - food program in Iraq during Saddam Hussein ’s rule .
The trader , David B. Chalmers Jr. , admitted that he and two companies he ran , Bayoil USA and Bayoil Supply and Trading , made millions of dollars in kickbacks to the Iraqi government  as well as huge profits  while trading oil under the $ 65 billion aid program .
In April 2005 , Bayoil USA became the first American company to be indicted in the wide - ranging criminal investigation of the program , which was established by the United Nations in 1995 to ease some aspects of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990 .
Under it , Mr. Hussein ’s government could use the money from limited oil sales to buy supplies like food and medicine .
The authorities said Bayoil and Mr. Chalmers not only made illegal payments to get Iraqi oil but also conspired to artificially lower its price , thus depriving the Iraqis of money for items they sorely needed .
A man described by the authorities as an associate of Bayoil , Ludmil Dionissiev , a Bulgarian oil trader living in Houston , also pleaded guilty yesterday to charges of fraud and conspiracy in the case .
Some protesters want the entire law to be revoked
He said it would be replaced by other measures to tackle youth unemployment .
Millions of students and union members have taken to the streets over the last month in protest against the law , which made it easier to fire young workers .
Union and student leaders said it was a " great victory " but it is not clear if protests set for Tuesday are still on .
The law introduced a new work contract , known as the First Employment Contract or CPE for under -26s .
FIRST JOB CONTRACT Contrat Premiere Embauche ( CPE ) : A new work contract for under - 26s allowing a two - year trial period
In that period , employers can end a contract without explanation After two years , the CPE reverts to a standard full - time contract Became law on 2 April
Q&A : French labour law row
It was to allow a two - year trial period , during which employers could end a contract without explanation .
The plan to replace the CPE was announced after a meeting between the president , Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and other senior ministers on Monday .
The new package of measures includes offering state support for employers hiring young people who face the most difficulties in gaining access to the labour market .
It was being submitted to parliament on Monday and is expected to be voted on in the next few days .
' Dramatic situation '
Speaking in a live television address , Mr de Villepin said the president had accepted his proposed changes .
Mr de Villepin has seen his popularity fall during the crisis
The prime minister said he was convinced that the only way of addressing joblessness in France was a better balance between flexibility for employers and security for employees .
" For some time the action of the government had been guided by one objective , to provide thousands of young people from our society with opportunities for jobs , " he said .
" I wanted to act very quickly because the dramatic situation and the despair of a number of young people warranted it .
" This was not understood by everyone , I 'm sorry to say , " said Mr de Villepin , who saw his poll ratings decline during the two - month crisis .
The BBC's Alasdair Sandford in Paris says it is a significant climbdown for the French government and is particularly humiliating for Mr de Villepin who had staked much of his personal credibility on the measure .
Demands
Union leaders had given the government until Easter weekend to withdraw the law or face a repeat of the recent general strikes .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The government has agreed that no jobs and state support are what France wants for its youth - so this was all a waste of time

Student leader Julie Coudry called for protesters to lift blockades at dozens of universities so students could prepare for their end - of - year exams .
" The CPE is dead , the CPE is well and truly finished , " she said .
But some students appeared unwilling to abandon their protest .
Many had wanted the entire law to be revoked , not just the article introducing the employment contract .
" Our demands have not really been met , " Lise Prunier , a student at the University of Paris - Jussieu told the Associated Press .
NBC wants the federal government to believe that peer - to - peer file - swapping hurts ... corn farmers ?
That 's one of the claims made in NBC 's controversial FCC filing , which also asks the government to require that Internet providers use mandatory content filters .
" In the absence of movie piracy , video retailers would sell and rent more titles , " says the filing .
" Movie theaters would sell more tickets and popcorn .
Corn growers would earn greater profits and buy more farm equipment . "
Everyone wins !
NBC 's filing received a beatdown this week from advocacy groups like the EFF , Free Press , Public Knowledge , the US Public Interest Research Group , and the New America Foundation , which together submitted a " reply comment " of their own .
Although the groups had submitted broader position papers over the course of the FCC 's network neutrality comment period , this later reply has only a single objective : point out the flaws in NBC 's dangerous line of argument .
The claim that content filtering can boost the revenue of corn farmers ( which is already , thanks to ethanol , higher than the average American income ) gets a footnote of its own in the new filing : " One could as easily argue , " write the authors , " that the money consumers saved by not buying movie tickets they instead use to eat out in restaurants , thus helping farmers , restaurant owners , the automobile industry , and parking valets . "
But the bigger issue here is that NBC wants the FCC to require ISPs to filter content .
How this would work , exactly , is not explained , and as the public interest groups point out in their filing , " nearly any Internet protocol can be used to illegally transfer copyrighted materials — instant messaging , the Web , e-mail , and many other protocols are capable of being used for this purpose . "
The groups also argue that such filters ( assuming that they work well , and this is a major assumption ) would hinder fair use and would basically put the FCC in charge of setting Internet technology policy .
After the agency was smacked down by the courts for exceeding its authority when it came to the broadcast flag , FCC officials are probably not in the mood to tackle such a controversial new policy .
One of the most important points made in the reply concerns NBC 's charge that network neutrality ( which this is all about ) would prevent most " network management " tools from being used .
Packet shaping , prioritization , deep packet inspection , bandwidth throttling — NBC argues that all of these tools would become illegal .
This is a crucial question , since many of these management tools serve a useful purpose ; does anyone not want VoIP traffic to be moved through network with less latency than , say , a P2P download ?
The advocacy groups point out to the FCC that " non-discriminatory traffic shaping " would not violate their view of network neutrality .
This means that protocols like VoIP could be prioritized , so long as that prioritization extended to all VoIP calls , from all users and all operators .
Degrading or blocking applications like P2P would still be verboten , though .
Instead of seeking to get the government into the business of mandating ISP filtering technology , the advocacy groups argue that " companies need to adapt to technological progress , not devote their energies to stopping it . "
NBC has actually done a decent job of that , putting many of its shows on the web and offering hits like The Office on iTunes .
But at least one part of the company is calling for heavy federal involvement in the Internet .
Sure , this is special interest politicking ( for all NBC 's talk of corn farmers , this is about its own revenues ) , but it looks like NBC is serious about this idea .
Four weeks ago at a tech conference , GE exec Bob Wright took the stage to talk up Rick Cotton , the man who wrote the NBC filing , and to call again for better filtering tools ( GE owns NBC ) .
Expect the tough talk to continue from both sides in the run-up to the FCC 's own decision on network neutrality .
V wie Verschwörungstheorie
Im Internet kursiert derzeit eine Zukunftsvision , bei der Google spätestens 2015 den Konkurrenten Microsoft als Bösewicht abgelöst – und zusammen mit Amazon eine totalitäre Informationsdiktatur installiert haben wird , gegen die herkömmliche Medien und Menschen machtlos sind : „ Epic 2015 “
von ROBIN SLOAN und MATT THOMPSON
Es war die beste Zeit und zugleich die schlimmste .
Im Jahr 2015 haben die Menschen Zugang zu einem früher nie für möglich gehaltenen Umfang an Informationen .
Jeder trägt irgendwie dazu bei , eine lebendige Medienlandschaft zu kreieren .
Die herkömmliche Presse jedoch existiert nicht mehr .
Das Glück der vierten Gewalt ist verblasst .
Nachrichtenmedien sind nur noch ein Nachgedanke – einsames Überbleibsel einer nicht allzu fernen Vergangenheit .
Der Weg ins Jahr 2015 begann im späten 20 .
Jahrhundert .
1989 erfindet Tim Berners Lee , ein Computerwissenschaftler am CERN - Labor für Teilchenphysik in der Schweiz , das World Wide Web .
1994 wird Amazon.com gegründet .
Der junge Schöpfer träumt von einem Geschäft , das alles verkauft .
Das Modell Amazon , das bald Standard für Internetverkäufe wird , gründet auf automatisierte , personalisierte Empfehlungen : ein Laden , der Vorschläge machen kann .
1998 starten zwei Programmierer aus Stanford Google .
Ihr Algorhythmus ist ein Widerhall der Amazon - Logik .
Links werden als Empfehlungen behandelt und speisen auf dieser Grundlage die schnellste und effektivste Suchmaschine der Welt .
1999 enthüllt ein Dotcom - Unternehmen namens Pyra Labs Blogger ein persönliches Publishing - Tool .
Friendster taucht im Jahr 2002 auf .
Hunderttausende von jungen Leuten stürmen los und bevölkern es mit einem unglaublich detaillierten Verzeichnis ihres Lebens , ihrer Interessen und ihrer sozialen Bindungen .
Ebenfalls 2002 startet Google Google News , ein Portal mit Schlagzeilen und Links zu den aktuellsten Storys .
Die journalistische
Welt schreit auf : Google News wird einzig von Computern aufbereitet .
2003 kauft Google Blogger .
2004 wird als das Jahr in die Geschichte eingehen , in dem alles begann .
Die Zeitschrift Reason schickt ihren Abonnenten eine Ausgabe , auf deren Titelseite sich ein Satellitenbild ihrer Häuser und in deren Inhalt sich maßgeschneiderte Informationen befinden .
Google enthüllt GMail samt einem Gigabyte freiem Speicher für jeden Nutzer .
Microsoft startet Newsbot , einen kollaborativen Nachrichtenfilter .
Google kauft Picassa , ein Tool zum Verwalten von Bildern .
Amazon startet A9 , eine Suchmaschine auf der Grundlage der Google - Technologie , die ebenfalls das Amazon - Markenzeichen , die Empfehlungen , umfasst .
Dann , im August , geht Google an die Börse .
Im neuen Kapital schwimmend erwirbt Google Keyhole , eine Firma , die die Erde kartografiert und ins Netz stellt .
Google beginnt zudem , die Bibliotheken dieser
Welt zu erschließen und zu digitalisieren .
Der iPod von Apple regt das Podcasting an , das Zeitalter des persönlichen Radios beginnt .
Wir alle können unsere eigenen Gedanken , unsere eigene Musik gegenseitig direkt an die Abspielgeräte senden .
2005 kauft Microsoft Friendster als Antwort auf die nächsten Schritte von Google .
Apple bringt den WiFi - Pod heraus , einen tragbaren Media - Player mit integrierter Kamera , der Podcasts und Bilder unterwegs senden und empfangen kann .
2006 kombiniert Google all seine Dienste zum Google Grid , einer universellen Plattform , die eine unbegrenzte Menge an Speicherplatz und Bandbreite zur gemeinsamen Nutzung von Medien aller Art bereitstellt .
Jeder Anwender kann seinen Content sicher auf dem Google Grid speichern oder ihn veröffentlichen .
Er wählt seinen eigenen Grad an Privatsphäre .
Nie war es einfacher , sein Leben zu einem Teil der Medienlandschaft zu machen .
2007 antwortet Microsoft auf die wachsende Herausforderung von Google mit Newsbotster , einem sozialen Netzwerk für News und einer Plattform für gemeinschaftlichen Journalismus .
Newsbotster klassifiziert und sortiert Nachrichten auf der Grundlage dessen , was Freunde und Kollegen lesen und anschauen .
Es erlaubt jedem , das Gelesene zu kommentieren .
2008 kommt es zum Bündnis , das Microsoft herausfordert .
Google und Amazon schließen sich zusammen und bilden Googlezon .
Google stellt das Google Grid und die beispiellose Suchtechnologie zur Verfügung .
Amazon liefert die Empfehlungsmaschine und seine enorme kommerzielle Infrastruktur .
Zusammen nutzen sie ihr detailliertes Wissen über das jeweilige soziale Geflecht , die Demografie und die Kauf - und Lesegewohnheiten zur totalen Anpassung des Contents und der Werbung an die Kundenwünsche .
In diesem Jahr wird die New York Times Online nur noch kostenpflichtig zu abonnieren sein – jedoch bleibt der Content Stream offen für die stets registrierenden Rechner von Googlezon .
Die Nachrichtenkriege des Jahres 2010 fallen durch die Tatsache auf , dass keine echten Nachrichtenmedien teilnehmen .
Googlezon und Microsoft bekämpfen sich durch das wöchentliche Ausbauen ihrer Dienste .
Googlezon stellt Microsoft schließlich mit einem Feature , dem der Software - Riese nichts entgegensetzen kann .
Mit neuen Algorhythmen durchsuchen Googlezons Rechner Geschichten nach Namen , Orten , Bildern und anderem .
Sie isolieren Fakten aus Zitaten und verwandeln Statistiken in flexible Gleichungen .
Googlezon sortiert , berechnet und kombiniert diese Bruchstücke dann neu mit unseren Informationen , Blog - Einträgen , Fotos , unseren Einkäufen und unserem Leben .
Nachrichteninhalte sind umfassender als jemals zuvor .
2011 erwacht die schlafende vierte Gewalt , um ein erstes und letztes Mal aufzubegehren .
Die New York Times verklagt Googlezon mit der Begründung , Googlezons Tatsachen isolierende Robots seien eine Verletzung des Urheberrechts .
Der Fall kommt bis vor das oberste Gericht , das am 4 .
August 2011 zugunsten von Googlezon entscheidet .
Am Sonntag , den 9 .
März 2014 , bringt Google Epic heraus .
Das Evolving Personalized Information Construct ist ein System , durch das unsere ausufernde , chaotische Medienlandschaft gefiltert , geordnet und dem Nutzer geliefert wird .
Jeder trägt bei , und viele werden jetzt auch bezahlt , proportional zur Popularität ihrer Beiträge – ein kleiner Teil nur der immensen Werbeeinnahmen von Googlezon .
Epic stellt für jeden ein Content - Paket zusammen , das seine Vorlieben , seine Konsumgewohnheiten , seine Interessen , seine demografischen Faktoren und seine sozialen Bindungen nutzt .
Bestenfalls ist Epic für seine klügsten Nutzer eine Zusammenfassung der Welt , tiefer , umfassender und nuancierter als alles vorher Erhältliche .
Aber schlimmstenfalls ist Epic für allzu viele Menschen lediglich eine Ansammlung von Belanglosigkeiten , viele davon unwahr , alle begrenzt , flach und sensationslüstern .

FBI raids DOJ attorney 's home in search for warrantless wiretap information leaker RAW STORY
Published : Sunday August 5 , 2007
Print This Email This As Newsweek reports in its August 13 issue , the FBI has used a secret warrant to raid the home of former Justice Department lawyer Thomas M. Tamm , taking three computers and personal files .
The government is searching for the individual who leaked information about President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program to the press , prompting a New York Times report in 2005 .
Mr. Tamm worked for the Justice Department during a period in 2004 when critics of the program included then Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI director Robert Mueller .
Tamm is said to have shared concern , but whether or not he was actively protesting is unknown .
# Excerpts :
The FBI raid on Tamm 's home comes when Gonzales himself is facing criticism for allegedly misleading Congress by denying there had been " serious disagreement " within Justice about the surveillance program .
The A.G. last week apologized for " creating confusion , " but Senate Judiciary Committee chair Sen.
Patrick Leahy said he is weighing asking Justice 's inspector general to review Gonzales 's testimony .
The raid also came while the White House and Congress were battling over expanding NSA wiretapping authority in order to plug purported " surveillance gaps . "
James X. Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the raid was " amazing " and shows the administration 's misplaced priorities : using FBI agents to track down leakers instead of processing intel warrants to close the gaps .
A Justice spokesman declined to comment .

Michael Chertoff , the homeland security secretary , waived several environmental laws yesterday to continue building a border fence through a national conservation area in Arizona , bypassing a federal court ruling that had suspended the fence construction .
Citing “ unacceptable risks to our nation ’s security ” if the fence along the border with Mexico was further delayed , Mr. Chertoff invoked waiver authority granted him under a 2005 bill that mandated construction of the fence .
He ordered work to continue on 6.9 miles of fence along the border through the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area in Cochise County in southeastern Arizona .
In a ruling on Oct. 10 , Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle of the federal court for the District of Columbia held up construction of the fence , finding that the government had failed to carry out the required environmental assessment .
The decision came in a suit brought by the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife .

It is pink and grey , 2ft long and one of the only two venomous lizards in the world .
Yet the Gila Monster has proved an unlikely ally in the battle to control diabetes .
Scientists have isolated a chemical in its saliva
which is similar to a human hormone that helps
regulate blood sugar .
Scroll down for more
The Gila ( pronounced heela ) Monster , which is
native to the desert areas of the U.S. and Mexico , eats only three or four times a year and a compound known as exendin - 4 produced in its salivary glands helps it digest these meals very slowly .
This quality has been copied and produced synthetically in the injectable drug exenatide , which is being used to treat type 2 diabetes .
Type 2 , which mainly affects the over - 40s , occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , leading to high levels which can damage body organs .
The companies Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals are launching the drug today under the brand name Byetta .
Wild populations of the Gila Monster and its
equally poisonous cousin the Beaded Lizard are
declining rapidly owing to habitat loss and illegal hunting for the pet trade .
This has led conservationists to set up a project
to protect it in its habitat .
In recognition of the Gila Monster ’s gift to medicine , Eli Lilly is making a charitable contribution to the project over the
next three years .
Richard Gibson , Curator of Herpetology
at the Zoological Society of London , said :
' The Gila Monster is an amazing reptile and without it this valuable discovery would not have been made .
' I hope that further awareness of its role in this exciting medication will highlight the importance of preserving its habitat . '

Yea , I know ... but at least he 's getting out this important truth .

Tweety :
Is the White House going to pull a Lucy again ?
With the football trick , all over again ?
For months President Bush has been asking us to wait for a report from General Petraeus .
How many times have we heard that phrase ?
" Wait for the report from General Petraeus . "
Now we learn that the White House is going to write that report - the White House - and that the General will testify publicly before Congress only after the report 's been written by Bush 's people .
Is this a sign of something we 've seen before , is the Bush Administration going to politicize that critical September report instead of letting the General deliver a full and honest raw assessment to the American people ?
It looks like it .

George Bush made it clear last night he is determined to stop Iraq becoming his Vietnam .
In bringing up the spectre of a bloody war which still haunts America 30 years on , the president broke a taboo in order to reinforce his warning that millions of innocents could suffer if the U.S. pulls out of Iraq too soon .
Insisting that his troop ' surge ' is finally paying dividends in Iraq , Mr Bush said the withdrawal from South East Asia in 1975 should have taught America the need for patience .
The White House has previously gone to great lengths to avoid any comparisons with America 's humiliation in Vietnam .
But speaking to war veterans in Missouri yesterday , Mr Bush gambled on drawing parallels with the conflict 's violent aftermath in a bid to win back public support to stay the course in Iraq .
" Many argued that if we pulled out , there would be no consequences for the Vietnamese people , " said Mr Bush .
" The world would learn just how costly these misimpressions would be .
" Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left . "
Referring to the reprisals against U.S. allies in Vietnam , the displacement of Vietnamese refugees and the massacres in neighbouring Cambodia under Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge , he added : " One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like " boat people " , " re-education camps " and " killing fields " . "

Mr Bush said that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists , citing Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's claim that the U.S. public would rise up against the Iraq conflict in the same way .
" Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , " said the president .
" I recognise that history cannot predict the future with absolute certainty .
But history does remind us that there are lessons applicable to our time . "
In Britain , Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell , whose party opposed the Iraq War , criticised Mr Bush 's speech , saying : " Things must be getting pretty desperate when an American president feels it necessary to rely on the bruising and never - toberepeated experience in Vietnam . "
President Bush also claimed that his controversial decision to push more troops into the Iraqi war zones is bearing fruit .
He said U.S. forces " are carrying out a surge that is helping bring former Sunni insurgents into the fight against Al Qaeda , clearing the terrorists out of population centres and giving families in liberated Iraqi cities their first look at decent and normal life .
" Our troops are seeing this progress on the ground .
And as they take the initiative from the enemy , they have a question :
Will their elected leaders in Washington pull the rug out from under them just as they are gaining momentum and changing the dynamic on the ground in Iraq ?
" My answer is clear .
" We will support our troops , we will support our commanders , and we will give them everything they need to succeed . "
The president 's speech came as Iraqi premier Nouri al - Maliki hit back at U.S. criticism of his government .
On Tuesday , Mr Bush had appeared to distance himself from Iraq 's government for the first time , saying that there was ' a certain level of frustration with the leadership ' of Mr Maliki .
But Mr Maliki blamed many of the negative comments on politicians seeking to gain an advantage in the U.S. presidential primaries .
Saying ' no one has the right to place timetables ' on the Iraqi government , he warned that Iraq could ' find friends elsewhere ' .
• The number of black recruits joining the U.S. Army has nearly halved since the start of war in Iraq .
Yesterday , heightened levels of anti-war feeling in America 's black community were blamed for the dramatic drop - off , as another 14 U.S. soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in northern Iraq .
The proportion of black recruits dropped from 23 per cent in 2001 to just 13 per cent last year .
The number of female U.S. Army recruits also fell from 22 per cent in 2000 to 17 per cent this year .

How Does Bad Credit Impact Instant Loans ?
Like it or not , credit scoring plays a role in your finances .
From your earliest financial relationships onward , credit reference agencies monitor financial outcomes , compiling records about your finance habits .
Top UK agencies , such as Transunion , Equifax , and Experian keep tabs on payments , account balances , open lines of credit , past performance satisfying debts , and other details about your financial life .
The for - profit agencies then share information with creditors , upon request .
Each time you make application for a loan , credit card , service contract , or enter into any other type of credit arrangement , banks and other issuing institutions conduct credit checks , using data provided by credit reference agencies .
Among the information contained in their reports , credit reference agencies furnish details such as : -
Personal Information – Reference agencies share your legal name and date of birth with creditors , using the data to confirm your identity with institutions evaluating your credit strength .
– Reference agencies share your legal name and date of birth with creditors , using the data to confirm your identity with institutions evaluating your credit strength .
Past and Present Addresses – Credit reports confirm electoral roll information tied to your current address , as well as sharing past addresses associated with your identity .
Although credit companies do a good job staying current , outdated address info may interfere with credit approval .
For the best results securing financing , always update your address , for official purposes .

Outstanding Debts – Before extending finance offers , creditors need assurance you ’re a favorable risk .

Credit card balances , outstanding loans , mortgage obligations , and other money you owe are all considered .

Your payment history is of the utmost importance to lenders considering your application for credit .
Whilst they may not expect a perfect record of timely payments , lenders want to see that you ’ve successfully kept up with your financial responsibilities over the years .
Not only does your credit report contain information about late payments , but it also has entries for late payments on past accounts .

Public Records –
If you ’ve requested bankruptcy protection or experienced insolvency , you can expect to find record of it in your credit report .
Other information found in public registers is also included in your credit file , including county court judgements against you .
As well as compiling details profiling your credit history , credit reference agencies take an additional step , assigning a three - digit credit “ score ” reflecting your success and shortfalls managing debts and other financial matters .
A history of prompt payments and responsible credit management supports a favorable score , whilst a pattern of problems and negative credit reporting results in a lower credit score .
Conventional lenders often require loan applicants to present a particular score , or higher , in order to qualify for financing .
Unsecured loans also require credit checks , but bad credit lenders may have greater flexibility approving loan requests .
In some cases , applicants unable to secure traditional loans at banks and building societies are nonetheless eligible for instant bad credit loans .

Bush administration to “ ratchet up pressure ” on Iran
By Peter Symonds
3 September 2007
The Bush administration ’s abrupt dismissal of last Thursday ’s International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report on Iran ’s nuclear programs is one more sign that Washington has no interest in a diplomatic resolution to its confrontation with Tehran .
Following Bush ’s bellicose denunciations of Iran last week , the US has reiterated its intention to push for tougher UN sanctions against Tehran this month .
The IAEA report , which is due to be discussed at its board meeting beginning next Monday , sets out its latest assessment of Iran ’s nuclear facilities , including the construction of a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy water research reactor at Arak .
The report also includes details of an agreement reached with Iran for a timetable to resolve by December all the questions raised by the UN agency over the past four years .
IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei told the media : “ This is the first time Iran is ready to discuss all outstanding issues which triggered the crisis in confidence .
It ’s a significant step .
There are clear guidelines , so it ’s not , as some people are saying , an open - ended invitation to dallying with the agency or a ruse to prolong negotiations and avoid sanctions . ”
Washington quickly dismissed the IAEA - Iran agreement as inadequate and insisted that Tehran comply with US demands for the suspension of all nuclear enrichment programs .
US State Department spokesman Tom Casey declared last Thursday : “ There is no partial credit here .
Iran has refused to comply with its international obligations , and as a result of that the international community is going to continue to ratchet up the pressure . ”
This response underscores the hypocrisy of US allegations that Iran is covertly seeking to build nuclear weapons .
Tehran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and continues to allow IAEA inspection of the Natanz enrichment plant , which it maintains is to provide fuel for its planned nuclear power reactors .
As it has repeatedly insisted , Iran has the right under the NPT to build an enrichment plant , as Brazil for instance is also doing , and to construct research reactors for peaceful purposes .
Bush officials have highlighted Iran ’s failure to clarify the IAEA ’s outstanding issues as “ proof ” of Iran ’s lack of transparency and of its nuclear weapons ’ plans .
Some of these “ issues ” are based on dubious evidence supplied to the IAEA by US and Israeli intelligence .
Far from welcoming Iran ’s willingness to provide the documentation and access to officials required to deal with the issues , the Bush administration has branded the IAEA agreement as an Iranian ploy to gain time and implied that the IAEA is an Iranian dupe .
The US reaction recalls the lead - up to its invasion of Iraq in March 2003 when Bush officials summarily dismissed the reports of the IAEA and other UN weapons inspectors , which stated that no “ weapons of mass destruction ” ( WMD ) programs had been found and called for more time to carry out searches , as a ruse by the Hussein regime .
The lies that were used as the pretext for war were quickly exposed following the invasion when the US military ’s own teams failed to find any evidence of Iraqi WMDs .
Responding to the latest US criticisms , ElBaradei declared last week : “ My responsibility is to look at the big picture .
If I see a situation deteriorating ... [ and ] it could lead to war , I have to raise the alarm or give my advice . ”
Prior to the previous IAEA board meeting in June , he frankly told the BBC : “ I have no brief other than to make sure we do n’t go into another war or that we go crazy into killing each other .
You do not want to give [ an ] additional argument to the new crazies who say ‘ let ’s go and bomb Iran ’ . ”
Last week ’s IAEA report found that Iran ’s progress in installing the gas centrifuges required to enrich uranium at its underground hall at Natanz had slowed considerably .
Since the previous report three months ago , Iranian technicians had only gotten several hundred new centrifuges up and running .
As of August 19 , the IAEA reported that 1,968 centrifuges were operating with another 656 in various stages of assembly or testing .
The IAEA verified that the level of enrichment was that required for nuclear fuel — well short of the highly enriched uranium required to build a bomb .
The IAEA also reported that one outstanding issue related to plutonium experiments was already “ closed ” after Iran provided access to a key expert , documentation and other data .
Next week ’s IAEA meeting promises to be another exercise in US bullying and arm - twisting as the Bush administration prepares for a diplomatic offensive in the UN to demand tougher punitive sanctions on Iran .
The White House has already leaked plans to brand the entire Iranian Revolutionary Guard ( IRG ) as a “ specially designated global terrorist ” organisation .
Criminalising the IRG , a major part of the country ’s armed forces , would clear the way for unilateral US penalties not only against Iran , but any foreign corporation or bank that had relations with any of the IRG ’s many businesses .
The US threat to brand the IRG as a “ terrorist organisation ” is in the first instance aimed at intimidating other UN Security Council members into passing new sanctions against Iran .
Russia , China and the European powers all have substantial investment and economic interests in Iran , which could be subject to American penalties if any links were demonstrated to IRG businesses .
The UN Security Council , including its permanent members — the US , Britain , France , China and Russia — has previously imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran , but Russia and China in particular have expressed reluctance to impose harsher penalties .
Iran ’s disputed nuclear programs are just one element of the White House ’s mounting propaganda war against Tehran .
In a belligerent speech last week , Bush denounced Iran as “ the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism ” and declared that “ Iran ’s active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons ” placed the region “ under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust ” .
He condemned the IRG ’s alleged training and arming of Shiite militias in Iraq , saying he had authorised the US military to “ confront Tehran ’s murderous activities ” .
In an ominous warning , the US president concluded : “ We will confront this danger before it is too late . ”
A lengthy commentary entitled “ Will President Bush bomb Iran ? ” published yesterday in the conservative British - based Telegraph noted that the US had advanced preparations for military strikes .
The article began by pointing out that top US officials , including from the Pentagon and State Department , had recently completed a four - month exercise , held under the auspices of the right - wing Heritage Foundation think tank , designed to simulate the impact of a US war with Iran .
The computer modelling found that if Iran closed the Straits of Hormuz , oil prices would double , $ 161 billion would be wiped off the US GDP in a single quarter and a million jobs would be lost .
The Heritage Foundation nevertheless concluded that the study ’s policy proposals “ virtually eliminated all of the negative outcomes from the blockade . ”
The Telegraph article noted that Bush ’s speech was “ designed as a threat not just to Iran , but to America ’s Western allies , along with Russia and China , who have been slow to support — or who have opposed — UN sanctions against Iran . ”
James Phillips from the Heritage Foundation told the newspaper : “ It [ the speech ] is simultaneously a shot across Iran ’s bows and an appeal for the international community to do more to stop or slow Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
The article reported that European observers , and some in the American government , believe that Bush has resolved to “ do something ” about Iran before he leaves office .
A State Department source said : “ If we get closer to the end of this administration and we are not seeing suitably tough diplomatic actions at the UN ... then people will start asking the question : how do we stop our legacy being a nuclear - armed Iran ? ”
The Telegraph noted that “ credible reports ” indicated that “ the US has stepped up clandestine activities in Iran over the past 18 months , using special forces to gather intelligence about military targets — nuclear infrastructure and airbases , and Revolutionary Guard command centres . ”
The article pointed out that US military plans to strike Iran with B2 bombers and cruise missiles included “ up to 400 sites , only a few dozen of which are linked to the nuclear programs ... first in the crosshairs would be the main centrifuge plant at Natanz . ”
Yesterday ’s British Sunday Times reported the comments of Alexis Debat from the conservative Nixon Centre who told a gathering last week that the Pentagon had drawn up plans for a three - day aerial blitzkrieg against 1,200 targets inside Iran .
US military planners were not preparing for “ pinprick strikes ” against nuclear facilities , but for “ taking out the entire Iranian military , ” which Debat described as a “ very legitimate strategic calculus ” .
As the Telegraph noted , opinion polls reveal that just one in five Americans currently support the bombing of Iran .
Moreover , the CIA has told the Bush administration that it has not come up with a “ smoking gun ” that would create domestic or international support for such a war .
“ Last autumn , the CIA told the White House that while it believes Iran is running a clandestine nuclear weapons program , it does not have conclusive proof .
Radioactivity detention devices placed near suspect facilities did not find the expected results , ” the article explained .
None of this will stop the Bush administration from using the IAEA and UN meetings this month to accuse Iran of secretly producing nuclear weapons and backing “ terrorists ” in Iraq and the region .
Washington is once more seeking to stampede public opinion and create the conditions for another criminal military adventure .

Who wrote 2.6.20 ?
Time recently published an article entitled Getting rich off those who work for free which , among other things , talked about free software this way :
Open -source , volunteer - created computer software like the Linux operating system and the Firefox Web browser have also established themselves as significant and lasting economic realities .
It is not uncommon to see Linux referred to as a volunteer - created system , as opposed to the corporate - sponsored , proprietary alternatives .
There has been little research , however , into how much work on Linux is truly " volunteer " - done on a hacker 's spare , unpaid time .
In general , the assumption that Linux is created by volunteers is simply accepted .
Determining the real provenance of free software can be a daunting task .
There is a wealth of information available for those who look , however .
In an attempt to shine some light in this area , your editor hacked up some scripts to do a lot of digging around in the kernel git repository .
The idea was that , by looking at who is putting changes into the kernel , we can get a sense for where our source is coming from .
Who got patches into 2.6.20
This study looked at the stream of patches that changed the 2.6.19 kernel into the current 2.6.20 release .
There were , as it turns out 4983 non-merge changesets in this release , contributed by 741 different developers .
( Merge changesets mark where the contents of other repositories were pulled into the mainline , but they do not carry any code changes , so the analysis skipped them ) .
These patches added 286,439 lines of code and removed 159,812 others , for a total growth of 126,627 lines over the 2.6.20 development cycle .
Your editor 's scripts looked over every non-merge commit in 2.6.20 .
For each , the developer listed as the " author " was given credit for the patch .
This approach is not entirely fair , since one developer will , in some cases , be submitting code written by a group of people .
In general , though , there is no easy way of getting around this problem - the true breakdown of authorship of a joint work simply is not available in the mainline repository .
Your editor believes that this inaccuracy affects the accounting of a relatively small portion of the patches merged into the mainline .
Beyond that , how one generates statistics from a patch stream is an interesting question .
How does one measure the productivity of programmers ?
One possibility is to look at the number of changesets merged .
By that metric , this is the list of the most prolific contributors to 2.6.20 :
Developers with the most changesets Al Viro 241 4.8 % Andrew Morton 92 1.8 % Jiri Slaby 92 1.8 % Adrian Bunk 87 1.7 % Gerrit Renker 79 1.6 % Josef Sipek 79 1.6 % Avi Kivity 68 1.4 % Tejun Heo 67 1.3 % Patrick McHardy 63 1.3 % Ralf Baechle 61 1.2 % Randy Dunlap 59 1.2 % Alan Cox 58 1.2 % Mariusz Kozlowski 57 1.1 % Andrew Victor 53 1.1 % Paul Mundt 52 1.0 % Stefan Richter 49 1.0 % David S. Miller 48 1.0 % Russell King 44 0.9 % Benjamin Herrenschmidt 44 0.9 % Akinobu Mita 43 0.9 %
Looking at patch counts rewards developers who put in large numbers of small patches .
Al Viro 's patches include a vast number of code annotations ( to enable better checking with sparse ) , include file fixups , etc .
Many of the changes are small - many do not affect the resulting kernel executable at all - but there are a lot of them .
Even so , as the biggest contributor , Al generated less than 5 % of the total changesets added to the kernel .
The top 20 contributors , all together , generated 28 % of the total changesets in 2.6.20 .
One could make the argument that a better way to look at the problem is by the number of lines affected by a patch .
In this way , a contributor 's portion of the whole will not depend on whether it has been split into a long series of small patches or not .
On the other hand , simply renaming a file can make it look like a developer has touched a large amount of code .
Be that as it may , by looking at lines changed ( defined as the greater of the number of lines added or removed by each individual changeset ) , one gets a table like this :
Developers with the most changed lines Jeff Garzik 20712 6.0 % Patrick McHardy 15024 4.3 % Jiri Slaby 13917 4.0 % Avi Kivity 11726 3.4 % Andrew Victor 9710 2.8 % Amit S. Kale 9537 2.7 % Stephen Hemminger 9120 2.6 % Geoff Levand 8396 2.4 % Michael Chan 8307 2.4 % Chris Zankel 8099 2.3 % Mauro Carvalho Chehab 7390 2.1 % Adrian Bunk 6138 1.8 % Yoshinori Sato 5232 1.5 % Al Viro 4981 1.4 % Benjamin Herrenschmidt 4588 1.3 % Thierry MERLE 4549 1.3 % Dan Williams 4516 1.3 % Jonathan Corbet 3924 1.1 % Gerrit Renker 3857 1.1 % Jiri Kosina 3805 1.1 %
Jeff Garzik comes out on top of this particular measurement by virtue of having deleted the long - unmaintained floppy tape subsystem .
Patrick McHardy 's work includes a number of additions to the netfilter subsystem , Jiri Slaby did a great deal of driver cleanup work , Avi Kivity was the contributor of the KVM virtualization code , and Andrew Victor contributed a number of ARM - related patches and the Atmel AT91 i2 c driver .
( The contributions made by other authors can be found by searching out their name in the 2.6.20 short - form changelog ) .
Most of the developers in the above list got there by adding code to the kernel .
It can be said , however , that the true heroes in the development community are those who remove code and make the kernel smaller .
The developers who were best at removing more code than they added were :
Developers with the most lines removed Jeff Garzik 19862 12.4 % Chris Zankel 5608 3.5 % Adrian Bunk 5528 3.5 % Arnd Bergmann 2224 1.4 % Linus Torvalds 1739 1.1 % Atsushi Nemoto 1425 0.9 % Thierry MERLE 911 0.6 % David Gibson 878 0.5 % Dominik Brodowski 528 0.3 % Stefan Richter 509 0.3 %
Once again , Jeff Garzik 's removal of ftape comes out on top , by far .
Chris Zankel cleaned up the Xtensa architecture , removing a number of files in the process .
Adrian
Bunk worked on the ftape removal , got rid of the frame diverter code , removed an old , broken block driver , and generally performed cleanups all over the tree .
Mr. Bunk is , in fact , the bane of old code ; over the last year ( since 2.6.16 ) he has removed a full 127,000 lines from the kernel source tree .
Arnd Bergman got rid of a bunch of syscall *( ) macros .
Linus Torvalds removed the broken x86 stack unwinder code .
Finally , one could look at a different measure entirely : the number of patches signed off by each developer .
A Signed - off - by : line is an indication that the person involved believes that the code is suitable for merging into the kernel ; it implies that some degree of attention has been paid to the patch .
Authors sign off their code , as do the subsystem maintainers who pass it up the chain .
The top signers - off in 2.6.20 were :
Developers with the most signoffs Andrew Morton 1422 13.7 % Linus Torvalds 1366 13.2 % David S. Miller 483 4.7 % Jeff Garzik 331 3.2 % Greg Kroah - Hartman 269 2.6 % Al Viro 241 2.3 % Paul Mackerras 232 2.2 % Andi Kleen 177 1.7 % Mauro Carvalho Chehab 170 1.6 % Russell King 166 1.6 % Adrian Bunk 120 1.2 % Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo 119 1.1 % Ralf Baechle 117 1.1 % James Bottomley 109 1.1 % Patrick McHardy 96 0.9 % Jiri Slaby 94 0.9 % Avi Kivity 87 0.8 % Josef Sipek 79 0.8 % Paul Mundt 78 0.8 % Gerrit Renker 78 0.8 %
There were a total of 10,354 signoff lines in the 2.6.20 patch stream , so each changeset , on average , was signed off just over two times .
It is interesting that Linus , who ultimately merges every patch , only signed off 13 % of them .
It seems that most patches , these days , go directly into the mainline from subsystem repositories without a signoff from Linus or Andrew .
Most of the other names on that list , with just a few exceptions , are the maintainers of subsystem or architecture trees .
Who paid them
So now we have a sense for who got their fingers on the code which went into 2.6.20 .
But one interesting question still has not been answered : to what extent was that code contributed by volunteers ( or " hobbyists " ) ?
Finding an answer to that question is somewhat trickier than looking at who wrote the patches , mostly because very few developers say " I wrote this on behalf of my employer . "
The approach taken by your editor was relatively simplistic , but , perhaps , the best that is practical .
Any patch whose author 's given email address indicates a corporate affiliation is assumed to have been developed by an employee of that corporation .
So any patch posted by somebody with an ibm.com email address is accounted as having been done by an IBM employee .
Things are complicated by the fact that many people who work for companies do not use corporate addresses ; it is not unheard - of for companies to have policies explicitly prohibiting code contributions associated with their domains .
Your editor has coped with this problem by filling in the relevant developer 's affiliation whenever it is known to him ; in some cases , the developer was asked for this information .
This method has the effect of crediting all of an employee 's work to his or her employer .
In many cases , the situation is probably more complicated than that ; one assumes , for example , that a certain kernel hacker 's employer has not directed him to hack on Battle for Wesnoth .
When looking only at kernel code , however , crediting all work to the employer is probably relatively safe .
Using this approach , the top sources of changesets were :
Top changeset contributors by employer ( Unknown ) 1244 25.0 % Red Hat 636 12.8 % ( None ) 383 7.7 % IBM 368 7.4 % Novell 295 5.9 % Linux Foundation 261 5.2 % Intel 178 3.6 % Oracle 126 2.5 % Google 97 1.9 % University of Aberdeen 79 1.6 % HP 78 1.6 % Qumranet 71 1.4 % Nokia 67 1.3 % SGI 64 1.3 % Astaro 63 1.3 % MIPS Technologies 61 1.2 % SANPeople 53 1.1 % Miracle Linux 43 0.9 % MontaVista 41 0.8 % Broadcom 39 0.8 %
Looking instead at the number of lines of code changed , the results become :
Top lines changed by employer ( Unknown ) 66154 19.0 % Red Hat 44527 12.8 % ( None ) 38099 11.0 % IBM 25244 7.3 % Astaro 15306 4.4 % Linux Foundation 13638 3.9 % Qumranet 12108 3.5 % Novell 11930 3.4 % Intel 11652 3.4 % SANPeople 9888 2.8 % NetXen 9607 2.8 % Sony 8497 2.4 % Broadcom 8349 2.4 % Tensilica 8195 2.4 % Nokia 5581 1.6 % MontaVista 4394 1.3 % University of Aberdeen 4324 1.2 % LWN.net 3975 1.1 % Secretlab 3370 1.0 % HP 3211 0.9 %
[ Note that these tables have been updated once since the article was originally published ; the curious can see what the original versions looked like . ]
In these tables , the line marked " ( Unknown ) " is exactly that : patches for which existence of a supporting employer could not be determined .
The line marked " ( None ) " , instead , indicates the patches from developers known to be working on their own time .
Either way , the results come out about the same : at least 65 % of the code which went into 2.6.20 was created by people working for companies .
If the entire " unknown " group turns out to be developers working on a volunteer basis - an unlikely result - then just over 1/3 of the 2.6.20 patch stream was written by volunteers .
The real number will be lower , but it still shows that a significant portion of the code we run is written by developers who are donating their time .
One year 's worth of changes
Looking at a single kernel release is instructive , but it can also be deceptive .
The relatively short release cycle used by the kernel project makes it fairly easy for prolific developers to see few of their patches go into a specific release .
In an attempt to gain a longer - term perspective , your editor forced his suffering system to crank through the entire history from 2.6.16 ( released almost exactly one year ago ) to the present .
Some 28,000 non-merge changesets have been added to the mainline ( by 1,961 developers ) over that time , replacing 1.26 million lines of old code with 2.01 million lines of new code - the kernel grew by 754,000 lines .
The developers who touched the most lines over that time were :
Developers with the most changed lines Adrian Bunk 134021 5.3 % Jeff Garzik 87847 3.5 % Andrew Vasquez 75195 3.0 % Mauro Carvalho Chehab 68568 2.7 % David Teigland 46607 1.9 % Ralf Baechle 38559 1.5 % David S. Miller 35958 1.4 % Andrew Victor 35594 1.4 % Bryan O'Sullivan 33901 1.4 % Paul Mundt 27041 1.1 % Dave Kleikamp 26615 1.1 % Lennert Buytenhek 25192 1.0 % Haavard Skinnemoen 24372 1.0 % Ben Dooks 23207 0.9 % Patrick McHardy 23175 0.9 % Ingo Molnar 22456 0.9 % James Bottomley 22205 0.9 % David Howells 19168 0.8 % Jiri Slaby 18335 0.7 % Divy Le Ray 17909 0.7 %
The results for employers were :
Top lines changed by employer ( Unknown ) 740990 29.5 % Red Hat 361539 14.4 % ( None ) 239888 9.6 % IBM 200473 8.0 % QLogic 91834 3.7 % Novell 91594 3.6 % Intel 78041 3.1 % MIPS Technologies 58857 2.3 % Nokia 39676 1.6 % SANPeople 36038 1.4 % SteelEye 36021 1.4 % Freescale 35034 1.4 % Linux Foundation 34163 1.4 % MontaVista 30211 1.2 % Simtec 26166 1.0 % Atmel 25975 1.0 % HP 23714 0.9 % SGI 22057 0.9 % Oracle 21251 0.8 % Open Grid Computing 20505 0.8 %
The end result of all this is that a number of the widely - expressed opinions about kernel development turn out to be true .
There really are thousands of developers - at least , almost 2,000 who put in at least one patch over the course of the last year .
Linus Torvalds is directly responsible for a very small portion of the code which makes it into the kernel .
Contemporary kernel development is spread out among a broad group of people , most of whom are paid for the work they do .
Overall , the picture is of a broad - based and well - supported development community .
There are many other interesting things to be learned by looking at the kernel 's development history .
Expect more articles along these lines as your editor finds the time to improve his scripts .
Lenovo quietly selling Linux - compatible laptops Jul. 11 , 2007
Lenovo seems to have a love / hate relationship with Linux .
Last year , it began offering its high - end T60 p ThinkPad laptop with SLED 10 ( SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ) .
This year , the company is releasing its newest high - end laptop , the T61p ThinkPad , and once more , while it runs desktop Linux , the company is n't overly eager to let the world know about it .
Be that as it may , Lenovo released the ThinkPad T61 p , on July 10 and will start to ship it to customers later in July .
The ThinkPad T61p is , like its predecessor , certified to run Novell SLED 10 .
In addition , Lenovo is now stating that its laptop has been certified to run Red Hat and Turbolinux as well .
While Lenovo gave no reason for adding those particular Linuxes to its line , there are some possible reasons for these moves .
In the case of Red Hat , besides this Linux 's clear popularity in business circles , Mark Enzweiler , Red Hat 's vice president of North American channel sales came to Red Hat immediately after being Lenovo 's vice president of global channel strategy and sales .
As for Turbolinux , this Japanese - based Linux distribution is gaining popularity in Japan , Korea and China .
These are also all counties where Lenovo , with its Chinese roots , is trying to win customers .
The ThinkPad T61p is built for workstation - level jobs that require 3 - D graphics .
To pull this off it comes with a 15.4 - inch - wide display and a NVIDIA Quadro FX 570 M chip set .
This newest member of the well - regarded ThinkPad family comes with a selection of new Core 2 Duo processors from Intel .
This includes the T7700 , T7500 and T7300 , which offer clock speeds ranging from 2.4GHz to 2.0GHz , 4MB of L2 cache and an 800M Hz front - side bus .
Lenovo is also offering users the option of including Intel 's TurboMemory , a NAND - based flash memory .
This portable workstation includes up to 4GB of RAM , a 160 GB SATA ( Serial ATA ) hard drive , three USB 2.0 ports and a CD - RW DVD combo .
It also includes a variety of Wi-Fi network connection options including support for draft 802.11n WLAN ( wireless LAN ) , embedded WWAN ( wireless WAN ) technologies and UWB ( ultrawideband ) .
There is , at this time , no page on the Lenovo site for Linux and the ThinkPad 61 p .
The closest you 'll find is a page about SLED on the ThinkPad 60 p page .
There is also a technical support page for SLED and the 60p .
Pricing for the ThinkPad T61 p starts at $ 1,814 .

The top US cigarette makers violated racketeering laws , deceiving the public for years about the health hazards of smoking , a federal judge ruled yesterday .
Judge Gladys Kessler stopped short of ordering the companies to pay for a quit - smoking programme but said they must publish in newspapers and on their websites " corrective statements " on the adverse health effects and addictiveness of smoking and nicotine .
The government had asked the judge to make the companies pay $ 10 bn ( £ 5.3bn ) for smoking cessation programmes in the action , launched under the Clinton presidency .
Web Browser Wednesday
As we ’ve shown before , Opera is an extremely customizable browser , but it does so much that it can be difficult to remember it all .
Then again you would have to know what it does in order to remember it . :)
Today we want to walk you through a dozen tips and tricks that will inch you closer to becoming an Opera grand master .
So lets go ahead and jump into it , and as always , hit us up with your tips in the comments !
– Bookmark & Folder Nicknames –
Opera has a nickname feature for bookmarks that I ’m guessing most people use .
With it you can enter in an abbreviation for a bookmark that can quickly be typed into the address bar to pull up a particular site .
One thing that you may not have realized is that the nicknames can also be assigned to entire folders of bookmarks , and entering that into the address bar will open every site within that folder :
– Bookmark & Open Multiple Links –
Let ’s say you ’re on a sight such as Digg , and you ’re trying to quickly go through all of the news .
Enter Links Panel !
The Links Panel ( a.k.a. sidebar ) will let you handle hyperlinks throughout the page in bulk .
You can Ctrl + Click or Shift + Click to select multiple links from the current page .
Then just choose the bookmark or open the option from the right - click menu .
– Click to Save Images –
Do you find yourself frequently saving images from websites ?
Instead of right - clicking on an image to save it each time , just Ctrl + Click on it .
You ’ll immediately be prompted with a Save As dialog box for you to enter in the name , or you can just press Enter to use the image ’s current name .
[ via Opera Watch ]
– Customize the Browser ’s Name and Icon–
Did you know that you change the name of the browser , and even replace its icon with your own ?
Yep , that ’s all built - in .
To change the icon you ’ll need to enter opera : config # UserPrefs|ApplicationIcon into your address bar , and then provide the location of the icon you want to use .
To change the browser ’s name , just enter opera:config # UserPrefs|Title into the address bar , and in the box type the name you want to appear .
Additionally , you can use these combinations to insert dynamic items :
%t for page title ( entering just %t in the box will remove the browser ’s name all together , which is what I currently do )
for page title ( entering just in the box will remove the browser ’s name all together , which is what I currently do ) %s for build number
for build number %v for version number
In this example I choose to display the browser ’s name before the title of the page :
[ via Tamil ]
– Detach / Move a Tab–
Want to open a tab up in a new window ?
Just drag it onto the title bar of the browser .
You can also move tabs between multiple windows simply by dragging and dropping them from one tab bar to another .
– Fast Navigation–
If you ’re trying to open several links on a page , you should try using Shift + Arrow keys to move between the hyperlinks on the page .
The nice thing is that this does n’t jump back up to the beginning of the page where the first hyperlink appears .
It starts with the first hyperlink in the area that you are looking at .
Shift + Ctrl +
Enter will then open the currently selected link in a background tab .
– Fit to Width–
When you come across a site that requires horizontal scrolling , why not try and enable the Fit to Width feature ( located in the View Menu , or press Ctrl + F11 ) .
The site will be adjusted so that no horizontal scrolling is necessary , and for the most part it wo n’t look all that bad .
– Hide the Menu Bar–
I hardly ever need to use the Menu Bar , and it takes up more room that I ’m willing to part with .
So what I do is I add a button that will remove the Menu Bar , and at the same time provide all of the menu options in a single condensed drop - down list .
Just click here to add that button , and for more menu buttons visit the Opera Wiki .
– Hide the Tab Bar for a Single Tab–
In Firefox when you only have one tab open , the tab bar is not visible , and there is an option in Opera to do the same thing .
Just right - click on the Tab Bar , choose the Customize option , and then check the box that says “ Show only when needed . ”
The tab bar will now be hidden anytime only one tab is open .
– Right - Click Address Mapping–
It ’s super easy to map any address on a site using your favorite map service .
Here ’s what you have to do :
Open up your favorite map service ( ex. Google Maps or Yahoo !
Maps ) .
Right - click in the service ’s search box , and choose the Create Search option .
Enter in a keyword ( it ’s required by Opera , but is n’t used in this trick ) , and then press Save .
The next time you see an address on a site just highlight it with your mouse , right - click , and then go to “ Search with . ”
You ’ll see a list of all the possible search engines that you ’ve added to Opera , and all you have to do is select the mapping service .
– Promptless Downloading –
If you ’re like me you probably save all of your downloads to the same folder so that you do n’t end up with things scattered all over your computer .
In Opera you can set your default download location in the Options , and then when you right - click on a file or image , there will be a “ Save to download folder ” option .
Clicking on that will initiate the download without prompting you for any information .
– Speed Dial Homepage Button–
This is something that I was yearning for , and luckily the Opera Community came through .
For reasons unknown to me , the Opera developers never associated an address to the Speed Dial page .
That meant you could n’t assign it as your browser ’s homepage , but dragging this button onto the address bar will do the trick .
It will take on the look of the homepage button , but it will actually open the Speed Dial page .
Artist 's rendition of the forming system at IRAS4B .
Credit : JPL / CalTech
Astronomers at the University of Rochester have discovered five Earth - oceans ’ worth of water that has recently fallen into the planet - forming region around an extremely young , developing star .
Dan Watson , professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester , believes he and his colleagues are the first to see a short - lived stage of protoplanetary disk formation , and the manner in which a planetary system ’s supply of water arrives from the natal envelope within which its parent star originally formed .
The findings , published in today ’s Nature , are the first - ever glimpse of material directly feeding a protoplanetary disk .
The embryonic star in question , called IRAS 4B , lies in a picturesque nebula called NGC 1333 , about 1000 light years from Earth .
It is one of an initial list of 30 of the youngest “ protostars ” known , which Watson and his team examined with the Spitzer Space Telescope ’s infrared spectrograph for signs of very dense , warm material at their cores .
It is also the only one of the thirty to show signs of such material , signaled by the infrared spectrum of water vapor .
The watery characteristics of IRAS4B ’s infrared spectrum can best be explained by material falling from the protostar ’s envelope onto a surrounding , dense disk .
This setup , called by astronomers a “ disk - accretion shock , ” is the formative mechanism of the disks within which all planetary systems are thought to originate .
“ Icy material from the envelope is in free - fall , reaching supersonic speeds and crashing into the protoplanetary disk . ” says Watson .
“ The ice vaporizes on impact , and the warm water vapor emits a distinctive spectrum of infrared light .
That light is what we measured .
From the details of the measured spectrum we can tease out the physical details of this brand - new , pre-planetary disk ”
Among the details derived so far are the rate of “ rainfall ” onto the disk – about 23 Earth masses per year – and the characteristics of the “ puddle ” on the disk ’s surface :
The surface is 170 degrees Kelvin ( 153 degrees below zero Fahrenheit ) , and at that temperature there is about an Earth ’s mass worth of material , including enough water to fill Earth ’s oceans about five times .
The area of the “ puddle ” is such that , if circular and centered on the Sun , its perimeter would be just beyond the orbit of Pluto .
Results such as this will help astronomers assess the early planet - forming potential of IRAS4B ’s disk , and by inference learn about the earliest stages of our solar system ’s life .
There are astro-chemical implications of the observations as well .
“ There are lots of primitive icy bodies in our solar system , and the ice they carry is often thought to descend directly from the interstellar medium , so that by studying one we could learn about the other , ” says Watson .
“ But in NGC 1333 IRAS 4B ’s disk , it is clear that the water is received as vapor and will be re-frozen under different conditions , and this means that the oxygen and hydrogen chemistry of its disk is reset from interstellar conditions .
It ’s not getting pristine , interstellar ice . ”
Astronomers at the University of Rochester , including Watson and co-author professor William Forrest , helped design the “ eyes ” of Spitzer specifically to look for objects like IRAS4B and its water because such objects sit in an astronomer ’s blind spot .
Called “ Class Zero Protostars ” for their extreme youth , these objects radiate substantial light only at long infrared wavelengths , which our atmosphere inconveniently blocks from ground - based telescopes .
When Watson and his team first planned their Spitzer observations , only 50 class - zero protostars were known , and the team selected the 30 brightest .
But Watson says that ’s just the beginning .
Astronomers now know of hundreds of such objects , and Watson expects to have thousands to investigate in the coming years .
Another characteristic makes the otherwise un-noteworthy IRAS4B a rarity .
It is oriented with its axis pointed almost directly at Earth , splaying out its entire disk to our view and simplifying the process of plumbing its secrets .
Only a small fraction of the future candidates are expected be similarly oriented , keeping the search for lots more “ raining protostars ” a challenge .

Athletes are urged to consume carbohydrates frequently -- before they start activity , during exercise to “ keep the tank full ” and as soon as possible after a workout to replenish carbohydrate stores .
But it was n’t always so .
Only 100 years ago , it was widely believed that beef was the cornerstone of an athlete ’s diet .
Then , in 1920 , came the first published study demonstrating the importance of a high - carbohydrate diet to fuel activity .
And in 1923 , researchers studying Boston Marathon runners first made the connection between low blood sugar and fatigue .
Since that time , the ideal composition of carbohydrate - rich sports products has become a hot topic of research .
Several recent studies have examined the physiological effects of different dietary sugars during exercise -- fueling the development of sports - related food products containing these “ functional carbohydrates . ”
A high - carb diet helps to stockpile glucose -- stored as glycogen in muscle and liver -- so it ’s ready to be used when needed .
Such a diet is one of the best defenses against early fatigue during physical exertion .
Because glucose is the sugar we need , you ’d think -- logically -- that a high - glucose diet would be the best one for an athlete .

But glucose is n’t present in foods to any great extent .
It appears , instead , as carbohydrate - rich foods are broken down during digestion .
Breads , pasta , cereals , fruits and dairy are all rich sources of carbohydrates , which is why they ’re typical fare for athletes .
Digestion also produces other simple sugars such as fruit - derived fructose , galactose from milk , trehalose from honey and maltose from starches .
These naturally - occurring sugars may have some beneficial effects beyond just providing much - needed carbohydrate .
One study , published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology in 2003 , compared the effects of three sugar solutions ( glucose , galactose and trehalose ) on performance and blood sugar levels in eight well - trained male cyclists .
The beverages were consumed just before an exercise bout of 20 minutes of low - intensity cycling followed by a timed trial of all - out effort .
Performance was comparable with all three sugars , but blood glucose levels rose and fell more gently with trehalose and galactose .
In other words , rather than being the favored pre-exercise carb source , glucose is less favorable , triggering a stronger release of insulin to bring blood sugar down .
The authors point out that if activity begins when insulin levels are high , blood sugar levels might drop too low , causing early exhaustion .

Other studies have shown that carbohydrates are more efficiently used as fuel when several sugar sources are consumed at once , and various mixtures have been studied in an attempt to find the best blend .
One study of cyclists , published in 2005 in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise , compared beverages prepared with a mixture of fructose and maltodextrin ( a short chain of glucose molecules ) with maltodextrin alone .
The total carbohydrate was the same in each group , but the fructose - maltodextrin combo increased the rate of energy production from the drinks by 40 % .
This improved “ fuel efficiency ” from food helps preserve the body ’s own carb stores .
Strenuous exercise not only drains carbohydrate reserves ; the metabolic activity required to sustain it leads to production of cell - damaging free radicals .
This can lead to fatigue .
A small placebo - controlled study published in May in the journal Nutrition demonstrated that an extract produced from unripe apples helped to counteract fatigue in athletes after a series of bouts on an exercise bike .
Apples , like all fruits , are a good source of carbohydrates .
But the researchers concluded that procyanidin , an antioxidant in apples , was responsible .
On the heels of this burgeoning research , consumers are now faced with a dizzying array of designer products in the form of fortified waters , sports drinks and energy drinks , some of which may tout proprietary blends of carbohydrates , electrolytes and antioxidants .
In the melee , whole foods may be getting short shrift .
These , after all , are more than just carbohydrates or antioxidants -- they are complex mixtures containing phytonutrients , vitamins , minerals , protein , fats and fluid .
So while designer sports foods and beverages have their place in the athlete ’s diet , many standard staples have merit .

At this year ’s American College of Sports Medicine meeting in New Orleans , researchers from the University of Texas at Austin reported that a bowl of wheat flakes with milk was just as effective in boosting exercise recovery as a specially formulated sports drink -- by providing a good balance of glycogen - restoring carbohydrates as well as protein for muscle repair .
Another tried - and - true recovery drink for many athletes is chocolate milk -- it ’s protein - and carb - rich , with fluid , potassium and cocoa antioxidants to boot .
A healthful diet with adequate carbs and fluids is critical for peak athletic performance .
But even if you ’re only a weekend warrior , experimenting with different foods and incorporating a few specialized sports products might just help you achieve your best .

After learning that items purchased on eBay may have been used in the Virginia Tech shootings this past April , the popular online auction site has revised its policy on firearms , weapons , and knives .
On April 16 , in Blacksburg , Virginia , a student at Virginia Tech University killed 32 people and wounded 25 before committing suicide .
Three weeks before the attack , the gunman purchased several empty ammunition clips from an eBay seller based in Idaho .
Currently , eBay prohibits the sale of guns and other weapons regulated by U.S. federal and state governments , and in mid-August , it will also ban the listing of any part that 's used in the firing of a gun , AuctionBytes.com reports .
This includes bullet tips , brass casing and shells , barrels , cylinders , magazines , firing pins , trigger assemblies , and more .
" We felt that revisiting our policies was not only necessary , but the right thing to do , " reads an announcement from Matt Halprin , eBay 's vice president of trust and safety .
" After much consideration , the Trust & Safety policy team - along with our executive leaders at eBay Inc. - have made the decision to further restrict more of these items than federal and state regulations require . " ®
Virtually everyone who joins a new group is sensitive to the fact that , as a newcomer , they must tread carefully for a while , keeping a low profile until becoming sufficiently integrated into the group .
When they do offer their ideas , criticisms , and suggestions , existing group members typically resist their contributions .
Why does that happen and what can be done to overcome that resistance ?
Research published in the July issue of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin ( PSPB ) , from SAGE , explores those questions .
The studies , authored in PSPB by Matthew J. Hornsey , Tim Grice , Jolanda Jetten , Neil Paulsen , and Victor Callan ( all at University of Queensland , Brisbane , Australia ) , examined how groups responded to identical criticisms of the group presented by both newcomers and old - timers .
In every instance , the newcomers ’ statements aroused less agreement and more negativity than the same comments delivered by long - term members .
As a result , old - timers were more influential in persuading others than the newcomers were .
The authors conclude that the resistance to newcomers occurred because they were perceived as being less attached to their group member identity than long - term members , leading others to question whether they had the group ’s best interests at heart .
“ Newcomers should have greater influence to the extent that they show commitment to their identity as a group member , ” write the authors .
“ Newcomers who seemed to relinquish their attachment to a community to which they formerly belonged were more influential in their new group . ”
Newcomers face an uphill battle to have their criticisms and recommendations for change accepted and this research can help them bring about positive change in the groups they join .

Sometime during the demonstrations against the Republican National Convention , which renominated George W. Bush in August 2004 , I went on a media protest march down the Valley of the Imperial Media , Sixth Avenue , in the Big Apple .
I had certainly been on enough marches in my life , but I was amazed .
Back in the Vietnam era , when the police photographed peaceful demonstrators , they tended to do it surreptitiously and out of uniform .
Here , police in uniform with video cameras were proudly out in the open shooting what looked like continuous footage of us all .
And that was the least of it .
We demonstrators were surrounded by a veritable army of police , on horseback , on motorbike , on foot .
As I wrote at the time :
“ The ‘ march , ’ which you might want to imagine as a serpentine creature heading south on New York ’s Sixth Avenue , had actually been chopped into a series of one - block long segments by the New York Police Department .
Each small segment was penned on its sides by moveable wooden barricades and on either end by the wheel - to - wheel bikes of a seemingly endless supply of mounted policemen backed up by all manner of police vehicles .
To ‘ march , ’ that is , actually meant to step from pen to pen , hemmed in everywhere , your protest at the mercy of the timing , tactics , and desires of the police . ”
As a light would turn red , your group on your block would be cut off from the group behind and in front of you .
There was never a moment when we were n’t , quite literally , penned in .
If this was the “ freedom ” to demonstrate , it managed to feel a lot like being jailed right out on the street .
And that was a modest experience indeed .
Jennifer Flynn lived through something far more intense .
As a recent Newsday piece put it : “ Jennifer Flynn is not a rabble - rouser .
She ’s not an aspiring suicide bomber .
She does n’t advocate the overthrow of the government .
Instead , she pushes for funding and better treatment for people with HIV and AIDS .
Better keep an eye on her .
Wait !
Somebody already did . ”
The organization Flynn co-founded was organizing a rally near the Republican convention .
The day before it was to be held , while visiting her family in New Jersey , she found her parents ’ house staked out and then herself followed by no less than three unmarked cars .
She wrote down the license plate of one which , according to Newsday reporter Rocco Parascandola , was traced “ back to a company  Pequot Inc.  and a post office box at an address far from the five boroughs [ of New York City ] .
Registering unmarked cars to post office boxes outside the city or to shell companies is a common practice of law enforcement agencies to shield undercover investigators . ”
The New York Police Department has denied involvement , but as Nick Turse writes below , in the year before the convention , its undercover teams had traveled the country , Canada , and Europe , conducting covert surveillance of quite peaceful activists .
In practice , this is part of what the Global War on Terror has meant here  the granting of an endless license for the draconian to become part of normal life , of what passes for “ safety . ”
“ All we want are the facts , Ma’am , ” Sgt. Friday of Dragnet used to say on the TV screen of my childhood .
Well , the facts now are that surveillance and “ homeland security ” add up to a massive , booming business ( and not just in Iraq ) .
Already our second defense department , the Department of Homeland Security , has sprouted a second , mini-military - industrial complex  and it ’s not just a domestic matter , either .
When it comes to the profits associated with surveillance and the crackdown , Chinese surveillance companies , already raising money from U.S. institutional investors , are reportedly about to get their first foothold on the New York Stock Exchange .
Today , a world of “ safety ” that involves techniques and technology once associated with Orwell ’s dystopian novel 1984 is fast becoming life as we know ( and accept ) it .
And there ’s more to come .
Tom
NYC , the NYPD , the RNC , and Me
Fortress Big Apple , 2007
by Nick Turse
One day in August , I walked into the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan .
Nearly three years before I had been locked up , about two blocks away , in “ the Tombs ”  the infamous jail then named the Bernard B. Kerik Complex for the now - disgraced New York City Police Commissioner .
You see , I am one of the demonstrators who was illegally arrested by the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) during the protests against the 2004 Republican National Convention ( RNC ) .
My crime had been  in an effort to call attention to the human toll of America ’s wars  to ride the subway , dressed in black with the pallor of death about me ( thanks to cornstarch and cold cream ) , and an expression to match , sporting a placard around my neck that read : WAR DEAD .
I was with a small group , and our plan was to travel from Union Square to Harlem , change trains , and ride all the way back down to Astor Place .
But when my small group exited the train at the 125th Street station in Harlem , we were arrested by a swarm of police , marched to a waiting paddy wagon , and driven to a filthy detention center .
There , we were locked away for hours in a series of razor - wire - topped pens , before being bussed to the Tombs .
Now , I was back to resolve the matter of my illegal arrest .
As I walked through the metal detector of the federal building , a security official searched my bag .
He did n’t like what he found .
“ You could be shot for carrying that in here , ” he told me .
“ You could be shot . ”
For the moment , however , the identification of that dangerous object I attempted to slip into the federal facility will have to wait .
Let me instead back up to July 2004 , when , with the RNC fast - approaching , I authored an article on the militarization of Manhattan  “ the transformation of the island into a ‘ homeland - security state ' ”  and followed it up that September with a street - level recap of the convention protests , including news of the deployment of an experimental sound weapon , the Long Range Acoustic Device , by the NYPD , and the department ’s use of an on - loan Fuji blimp as a “ spy - in - the - sky . ”
Back then , I suggested that the RNC gave New York ’s “ finest , ” a perfect opportunity to “ refine , perfect , and implement new tactics ( someday , perhaps , to be known as the ‘ New York model ’ ) for use penning in or squelching dissent .
It offered them the chance to write up a playbook on how citizens ’ legal rights and civil liberties may be abridged , constrained , and violated at their discretion . ”
Little did I know how much worse it could get .
No Escape
Since then , the city ’s security forces have eagerly embraced an Escape From New York - aesthetic  an urge to turn Manhattan into a walled - in fortress island under high - tech government surveillance , guarded by heavily armed security forces , with helicopters perpetually overhead .
Beginning in Harlem in 2006 , near the site of two new luxury condos , the NYPD set up a moveable “ two - story booth tower , called Sky Watch , ” that gave an “ officer sitting inside a better vantage point from which to monitor the area . ”
The Panopticon - like structure  originally used by hunters to shoot quarry from overhead and now also utilized by the Department of Homeland Security along the Mexican border  was outfitted with black - tinted windows , a spotlight , sensors , and four to five cameras .
Now , five Sky Watch towers are in service , rotating in and out of various neighborhoods .
With their 20 - 25 neighborhood - scanning cameras , the towers are only a tiny fraction of the Big Apple surveillance story .
Back in 1998 , the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) found that there were “ 2,397 cameras used by a wide variety of private businesses and government agencies throughout Manhattan ”  and that was just one borough .
About a year after the RNC , the group reported that a survey of just a quarter of that borough yielded a count of more than 4,000 surveillance cameras of every kind .
At about the same time , military - corporate giant Lockheed Martin was awarded a $ 212 million contract to build a “ counter - terrorist surveillance and security system for New York ’s subways and commuter railroads as well as bridges and tunnels ” that would increase the camera total by more than 1,000 .
A year later , as seems to regularly be the case with contracts involving the military - corporate complex , that contract had already ballooned to $ 280 million , although the system was not to be operational until at least 2008 .
In 2006 , according to a Metropolitan Transit Authority ( MTA ) spokesman , the MTA already had a “ 3,000 - camera - strong surveillance system , ” while the NYPD was operating “ an additional 3,000 cameras ” around the city .
That same year , Bill Brown , a member of the Surveillance Camera Players  a group that leads surveillance - camera tours and maps their use around the city , estimated , according to a Newsweek article , that the total number of surveillance cameras in New York exceeded 15,000  “ a figure city officials say they have no way to verify because they lack a system of registry . ”
Recently , Brown told me that 15,000 was an estimate for the number of cameras in Manhattan , alone .
For the city as a whole , he suspects the count has now reached about 40,000 .
This July , NYPD officials announced plans to up the ante .
By the end of 2007 , according to the New York Times , they pledged to install “ more than 100 cameras ” to monitor “ cars moving through Lower Manhattan , the beginning phase of a London - style surveillance system that would be the first in the United States . ”
This “ Ring of Steel ” scheme , which has already received $ 10 million in funding from the Department of Homeland Security ( in addition to $ 15 million in city funds ) , aims to exponentially decrease privacy because , if “ fully financed , it will include 3,000 public and private security cameras below Canal Street , as well as a center staffed by the police and private security officers ” to monitor all those electronic eyes .
Spies in the Sky
At the time of the RNC , the NYPD was already mounted on police horses , bicycles , and scooters , as well as an untold number of marked and unmarked cars , vans , trucks , and armored vehicles , not to mention various types of water - craft .
In 2007 , the two - wheeled Segway joined its list of land vehicles .
Overhead , the NYPD aviation unit , utilizing seven helicopters , proudly claims to be “ in operation 24/7 , 365 , ” according to Deputy Inspector Joseph Gallucci , its commanding officer .
Not only are all the choppers outfitted with “ state of the art cameras and heat - sensing devices , ” as well as “ the latest mapping , tracking and surveillance technology , ” but one is a “ $ 10 million ‘ stealth bird , ’ which has no police markings  [ so ] that those on the ground have no idea they are being watched . ”
Asked about concerns over intrusive spying by members of the aviation unit  characterized by Gallucci as “ a bunch of big boys who like big expensive toys ”  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly scoffed .
“ We ’re not able to , even if we wanted , to look into private spaces , ” he told the New York Times .
“ We ’re looking at public areas . ”
However , in 2005 , it was revealed that , on the eve of the RNC protests , members of the aviation unit took a break and used their night - vision cameras to record “ an intimate moment ” shared by a “ couple on the terrace of a Second Avenue penthouse . ”
Despite this incident , which only came to light because the same tape included images that had to be turned over to a defendant in an unrelated trial , Kelly has called for more aerial surveillance .
The commissioner apparently also got used to having the Fuji blimp at his disposal , though he noted that “ it ’s not easy to send blimps into the airspace over New York . ”
He then “ challenged the aerospace industry to find a solution ” that would , no doubt , bring the city closer to life under total surveillance .
Police Misconduct : The RNC
As a result of its long history of brutality , corruption , spying , silencing dissent , and engaging in illegal activities , the NYPD is a particularly secretive organization .
As such , the full story of the department ’s misconduct during the Republican National Convention has yet to be told ; but , even in an era of heightened security and defensiveness , what has emerged has n’t been pretty .
By April 2005 , New York Times journalist Jim Dwyer was already reporting that , “ of the 1,670 [ RNC arrest ] cases that have run their full course , 91 percent ended with the charges dismissed or with a verdict of not guilty after trial .
Many were dropped without any finding of wrongdoing , but also without any serious inquiry into the circumstances of the arrests , with the Manhattan district attorney ’s office agreeing that the cases should be ‘ adjourned in contemplation of dismissal . ' ”
In one case that went to trial , it was found that video footage of an arrest had been doctored to bolster the NYPD ’s claims .
( All charges were dropped against that defendant .
In 400 other RNC cases , by the spring of 2005 , video recordings had either demonstrated that defendants had not committed crimes or that charges could not be proved against them . )
Since shifting to “ zero - tolerance ” law enforcement policies under Mayor ( now Republican presidential candidate ) Rudolph Giuliani , the city has been employing a system of policing where arrests are used to punish people who have been convicted of no crime whatsoever , including , as at the RNC or the city ’s monthly Critical Mass bike rides , those who engage in any form of protest .
Prior to the Giuliani era , about half of all those “ arrested for low - level offenses would get a desk - appearance ticket ordering them to go to court . ”
Now the proportion is 10 percent .
( NYPD documents show that the decision to arrest protesters , not issue summonses , was part of the planning process prior to the RNC . )
Speaking at the 2007 meeting of the American Sociological Association , Michael P. Jacobson , Giuliani ’s probation and correction commissioner , outlined how the city ’s policy of punishing the presumed innocent works :
“ Essentially , everyone who ’s arrested in New York City , in the parlance of city criminal justice lingo , goes through ‘ the system ’ if you ’ve never gone through the system , even 24 hours  that ’s a shocking period of punishment .
It ’s debasing , it ’s difficult .
You ’re probably in a fairly gross police lockup .
You probably have no toilet paper .
You ’re given a baloney sandwich , and the baloney is green . ”
In 2005 , the Times ’ Dwyer revealed that at public gatherings since the time of the RNC , police officers had not only “ conducted covert surveillance of people protesting the Iraq war , bicycle riders taking part in mass rallies and even mourners at a street vigil for a cyclist killed in an accident , ” but had acted as agent provocateurs .
At the RNC , there were multiple incidents in which undercover agents influenced events or riled up crowds .
In one case , a “ sham arrest ” of “ a man secretly working with the police led to a bruising confrontation between officers in riot gear and bystanders . ”
In 2006 , the Civilian Complaint Review Board ( CCRB ) , reported “ that hundreds of Convention protesters may have been unnecessarily and unlawfully arrested because NYPD officials failed to give adequate orders to disperse and failed to afford protesters a reasonable opportunity to disperse . ”
Police Commissioner Kelly had no hesitation about rejecting the organization ’s report .
Still , these were strong words , considering the weakness of the source .
The overall impotence of the CCRB suggests a great deal about the NYPD ’s culture of unaccountability .
According to an ACLU report , the board “ investigates fewer than half of all complaints that it reviews , and it produces a finding on the merits in only three of ten complaints disposed of in any given year . ”
This inaction is no small thing , given the surge of complaints against NYPD officers in recent years .
In 2001 , before Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly came to power , the CCRB received 4,251 complaints .
By 2006 , the number of complaints had jumped by 80 percent to 7,669 .
Even more telling are the type of allegations found to be on the rise ( and largely ignored ) .
According to the ACLU , from 2005 to 2006 , complaints over the use of excessive force jumped 26.8 percent  “ nearly double the increase in complaints filed . ”
It was in this context that the planning for the RNC demonstrations took place .
In 2006 , in five internal police reports made public as part of a lawsuit , “ New York City police commanders candidly discuss[ed ] how they had successfully used ‘ proactive arrests , ’ covert surveillance and psychological tactics at political demonstrations in 2002 , and recommend [ed ] that those approaches be employed at future gatherings . ”
A draft report from the department ’s Disorder Control Unit had a not - so - startling recommendation , given what did happen at the RNC : “ Utilize undercover officers to distribute misinformation within the crowds . ”
According to Dwyer , for at least a year prior to those demonstrations , “ teams of undercover New York City police officers traveled to cities across the country , Canada and Europe ” to conduct covert surveillance of activists .
“ In hundreds of reports , stamped ‘ N.Y. P.D. Secret , ’ [ the NYPD ’s ]
Intelligence Division chronicled the views and plans of people who had no apparent intention of breaking the law , [ including ] street theater companies , church groups , and antiwar organizations , as well as environmentalists and people opposed to the death penalty , globalization , and other government policies . ”
Three elected city councilmen  Charles Barron , Bill Perkins , and Larry B. Seabrook  were even cited in the reports for endorsing a protest event held on Jan. 15 , 2004 , in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s birthday .
In August , the New York Times editorial page decried the city ’s continuing attempts to keep documents outlining the police department ’s spying and other covert activities secret :
“ The city of New York is waging a losing and ill - conceived battle for overzealous secrecy surrounding nearly 2,000 arrests during the 2004 Republican National Convention .
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly seemed to cast an awfully wide and indiscriminate net in seeking out potential troublemakers .
For more than a year before the convention , members of a police spy unit headed by a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency infiltrated a wide range of groups many of the targets posed no danger or credible threat . ”
The Times concluded that  coupled with Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s efforts to disrupt and criminalize protest during the convention week  “ police action helped to all but eliminate dissent from New York City during the Republican delegates ’ visit .
If that was the goal , then mission accomplished .
And civil rights denied . ”
Police Commissioner Kelly had a radically different take on his department ’s conduct .
Earlier this year , he claimed that “ the Republican National Convention was perhaps the finest hour in the history of the New York City Department . ”
Police Misconduct : 2007
“ Finest ” might seem a funny term for the NYPD ’s actions , but these days everyone ’s a relativist .
In the years since the RNC protests , the NYPD has been mired in scandal after scandal  from killing unarmed black men and “ violations of civil rights ” at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade to issuing “ sweeping generalizations ” that lead to “ labeling almost every American Muslim as a potential terrorist . ”
And , believe it or not , the racial and political scandals were but a modest part of the mix .
Add to them , killings , sexual assaults , kidnapping , armed robbery , burglary , corruption , theft , drug - related offenses , conspiracy  and that ’s just a start when it comes to crimes members of the force have been charged with .
It ’s a rap sheet fit for Public Enemy # 1 , and we ’re only talking about the story of the NYPD in the not - yet - completed year of 2007 .
For example , earlier this year a 13 - year NYPD veteran was “ arrested on charges of hindering prosecution , tampering with evidence , obstructing governmental administration , and unlawful possession of marijuana , ” in connection with the shooting of another officer .
In an unrelated case , two other NYPD officers were arrested and “ charged with attempted kidnapping , armed robbery , armed burglary , and other offenses . ”
In a third case , the New York Post reported that a “ veteran NYPD captain has been stripped of his badge and gun as part of a federal corruption probe that already has led to the indictment of an Internal Affairs sergeant who allegedly tipped other cops that they were being investigated . ”
And that is n’t the only NYPD cover - up allegation to surface of late .
With cops interfering in investigations of fellow cops and offering advice on how to deflect such probes , it ’s a wonder any type of wrongdoing surfaces .
Yet , the level of misconduct in the department appears to be sweeping enough to be irrepressible .
For instance , sex crime scandals have embroiled numerous officers  including one “ accused of sexually molesting his young stepdaughter , ” who pled guilty to “ a misdemeanor charge of child endangerment , ” and another “ at a Queens hospital charged with possessing and sharing child pornography . ”
In a third case , a member of the NYPD ’s School Safety Division was “ charged with the attempted rape and sexual abuse of a 14 - year - old girl . ”
In a fourth case , a “ police officer pleaded guilty to a grotesque romance with an infatuated 13 - year - old girl . ”
Meanwhile , an NYPD officer who molested women while on duty and in uniform was convicted of sexual abuse and official misconduct .
Cop - on - cop sexual misconduct of an extreme nature has also surfaced but why go on ?
You get the idea .
And , if you do n’t , there are lurid cases galore to check out , like the investigation into “ whether [ an ]
NYPD officer who fatally shot his teen lover before killing himself murdered the boyfriend of a past lover , ” or the officer who was “ charged with intentional murder in the shooting death of his 22 - year - old girlfriend . ”
And do n’t even get me started on the officer “ facing charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conspiracy to commit robberies of drugs and drug proceeds from narcotics traffickers . ”
All of this , and much more , has emerged in spite of the classic blue - wall - of - silence .
It makes you wonder :
In the surveillance state to come , are we going to be herded and observed by New York ’s finest lawbreakers ?
It ’s important to note that all of these cases have begun despite a striking NYPD culture of non-accountability .
Back in August , the New York Times noted that the “ Police Department has increasingly failed to prosecute New York City police officers on charges of misconduct when those cases have been substantiated by the independent board that investigates allegations of police abuse , officials of the board say . ”
Between March 1 , 2007 , and June 30 , 2007 , alone , the NYPD “ declined to seek internal departmental trials against 31 officers , most of whom were facing charges of stopping people in the street without probable cause or reasonable suspicion , according to the city ’s Civilian Complaint Review Board . ”
An ACLU report , “ Mission Failure : Civilian Review of Policing in New York City , 1994 - 2006 , ” released this month , delved into the issue in even greater detail .
The organization found that , between 2000 and 2005 , “ the NYPD disposed of substantiated complaints against 2,462 police officers : 725 received no discipline .
When discipline was imposed , it was little more than a slap on the wrist . ”
Much has come to light recently about the way the U.S. military has been lowering its recruitment standards in order to meet the demands of ongoing , increasingly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , including an increase in “ moral waivers ” allowing more recruits with criminal records to enter the services .
Well , it turns out that , on such policies , the NYPD has been a pioneering institution .
In 2002 , the BBC reported that “ New York ’s powerful police union accused the police department of allowing ‘ substandard ’ recruits onto the force . ”
Then , just months after the RNC protests , the New York Daily News exposed the department ’s practice of “ hiring applicants with arrest records and shoving others through without full background checks ” including those who had been “ charged with laundering drug money , assault , grand larceny , and weapons possession . ”
According to Sgt. Anthony Petroglia , who , until he retired in 2002 , had worked for almost a decade in the department ’s applicant - processing division , the NYPD was “ hiring people to be cops who have no respect for the law . ”
Another retiree from the same division was blunter : “ It ’s all judgment calls  bad ones but the bosses say , ‘ Send ’em through .
We ’ll catch the problem ones later . ' ”
The future looks bright , if you are an advocate of sending the force even further down this path .
The new choice to mold the department of tomorrow , according to the Village Voice , the “ NYPD ’s new deputy commissioner of training , Wilbur ‘ Bill ’ Chapman , should have no trouble teaching ‘ New York ’s Finest ’ about the pitfalls of sexual harassment , cronyism , and punitive transfers [ because h]e ’s been accused of all that during his checkered career . ”
In the eerie afterglow of 9/11 , haunted by the specter of terrorism , in an atmosphere where repressive zero - tolerance policies already rule , given the unparalleled power of Commissioner Kelly  called “ the most powerful police commissioner in the city ’s history ” by NYPD expert Leonard Levitt  and with a police department largely unaccountable to anyone ( as the only city agency without any effective outside oversight ) , the Escape from New York model may indeed represent Manhattan ’s future .
Nick Turse v. The City of New York
So what , you might still be wondering , was it that led the security official at the federal courthouse to raise the specter of my imminent demise ?
A weapon ?
An unidentified powder ?
No , a digital audio recorder .
“ Some people here do n’t want to be recorded , ” he explained in response to my quizzical look .
So I checked the recording device and , accompanied by my lawyer , the indomitable Mary D. Dorman , made my way to Courtroom 18D , a stately room in the upper reaches of the building that houses the oldest district court in the nation .
There , I met our legal nemesis , a city attorney whose official title is “ assistant corporation counsel . ”
After what might pass for a cordial greeting , he asked relatively politely whether I was going to accept the city ’s monetary offer of $ 8,500  which I had rejected the previous week to settle my lawsuit for false arrest .
As soon as I indicated I would n’t ( as I had from the moment the city started the bidding at $ 2,500 ) , any hint of cordiality fled the room .
Almost immediately , he was referring to me as a “ criminal ”  declassified NYPD documents actually refer to me as a “ perp . ”
Soon , he launched into a bout of remarkable bluster , threatening lengthy depositions to waste my time and monetary penalties associated with court costs that would swallow my savings .
Then , we were all directed to a small jury room off the main courtroom , where the city ’s attorney hauled out a threatening prop to bolster his act  an imposingly gigantic file folder stuffed with reams of “ Nick Turse ” documents , including copies of some of my disreputable TomDispatch articles as well as printouts of suspicious Web pages from the American Empire Project  the obviously criminal series that will be publishing my upcoming book , The Complex .
There , the litany of vague threats to tie me down with depositions , tax me with fees , and maybe , somehow , send me to jail for a “ crime ” that had been dismissed years earlier continued until a federal magistrate judge entered the room .
To him , the assistant corporation counsel and I told our versions of my arrest story  which turned out to vary little .
The basic details were the same .
As the city attorney shifted in his seat , I told the judge how , along with compatriots I ’d met only minutes before , I donned my “ WAR DEAD ” sign and descended into the subway surrounded by a phalanx of cops  plainclothes , regular uniformed , Big Brother - types from the Technical Assistance Response Unit ( TARU ) , and white - shirted brass , as well as a Washington Post photographer and legal observers from the National Lawyers Guild  and boarded our train .
I explained that we sat there looking as dead as possible for about 111 blocks and then , as the Washington Post reported , were arrested when we came back to life and “ tried to change trains . ”
I asked , admittedly somewhat rhetorically why , if I was such a “ criminal , ” none of the officers present at my arrest had actually showed up in court to testify against me when my case was dismissed out of hand back in 2004 ?
And why had n’t the prosecutor wanted to produce the video footage the NYPD had taken of the entire action and my arrest ?
And why had the city been trying to buy me off all these years since ?
Faced with the fact that his intimidation tactics had n’t worked , the city attorney now quit his bad - cop tactics , and I rose again out of the ditch of “ common criminality ” into citizenship and then to the high status of being addressed as “ Dr. Turse ” ( in a bow to my Ph.D. ) .
Offers and counteroffers followed , leading finally to a monetary settlement with a catch  I also wanted an apology .
If that guard had n’t directed me  under threat of being shot  to check my digital audio recorder at the door , I might have had a sound file of it to listen to for years to come .
Instead , I had to be content with the knowledge that an appointed representative of the City of New York not only had to ditch the Escape from New York model  at least for a day  pony up some money for violating my civil rights , and , before a federal magistrate judge , also issue me an apology , on behalf of the city , for wrongs committed by the otherwise largely unaccountable NYPD .
The Future of the NYPD and the Homeland - Security Statelet
I ’m under no illusions that this minor monetary settlement and apology were of real significance in a city where civil rights are routinely abridged , the police are a largely unaccountable armed force , and a culture of total surveillance is increasingly the norm .
But my lawsuit , when combined with those of my fellow arrestees , could perhaps have some small effect .
After all , less than a year after the convention , 569 people had already “ filed notices that they intended to sue the City , seeking damages totaling $ 859,014,421 , ” according to an NYCLU report .
While the city will end up paying out considerably less , the grand total will not be insignificant .
In fact , Jim Dwyer recently reported that the first 35 of 605 RNC cases had been settled for a total of $ 694,000 .
If New Yorkers began to agitate for accountability  demanding , for instance , that such settlements be paid out of the NYPD ’s budget  it could make a difference .
Then , every time New Yorkers ’ hard - earned tax - dollars were handed over to fellow citizens who were harassed , mistreated , injured , or abused by the city ’s police force that would mean less money available for the “ big expensive toys ” that the “ big boys ” of the NYPD ’s aviation unit use to record the private moments of unsuspecting citizens or the ubiquitous surveillance gear used not to capture the rest of the city on candid camera .
It would n’t put an end to the NYPD ’s long - running criminality or the burgeoning homeland security statelet that it ’s building , but it would , at least , introduce a tiny measure of accountability .
Such an effort might even begin a dialogue about the NYPD , its dark history , its current mandate under the Global War on Terror , and its role in New York City .
For instance , people might begin to examine the very nature of the department .
They might conclude that questions must be raised when institutions  be they rogue regimes , deleterious industries , unaccountable corporations , or fundamentally tainted government institutions  consistently , over many decades , evidence a persistent disregard for the law , a lack of accountability , and a deep resistance to reform .
Those directly affected by the NYPD , a nearly 38,000 - person force  larger than many armies  that has consistently flouted the law and has proven remarkably resistant to curtailing its own misconduct for well over a century , might even begin to wonder if it can be trusted to administer the homeland security state - let its top officials are fast implementing and , if not , what can be done about it .

An optical illusion is always characterized by visually perceived images that , at least in common sense terms , are deceptive or misleading .
Therefore , the information gathered by the eye is processed by the brain to give , on the face of it , a percept that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source .
This is a list of twenty amazing illusions .
20 Blivet
A blivet , also known as a poiuyt , is an undecipherable figure , an optical illusion and an impossible object .
It appears to have three cylindrical prongs at one end which then mysteriously transform into two rectangular prongs at the other end .
19 Bezold Effect
Advertisement
The Bezold Effect is an optical illusion , named after a German professor of meteorology , Wilhelm von Bezold ( 1837-1907 ) , who discovered that a color may appear different depending on its relation to adjacent colors .
In the above example , the red seems lighter combined with the white , and darker combined with the black .
18 Café Wall Illusion
The café wall illusion is an optical illusion , first described by Doctor Richard Gregory .
He observed this curious effect in the tiles of the wall of a café at the bottom of St Michael ’s Hill , Bristol .
This optical illusion makes the parallel straight horizontal lines appear to be bent .
To construct the illusion , alternating light and dark “ bricks ” are laid in staggered rows .
It is essential for the illusion that each “ brick ” is surrounded by a layer of “ mortar ” ( the grey in the image ) .
This should ideally be of a color in between the dark and light color of the “ bricks ” .
17 The Chubb Illusion
The Chubb illusion is an optical illusion wherein the apparent contrast of an object varies dramatically , depending on the context of the presentation .
Low - contrast texture surrounded by a uniform field appears to have higher contrast than when it is surrounded by high - contrast texture .
This was observed and documented by Chubb and colleagues in 1989 .
16 Ebbinghaus Illusion
The Ebbinghaus illusion is an optical illusion of relative size perception .
In the best - known version of the illusion , two circles of identical size are placed near to each other and one is surrounded by large circles while the other is surrounded by small circles ; the first central circle then appears smaller than the second central circle .
15 Fraser Spiral Illusion
The illusion is also known as the false spiral , or by its original name , the twisted cord illusion .
The overlapping black arc segments appear to form a spiral ; however , the arcs are a series of concentric circles .
14 Hermann Grid Illusion
The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870 while , incidentally , reading John Tyndall ’s Sound .
The illusion is characterised by “ ghostlike ” grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white ( or light - colored ) grid on a black background .
The grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection .
13 Hering Illusion
The Hering illusion is an optical illusion discovered by the German physiologist Ewald Hering in 1861 .
The two vertical lines are both straight , but they look as if they were bowed outwards .
The distortion is produced by the lined pattern on the background , that simulates a perspective design , and creates a false impression of depth .
12 Impossible Cube Illusion
The impossible cube or irrational cube is an impossible object that draws upon the ambiguity present in a Necker cube illustration .
An impossible cube is usually rendered as a Necker cube in which the edges are apparently solid beams .
This apparent solidity gives the impossible cube greater visual ambiguity than the Necker cube , which is less likely to be perceived as an impossible object .
The illusion plays on the human eye ’s interpretation of two - dimensional pictures as three - dimensional objects .
11 Isometric Illusion
An isometric illusion ( also called an ambiguous figure or inside / outside illusion ) is a type of optical illusion , specifically one due to multistable perception .
In the image above , the shape can be perceived as either an inside or an outside corner .
10 Jastrow Illusion
The Jastrow illusion is an optical illusion discovered by the American psychologist Joseph Jastrow in 1889 .
In this illustration , the two figures are identical , although the lower one appears to be larger .
9 Kanizsa Triangle
The Kanizsa triangle is an optical illusion first described by the Italian psychologist Gaetano Kanizsa in 1955 .
In the image above , a white equilateral triangle is perceived , but in fact none is drawn .
8 Lilac Chaser
Lilac chaser is a visual illusion , also known as the Pac - Man illusion .
It consists of 12 lilac ( or pink or magenta - like ) , blurred disks arranged in a circle ( like the numbers on a clock ) , around a small , black , central cross on a grey background .
One of the disks disappears briefly ( for about 0.1 second ) , then the next ( about 0.125 second later ) , and the next , and so on , in a clockwise direction .
When one stares at the cross for about 20 seconds or so , one first sees a gap running around the circle of lilac disks , then a green disk running around the circle of lilac disks , then a green disk running around on the grey background , the lilac disks appearing to have disappeared or to have been erased by the green disk .
7 Motion Illusion
One type of motion illusion is a type of optical illusion in which a static image appears to be moving due to the cognitive effects of interacting color contrasts and shape position .
To properly view this effect , click the image above to see the full sized version .
6 Necker Cube
The Necker cube is an ambiguous line drawing .
It is a wire - frame drawing of a cube in isometric perspective , which means that parallel edges of the cube are drawn as parallel lines in the picture .
When two lines cross , the picture does not show which is in front and which is behind .
This makes the picture ambiguous ; it can be interpreted two different ways .
When a person stares at the picture , it will often seem to flip back and forth between the two valid interpretations ( so - called multistable perception ) .
5 Orbison Illusion
The Orbison illusion is an optical illusion that was first described by the psychologist William Orbison in 1939 .
The bounding rectangle and inner square both appear distorted in the presence of the radiating lines .
The background gives us the impression there is some sort of perspective .
As a result , our brain sees the shape distorted .
This is a variant of the Hering and Wundt illusions .
4 Poggendorff Illusion
The Poggendorff Illusion is an optical illusion that involves the brain ’s perception of the interaction between diagonal lines and horizontal and vertical edges .
It is named after Johann Poggendorff ( 1796 - 1877 ) , a German physicist who first described it in 1860 .
In the image above , a straight black and red line is obscured by a grey rectangle .
The blue line appears , instead of the red line , to be the same as the black one , which is clearly shown not to be the case in the second picture .
3 Adelson ’s Checker Shadow Illusion
The image shows what appears to be a black and white checker - board with a green cylinder resting on it that casts a shadow diagonally across the middle of the board .
The black and white squares are actually different shades of gray .
The image has been constructed so that “ white ” squares in the shadow , one of which is labeled “ B , ” are actually the exact same gray value as “ black ” squares outside the shadow , one of which is labeled “ A . ” The two squares A and B appear very different as a result of the illusion .
2 White Illusion
White ’s illusion is an optical illusion illustrating the fact that the same target luminance can elicit different perceptions of brightness in different contexts .
Note , that although the gray rectangles are all of equal luminance , the ones seen in the context with the dark stripes appear brighter than the ones seen in the context with the bright stripes .
Note that this effect is opposite to what would be expected from a simple physiological explanation on the basis of simultaneous contrast ( in that case the rectangles sharing the long borders with the dark stripes should appear brighter ) .
1 Zöllner Illusion
In this figure the black lines seem to be unparallel , but in reality they are parallel .
The shorter lines are on an angle to the longer lines .
This angle helps to create the impression that one end of the longer lines is nearer to us than the other end .
This is very similar to the way the Wundt illusion appears .
It may be that the Zöllner illusion is caused by this impression of depth .
A wave of Zombie survival manuals have popped up recently , this one included , telling people what they should do during an outbreak of zombies .
Thing is , nobody ’s talking about what people should n’t do during a zombie outbreak .
Fortunately for you , our Zombiephile has scoured popular zombie movies and has isolated the Ten WORST Things to Do During a Zombie Outbreak .
Sit back , enjoy , and take notes , Zombiephiles .
Ten WORST
Things to Do During a Zombie Outbreak
10 .
Do n’t set zombies on fire .
Burning zombies smell terrible .
We ’re not sure why you see it in every zombie movie , but it stands to reason that the only thing worse than a zombie is a flaming zombie .
Remember , it can take a long time for a zombie to burn to death – more than ten minutes , in some recorded cases .
Do you really want a burning zombie lighting you and your friends on fire ?
Play it safe – chances are good that there wo n’t be much fire - fighting infrastructure in place during a zombie outbreak if things get out of hand .
9 . Do n’t get sentimental .
Zombies wo n’t .
Sure , it ’s your house .
Sure , they were your family and friends .
But now it ’s a zombie nest , and they ’re zombies .
Stick around , and your best chance is to become zombie food – worst case , you ’ll end up a zombie like the rest .
Zombies do n’t have any feelings – neither should you .
8 . Do n’t forget to shut the door behind you .
Zombies often come over without calling first .
Were you born in a barn ?
Zombies might not be the brightest , but they know an open door when they see one .
Keep your suburban zombie fortress secure by remembering to close and lock the door behind you .
And do n’t slam it either !
Zombies hate that .
7 . Do n’t keep zombies in the basement .
Even if they are your zombie family .
Devotion to family and friends is touching .
However , you do n’t want them to be touching you , after they ’re dead .
Do yourself a favor and make sure you put zombie friends and family down properly .
Remember , there is no zombie cure , and keeping them around only prolongs their suffering and increases the risk for everyone .
Besides , do you really want to get eaten by your buddies ?
6 . Do n’t try to reunite with friends / family over long distances .
Seems like a great idea , does n’t it ?
That ’s what everyone thinks .
Look , do the math .
If you leave your house at noon , heading toward your mum ’s , traveling 3 km per hour , and a crowd of zombies leaves the general vicinity of your mum’s at the same time , heading toward you at 1 km per hour , what time will you get eaten by zombies ?
Skip the math and consult rule # 9 .

Last spring , Cal graduate student Mandy Johnson wrote a paper looking at why parents picked certain schools in the choice - based San Francisco district .
" I just thought it would be interesting , " says Johnson , who is now a policy analyst for the district .
" I realized that it could be explosive if I could prove this . "
Working at Cal's Goldman School of Public Policy , Johnson analyzed the data from the 2006 - 07 school year .
The two top factors correlated with high demand for a seat in a particular school were its academic performance and the availability of special classes like language immersion .
The top factors correlated with low demand were the prevalence of low - income students and - here 's the really troubling one - race .
Specifically , Johnson found , " as the percentage of African American students in the school increases , kindergarten demand decreases . "
By the way , for those assuming this is something that can be explained away by the interplay of race and poverty , it is n't .
Johnson said she used a statistical tool called regression analysis , which allowed her to isolate factors such as income and skin color .
For example , the researcher found no correlation between school choice and the number of Latino students , who are disproportionately lower - income .
Chris Rosenberg , principal of ethnically diverse Starr King Elementary , laid it out for me in clear terms .
" The bottom line is that many people do not feel comfortable sending their kids to a school with a lot of African American students , " says Rosenberg , who has been at Starr King for 12 years , four as principal .
" It 's a crying shame .
It 's terrible .
But it is a sad and obvious truth in our schools .
And no one wants to touch it . "
Actually , that 's not true .
San Francisco school board President Mark Sanchez , who is a teacher , has decided to speak up .
He read Johnson 's report and is attempting to use it as a way of starting a dialogue about something " our society does n't want to talk about . "
" We need to bring this out on the table and have a discussion , " says Sanchez .
" Nobody is going to come out and say they did n't choose a school because it had too many black kids .
But they do n't have to . "
Sanchez is n't just interested in this as a moral issue .
There 's a practical matter , too .
With African American families leaving San Francisco , schools are losing black students .
But as Sanchez says , when students leave those predominantly black schools , " nobody is willing to fill those seats . "
The result is that schools in minority neighborhoods are continually threatened with closure because they are losing enrollment .
" It 's a bad outcome , " Sanchez says .
" We know that there are so many things these kids are up against , to have their school , their community center , close is difficult . "
In 1982 , a federal consent decree required San Francisco Unified School District to fulfill racial ratios at each school .
But in 1994 , Chinese American families successfully sued to eliminate racial considerations .
In 2005 , the consent decree ended , and the district is now operating under a " choice - based " model , which allows families to rank their preferred schools and usually get one of their top two picks .
Although schools have responded with more programs and desirable amenities , racial balance has proved increasingly difficult to achieve .
As Johnson says , " The district has two problems : Enrollment is going down , and segregation is going up . "
Skeptics will say we are exaggerating the problem .
After all , it may not be racial .
Who wants to send their kid to a school in a bad neighborhood ?
Rosenberg admits that Starr King is not far from the Potrero housing projects .
" I get a lot of questions from parents about safety , " says Rosenberg , a white man who majored in African American studies in college .
" But John Yehall Chin Elementary ( on Broadway ) is a really good school with a lot of strip clubs around it .
Do you think they get asked about safety ?
The fact is , people do n't care so much about the environment when it does not include black people . "
If anything , this is an accepted fact among those who work in education .
School board member Kim - Shree Maufas , who is the first African American member of the board in 10 years , says , " It does n't surprise me . "
" I recognize it and am very disturbed that people are selecting on that basis , " Maufas says .
" But I 'm on to thinking about the next step . "
That 's the tough part - doing something to change perceptions .
As Sanchez says , not only is race a difficult and sensitive topic , most parents do n't even want to discuss it .
" And they especially do n't want to talk about it if they are going to be blamed , " Sanchez says .
" We are not saying you are a bad person if you did n't choose these schools . "
Keeping the volume down during the discussion is a must .
As Johnson says about her research , " It 's real easy to see something like this and fly off the handle - whichever way you want to fly off the handle . "
Sanchez would like to see some greater incentives to encourage students to give schools with African American pupils a try .
" One of the ways I would propose is that , if you go to an ethnically added school , " meaning one disproportionately black , " you would get points for going to college , " Sanchez says .
" People would be beating down the doors to get in . "
That would certainly be a change .
As it stands now , parents make tours of schools to see which ones they might be interested in .
( Asian and white parents , Johnson found , are much more likely to exercise their choice options . )
The parents look at the neighborhood , talk to the teachers , and check out the classrooms .
But , Rosenberg says , that 's not how they make their decision .
" When people come into some schools and they see a bunch of black kids , I can see it in their faces - ' Thanks , but no thanks , ' " he says .
" Basically , racism is a big factor in the choices people are making in San Francisco .
" I can say that as a sad fact . "
Giuliani has long been a critic of the idea of a Palestinian state
In an essay , he said it was not in the US interest to help create a state that , he said , would support terrorism .
He also said he would consider talks with Iran , so long as its rulers understood the US might be prepared to destroy Iran 's nuclear infrastructure .
The former New York mayor leads polls for the Republican party 's nomination .
Outlining his foreign policy views in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs magazine , Mr Giuliani said too much emphasis had been placed on brokering negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
Palestinian statehood will have to be earned through sustained good governance , a clear commitment to fighting terrorism , and a willingness to live in peace with Israel
Rudy Giuliani
" It is not in the interest of the United States , at a time when it is being threatened by Islamist terrorists , to assist the creation of another state that will support terrorism , " he wrote .
" Palestinian statehood will have to be earned through sustained good governance , a clear commitment to fighting terrorism , and a willingness to live in peace with Israel .
" America 's commitment to Israel 's security is a permanent feature of our foreign policy . "
President George W Bush is in favour of a Palestinian state and has been seeking to bolster the position of Palestinian Authority President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas .
' Position of strength '
Mr Giuliani has been a consistent critic of the idea of a Palestinian state and of Palestinian leaders .
In 1995 , as New York 's mayor , he banned the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from city - sponsored events related to the United Nations ' 50th anniversary celebrations .
Mr Giuliani said the US might enter negotiations with Iran from a " position of strength " .
" The theocrats ruling Iran need to understand that we can wield the stick as well as the carrot , by undermining popular support for their regime , damaging the Iranian economy , weakening Iran 's military , and , should all else fail , destroying its nuclear infrastructure , " he said .
In an airless rehearsal studio , hidden away among the anonymous warehouses of New York 's meat - packing district , Philip Glass and his ensemble are making final preparations for a rare performance of his 1974 landmark piece of pure minimalism , Music In 12 Parts .
It takes six hours to perform , a work that pushes the boundaries of musical and mental stamina .
It begins innocently enough , the opening of part one sounding like a chorus of angels , their needle stuck in some serene , celestial groove .
But soon the arpeggios of Glass 's Hammond organ break over the audience , releasing a torrent of shimmering octave notes and pounding triads .
As the phrases repeat mercilessly the impression of heavy machinery at full throttle , cogs spinning furiously , pistons shunting back and forth , is hard to escape .
Even in the stuffy rehearsal room , the impact of this bleak , mutating sonic landscape is alternately jarring , grating , mesmeric .
For the musicians - three other keyboards , soprano , tenor and alto saxes , flute and solo voice - the whole process is infinitely more exacting .
The scores look less like conventional musical annotation than the peaks and troughs of a cardiograph .
The only guide through the maze of dizzying circular melodies and perpetual rhythmic motions is Glass himself , who sits at his keyboard in the centre , periodically throwing his head forward in a manner not unlike a rock - guitarist launching into a power chord , the signal that nudges the music on from one whirling passage to the next .
During a break , Glass outlines some of the difficulties involved : " If we were to attempt this work , " he says , " without preparing ourselves just the way a runner would , or a swimmer , or anybody who was involved with any demanding physical activity , we would be in trouble . "
At this point he is joined by the craggy , lanky figure of Michael Reisman , musical director and primary keyboard player of the ensemble .
" Occasionally , I get not so much concentration lapses as fog - brain fog , " says Reisman .
" After the fourth hour , I sometimes get to the point where I start looking down at my hands and I can see them moving but I do n't feel it 's me any more . "
Glass chuckles , and takes his place again behind the keyboard .
" The trance aspect of the music is a misnomer , " he says , releasing a flourish of arpeggios .
" It 's music that requires alertness all the time - if you space out , without any doubt you 'll get lost .
The audience might have that privilege , but we do n't . "
In the quarter of a century since the conception of this unashamedly avant - garde work , Philip Glass has risen to become the world 's most celebrated contemporary composer .
Commanding fees in the range of £ 230,000 , the sum which New York 's Metropolitan opera house stumped up for The Voyage in 1992 , he now has over a dozen full - length operas to his name .
While pioneers such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley may have first explored the form , it is Glass who is widely regarded as the founding father and figure - head of minimalism , one of the most influential movements of recent times .
" Philip is probably the most successful living composer , and the one who has attracted the highest rate of commission fee since Verdi wrote Aida , " says fellow minimalist Gavin Bryars .
" His operas especially have been instrumental in opening up opera houses to a new and younger audience .
His best operas - Satyagraha , Akhnaten , The Fall Of The House of Usher - are major works in the genre and stand out as some of the high points of late 20th - century opera . "
On December 6 , the BBC Symphony Orchestra will celebrate this achievement with a composer portrait of Glass at the Barbican in London to include the UK premieres of his second and third symphonies .
December also sees the release on the Nonesuch label of a five - disc compilation of his sound - track work , entitled Philip on Film .
However , as Music
In 12 Parts graphically demonstrates , Glass 's journey is all the more extraordinary for having begun on the fringes of downtown New York 's non-commercial experimentalism .
The radicalism of early pieces , which also included the equally repetitive and scaled - down Music In Fifths , 1969 , and Music With Changing Parts , 1970 , enraged audiences and baffled critics .
" Music of Philip Glass Called Sonic Torture , " was the headline on one critic 's view in 1973 , which continued with " Music In Fifths sent a number of listeners racing out , their hands covering their ears .
Through the performance , the audience continued to dwindle steadily . "
The turning point came in 1976 with the landmark Einstein On The Beach , a startling five - hour collaboration with theatre director Robert Wilson , for which Glass supplied a scintillating score that wore its structure , rather like the Pompidou Centre , on the outside .
" One of the seminal artworks of the century , " raved the Washington Post , " possibly the seminal work . "
Glass cemented his reputation with the subsequent two instalments of his trilogy , Satyagraha , 1980 and Akhnaten , 1984 .
Then , having brought his work to the very boundaries of the definition of music , Glass proceeded in the 80s and 90s , to bring it all the way back again .
" After stripping it down to a tiny subset , " says Reisman , " he has gradually introduced one element after another to the point where the symphonic music he is writing today could have come from an entirely different place . "
Some have been disappointed by the conventional nature of pieces such as Hydrogen Jukebox 1990 , with a libretto by Allen Ginsberg ; The Voyage , based on Columbus 's discovery of America ; and Glass 's trilogy of operas based on Cocteau 's films La Belle et La Bête , Orphée and Les Enfants Terribles .
But , as others point out , the individual works are now dwarfed by Philip Glass the cultural phenomenon .
" His success goes beyond classical music , " says producer David Free man , who brought Akhnaten to the stage .
" It is very hard to sit through an entire evening of television without coming across some sort of sub-Philip Glass rip - off music .
He has become part of the musical lingua franca of our time . "
Sitting in the claustrophobic back yard of his brownstone apartment in New York 's East Village , Glass now bristles at the very mention of the term " minimalism " , which he feels distorts conceptions of his music and traps it in the past .
" People hear what they want to hear , see what they want to see , " he grumbles .
" If someone is told that a work is going to repeat over and over again they will hear it . "
But even he expresses a certain degree of wry surprise that the music has proved quite so versatile and enduring .
" When it first came out , people said ' where can this music go ? " ' he says , betraying the flicker of a grin .
" Well , it turns out it can go everywhere . "
In conversation , Glass is naturally understated , deadpan , droll , with a distracted professorial air .
People generally take to him .
" What really impressed me is that he is so humble by nature , " says Ravi Shankar who worked with him on the record Passages .
" He is very simple , all these are things that are very rare in western people , particularly in famous ones . "
Glass has had his fair share of incendiary confrontations , the most famous being with Robert Wilson after Einstein On The Beach , when exhaustion , a shared $ 150,000 debt and what one friend has described as Glass 's legendary canniness with money contributed to an icy silence that did not crack for years .
And in relation to his own work , Glass is anything but easy - going .
" This is one of the most disciplined guys you will ever meet , " says Godfrey Reggio , director of the Qatsi film trilogy , for which Glass has provided the sound - track .
" He has literally 100 things going at once and all with the same careful attention . "
Whether in New York , or at the fisherman 's lodge in Nova Scotia which he bought with his first wife , the theatre director JoAnne Akalaitis , Glass rises at 6 am , and launches into an iron - clad regime of work that only accommodates a modest break in the afternoon to deal with logistical matters .
" The perfect timetable for Philip is when he can step off the plane and straight out on stage , with absolutely no time wasted , " says Jim Woodard , tour manager for the ensemble .
" Sometimes , I 'll get him to the venue 20 minutes early , and he 'll look at me as if to say : ' What am I supposed to do now ?
What am I doing here ?
I could have written a page of music in this time . ' "
Earlier this year , Glass married Holly Critchlow , a restaurant manager and businesswoman some 30 years his junior .
This relationship followed a particularly difficult period in Glass 's life after his third wife , the artist Candy Jernigan , died unexpectedly of liver cancer in 1991 aged 39 .
" It was diagnosed very late , " he says .
" She found out six or seven weeks before she died .
She was going to live forever , as far as I was concerned .
It was a big shock for everybody , particularly the kids .
Especially for people her age it was a big surprise . "
Jernigan 's bold , pop- influenced paintings , bearing titles such as All Kinds Of Dope and Goya Beans still decorate his walls .
A Buddhist and vegetarian ( and a vegan until his friend Doris Lessing convinced him of the dangers of dwindling bone density ) , Glass has never been more productive or content .
He says " I 'm a highly socialised person .
I had a few wives , I have a number of kids and I have lots of friends .
I have an ensemble , but besides that I have a recording studio and a production company .
It is a bit of a nuisance to fit everything in , since I also need hours and hours to write music . "
Philip Glass was born on January 31 1937 in Baltimore , Maryland , to Jewish immigrant parents , Benjamin Charles Glass and Ida , née Gouline .
His father was a radio repair man who decided to diversify by stocking records .
" Very quickly , I guess , the records took over the store , " Glass recalls , " but he still kept a little place at the back where he fixed radios , because he liked to do it . "
It was here that young Philip was first exposed to a staggering variety of music , from bebop to hillbilly as well as more offbeat works by composers like Bartok and Hindemith , which his father brought home .
" He told me later that he listened to these records to see what was wrong with them .
He wanted to figure out why they did n't sell .
That was his motivation .
Because he was a practical guy . "
Glass has an older sister , Sheppie , who has worked for humanitarian organisations , and a younger brother Martin , a businessman who lives in Baltimore .
At the age of eight Philip became the youngest - ever student at Baltimore 's prestigious Peabody Institute , taking lessons in violin and flute , and by his mid-teens was already composing .
Then at 15 , he took up a place at the University of Chicago to study mathematics and philosophy .
Soon , however , he found himself gravitating towards the music department , where he discovered the work of Charles Ives , Aaron Copland , Roy Harris and William Schuman .
He also took piano lessons from fellow student , Marcus Raskin .
" One day I was in the lounge playing the piano , " says Raskin , who is now head of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies , " and he came up and he said : ' You know , I would like very much to learn to play - and can we begin with Bach ?
So , that is what we did ; with two - part inventions . "
Raskin remembers a focused , eloquent and assertive young man , who even at such a young age seemed to have an idea of where he was going .
He says , " He knew what he wanted to do and was prepared to bear the cost . "
After college , Glass went back to Baltimore and spent six months working as a crane operator at the Bethlehem steel mills to earn money for his postgraduate studies .
In 1957 , aged 20 , he arrived in New York to take up a place on the composition course at the Juilliard School , where students included that other minimalist firebrand Steve Reich and the teaching staff was led by Vincent Persichetti and William Bergsma .
After experiments in Chicago with 12 - tone serialism , it was here that Glass began composing in earnest , producing about 75 pieces over the five years of the course : " His music then was quite lyrical , " remembers fellow student Peter Schickele , better known as the composer PDQ Bach .
" Someone like Samuel Barber came to mind .
There was a kind of dissonance between Philip 's music and his tastes in cinema or literature , which were much darker ; Ingmar Bergman and Céline were his chief passions . "
It was also in New York that Glass cemented his relationship with JoAnne Akalaitis , then an aspiring actress he had met during his time in Chicago and would go on to marry in 1965 .
The y had two children , Zachary , born in 1969 , now a budding songwriter , and Juliet , born 1971 , a professor of history .
Akalaitas says " I remember he invited me to go on a motorcycle to Aspen , Colorado .
Phil at that time was a great biker .
He loved road bikes and had this great big white BMW .
It was very beautiful . "
After graduating from Juilliard , Glass spent two years on a composer in residence scheme in the Pittsburgh public school system .
Then in 1964 , with Akalaitis following shortly afterwards , he sailed for Paris on the Queen Mary to study with the legendary music teacher Nadia Boulanger : " I was working six or eight hours a day just filling up pages and pages of music paper , " Glass recalls .
" The worst time was the 12 o'clock lesson .
Since Boulanger never stopped to eat , her lunch was served to her at - or rather on - the piano .
My attention was torn between the very real danger of food sliding onto our laps and the much more serious danger of her discovering that ' hidden fifths ' had somehow slipped into my music . "
However , if Boulanger gave Glass the technical framework for his radical new direction , the catalyst was an encounter with Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar , who was working on the sound - track to the Conrad Rook film Chappaqua .
Given the job of transcribing the music to western notation , Glass first discovered the Indian use of rhythm " in developing an overall structure in music " .
In reaction to the infinite variations of the European serialists , who , Glass now believed , " wielded much more power than their appeal justified " and inspired by much of the progressive theatre work he had seen in Paris , including Beckett 's and Brecht's , Glass now used these twin influences to pare down music to its reductive , basic elements .
Fittingly , it was in Akalaitis 's own Paris theatre company , an ad - hoc group of ex-pat friends including Lee Breuer , Ruth Maleczech and Terry O'Reilly but which would soon become known as the seminal avant - garde group Mabou Mines , that Glass 's new minimalist direction was first unveiled .
" I think I was the first to play Philip 's new departure , " says saxophonist Jack Kripl , who played Glass 's music for a production of Beckett 's Play .
" It was two notes , some sort of minor interval , played over and over .
It was very enticing , and very technically demanding , which was I suppose a way of keeping that tension .
These little intervals seemed to be a very powerful way of controlling the atmosphere . "
After a grand backpacking tour through Turkey , Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and India , Glass and Akalaitis returned to New York early in 1967 .
Within a few years their marriage had began to unravel .
" I can hardly remember why , " says Glass , " No - one threw anything at anybody .
I think she was glad to get rid of me . "
They finally divorced in 1980 , and Glass married Luba Burtyk , a doctor .
Back in New York , Glass renounced his earlier work and began to explore the possibilities of his new minimalist direction , with pieces such as Music In Fifths , Music In Similar Motion , both also from 1969 , which were little more than single , haunting phrases played ad infinitum and at deafening volume .
However , it was only with Music With Changing Parts , 1970 , a swirling miasma of pulsating arpeggios that Glass began to fully develop his theory of " additive process " in which repetitions of musical phrases mutate slowly by the periodic addition of extra notes , and " cyclical structure " , the process whereby two or more different rhythmic patterns played simultaneously arrive naturally back at a point of synchronicity .
The purest and most uncompromising realisation of these theories came with Music
In 12 Parts , originally intended as a short exploration of 12 lines of counterpoint , but which grew into a mammoth study in rarefied , hypnotic minimalism .
" I played it for a friend of mine , " says Glass , " and when it was through she said , ' That 's very beautiful ; what are the other 11 parts going to be like ? '
I decided to take it as a challenge and compose 11 more parts . "
Critical reactions to these pieces was often extremely negative .
" It is as if Beethoven had made his entire career rewriting the first movement of the Moonlight Sonata , " complained one critic .
In 1973 , a local Cleveland paper complained : " There was admittedly a certain masochistic fascination in the process .
And when the music finally stopped , there was the satisfying feeling of relief that came from having suffered and survived . "
Throughout this period , Glass supported himself as a New York cabbie and as a plumber , occupations that often led to unusual encounters .
" I had gone to install a dishwasher in a loft in SoHo , " he says .
" While working , I suddenly heard a noise and looked up to find Robert Hughes , the art critic of Time magazine , staring at me in disbelief .
' But you 're Philip Glass !
What are you doing here ? '
It was obvious that I was installing his dishwasher and I told him I would soon be finished .
' But you are an artist , ' he protested .
I explained that I was an artist but that I was sometimes a plumber as well and that he should go away and let me finish . "
The project that would propel Glass from downtown New York notoriety to international stardom came in 1976 - an avant - garde music theatre collaboration with theatre visionary Robert Wilson .
Glass had his first encounter with Wilson 's work at a 1974 performance of the glacial , imagist 1974 piece The Life And Times Of Joseph Stalin , and they immediately hit it off .
Wilson says , " We readily understood one another because we thought alike .
The way he was making music and how I was structuring theatre , it was very similar .
We had a common sense of time . "
Initial suggestions for subject matter included Hitler and Gandhi , but once they settled on Einstein , the piece began to evolve .
" We met once a week in a little restaurant , " says Glass , " and over six or eight months Bob produced a book of drawings that became the basis of Einstein and in turn became the basis of the music . "
Wilson 's non-narrative , pictorial libretto , in which Einstein 's theories and aspects of his biography were transformed into huge space ships and ghostly trains , and Glass 's incantatory score , with its solfège arias [ sung to the same syllable or syllables ] and soaring streams of arpeggios has been cited as the perfect fusion of sound and image , though the two rarely discussed each other 's contribution .
" The only comment that Bob ever made was in the final rehearsal , " says Glass .
" I was using a piccolo for a certain section and he said : ' Is n't that a little shrill ? '
I changed it to a flute . "
Einstein on the Beach was premiered in Avignon on July 25 1976 .
Glass and Wilson were then offered the option of two performances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York , where the critical reaction was delirious : " One listens to the music just as one watches Wilson 's shifting tableaus , " wrote John Rockwell in the New York Times , " and somehow , without knowing it , one crosses the line from being puzzled or irritated to being absolutely bewitched . "
The day after the performance , Glass was back driving his taxi : " I vividly remember the moment , shortly after the Met adventure , " he says , " when a well - dressed woman got into my cab .
After noting the name of the driver , she leaned forward and said : ' Young man , do you realise you have the same name as a very famous composer ' . "
Einstein had , however , changed everything .
During the tour , Glass was approached by Hans de Roo , head of the Netherlands Opera .
" Well , Philip , that was very interesting , " he said , alluding to the fact that the piece was performed by Glass 's ensemble and sung by semi-professionals .
" Now , how would you like to write a ' real ' opera ? "
Glass immediately decided on subject matter that had been rejected by Wilson during the process of formulating Einstein : Mahatma Gandhi 's formative period working as a lawyer in South Africa .
Research on the piece that became Satyagraha began with a trip to India , in the company of librettist Constance De Jong .
Slowly , a libretto was created that combined elements of Gandhi 's life with extracts from the Bhagavad - Gita .
" We really shepherded the work from my kitchen table to the premiere , " says De Jong .
" It was never outside our hands for very long . "
However , a " real " opera brought new challenges , including a full quota of divas who fiercely resisted the unorthodox choice of Sanskrit as the predominant language of the libretto .
" A lot of the singers were appalled by the idea , " says De Jong , who was given the job of teaching the dead language phonetically to the chorus .
However , most mutinous were the musicians , who objected to the continuous repetitions .
" Oh my goodness they were horrible , " moans Glass .
" At one point , they just put down their instruments and walked out . "
However , no - one could argue with the overwhelmingly positive critical reaction to Glass 's lush , beguiling score when the opera was premiered in Amsterdam in 1981 .
New York Times reviewer Robert Jones , who had described Glass 's early works as " lacking even the sophistication to raise them into the class of the primitive " was now enthusing that Satyagraha " shines with a luminous beauty that makes it the most sensually appealing of all Glass 's works " .
A commission of the third instalment of the trilogy came in 1982 from the Stuttgart Opera .
Glass soon settled on the subject matter of the 18th dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Akhnaten , credited as the founder of monotheism .
Again the singers balked at the prospect of tackling a libretto assembled from fragments of the Babylonian language of Akkadian , ancient Hebrew and ancient Egyptian .
However , the orchestration is far more conventional in tone and colour than its predecessors , signalling a move away from avant - garde experimentation .
" Einstein remains not only among my greatest achievements but I do n't know any contemporary opera which has challenged the form as much , " Glass says .
" But I could see no point in writing Son Of Einstein . "
Since completing the trilogy , Glass 's output has been impressive .
He has written over a dozen new operas , including The Making Of The Representative of Planet 8 ( 1988 ) , with a libretto by Doris Lessing ; The Voyage ( 1992 ) and 1000 Airplanes On The Roof ( 1988 ) , with libretti by David Henry Hwang ; and collaborations with Wilson , including a 3 - D opera Monsters Of Grace ( 1998 ) , and White Raven , seen earlier this year at New York 's Lincoln Centre .
Some have lamented that the earlier , ascetic rigour of the work has disappeared .
But others feel it has simply grown richer and more mature : " Before , with that minimal thing he did , it was very much a type or genre of music , " says Shankar , " but this past 10 years I find he has grown so much and there are so many different aspects .
His creative range has become so much larger . "
The last decade has also seen upheavals in Glass 's personal life , in particular Candy Jernigen 's death in 1991 .
However , five years ago Glass met Holly Critchlow , now his fourth wife .
" The age difference does n't seem to be a hurdle .
But that is partly because I 've always had younger friends and collaborators , " he says , adding " I 've outlived one wife .
So I am not so sanguine as to think that I wo n't outlive this one .
One thing that you find out is that you have no way of knowing .
It is completely unpredictable . "
However , from Music
In 12 Parts through Einstein all the way to the 6th symphony on which he is currently working , one aspect of Glass 's life has remained constant : " I am still trying to write melodies which are truly beautiful and fresh and unexpected .
It 's very simple : I find playing music and writing music very challenging .
It has n't gotten any easier as I 've gotten older .
And after 50 years of composing , that is an achievement in itself .
It is still engrossing enough to get me up early and keep me working all day . "

Although the court gave no reason for its order , Mr. Turner , convicted of murdering his adoptive parents in 1998 , had appealed to the court after it agreed Tuesday to consider the constitutionality of lethal injection , the most commonly used method of execution in the United States .
Several legal experts said the Supreme Court reprieve would be seen by most states as a signal to halt all executions until the court determined , probably some time next year , whether the current chemical formulation used for lethal injections amounts to cruel and unusual punishment barred by the Eighth Amendment .
Eleven states had halted executions for that reason .
On Thursday , Alabama stayed an execution for 45 days to come up with a new formula .
“ There is a momentum quality to this , ” said Douglas A. Berman , a law professor at Ohio State University who has a blog , Sentencing Law and Policy .
“ Not only the Supreme Court granting the stay , but also the Alabama governor doing a reprieve that is likely to lead to other states with executions on the horizon waiting to see what the Supreme Court does .
I ’ll be surprised if many , and arguably if any states other than Texas , go through with executions this year . ”
On his blog on Friday , Professor Berman predicted that there would be few if any executions in the country for the next 9 to 18 months , while the court deliberates and , later , as lower courts parse the meaning of its eventual ruling .
Operation Deep Freeze 2007 - 08 begins
by Tech . Sgt. Shane A. Cuomo
Air Force News Agency
8/21/2007 - CHRISTCHURCH , New Zealand ( AFPN ) -- Operation Deep Freeze 2007 - 08 winter flights began Aug. 20 ending more than five months of isolation for the research station as the first C - 17 Globemaster III delivered passengers and cargo to McMurdo Station , Antarctica .
Landing 15 miles from McMurdo Station at Pegasus Runway , the C - 17s will carry in scientists and support members to start early pre-summer projects , augment maintenance personnel and prepare skyways and ice runways at McMurdo Station .
Winter fly - in , called WinFly , is the first of three phases for Operation Deep Freeze that sets the stage for the U.S. Antarctic Program .
" We bring people down that will begin construction on what is called the ' annual sea ice ' runway , which is very close to McMurdo , " said Lt. Col.
Jim McGann , the 304th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron commander .
When people arrive at Antarctica , they have to take about an hour trip from Pegasus Runway to McMurdo Station .
Once the 10,000 feet by 220 feet annual sea ice runway is completed , the trip will be just 10 minutes that allows quicker downloads and less exposure to the weather .
" We like it because they build us a nice runway .
They like it because the C - 17 is closer and it makes the travel time a lot quicker , " Colonel McGann said .
Operation Deep Freeze is a demanding mission due to the extreme adversity of the environment and remoteness of Antarctica .
For WinFly , and for all of the seasons , there are few options .
The C - 17 carries unusual loads and has to deal with weather that can change in 30 minutes .
To meet the challenges , a joint force of active - duty and Reserve members are assembled to complete the difficult tasks safely and efficiently .
" My pilots are picked because of their judgment and their ability to make the right decision .
The loadmasters are the same way , " Colonel McGann said .
" Both positions have to be highly intuitive .
They have to be able to think on their feet and they have to be able to make the right decisions . "
Transitioning McMurdo Station from a quiet , isolated winter camp to a logistical hub for the U.S. Antarctic Program the C - 17 had only a short window to deliver its passengers and cargo due to daylight and weather .
" The biggest challenges are weather , the complexity of the loads and the time it takes to download and upload the aircraft , " said Senior Master Sgt. Jim Masura , the 304th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron superintendent .
" Time is limited due to daylight , and we have to get in and out as quickly as we can . "
The U.S. military is uniquely equipped to assist the National Science Foundation in the accomplishments of its mission to explore Antarctica , and 13th Air Force officials have the capability to provide joint operational and logistical support around the clock .
Operation Deep Freeze is divided into three seasons : Winfly , main body and winter .
It involves active duty and Reserve C - 17 support from McChord Air Force Base , Wash .
LC - 130 from the New York Air National Guard and other aircraft necessary to support the mission , as well as Coast Guard icebreakers and the Navy Cargo Handling Battalion
One to provide critical port services at McMurdo Station .

Dare Obasanjo's May 26th thoughts on the facebook platform contained a number of links to the Facebook API documentation .
At the time , clicking through to any of the Facebook API links resulted in a login dialog :
It struck me as incredibly odd that I had to login just to look at API documentation .
When presented with the login barrier , I did what 99 % of all the people who encounter a login barrier do : I turned back .
Dare seemed excited about the Facebook API , but I lost interest when confronted with this login screen .
Would n't you want information about your API disseminated as widely as possible , to as many people as possible ?
To be fair , Facebook has since rectified this problem .
Clicking on the link now takes you directly to the Facebook API documentation with no login barrier .
I 'm not so sure the Facebook folks are " brilliant on several levels " if their API documentation was placed behind a login barrier , even if for only a few days .
I previously referenced Jan Miksovsky 's enumeration of login steps as a type of user interface friction .
But in reality , login barriers are far worse than friction -- they 're a brick wall .
Login barriers are a no - win situation for users .
What 's in it for them ?
And without sneaking behind the barrier , if only for a moment , how can the user possibly know if your site is worth the hassle of signing up ?
If you 're the New York Times , maybe you can get away with forcing users to deal with the login barrier before getting to the meat of your website .
But most of us will never have that much cheese .
Even if you can't avoid an eventual login , it is possible to make the user 's login process nearly seamless .
Too many sites take a ham - handed , completely traditional approach to logins .
You can do much , much better than the abysmal login barrier status quo .
Jan does n't mince any words when he says Geni has the most inviting initial user experience he 's ever seen :
Right off the bat , you 're cleverly dropped into a family tree that 's already partially started : there 's a place for you , and obvious points to add your parents .
No fanfare is needed to introduce the site or explain what it 's for .
The very nature of the task 's UI makes it obvious that you 're building a family tree .
You 're asked for an email address , and in the most compact text imaginable , they define the key points of their privacy policy ( " never spammed , never shared " ) .
It 's not advertised to the user at this point that the email address they enter for themselves will become their user ID on the site .
This is revealed the first time the user tries to return to the site .
At that point -- the second visit -- the user is asked to sign in with their email address and a temporary password that was emailed separately to that address .
It 's obvious that Jan has been thinking a lot about this topic ; he has a followup post describing how Netvibes and Pageflakes ease visitors into sites with anonymous accounts :
These sites both use cookies to establish a tentative , anonymous relationship between you and the site .
You can even enter personal data to customize the various widgets , but until you 've established an account , you 're generally using the service anonymously .
( Of course , even without a user ID , each additional piece of data you enter to customize the site can be used to more precisely identify you . )
You can use your anonymous account for as long as you want to , provided you use the same browser on the same machine to do so .
Whenever you reach that point -- maybe even months after starting to use the service -- you can sign up for an account .
The basis of your relationship with the site transfers from your anonymous browser cookie to a real account secured with a user ID and a password .
( Both these sites use your email address as a user ID , to eliminate the signup hurdle of picking a user ID . )
The deep principle at work is that a site does n't need to rush to secure a relationship with a visitor .
Inevitable interest in getting more out of the site ( in these cases , the desire to use your customized home page from another location ) slowly pushes you , the casual anonymous visitor , to finally forge a permanent relationship with the site as an identified user .
The site knows a relationship with you will develop in its own time .
If your application requires users to log in , do n't underestimate the impact of the login barrier you 're presenting to users .
Consider utilizing anonymous , cookie - based accounts to give users a complete experience that more closely resembles the experience that named users get .
By removing the login barrier and blurring the line between anonymous users and named users , you 're likely to gain a lot more of the latter .

I was six - years - old when my mother , Shakeela Begum Khan , a beautiful , sassy , educated young Muslim woman , was murdered .
Returning home from school one day in 1976 to the one - room bedsit in East London where we both lived , I found police officers and an ambulance crew removing her body .
Scroll down for more ...
I remember that scene now as if it were a vague dream .
Did it really happen , or did I just imagine it ?
I have no memory of how I felt , only of what I witnessed .
As I grew up , older relatives had to reassure me that my memories were n't delusional .
Many years later , I also discovered the killer had set up the room to make it look as though it were a brothel , and my mother a prostitute .
As anyone from a Muslim background would instantly recognise , it was the ultimate way to dishonour a woman in the eyes of her family and community .
Soon after my mother 's death , her estranged husband , Rasib - my father - was accused of the murder , charged and tried , but he was acquitted .
Taken by Rasib to live with his new wife and a half - brother , both of whom were cruel and abusive to me when my father was not around , I was never allowed to utter a word about my mother .
For the next eight years , I lived in an atmosphere of secrets , lies and crippling fear , reluctantly protecting my vicious stepmother and half - brother from the fury my father would have unleashed on them if he'd known what they did to me .
I lived in constant dread that if I told anybody , the ultimate punishment for them would be death .
Now , three decades later , I have attained a form of poetic justice .
As a playwright , I challenge the forces that try to impose silence and censorship on me .
Having been silenced for so many years of my life , I am now determined to say the unsayable whenever necessary .
My father , Rasib Khan , was born in Pakistan , one of six sons .
Although his family were wealthy landowners , he grew up illiterate .
Apparently , in his teens , my father got into a fight with his youngest brother and , in an outburst of anger , pushed him ; the younger boy accidentally landed on a sharp farming tool and died .
My father 's family bribed the police and placed the dead body at a neighbour 's house to shift the blame .
Scroll down for more ...
Soon after , Rasib emigrated to England to start a new life , settling in East London with an older brother .
Like most Asian immigrants in the early Sixties , Rasib worked in a factory - in his case , The London Rubber Company , which manufactured washing - up gloves and condoms among other things .
Like many immigrants , he worked hard and lived frugally , saving every penny he could from his 12 - hour shifts to buy run-down properties which he did up and then sold again .
Gradually , he built up his capital until , in 1965 , he was able to return to Pakistan a wealthy man and marry my mother , Shakeela .
When they got back to London , my mother took on Rasib 's illegitimate son , Khalid , who was the result of a youthful liaison between my father and a woman from a nearby village and now lived in London with our father .
For five years after their marriage , my parents tried unsuccessfully for a child .
Then , I was born .
According to old family friends and relatives I have talked to about this time , Rasib was the happiest man around , and my memories of how he treated me are of a doting , loving and fun father .
Despite the fact that I was a girl , he called me his Sher Puttar ( ' Tiger Son ' ) , training me to stand up for myself and , if anyone hit me , to " kick 'em in the shins " .
He proudly displayed a half - moon shaped scar on his forehead that apparently was a toothmark from where I 'd bitten him .
For this he rewarded me with praise , hugs and kisses .
My father could be a tough man , with a loud , harsh voice , and he treated my half - brother particularly sternly , in marked contrast to the loving way in which he treated me .
In my father 's presence , my half - brother would cower and sometimes wet himself .
In my father 's absence , though , Khalid would show me resentment , even hatred .
My mother did n't fear her husband because he treated her kindly , encouraging her to explore the delights of London 's shops and go out with her friends .
To any intellectual feminist this may not seem liberating , but compared with her peers my mother had a good lifestyle - helped , no doubt , by the fact that she had only one young child .
Other Pakistani wives , with many children to help support , were homeworkers , sewing dresses in dark cellars for exploitative employers .
Both my parents were relatively " progressive " , particularly in the way they raised me .
My mother always kitted me out in trendy flares and psychedelic minidresses .
My female cousins envied me because I had a chic pageboy haircut , instead of the standard two long , oiled plaits with bright red ribbons .
But while my cousins envied my pageboy , I really envied their plaits .
My cousins had to go to the mosque every day to learn the Koran .
They thought of any excuse to skive off , but their parents , with the support of the mullah 's cane , insisted they would grow up to be heathens , overtly sexual , undignified and non-Islamic if they did n't go .
It was due to these ridiculous fears that my father kept himself and me well away from the mosque and the mullah .
He only faked prayers , twice a year for Eid , and even then he used a make - do prayer hat , a white handkerchief with a knot tied in each corner .
He objected to hypocrisy and thought religion caused hatred .
Plus , being illiterate did n't help restore his faith in Koranic words , whether written or spoken , as he resented the taboo against debating or disagreeing with them .
My father 's main focus , other than my mother and me , was to make money , buy property and make more money .
This he thought would then lead to his Sher Puttar having a dowry to be reckoned with .
School and education were important to him , and that was all I should concentrate on , not housework or religion ; just play and school .
As soon as I was putting basic letters together into words , I remember having to read his post for him .
There were big words like " leasehold " and " freehold " , not " Peter and Jane went for a walk " .
But my life changed dramatically for the worse when I was aged just four , with what was supposed to be a happy family holiday to Pakistan .
Without telling Rasib , so relatives later told me , my mother decided to give away her gold jewellery to a poor relative .
My father apparently felt betrayed by my mother not consulting him before making this impulsive gesture , and flew into a rage .
As my father and I were inseparable at that time , my mother left me with him for what she assumed would be a few days and went to stay with her mother until he calmed down .
In her absence , however , my father did an extraordinary thing , at least to Western eyes .
Scroll down for more ...
While my mother was away he vengefully entered into a hastily arranged marriage with a woman from a nearby village - under Islamic law , a man is permitted to take up to four wives - and illegally brought her back to London , using my mother 's passport .
He moved her into our family home and she took over the care of Khalid and me , as though my mother had never existed .
With the benefits of A - levels and her basic English , however , Shakeela managed to get herself back to England .
After a court hearing , my parents were separated and my mother won custody of me , with my father having only weekend access .
Not many Pakistani women would have defied and shamed their husbands in Seventies London in such a way .
My father had never been challenged like that before in his life and here was a woman , his own wife , doing this ; it was such a big insult .
On weekends , my loyalties were torn .
I could n't bear to be parted from my mother , so I refused to visit my father .
My mother needed some peace and quiet though , as she worked long hours in a fish - and - chip shop to support us both and was usually exhausted .
So she wanted me to spend time with Rasib , who would turn up every Saturday and Sunday morning to collect me - only to be rejected by me each time .
Then , on that terrible day in 1976 , my mother was murdered .
I have one hazy memory of leaving our bedsit holding my father 's hand , to start my new life with my stepmother and my half - brother .
I can remember walking around the local shops and seeing pictures of my mother posted on billboards , in shop windows and cinema doorways , but I was never allowed to acknowledge the posters or ever utter a word about my mother again .
Was she a celebrity , I used to wonder , who had perhaps left me for the bright lights of television . . . for Charlie 's Angels , perhaps ?
After my father was arrested for her murder , he spent time in jail on remand , but he denied responsibility and was eventually acquitted for lack of evidence .
Having taken the easy option of arresting my father , the police never solved the crime , and I doubt they tried all that hard , given the racial prejudice rife in Seventies Britain and the lack of cultural understanding .
I think it highly likely , though , that my beautiful mother , still only in her 20s at the time of her death , was the victim of a so - called " honour killing " - one of countless thousands of young women from Muslim communities who are murdered , often by close male relatives , for stepping out of line .
After my father 's trial , I retreated into a world of silence and invisibility .
Aunts and uncles would greet me when they realised I was in the room and speak to me in tones of sympathy and pity .
But none was brave enough to stand up to my father , speak openly of my dead mother or defend me from my " wicked stepmother " and even more wicked half - brother .
I spent eight unhappy years with my father and his new family , keeping quiet about how I was being treated by my stepmother and half - brother .
I hated these two for what they did to me , crying myself to sleep on many occasions , not knowing what to do or who to tell .
I lived in fear of what my father would do if he ever discovered what was happening to me , and he loved me dearly , behind his back .
Eventually , having managed to persuade Social Services to take me into care when I was 14 , I was placed with a wonderful family .
It was then that I first challenged the censorship and silence that had been imposed on me .
From the safety of my new home in the country far from London , I wrote to my father and told him exactly how I felt and what his second wife and son had done to me .
My father , a man feared by everyone around him , withered into a sobbing wreck and died a few years later .
Unsurprisingly , those miserable years after my mother 's death gave me a deep horror of enforced silence .
On leaving school , I became a youth and community worker in London , where I came across many other people who had had horrific experiences of exploitation , abuse , violence , injustice and fundamentalist intolerance but who were , for various reasons , silenced , ignored or denied any chance to defend themselves .
One only has to open a newspaper or watch the news to see this still repeated on a national and international level today .
So if I could n't help people through my own intervention , and in most instances , of course , I could n't , then I could at least try to help by exploring and questioning issues to raise awareness and encourage those in power to take action .
Around six years ago , after the director of a London theatre company encouraged me to try my hand at writing for the stage , I began writing plays .
I went on to explore once - taboo subjects such as " honour killings " of women in British - Pakistani families and the sex trafficking of Asian women , in the hope I could provide a voice for victims of abuse and injustice .
However , the political climate in the West following 9/11 has not been helpful , encouraging many Muslims to close ranks against perceived Islamaphobia .
For instance , I wrote about " honour killings " in my play Reshaam before 9/11 had happened , and the feedback I received from Pakistani communities at the time was : " Thank you for writing about this . "
People wrote to me saying " My sister went through a similar experience , " and " Men are gossips who hide behind the veil of the mosque . "
Since 2001 though , any attempt to publicly examine and expose sensitive subjects within Muslim communities can result in a hostile response , as I discovered after another of my plays , Bells , attracted national Press coverage .
This play , which I am now hoping might be made into a film , exposed the secret , seedy world of mujra , or courtesan clubs , a centuries - old tradition in Pakistan that has emerged in Britain in a bastardised form and is now growing through sex trafficking .
During the day , a shop is a halal butchers , at night it becomes Bells , a members - only club upstairs where girls wearing traditional dress dance seductively for the male customers who throw money at their feet - the girls go a lot further for those who pay more .
The club seems glamorous , but it is tarnished by the secret , sordid lives beneath the surface : a place where meat is bought and sold .
To discover this world exists in the UK , perhaps just around the corner , was a fascinating realisation - and a culture shock .
In sections of the media , Bells was described as " a play about Muslim brothels " - sensationalist shorthand that placed the focus on religion over and above the desperate circumstances of the women , which is what I was trying to convey .
Birmingham Repertory
Theatre , which staged Bells two years ago , was threatened with riots on the opening night .
The theatre management assured me that no matter what happened , they would not give in to protesters and drop my play - unlike Sikh playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti's Behzti ( Punjabi for " dishonour " ) .
The play was notoriously cancelled by the same theatre after protests from members of the Sikh community in 2004 about the play 's depiction of a rape and murder in a Sikh temple .
Nevertheless , I suffered during and after the national tour of Bells .
For daring to write about this sensitive subject , I was set upon by jeering young Asian men howling obscenities , and by elderly men who spat at me .
My car was blown up in an arson attack , apparently as a punishment from a self - righteous religious fundamentalist incensed at my reputation as a " non-believer in God " .
Biologically , I 'm not mixed race , but mentally and socially I am half English and half Pakistani , and proud to be both .
My heritage is Muslim ; but I 'm not a follower of any religion .
Despite the intimidation , I declared publicly that I was not going to give in to bullies .
But last year , writing my latest play , In No Sense , I was shocked to realise I was censoring myself , fearful of encouraging further attacks from people insulted by my " evil " writing .
At first I thought it was just a case of writer 's block .
But once I acknowledged to myself that it was fear constraining me , I had to choose either to stay quiet - as I had as a frightened child - or to continue to confront the bullies .
I chose the latter course .
That experience gave me a new sense of resolve : never to be silenced again .
Speaking out , even at the risk of causing offence - or perhaps more accurately , deliberately risking offence -- is the only method available to me to challenge injustice and fundamentalist intolerance .
Otherwise , I 'm not much better than my uncles , aunts , the police and those in the law courts who stood by for years , either ignoring what was happening to me or watching and just whispering their concerns behind closed doors .

Former CBS anchor Dan Rather recently filed a $ 70 million lawsuit against CBS , saying they made him a " scapegoat " when he was fired for a September 2004 story on 60 Minutes about President Bush 's unsatisfactory service in the Texas Air National Guard .
When Rather appeared on Larry King 's program Thursday , King began by showing him a 2005 clip of himself saying , " I 'm not a victim of anything except my own shortcomings . "
But he added , " Somebody , sometime has got to take a stand and say democracy cannot survive , much less thrive with the level of big corporate and big government interference and intimidation in news . "
" I 've learned a good deal since that time , " said Rather .
" It 's reported that Sumner Redstone [ president of Viacom ] ... was described as being enraged that the news division , this story , had cost Viacom and CBS in Washington , and he wanted Dan Rather and everybody connected with it out . "
" They sacrificed support for independent journalism for corporate financial gain , and in so doing , I think they undermined a lot at CBS News , " he said .
Rather said he still believes the 60 Minutes report was correct .
" [ CBS ] sacrificed support for independent journalism for corporate financial gain , " he stated , " and in so doing I think they undermined a lot at CBS News . "
" Nobody to this day has shown that these documents were fraudulent , " continued Rather , referring to the disputed memos featured in the 60 Minutes story .
" Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent , much less a forgery .
...
The truth of this story stands up to this day . "
Rather added that he believed somebody with subpoena power could get to the bottom of the matter pretty quickly .

Samantha Bee : ' Larry Craig is gay in eyes of the law '
After Larry Craig lost a legal bid to withdraw his guilty plea to disorderly conduct in a men's restroom , the Daily Show 's Samantha
Bee thinks that there is finally some closure to the Idaho Republican 's scandal .
" It 's been months since the Minneapolis High Court found Larry Craig gay , " she reported .
" Now that his petition of ' not gay ' has been thrown out , it 's official : Larry Craig is gay in the eyes of the law .
A confused Jon Stewart questioned Bee about her claim , pointing out that the court ruled on the legality of his misdemeanor plea , not his sexuality .
" John , John , John , you are so adorable , " she responded .
" All of our sexuality is determined by the courts .
It 's a landmark case .
1976 . Village v. People of the State of New York . "
Stewart also acknowledged Craig 's indecision regarding his whether or not he should resign from the Senate , amplified by an onslaught of media coverage .
" It 's almost as if he 's confused with who he is and what he wants , " he said .

A trellis .
Component is an object that can have its attributes automatically maintained by rules , the way a spreadsheet is maintained by its formulas .
These managed attributes are called " cell attributes " , because the attribute values are stored in " cell " ( trellis .
AbstractCell ) objects .
Cell objects can be variable or constant , and either computed by a rule or explicitly set to a value -- possibly both , as in the temperature converter example !
There are five basic types of cell attributes :
Passive , Settable Values ( attr ( ) and attrs ( ) )
These are simple read - write attributes , with a specified default value .
Rules that read these values will be automatically recalculated after the attribute is changed .
Computed Constants Or Initialized Values ( make ( ) and make.attrs ( ) )
These attributes are usually used to hold a mutable object , such as a list or dictionary ( e.g. cache = trellis.make ( dict ) ) .
The callable ( passed in when you define the attribute ) will be called at most once for each instance , in order to initialize the attribute 's value .
After that , the same object will be returned each time .
( Unless you make the attribute writable , and set the attribute to a new value . )
Computed , Observable Values ( @compute and compute.attrs ( ) )
These attributes are used to compute simple formulas , much like those in a spreadsheet .
That is , ones that calculate a current state based on the current state of other values .
Formulas used in @compute attributes must be non-circular , side - effect free , and cannot depend on the attribute 's previous value .
They are automatically recalculated when their dependencies change , but only if a maintenance or action - performing rule depends upon the result , either directly or indirectly .
( This avoids unnecessary recalculation of values that nobody cares about . )
Maintenance Rules / Maintained Values ( @maintain and maintain.attrs ( ) )
These rules or attribute values are used to reflect changes in state .
A maintenance rule can modify other values or use its own previous value in a calculation .
It is re-invoked any time a value it has previously used changes , even if no other rule depends upon it .
Maintenance rules can be circular , as in the temperature converter example , as their values can be explicitly set -- both as an initial value , and at runtime .
They are also used to implement " push " or " pull " rules that update one data structure in response to changes made in another data structure .
All side - effects in maintenance rules must be undo-able using the Trellis 's undo API .
( Which is automatic if the side - effects happen only on trellis attributes or data structures . )
But if you must change non-trellis data structures inside a maintenance rule , you will need to log undo actions .
We 'll discuss the undo log mechanism in more detail later , in the section on Creating Your Own Data Structures .
Action - Performing Rules ( @perform )
These rules are used to perform non-undoable actions on non-trellis data or systems , such as output I/O and calls to other libraries .
Like maintenance rules , they are automatically re-invoked whenever a value they 've previously read has changed .
Unlike maintenance rules , however , they cannot return a value or modify any trellis data .
Note , by the way , that this means performing rules should never raise errors .
If they do , the changes that caused the rule to run will be rolled back , but if any other performing rules were run first , their actions will not be rolled back , leaving your application in an inconsistent state .
For each of the attribute types , you can use the plural attrs ( ) form ( if there is one ) to define multiple attributes at once in the body of a class .
The singular forms ( except for attr ( ) ) can be used either inline or as function decorators wrapping a method to be used as the attribute 's rule .
Let 's take a look at a sample class that uses some of these ways to define different attributes , being deliberately inconsistent just to highlight some of the possible options :
>>> class Rectangle ( trellis.Component ) : ... trellis.attrs ( ... top = 0 , ... width = 20 , ... ) ... left = trellis.attr( 0 ) ... height = trellis.attr ( 30 ) ... ... trellis.compute.attrs ( ... bottom = lambda self : self.top + self .height , ... ) ... ... @trellis.compute ... def right ( self ) : ... return self .
left + self .width ... ... @trellis.perform ... def show ( self ) : ... print self ... ... def __repr__( self ) : ... return " Rectangle " +repr ( ... (( self.left,self.top ) , ( self.width,self.height ) , ... ( self.right,self.bottom ) ) ... ) >>> r = Rectangle ( width=40 , height=10 ) Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 40 , 10 ) , ( 40 , 10 ) ) >>> r.width = 17 Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 17 , 10 ) , ( 17 , 10 ) ) >>> r.left = 25 Rectangle ( ( 25 , 0 ) , ( 17 , 10 ) , ( 42 , 10 ) )
By the way , note that computed attributes ( as well as make attributes by default ) will be read - only :
>>> r.bottom = 99 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ca n't set attribute
However , " maintained " attributes will be writable if you supply an initial value , as we did in the TemperatureConverter example .
( Plain attr attributes are always writable , and make attributes can be made writable by passing in writable =
True when creating them . )
Note , by the way , that you are n't required to make everything in your program a trellis .
Component in order to use the Trellis .
The Component class does only four things , and you are free to accomplish these things some other way if you need or want to :
It sets self .__cells__ = trellis. Cells ( self ) .
This creates a special dictionary that will hold all the Cell objects used to implement cell attributes .
The __init__ method takes any keyword arguments it receives , and uses them to initialize any named attributes .
( Note that this is the only thing the __init__ method does , so you do n't have to call it unless you want this behavior . )
It creates a cell for each of the object 's non-optional cell attributes , in order to initialize their rules and set up their dependencies .
We 'll cover this in more detail in the next section , Automatic Activation and Dependencies .
It wraps the entire object creation process in a @modifier , so that all of the above operations occur in a single logical transaction .
We 'll cover this more in a later section on Managing State Changes .
In addition to doing these things another way , you can also use Cell objects directly , without any Component classes .
This is discussed more in the section below on Working With Cell Objects .
Automatic Activation and Dependencies
You 'll notice that each time we change an attribute value , our Rectangle instance above prints itself -- including when the instance is first created .
That 's because of two important Trellis principles :
When a Component instance is created , all its " non-optional " cell attributes are calculated after initialization is finished .
That is , if the attribute is a maintenance or performing rule , and has not been marked optional , then the rule is invoked , and the result is used to determine the cell 's initial value .
While a cell 's rule is running , any trellis cell whose value is looked at becomes a dependency of that rule .
If the looked - at cell changes later , it triggers recalculation of the rule that " looked " .
In Trellis terms , we say that the first cell has become a " listener " of the second cell .
The first of these principles explains why the rectangle printed itself immediately : the show performer cell was activated .
We can see this if we look at the rectangle 's show attribute : >>> print r.show None
( The show rule is a performer , so the resulting attribute value is None .
Also notice that rules are not methods -- they are more like properties . )
The second principle explains why the rectangle re-prints itself any time one of the attributes changes value : all six attributes are referenced by the __repr__ method , which is called when the show performer prints the rectangle .
Since the cells that store those attributes are being looked at during the execution of another cell 's rule , they become dependencies , and the show rule is thus re-run whenever the listened - to cells change .
Each time a rule runs , its dependencies are automatically re-calculated -- which means that if you have more complex rules , they can actually depend on different cells every time they 're calculated .
That way , the rule is only re-run when it 's absolutely necessary .
By the way , a listened - to cell has to actually change its value ( as determined by the != operator ) , in order to trigger recalculation .
Merely setting a cell does n't cause its observers to recalculate : >>> r. width = 17 # does n't trigger ``show``
But changing it to a non-equal value does : >>> r.width = 18 Rectangle ( ( 25 , 0 ) , ( 18 , 10 ) , ( 43 , 10 ) )
" Optional " Rules and Subclassing
The show rule we 've been playing with on our Rectangle class is kind of handy for debugging , but it 's kind of annoying when you do n't need it .
Let 's turn it into an " optional " performer , so that it wo n't run unless we ask it to : >>> class QuietRectangle ( Rectangle ) : ... @trellis.perform(optional=True ) ... def show ( self ) : ... print self
By subclassing Rectangle , we inherit all of its cell attribute definitions .
We call our new optional rule show so that its definition overrides the noisy version of the rule .
And , because it 's marked optional , it is n't automatically activated when the instance is created .
So we do n't get any announcements when we create an instance or change its values : >>> q = QuietRectangle ( width=18 , left=25 ) >>> q.width = 17 Unless , of course , we activate the show rule ourselves : >>> q.show Rectangle ( ( 25 , 0 ) , ( 17 , 30 ) , ( 42 , 30 ) )
And from now on , it 'll be just as chatty as the previous rectangle object : >>> q.left = 0 Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 17 , 30 ) , ( 17 , 30 ) )
While any other QuietRectangle objects we create will of course remain silent , since we have n't activated their show cells : >>> q2 = QuietRectangle ( ) >>>
q2.top = 99 @compute rules are always " optional " .
make ( ) attributes are optional by default , but can be made non-optional by passing in optional =False .
@maintain and @perform are non-optional by default , but can be made optional using optional =True .
Notice , by the way , that rule attributes are more like properties than methods , which means you can't use super ( ) to call the inherited version of a rule .
( Later , we 'll look at other ways to access rule definitions . )
Read -Only and Read - Write Attributes Attributes can vary as to whether they 're settable : Passive values ( attr ( ) , attrs ( ) ) and @maintain rules are always settable
, ) and rules are always settable make ( ) attributes are settable only if created with writable =
True
attributes are settable only if created with @compute and @perform attributes are never settable For example , here 's a class with a non-settable aDict attribute : >>> class Demo( trellis.Component ) : ... a Dict = trellis.make ( dict ) >>> d = Demo( ) >>> d.aDict {} >>> d.aDict [ 1 ] = 2 >>> d.aDict { 1 : 2} >>> d.aDict = {} Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : Constants can't be changed Note , however , that even if an attribute is n't settable , you can still initialize the attribute value , before the attribute 's cell is created : >>> d = Demo( aDict= {3:4} ) >>> d.aDict { 3 : 4} >>> d = Demo( ) >>> d.aDict = { 1:2} >>> d.aDict { 1 : 2} Since the aDict attribute is " optional " ( make attributes are optional by default ) , it was n't initialized when the Demo instance was created .
So we were able to set an alternate initialization value .
But , if we make it non-optional , we can't do this , because the attribute will be initialized during instance construction : >>> class Demo( trellis.Component ) : ... a Dict = trellis.make ( dict , optional =False ) >>> d = Demo( ) >>> d.aDict = { 1:2} Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : Constants can't be changed
And so , non-optional read - only attributes can only be set while an instance is being created : >>> d = Demo( aDict= {3:4} ) >>> d.aDict { 3 : 4}
But if an attribute is settable , it can be set at any time , whether the attribute is optional or not : >>> class Demo( trellis.Component ) : ... a Dict = trellis.make ( dict , writable = True ) >>> d = Demo( ) >>> d.aDict = { 1:2} >>> d.aDict = { 3:4}
Model - View - Controller and the " Observer " Pattern
As you can imagine , the ability to create rules like this can come in handy for debugging .
Heck , there 's no reason you have to print the values , either .
If you 're making a GUI application , you can define rules that update displayed fields to match application object values .
For that matter , you do n't even need to define the rule in the same class !
For example : >>> class Viewer( trellis.Component ) : ... model = trellis.attr( None ) ... ... @trellis.perform ... def view_it( self ) : ... if self .
model is not None : ... print self .
model >>> view = Viewer ( model=q2 ) Rectangle ( (0 , 99 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) , ( 20 , 129 ) ) Now , any time we change q2 , it will be printed by the Viewer 's view_it rule , even though we have n't activated q2's show rule : >>> q2.left = 66 Rectangle ( ( 66 , 99 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) , ( 86 , 129 ) )
This means that we can automatically update a GUI ( or whatever else might need updating ) , without adding any code to the thing we want to " observe " .
Just use cell attributes , and everything can use the " observer pattern " or be a " Model - View - Controller " architecture .
Just define rules that can read from the " model " , and they 'll automatically be invoked when there are any changes to " view " .
Notice , by the way , that our Viewer object can be repointed to any object we want .
For example : >>> q3 = QuietRectangle ( ) >>> view.model = q3 Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) ) >>> q2.width = 59 # it 's not watching us any more , so no output >>> view.model = q2 # watching q2 again Rectangle ( ( 66 , 99 ) , ( 59 , 30 ) , ( 125 , 129 ) ) >>> q3.top = 77 # but we 're not watching q3 any more
See how each time we change the model attribute , the view_it rule is recalculated ?
The rule references self .
model , which is a value cell attribute .
So if you change view .
model , this triggers a recalculation , too .
Remember : once a rule reads another cell , it will be recalculated whenever the previously - read value changes .
Each time view_it is invoked , it renews its dependency on self .
model , but also acquires new dependencies on whatever the repr ( ) of self .
model looks at .
Meanwhile , any dependencies on the attributes of the previous self .
model are dropped , so changing them does n't cause the perform rule to be re-invoked any more .
This means we can even do things like set model to a non-component object , like this : >>> view . model = {} {}
But since dictionaries do n't use any cells , changing the dictionary wo n't do anything : >>> view.model [ 1 ] = 2
To be able to observe mutable data structures , you need to use data types like trellis .
Dict and trellis .
List instead of the built - in Python types .
We 'll cover how that works in the section below on Mutable Data Structures .
By the way , the links from a cell to its listeners are defined using weak references .
This means that views ( and cells or components in general ) can be garbage collected even if they have dependencies .
For more information about how Trellis objects are garbage collected , see the later section on Garbage Collection .
Accessing a Rule 's Previous Value Sometimes it 's useful to create a maintained value that 's based in part on its previous value .
For example , a rule that produces an average over time , or that ignores " noise " in an input value , by only returning a new value when the input changes more than a certain threshhold since the last value .
It 's fairly easy to do this , using a @maintain rule that refers to its previous value : >>> class NoiseFilter( trellis.Component ) : ... trellis.attrs ( ... value = 0 , ... threshhold = 5 , ... ) ... @trellis.maintain(initially=0 ) ... def filtered ( self ) : ... if abs( self.value - self.filtered ) > self .
threshhold : ... return self.value ... return self .
filtered >>> nf = NoiseFilter ( ) >>> nf.filtered 0 >>> nf.value = 1 >>> nf.filtered 0 >>> nf.value = 6 >>> nf.filtered 6 >>> nf.value = 2 >>> nf.filtered 6 >>> nf.value = 10 >>> nf.filtered 6 >>> nf.threshhold = 3 # changing the threshhold re-runs the filter ... >>> nf.filtered 10 >>> nf.value = - 3 >>> nf.filtered - 3
As you can see , referring to the value of a cell from inside the rule that computes the value of that cell , will return the previous value of the cell .
( Note : this is only possible in @maintain rules . )
Beyond The Spreadsheet : " Resetting " Cells
So far , all the stuff we 've been doing is n't really any different than what you can do with a spreadsheet , except maybe in degree .
Spreadsheets usually do n't allow the sort of circular calculations we 've been doing , but that 's not really too big of a leap .
But practical programs often need to do more than just reflect the values of things .
They need to do things , too .
So far , we 've seen only attributes that reflect a current " state " of things .
But attributes can also represent things that are " happening " , by automatically resetting to some sort of null or default value .
In this way , you can use an attribute 's value as a trigger to cause some action , following which it resets to an " empty " or " inactive " value .
And this can then help us handle the " Controller " part of " Model - View - Controller " .
For example , suppose we want to have a controller that lets you change the size of a rectangle .
We can use " resetting " attributes to do this , in a way similar to an " event " , " message " , or " command " in a GUI or other event - driven system : >>> class ChangeableRectangle ( QuietRectangle ) : ... trellis.attrs.resetting_to( ... wider = 0 , ... narrower = 0 , ... taller = 0 , ... shorter = 0 ... ) ... width = trellis.maintain ( ... lambda self : self .
width + self .wider - self.narrower , ... initially = 20 ... ) ... height = trellis.maintain ( ... lambda self : self .
height + self .
taller - self .shorter , ... initially = 30 ... ) >>> c = ChangeableRectangle ( ) >>> view.model = c Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) ) A resetting attribute ( created with attr( resetting_to=value ) or attrs.resetting_to( ) ) works by receiving an input value , and then automatically resetting to its default value after its dependencies are updated .
For example : >>> c.wider 0 >>> c.wider = 1 Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 21 , 30 ) , ( 21 , 30 ) ) >>> c.wider 0 >>> c.wider = 1 Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) )
Notice that setting c.wider = 1 updated the rectangle as expected , but as soon as all updates were finished , the attribute reset to its default value of zero .
In this way , every time you put a value into a resetting attribute , it gets processed and discarded .
And each time you set it to a non -default value , it 's treated as a change .
Which means that any maintenance or performing rules that depends on the attribute will be recalculated ( along with any @compute rules in between ) .
If we 'd used a normal trellis. attr here , and then set c.wider = 1 twice in a row , nothing would have happen the second time , because the value would not have changed .
Now , we could write methods for changing value cells that would do this sort of resetting for us , but it would n't be a good idea .
We 'd need to have both the attribute and the method , and we 'd need to remember to never set the attribute directly .
( What 's more , it would n't even work correctly , for reasons we 'll see later . )
It 's much easier to just use a resetting attribute as an " event sink " -- that is , to receive , consume , and dispose of any messages or commands you want to send to an object .
But why do we need such a thing at all ?
Why not just write code that directly manipulates the model 's width and height ?
Well , sometimes you can , but it limits your ability to create generic views and controllers , makes it impossible to " subscribe " to an event from multiple places , and increases the likelihood that your program will have bugs -- especially order - dependency bugs .
If you use rules to compute values instead of writing code to manipulate values , then all the code that affects a value is in exactly one place .
This makes it very easy to verify whether that code is correct , because the way the value is arrived at does n't depend on what order a bunch of manipulation methods are being called in , and whether those methods are correctly updating everything they should .
Thus , as long as a cell 's rule does n't modify anything except local variables , there is no way for it to become " corrupt " or " out of sync " with the rest of the program .
This is a form of something called " referential transparency " , which roughly means " order independent " .
We 'll cover this topic in more detail in the later section on Managing State Changes .
But in the meantime , let 's look at how using attributes instead of methods also helps us implement generic controllers .
Creating Generic Controllers by Sharing Cells
Let 's create a couple of generic " Spinner " controllers , that take a pair of " increase " and " decrease " command attributes , and hook them up to our changeable rectangle : >>> class Spinner( trellis.Component ) : ... " " " Increase or decrease a value " " " ... increase = trellis.attr( resetting_to=0 ) ... decrease = trellis.attr( resetting_to=0 ) ... by = trellis.attr ( 1 ) ... ... def up ( self ) : ... self .
increase = self .by ... ... def down ( self ) : ... self .
decrease = self .by >>> cells = trellis .
Cells( c ) >>> width = Spinner ( increase=cells [ ' wider ' ] , decrease=cells [ ' narrower ' ] ) >>> height = Spinner ( increase=cells [ ' taller ' ] , decrease=cells [ ' shorter ' ] )
The trellis .
Cells ( ) API returns a dictionary containing all active cells for the object .
( We 'll cover more about this in the section below on Working With Cell Objects_ . )
You can then access them directly , assigning them to other components ' attributes .
Assigning a Cell object to a cell attribute allows two components to share the same cell .
In this case , that means setting the .increase and . decrease attributes of our Spinner objects will set the corresponding attributes on the rectangle object , too : >>> width.up () Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 23 , 30 ) , ( 23 , 30 ) ) >>> width.down ( ) Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) ) >>> height .by = 5 >>> height.down ( ) Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 22 , 25 ) , ( 22 , 25 ) ) >>> height.up () Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) , ( 22 , 30 ) ) Could you do the same thing with methods ?
Maybe .
But can methods be linked the other way ? : >>> width2 = Spinner ( ) >>> height2 = Spinner ( ) >>> controlled_rectangle = ChangeableRectangle ( ... wider = trellis. Cells ( width2 ) [ ' increase ' ] , ... narrower = trellis. Cells ( width2 ) [ ' decrease ' ] , ... taller = trellis. Cells ( height2 ) [ ' increase ' ] , ... shorter = trellis.
Cells ( height2 ) [ ' decrease ' ] , ... ) >>> view.model = controlled_rectangle Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) , ( 20 , 30 ) ) >>> height2.by = 10 >>> height2.up ()
Rectangle ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 20 , 40 ) , ( 20 , 40 ) ) A shared cell is a shared cell : it does n't matter which " direction " you share it in !
It 's a simple way to create an automatic link between two parts of your program , usually between a view or controller and a model .
For example , if you create a text editing widget for a GUI application , you can define a value cell for the text in its class : >>> class TextEditor ( trellis.Component ) : ... text = trellis.attr ( '' ) ... ... @trellis.perform ... def display ( self ) : ... print " updating GUI to show " , repr( self.text ) >>> te = TextEditor ( ) updating GUI to show '' >>> te. text = ' blah ' updating GUI to show ' blah '
And then you 'd write some additional code to automatically set self .
text when there 's accepted input from the GUI .
An instance of this editor can then either maintain its own text cell , or be given a cell from an object whose attributes are being edited .
This allows you to independently test your models , views , and controllers , then simply link them together at runtime in any way that 's useful .
Resetting Rules Resetting attributes are designed to " accept " what might be called events , messages , or commands .
But what if you want to generate or transform such events instead ?
Let 's look at an example .
Suppose you 'd like to trigger an action whenever a new high temperature is seen : >>> class HighDetector( trellis.Component ) : ... value = trellis.attr( 0 ) ... last_max = trellis.attr( None ) ... ... @trellis.maintain ... def new_high ( self ) : ... last_max = self.last_max ... if last_max is None : ... self.last_max = self.value ... return
False # first seen is n't a new high ... elif self.value > last_max : ... self.last_max = self.value ... return True ... return False ... ... @trellis.perform ... def monitor ( self ) : ... if self .
new_high : ... print " New high "
The new_high rule runs whenever value changes , and checks to see if it 's greater than the current highest value .
If so , it returns true and updates the maximum value .
Let 's try it out : >>> hd = HighDetector ( ) >>> hd.value = 7 New high >>> hd.value = 9 Oops !
We set a new high value , but the monitor rule did n't detect a new high , because new_high was already
True from the previous high .
Just as with a regular attribute , rules normally return what might be called " continuous " or " steady state " values .
That is , their value remains the same until something causes them to be recalculated .
In this case , the second recalculation of new_high returns True , just like the first one ... meaning that there 's no change , and thus the performing rule is n't triggered .
But , just as with regular attributes , @compute and @maintain rules can be made " resetting " , using the resetting_to= keyword , allowing the value to reset to a default as soon as all of the value 's listeners have " seen " the original value .
Let 's try a new version of our high detector : >>> class HighDetector2( HighDetector ) : ... ... @trellis.maintain(resetting_to=False ) ... def new_high ( self ) : ... # this is a bit like a super ( ) call , but for a rule : ... return HighDetector.new_high.rule( self ) >>> hd = HighDetector2 ( ) >>> hd.value = 7 New high >>> hd.value = 9 New high >>> hd.value = 3 >>> hd.value = 16 New high
As you can see , each new high is detected correctly now , because the value of new_high is silently reset to False after it 's calculated as ( or set to ) any other value : >>> hd.new_high False >>> hd.new_high = True New high >>>
hd.new_high False ( By the way , that HighDetector.new_high.rule in the new new_high rule retrieves the base class version of the rule .
We could also have done the same thing this way : >>> class HighDetector2( HighDetector ) : ... new_high = trellis.maintain ( ... HighDetector.new_high.rule , resetting_to = False ... ) and the result would have been the same , except it would run faster since the lookup of the inherited rule only happens once . )

The two clusters of galaxies , called Bullet Cluster , are in the process of moving through each other .
The red curves show gravitational measurements of the combined mass that consists of partly the visible matter of the galaxies and partly the invisible dark matter .
X - ray measurements of the two clusters of galaxies show that the clouds of gas have been pushed out at the collision between the two clusters of galaxies .
In the cluster of galaxies to the right there is a lot of dark matter , but very little x-ray , so the dark matter decays very slowly and thus has a very , very long lifetime .

New research from the Niels Bohr Institute presents new information that adds another piece of knowledge to the jigsaw puzzle of the dark mystery of the universe – dark matter .
The research has just been published in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters .
The universe consists not just of visible celestial bodies , stars , planets and galaxies .
It also has a mystical fellow player – dark matter .
The astronomers can measure that the dark matter exists in big quantities but no one knows what it is , nobody has seen it .
It does not emit light and it does not reflect light .
It is invisible .
It is a mystery and the researchers have many theories .
The dark matter has caused the researchers headaches for decades since it was detected in the 1970s , and there is intense research into the phenomena .
It is invisible but it has got mass , and thus it has got gravitation that can be measured .
By analysing the galaxies it is possible to weigh them , and it turns out that by far the greatest matter of the collective mass of the galaxy is dark matter .
Just like stars get together in galaxies , the galaxies get together in clusters of galaxies of up to several thousand galaxies .
The astrophysicist Signe Riemer - Sørensen , PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute , has analysed two clusters of galaxies that collide .
Colliding clusters of galaxies are analysed
When the two clusters of galaxies meet neither the galaxies nor the dark matter collide .
However , about 12 per cent of the mass of the cluster of galaxies consists of huge clouds of gas and dust and these clouds collide .
The gas clouds are hot and emit x-ray that can be observed , and it is possible to see how the clouds are actually pushed out of the two clusters of galaxies at the collision .
When the clouds of gas collide they become even hotter and emit more x-ray so that a whole chock front of warn gas is generated .
Observations indicate that the dark matter can be a new and still undetected type of particle .
Among the suggestions for the dark matter , are particles that when they decay they emit x-ray .
One is the so called axions that are particles which is explained in theories with extra dimensions .
So to be able to look for x-ray from dark matter the researchers are looking in places where there is a big concentration of dark matter , but no gas .
Such places are found in the two colliding clusters of galaxies where the gas clouds have been pushed out at the collision .
Signe Riemer - Sørensen has analysed the one of the two clusters of galaxies that are in the process of colliding .
The analyses show that it is a very heavy cluster with many galaxies , and measurement of the gravitation show that there is a very big amount of dark matter , up to 85 per cent of the collective mass .
However , no x-ray of any consequence was measured .
When the dark matter does not emit significant x-ray it is possible to calculate an upper limit to how quickly the particles decay and thus calculate their lifetime .
The result is that if axions are to be the dark matter they must have a life span that is longer that 3.000.000 billion years .
In that case there is not very much dark matter that has decayed yet if it was formed 13.7 billion years ago .
The conclusion is that dark matter has a very , very long lifetime .

Local Engineers Team Up to Design Novel Space - Borne Imager
A new generation of imaging detectors with low - noise and high - speed capabilities may transform imaging applications on NASA space missions , impact biomedical imaging , and aid in homeland defense .
The University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology have won $ 847,000 from NASA 's Astronomy Physics Research and Analysis program to build and test a detector that will capture sharper images and consume less power than technology currently in use .
The new imaging sensor , which will function at wavelengths spanning from ultraviolet to mid-infrared , will be able to operate reliably in the harsh radiation environment of space .
" These benefits will lead to lower mission cost and greater scientific productivity , " says Donald Figer , director of the Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory at RIT and lead scientist on the project .
The team includes Zeljko Ignjatovic , assistant professor in the University of Rochester 's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , and Zoran Ninkov from RIT .
The new detector is based on a technology created by Ignjatovic and his colleagues at the University of Rochester .
It will shrink the required hardware on NASA planetary missions from the size of a crate weighing tens of pounds to a tiny thumb - sized chip .
It also will enhance images captured by ground telescopes that will rival those from orbiting telescopes , like the Hubble Space Telescope .
Ignjatovic 's chip integrates an analog - to - digital converter at each pixel in a sensor .
" Previous attempts to do this on - pixel conversion have required far too many transistors , leaving too little area to collect light , " says Ignjatovic .
" First tests on the chip show that it uses 50 times less power than the industry 's current best , which is especially helpful on deep - space missions where energy is precious . "
Despite the chip 's low power consumption and sensitivity , it is surprisingly resistant to the radiation noise of space .
Since each pixel converts the signal from analog to digital before moving it off - chip , the signal is digital and clear before it has a chance to travel and degrade .
Coatings applied to the light - sensitive portion of the sensor will optimize the technology and the ability to detect a range of wavelengths .
RIT 's Ninkov will explore techniques for bonding the coating to the delicate circuit using industrial microwave ovens .
Further testing of the overall system will determine how the sensors hold up in cryogenic environments where the device is cooled to very low temperatures , imitating conditions in space .
In addition to astronomical applications , the detector could improve biomedical imaging devices used in emergency rooms or on battlefields .
The technology could aid in homeland security surveillance efforts to watch the nation 's borders .
Likewise , military applications could adopt the detector for use as airborne or space - based lasers designed to shoot down missiles aimed at the United States .
@andrebasso :
This could be a GM car with a " waste spark . "
Instead of a distributor , there 's a coil pack that fires two cylinders at a time .
When the cylinder on combustion fires , the cylinder on exhaust also fires .
I believe the main reason is then there 's fewer moving parts to break / draw power from the engine .

Facebook WASHINGTON 
The government 's terrorist watch list has swelled to more than 755,000 names , according to a new government report that has raised worries about the list 's effectiveness .
The size of the list , typically used to check people entering the country through land border crossings , airports and sea ports , has been growing by 200,000 names a year since 2004 .
Some lawmakers , security experts and civil rights advocates warn that it will become useless if it includes too many people .
" It undermines the authority of the list , " says Lisa Graves of the Center for National Security Studies .
" There 's just no rational , reasonable estimate that there 's anywhere close to that many suspected terrorists . "
The exact number of people on the list , compiled after 9/11 to help government agents keep terrorists out of the country , is unclear , according to the report by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) .
Some people may be on the list more than once because they are listed under multiple spellings .
Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman , D - Conn. , who plans a hearing on the report today , says " serious hurdles remain if ( the list ) is to be as effective as we need it to be .
Some of the concerns stem from its rapid growth , which could call into question the quality of the list itself . "
About 53,000 people on the list were questioned since 2004 , according to the GAO , which says the Homeland Security Department does n't keep records on how many were denied entry or allowed into the country after questioning .
Most were apparently released and allowed to enter , the GAO says .
Leonard Boyle , director of the FBI 's Terrorist Screening Center , which maintains the list , says in testimony to be given today that 269 foreigners were denied entry in fiscal 2006 .
The GAO report also says : • The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) could not specify how many people on its no - fly list , which is a small subset of the watch list , might have slipped through screening and been allowed on domestic flights .
•TSA data show " a number of individuals " on the no-fly list passed undetected through screening and boarded international flights bound for the United States .
Several planes have been diverted once officials realized that people named on the watch lists were on board .
• Homeland Security has not done enough to use the list more broadly in the private sector , where workers applying for jobs in sensitive places such as chemical factories could do harm .
Boyle also urges that the list be used by for screening at businesses where workers could " carry out attacks on our critical infrastructure that could harm large numbers of persons or cause immense economic damage . "
But the sheer size of the watch list raised the most alarms .
" They are quickly galloping towards the million mark — a mark of real distinction because the list is already cumbersome and is approaching absolutely useless , " said Tim Sparapani of the American Civil Liberties Union .
Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , says " creating and maintaining a comprehensive terrorist watch list is an enormous endeavor fraught with technical and tactical challenges . "
The report , she says , " underscores the need to make the watch lists more accurate , to improve screening procedures at airports and the ports of entry , and to provide individuals with the ability to seek redress if they believe they have been wrongfully targeted . "

Crewmembers will spend up to six months in space , eating , sleeping , excercising , and practicing hygiene .
They will also conduct scientific and technological experiments that require the weightless , “ micro- gravity ” environemnt of an orbit around the Earth .
Space on the HabLab is very limited .
Fortunately , in a weightless environment there are no floors and ceilings , and every surface becomes useful .
Equipment is designed to be as small as possible , and fits together snugly to minimize unused space
7. Stockholm - Arlanda Airport Sweden
The solution is a combination of design , art and function .
The purpose is to show a beautiful part of the swedish nature in the contrast of concrete and airplains .
All hidden in the wish of better smell .
Big sheets of glass reduce the gaps – and the odour .
Swedes are the most travelling people in the world and Stockholm - Arlanda Airport is one of the biggest airports in Scandinavia .
6. Women ’s Urinal at Dairy Queen Florida
While it ’s as not as versatile as a regular toilet , it still takes up the same amount of floor space .
The funnel - like device that is is shared by everyone using the urinal also proved not to be a popular feature .
Because of those reasons , not more than 700 ‘ She- inals ’ were sold before Urinette , the company that manufactured it , sold the manufacturing rights .

4. Public Rest Rooms of Rothesay UK
Rothesay was once a very popular stopping off point / resort for the Victorians as part of the ‘ Island Cruising ’ circuit .
Countless numbers of folks also remember it from a simpler time as a day trip destination , popular up to the late ’ 50’s , as city dwellers ( Glasgow ) would go ‘ Doon the Water ’ .
3. Nature ’s Call California
These urinals were sculpted by Clark Sorensen between 2002 and 2005 .
Each is created by hand from high fire porcelain , the same material as commercially available fixtures , and takes nearly a year to complete .
These fixtures are fully functional , and can be acquired by a collector for installation in ones home .
2. The Taj Mahal India
Taj Mahal , meaning “ Crown Palace ” , was built as the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal , second wife of emperor Shah Jahan .
Construction of the monument took 22 years and was completed in 1653 ; three and one half centuries later , Taj Mahal stands as a remarkable and beautiful piece of architectural history .
It is recognized as one of the Eight Wonders of the World .
1. Amundsen -Scott Station South Pole
Chris Curtis , who submitted this photograph said :
“ … I spent 26 days in Antarctica … in the process of getting [ this ] picture .
I feel that it in and of itself is a fixture to be admired .
One that resides upon the highest , driest , and coldest continent on earth , the very bottom of the planet ; one that marks an elusive destination and goal that was not able to even be reached until the early 1900 ’s and carries with it the suffering and the loss of life of several explorers ; and one that is at a place that is not only off the beaten path but literally ‘ miles from nowhere ’ …
In fact , no other urinal in the world or even space can compete with the efforts and loss of life that went into [ this fixture ’s ] eventual permanence at the South Pole .
What it may lack in beauty it more that makes up for in dignity . ”

Hundertwasser ’s Kawakawa Toilets are a famous public installation in Kawakawa , New Zealand .
Mark your calendars : 150 years ago Tuesday , the Supreme Court issued a long , muddled opinion in Scott v. Sandford , which Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes later said was the Court ’s greatest “ self - inflicted wound . ”
The case was brought by Dred Scott ( right ) , a Missouri slave .
Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the Court , ruled that African - Americans are not citizens under the Constitution , and could not file suit in federal courts .
The Court also ruled that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories .
The anniversary is being marked – not celebrated – in numerous ways , including events over the weekend in St. Louis , where the case originated .
And next month , at Harvard Law School , professor Charles Ogletree ’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice will stage a re-argument of the case , with the participation of Justice Stephen Breyer and D.C. Circuit senior judge Harry Edwards , among many others .
“ No decision in our history has done more to injure the reputation of the Court , ” wrote the late Court scholar Bernard Schwartz , who put the Scott decision at the top of his list of the Court ’s worst rulings .

Many patients tell me they have a sleep problem because they wake up in the middle of the night for a time , typically 45 minutes to an hour , but fall uneventfully back to sleep .
Curiously , there seems to be no consequence to this " problem . "
They are unaffected during the day and have plenty of energy and concentration to go about their lives .
------------snip-----------
The problem , it seems , is not so much with their sleep as it is with a common and mistaken notion about what constitutes a normal night 's sleep .
It 's a question that Dr. Thomas Wehr at the National Institute of Mental Health asked himself in the early 1990's .
He conducted a landmark experiment in which he placed a group of normal volunteers in 14 - hour dark periods each day for a month .
He let the subjects sleep as much and as long as they wanted during the experiment .
------------snip-----------
By the fourth week , the subjects slept an average of eight hours a night — but not consecutively .
Instead , sleep seemed to be concentrated in two blocks .
First , subjects tended to lie awake for one to two hours and then fall quickly asleep .
Dr. Wehr found that the abrupt onset of sleep was linked to a spike in the hormone melatonin .
Melatonin secretion by the brain 's pineal gland is switched on by darkness .
After an average of three to five hours of solid sleep , the subjects would awaken and spend an hour or two of peaceful wakefulness before a second three - to five - hour sleep period .
Such bimodal sleep has been observed in many other animals and also in humans who live in pre-industrial societies lacking artificial light .
Carol Worthman , an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta , has studied the sleep patterns of non-Western populations .
From the !
Kung hunter - gatherers in Africa to the Swat Pathan herders in Pakistan , Dr. Worthman documented a pattern of communal sleep in which individuals drifted in and out of sleep throughout the night .
She speculates that there may even be an evolutionary advantage to interrupted sleep .
" When we lived in open exposed savanna , being solidly asleep leaves us vulnerable to predators . "
With artificial light , modern humans have essentially managed to extend their daytime activities late into the night , when all other sensible creatures are busy sleeping .
As a result , we have compressed our natural sleep into artificially short nighttimes , but not all people are so easily tamed by artificial light .
Some people , who may just have very strong circadian rhythms , still have this primitive bimodal sleep that they confuse with a sleep disorder .
Add these people to the rest of us who , under the pressures of modern life , often have some trouble falling or staying asleep and there is a large captive audience for drug companies .
Thanks in large part to the meteoric rise in direct - to - consumer advertising , medications like Ambien and Lunesta have become household names and seductive panaceas that millions find hard to resist — even though a majority have no serious sleep problem to repair .
If it 's any consolation to those of you who are awake in the middle of the night for an hour or so , reading or watching television , you may simply be the most natural sleepers .
I have mentioned this in my very first post here : in a natural state , humans do not sleep a long consecutive bout throughout the night .
The natural condition is bimodal - two bouts of sleep interrupted by a short episode of waking in the middle of the night .
In today 's New York Times , there is an article about this : Sleep Disorder ?
Wake Up and Smell the Savanna by RICHARD A. FRIEDMAN , M.D. : I have nothing to add , except I can also give you an image I dug up - the original data from Wehr 's experiment .
See how the sleep is bimodal during the long winter nights and gets compressed during simulated summer :

Wow ..
I just laughed my ass off .
I was looking at my site today and noticed a google adsense ad that had me rolling on the floor .
The adsense ad appeared on my Story Telling Sunday – The Bear and the Man post .
I know google is supposed to be great a picking appropriate ads for your content , but this was a little too wierd .
If you ’re lucky you might still see the ad there .
If it ’s not there anymore , I took a screen cap of it .
Here it is :
Too funny … at least that ’s what I thought 🙂

The legend of King Arthur is an enduring one , so popular that it has been shared for centuries .
The earliest accounts are simple : A heroic king rescues his country .
The story evolved over the centuries , and further elements such as Camelot , the Round Table , and Merlin were added in for flavor .
Some versions of the legend state that Arthur did not truly die , but rather that he was put in an enchanted sleep⁠ — and it is said that he will return again in an hour of great need .
For hundreds of years the Arthur story has been retold in its various forms , though even ancient historians considered it nothing more than a myth .
But in the twelfth century , evidence surfaced that suggested that one of history ’s most popular figures might have been more than a mere legend .
In the year 1190 , the monks of Glastonbury Abbey in England announced an incredible discovery .
According to historical record , the monks began to experience dreams and visions about King Arthur around that time , which prompted them to consult with King Henry II ( AD 1133 - 1189 ) .
Henry informed them of a long - kept secret of the royal family : Arthur ’s remains were buried in the churchyard of St. Dunstan in Glastonbury .
A search was soon commissioned .
Upon excavating the indicated area , the searchers unearthed a massive oak trunk , buried sixteen feet deep just as Henry had described .
Inside was a human skeleton which confirmed that they had discovered something special .
It was absolutely gigantic .
It appeared to be much taller than an average man , and the space between the eye sockets was as wide as the palm of a man ’s hand .
Apparently , this famous king was truly larger than life .
This skeleton was not alone in its coffin .
Alongside it was a second , lying next to a plait of blonde hair .
The identities of the two remains were described on an archaic lead cross which was found nearby , inscribed with the Latin message “ Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia , ” meaning “ Here lies interred the famous King Arthur on the Isle of Avalon . ”
All in all , this was exciting stuff .
Men and women flocked to Glastonbury from the surrounding regions , and King Henry II interred the ancient bones .
Glastonbury soon became wealthy from the offerings and alms given by those who made the pilgrimage , and few questioned the authenticity of the find .
Indeed , a few decades earlier the contemporary historian Geoffrey of Monmouth had claimed that Glastonbury was built on the site of ancient Avalon .
It turns out that Arthur ’s grave was not the first historically significant discovery made by the monks of Glastonbury .
In 1184 , they had allegedly found the remains of St. Patrick .
However , this claim failed to convince most people , since it was widely believed that St. Patrick had been buried in Ireland .
Soon after this incident , the monks of the town had found the bones of famed Saint Dunstan .
This discovery , too , was not widely believed .
Though St. Dunstan had begun his career in Glastonbury , he ultimately relocated to Canterbury and had been buried there .
It was several years later that the monks found the grave of King Arthur .
The discovery was fortuitous , because the monastery was rumored to be in financial trouble .
In 1184 , the monastic building and church of Glastonbury had been razed to the ground in a fire , leaving the monks of the town in dire monetary straits .
However , if an abbey were in possession of a sacred relic , then it would be assured revenue .
People would visit from far and wide to see pieces of the cross , clothes and objects of the saints … and bones .
King Arthur was not a religious figure , but as one of the foremost heroes in legendary history , his remains attracted a great deal of medieval tourists .
While the circumstances of the discovery cast it in a suspicious light , the story was supported by King Henry II King Edward , who had succeeded Henry III and who had no need for money .
But he may have had political motives in backing such a hoax ; England was being ruled by Norman conquerors .
The Saxons generally accepted these rulers , but those belonging to the Celtic fringes did not .
Among those who revolted against the Norman invaders , it was widely believed that Arthur would one day return and fend off the invaders .
With proof that the Celts ’ savior was truly dead , Edward would secure a greater hold on his subjects .
He interred the bones of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere , symbolically aligning his reign with that of England ’s most famous hero and putting the matter to rest .
Taken all together , the evidence strongly suggests that the grave of King Arthur was just an elaborate hoax , designed to benefit several parties .
Unfortunately the bones and the cross went missing centuries ago , so the evidence cannot be examined using modern techniques .
But if they are ever rediscovered , even if they prove to be forgeries , these artifacts would be an interesting testament to the enduring legacy of political trickery and propaganda .
IBM has shed another 1,573 jobs as part of an ongoing push to thin its services organization .
The layoffs , mostly in the US , follow a similar round of 1,300 cuts performed earlier this month .
IBM described the firings as " business as usual " and noted that it hired 14,000 people worldwide during the first four months of this year .
IBM closed 2006 with 355,000 staff - its highest total in 15 years .
Columnist Robert Cringely has put your contributions to public broadcasting to hard work over the past couple of weeks with a series of PBS columns suggesting that these services layoffs signal an armageddon scenario at IBM .
According to Cringely , IBM will soon layoff its entire 130,000 person US workforce and then find another 20,000 people it does n't even employ to layoff as well .
We guess that 's what the kids call " new math . "
Cringely insists that the layoffs are part of an IBM covert op dubbed " LEAN . "
IBM , however , confirms that Lean is simply a Six Sigma business practices effort that has nothing to do with layoffs .
" Lean is a collection of Six Sigma business processes used by a number of leading companies to improve speed , quality and responsiveness to customers , " IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told us .
Regular readers will know that we maintain a more than healthy amount of skepticism for company lines , but IBM Corporate has looked much closer to the reality bush of late than Cringely - a man who seems to want to scare himself into a bunker serviced by an Indian call center .
In a broader context , IBM is trying to redefine its services organization from an internal process point of view , while also changing the way outsiders see the services group .
Rivals have long poked fun at IBM for sucking money out of customers over decade - long " engagements . "
To counter this perception , IBM has spent the better part of 2007 discussing services efficiencies and how it plans to create better links between people and technology .
Robert Moffat , an EVP at Big Blue , described this shift during a recent investor meeting .
There ’s significant and sustainable benefit from process re-design ; simple , standard , global processes to improve workflows ; be more responsive to clients and eliminate tasks that do not provide value .
Then you apply technology to process and infrastructure .
Automate manual tasks and redeploy resources on value - add work .
In the infrastructure , capitalize on virtualization or systems management from Tivioli and MRO ; which lowers cost of computing , while improving resiliency and security .
Finally , with standard , global processes and a high degree of automation you have unprecedented flexibility to optimize capacity ; deploy global capabilities in the most efficient and effective way .
Yeah , it sounds like a nebulous bunch of waffle to us too , but you get the sense that IBM is trying . ®
SAN JOSE , Calif . 
The ability to cram more data into less space on a memory chip or a hard drive has been the crucial force propelling consumer electronics companies to make ever smaller devices .
It shrank the mainframe computer to fit on the desktop , shrank it again to fit on our laps and again to fit into our shirt pockets .
Now , if an idea that Stuart S. P. Parkin is kicking around in an I.B.M. lab here is on the money , electronic devices could hold 10 to 100 times the data in the same amount of space .
That means the iPod that today can hold up to 200 hours of video could store every single TV program broadcast during a week on 120 channels .
The tech world , obsessed with data density , is taking notice because Mr. Parkin has done it before .
An I.B.M. research fellow largely unknown outside a small fraternity of physicists , Mr. Parkin puttered for two years in a lab in the early 1990s , trying to find a way to commercialize an odd magnetic effect of quantum mechanics he had observed at supercold temperatures .
With the help of a research assistant , he was able to manipulate the alignment of electronics to alter the magnetic state of tiny areas of a magnetic data storage disc , making it possible to store and retrieve information in a smaller amount of space .
The huge increases in digital storage made possible by giant magnetoresistance , or GMR , made consumer audio and video iPods , as well as Google - style data centers , a reality .
An Unlikely Education
I ’ve been meaning to write this post for a while , and was inspired to get it done by Merlin Mann ’s recent piece about improving his use of PowerPoint .
I do a lot of presentations .
Each time I give a talk , I try to improve on something .
I have a good base on which to build thanks to an unlikely education .
Despite my career in technology , I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Theatre .
I learned a lot of good public speaking practices from theatre school .
They come in two flavours –content and technique :
Content – What You Say
Respect the Narrative Arc.
Every good story has a beginning , middle and end .
The beginning promises the audience something , the middle threatens to take that promise away , and the end pays off on the promise ( or , in the so - called ‘ third act twist ’ , it does n’t ) .
Tell Stories .
If you take one piece of advice from this article , it ’s this .
We make meaning by telling stories –to ourselves and each other .
If you can construct your entire talk by embedding your points in a series of anecdotes and tall tales , do it .
You ’ll entertain your audience a lot more , and your message will be much stickier in your audience ’s heads .
Watch Seth Godin speak–he ’s all about the clever anecdotes .
Embrace Metaphors .
Metaphors are another important means of how we make sense of the world .
Use similes ( “ this site is eBay for seniors ” ) .
Dialogue Starts on the Page .
I find my talks are much more cogent and compelling when I ’ve written them as informal essays first .
Then I try to commit as much of it as I can to memory , and write out the key points on index cards .
Too many speakers seem to think they ’ve prepared a talk by creating some slides .
The slides should come last .
Slides are Your Costumes , Lighting and Set , Not Your Speech .
Your slides exist to reinforce the things you ’re saying , not the other way around .
Like your clothes , they provide context and framing for your message .
As such , I almost always eschew bullet points for a single word or phrase per slide , accompanied by lots of photos .
An overly complicated set will distract an audience , and so will overly busy slides .
Your Set Design Needs Soul .
Use lots of photos in your slides , but pick photos with soul .
You ’ll know them when you see them .
Here ’s a tip–there ’s more soul on Flickr than iStockPhoto .
And avoid obvious illustrations .
You do n’t need to show two generic hands shaking to imply a relationship .
I recently gave a talk that included a brief summary of the history of communications –from few - to - few to few - to - many to many - to - many .
These are the three photos I used :
The Play ’s As Long As It Needs To Be ( or Not To Be ) .
People like to say “ you should n’t have more than five ( or 15 or 23 ) slides ” .
This implies that there ’s a standard duration for each slide , and that you ’re a simpleton .
When you do n’t use bullet points , this rule no longer applies .
In one of my talks I run 60 slides –all photos–in about 3 minutes , and other slides sit up on screen for five minutes while I ’m making a point .
Surprise Your Audience .
We ’re delighted when the unexpected happens .
Change gears midstream , take your theme in a new direction , or show a little video in the middle of your talk .
It piques the interest of the audience and refreshes their attention .
Everybody perks up when the ghost of Hamlet ’s dad returns in Act 3 .
Begin In Media Res .
It ’s Latin for ‘ in the middle of things ’ , and a lesson from Playwriting 101 .
Start in the middle of the action .
Start with an anecdote out of left field , and let the audience catch up later .
Do n’t be afraid to use a flashback to fill in the background in the middle of your talk .
Find the Funny .
This is dangerous , because there ’s nothing worse than a joke ( or a joker ) that bombs on - stage .
If you ’re not a naturally - gifted comic , find other ways .
Embed humour in your slides , bring a prop or gently abuse the audience .
I recently used a volunteer and a prop in a talk :
It ’s hardly a stroke of comic genius , but it can change the tone for a few minutes , which never hurts .
Technique – How You Say It
Go to a speech coach .
Why do British actors always sound smart ?
Because , usually , they ’ve got superb vocal training and are exceptionally articulate .
Discover all the muscles in your mouth , throat and chest dedicated to speaking , and learn how to exercise them .
Warm up your voice .
You stretch before playing pickup hockey –why do n’t you warm up your voice before putting it through the paces ?
Your speech coach can help with this .
As part of my pre-speaking ritual , I spend about ten minutes conducting an embarrassing vocal warm - up before speaking .
I try to do it backstage , in an empty bathroom or in some other out of the way corner .
Quit moving around .
It ’s a common bad habit of the young ( and , in my case , really awful ) actor .
When you ’re not rooted firmly in one place , you water down your message and distract the audience .
Stand in one spot , and move only to emphasize a point .
Talk slower .
You ’re almost certainly talking too fast .
Even if you have a complete handle on your nerves , there ’s a lot going on during a talk–slides , distracting audience members , and so forth–and people take longer to absorb information .
Practice slowing down until people tell you that you ’re talking too slowly .
Consider Your Pacing .
That said , you do n’t always have to talk slowly .
The speed at which you speak is just another tool–be sure to use it .
Speak quickly for comic effect , or to emphasize the complexity of a process .
Wield the Pause .
Playwrights often write ( Pause ) .
I ’ve used it as a lazy transition , and a way to notify the actor that a speech ’s tone or subtext changes .
You can use a pause in the same way –implying a shift from one section to the next .
More importantly , the skillfully - wielded pause sharpens the audience ’s attention , and builds anticipation of your next point .
Costumes Matter .
I keep saying this , but here it is again : clothes are costumes , and costumes are powerful symbols .
Whether you ’re speaking to six of your colleagues or 600 strangers , your clothes matter .
They offer both context and subtext for what you ’re speaking about .
People are looking at you for a while –even if they do n’t process your clothes consciously , they ’ll do so in the background cycles of their brain .
Guy Kawasaki spoke after me at Gnomedex , and he wore this cool , casual shirt and jeans .
Maybe that ’s a carefully crafted image , or maybe it ’s just what he threw on that morning , but it says a lot about who he is as a speaker .
In short , make your presentations a little more like a play or a film .
A little creativity and humour goes a long way , so do n’t overdo it .
I think it was George Bernard Shaw who described entertainment as “ the jam that coats the pill of morality ” .
Your pill is probably more education or marketing than morality , but the lesson applies .
Entertain your audience , and they ’ll buy more of whatever it is you ’re selling .
@jesusdiaz : bummer !
I gave up LEGO except for one racing car that still resides on one of my cupboards .
I still have four huge crates of parts somewhere round here .
@icepick314 : That happened to me once in my life .
I was 12 years old and had just bought a huge truck with a trailer and a helicopter .
I realised that a crucial part was missing ( one of those custom parts ) .
That thing was n't a gift , and I spent about 120 Deutsch - Mark on that toy .
So I wrote a letter to Lego Germany , with a picture of the missing part attached .
About two weeks later they sent me that missing part along with a second model and a apology .
I gave that second model to my best friend as a gift .
Great music can inspire us to do anything : love one another , protest an unjust war , make sweet , sweet love to a large black man in the 1970s .
But in the ' 80s there were a series of songs that inspired us to kick ass in every way possible .
None inspired more ass kicking than these .

10 " The Final Countdown " by Europe
The synthesizer riff in this 1986 track is as fist - pumping as music gets without involving an actual instrument .
We 're not clear on what he 's counting down to , but somebody 's about to get their ass kicked .
If we were wrestlers and it was 1986 again , we 'd totally have this as our intro music .

The song takes a sharp decline after the chorus , when it slips from the vaguely threatening line " It 's the final countdown ! " into sci - fi - gibberish wails like " we 're heading for Venus , and still we 'll stand tall ! "
" The Final Countdown " needs some serious trimming .
If a remix were to come out that consists only of that synthesizer riff and the cry of " It 's the final countdown ! , " it would doubtlessly rank higher on this list .
But , hey , it 's European .
Just be grateful it's not about scat fetishes and exceedingly thin cigarettes .
Also , let 's face it .
That distinctly ' 80s synthesizer sound did n't exactly age well .
Those too young to remember the Cold War , in fact , tend to laugh upon hearing it .

In this otherwise lopsided article about security cameras , this one quote stands out :
But Steve Swain , who served for years with the London Metropolitan Police and its counter - terror operations , doubts the power of cameras to deter crime .
“ I do n’t know of a single incident where CCTV has actually been used to spot , apprehend or detain offenders in the act , ” he said , referring to the London system .
Swain now works for Control Risk , an international security firm .
Asked about their role in possibly stopping acts of terror , he said pointedly : “ The presence of CCTV is irrelevant for those who want to sacrifice their lives to carry out a terrorist act . ”
[…]
Swain does believe the cameras have great value in investigation work .
He also said they are necessary to reassure the public that law enforcement is being aggressive .
“ You need to do this piece of theater so that if the terrorists are looking at you , they can see that you ’ve got some measures in place , ” he said .

Jon Stewart : ' Ottoman - humping gigolos ruin troop morale '
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
Commenting on a new military policy that bans US troops in Iraq access to Web sites like MySpace and YouTube , Daily Show host Jon Stewart said the policy prevents " our fighting men from seeing the un-horrors of not - war . "
Stewart showed a popular YouTube clip of several young men simulating sex on pieces of furniture .
" Because if there 's one thing we do n't want our fighting boys exposed to , it 's guys their age with enough time on their hands to do this , " Stewart said before playing the clip .
" Ottoman - humping gigolos !
You 're ruining troop morale ! "
Stewart played a CNN clip of a commentator explaining the policy as preventing troops from using their work computers for something that is n't work .
" Yeah , stop f-- king around at work , guys who are involuntarily extended tours in the Sunni Triangle of death , " Stewart said .
" Here 's the thing , if you spend most of your day actually sweeping for mines , I think you can play a little Minesweeper when you 're done . "
Being disappointed during a game demo is n't usually a good sign , but there are exceptions to the rule .
We 're at a preview event for Mass Effect - BioWare 's hotly anticipated science - fiction RPG about buccaneering around the galaxy - and they 've just revealed a plot spoiler .
We 're already looking forward to playing it and now they 've gone and spoiled it by telling us all about the [ Deletedeletedelete .
Now you 've spoiled it for me !
Witch ! - Ed ]
No need to spoil it for you too , but we will say you 're given a difficult choice regarding a likeable character you 've spent hours building up and getting to know .
One option involves deviating from your main mission objective .
The other involves losing the character from your party .
And there 's a much broader ethical dilemma thrown in for good measure .
This is nothing new for a BioWare game .
Making choices which change how the game plays out was a defining feature of previous titles Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire .
But the choices in Mass Effect are much more complex and much harder to make , as studio president Greg Zeschuk explains .
" There are things you can do to keep this character in your party .
It might be things you had to have done earlier .
It 's a path you can follow if you do certain things consistently , " he says .
Decide and conquer
It 's behind you .
The choices you make , Zeschuk continues , can have such significant impacts on what happens in the rest of the game that you and a friend might have completely different experiences to compare once you 've finished the game .
" It 's a rollercoaster ride , and the thing is it 's your rollercoaster ride - someone else 's will be different . "
For Mass Effect , BioWare has developed not just the complexity of decision - making but the way the process plays out .
There are no more long lines of text and simple changes in facial expressions .
A summary of each multiple - choice response is shown as text , but when you select one your character is shown delivering a much longer answer and other characters respond accordingly .
Thanks to excellent visuals and decent acting , you feel like you 're watching a cut - scene you 're actively involved in .
The characters ' facial expressions , body language and even lip - synching are very well done .
We 're not quite out of the uncanny valley yet , but this is a significant step forwards .
According to Zeschuk , " There 's really nothing pre-rendered in this game .
At times you almost think , ' I 'm watching a great movie or a television show , ' but the reality is you 're effectively the actor and the director at the same time . "
Talk talk
There 's a lot of this sort of thing going on in Mass Effect .
In some of the scenes we played through , there was an awful lot of standing around while characters reeled off reams of plot exposition .
Taking part in a cut - scene is n't much fun if it 's a boring cut - scene .
And although you do n't have to try out all the " more info " responses , there 's a feeling you should just in case you miss out .
More interesting are the types of response that determine which moral path your character follows - Renegade or Paragon .
For example , your way is blocked by a couple of hired guns who are basically innocent amateurs .
You can either warn them off or take them out , and you 'll earn points whatever you decide .
Again , this idea is nothing new for a BioWare game , but there is a new system in place .
Now you can't just cancel out a bad action by performing a good one ; you rack Renegade and Paragon points on separate scales .
Nor can you make a single choice to determine a specific outcome .
NPCs will respond differently to you according to choices you 've made in the past , and the ending you see will depend on how you 've acted throughout the game - not just on the last decision you took .
In addition , choices affect your character 's abilities .
The more Renegade choices you make , the better you become at intimidating people .
Go down the Paragon path and you 'll find it easier to charm others into helping you out .
Pine starred in Just My Luck with Lindsay Lohan
Pine had to turn down a role opposite George Clooney in the film White Jazz in order to play Kirk because of a clash of filming schedules .
Lord of the Rings actor Karl Urban will play Leonard " Bones " McCoy , the Starship Enterprise 's medical officer .
The film , which chronicles the early days of the Enterprise crew , will be released in the US on 25 December 2008 .
The movie will show the crew meeting at the Starfleet Academy and embarking on their first mission .
NEW STAR TREK FILM CAST Captain Kirk - Chris Pine Older Mr Spock - Leonard Nimoy Young Mr Spock - Zachary Quinto Scotty - Simon Pegg Nero - Eric Bana Uhura - Zoe Saldana Chekov - Anton Yelchin Sulu - John Cho Leonard ' Bones ' McCoy - Karl Urban
The Paramount Pictures film is expected to begin shooting in November .
Urban 's character Bones was responsible for several of Star Trek 's famous phrases including : " He 's dead , Jim . "
New Zealand - born Urban played Eomer in the Lord of the Rings trilogy .
He also starred in The Bourne Supremacy .
The film , directed by Lost creator JJ Abrams , is Star Trek 's 11th big screen outing .
The most recent Trek film , Star Trek : Nemesis , was released in 2003 .
The next step is to identify how many of them live ( and are registered to vote ) in South Carolina .
For help , I turned to Professor Blease Graham of the University of South Carolina , and to Sam Wellborn , a graduate student at the school ’s Institute for Public Service and Policy Research , who shared survey data on the state ’s voters .
Suffice it to say that Graham is not persuaded of Colbert ’s electoral reach in the Palmetto State .
“ If this were the high school operetta , ” he told me , “ Colbert would be the amusement at intermission to keep the audience from straying in the second half . ”
Good sport that he is , Graham crunched the numbers anyway .
About 2.4 million people voted in the last presidential election , only a fraction of whom will vote in the primaries .
Graham estimated that about 600,000 will turn out for the Republican primary and about 350,000 for the Democratic primary .
Colbert ’s focus is on younger voters .
Graham made a back - of - the - envelope calculation that 260,000 people between the ages of 18 and 44 will vote in both primaries : 169,000 in the Republican primary and 91,000 in the Democratic primary .
That ’s Colbert ’s target .
But to guess how he might fare , it ’s necessary to examine a few more variables .
Colbert ’s viewers are assumed to be mostly liberals .
So let ’s look first at the Democratic primary .
It does n’t look great for Colbert .
Roughly speaking , 70 percent of South Carolina voters are white , and about 30 percent are black .
But most black voters are Democrats , and about half the state ’s Democratic primary electorate is black — not Colbert ’s audience .
Another problem : old people .
A consultant to one of the major presidential candidates ( all of the consultants I interviewed watch “ Colbert , ” all of them speculated about his prospects , and none of them would go on the record ) pointed out that Democratic primary voters are seriously old — older , on average , than Republican primary voters and especially old in South Carolina .
That ’s not Colbert ’s audience either .
The same applies to gender .
The Democratic primary electorate skews female , more so in South Carolina than elsewhere .
Colbert might fare better in the Republican primary .
According to one presidential advisor , the South Carolina Republican electorate is “ monolithically white , much more male than female , and younger ” than the Democratic electorate — all good news for Colbert .
As a rule of thumb , younger voters tend to be more liberal than older voters .
But in South Carolina , younger voters are more conservative than their counterparts elsewhere .
Factor in “ Reaganiness , ” and things could really get interesting .
The next question is :
Which presidential candidates might be threatened by a Colbert candidacy ?
The obvious group is second - tier competitors , because if Colbert runs more than a “ front - porch ” campaign — if he actually shows up and holds a few rallies — he ’ll suck up the media buzz any laggard needs to break through .
Sam Brownback may cite other reasons for dropping out today , but Colbert ’s plan to run in South Carolina would n’t have made his job there any easier .
Same is true for Bill Richardson , Chris Dodd , Joe Biden , and Mike Huckabee .
I put Ron Paul in a separate category of “ protest candidate , ” but he should be sweating , too .
Paul ’s supporters are among the most passionate and committed this cycle .
But their profile is similar to that of the voters Colbert might attract .
( “ Pot smokers , ” a Republican consultant called them . )
Anonymous presidential advisor : “ If Colbert wants to do it he ’s got to convert every young , semi-liberal Ron Paul supporter to the Colbert cause .
If a young white male is going to vote , watches Comedy Central , and is internet savvy , chances are he ’s a Ron Paul supporter . ”
Some of those New York intellectual types can be rather tightly wound .
Here , the OriginalUnoriginal reports as eminence grise Harold Bloom , the king of litcrit heavyweights , Sterling Professor for the Humanities at Yale University , and Berg Professor of English and American Literature at New York University , goes apeshit on some hapless Pottermaniacs .
“ It ’s crap !
It ’s fucking crap !

What would a relativistic interstellar traveller see ?
We are all familiar with the picture .
Captain Picard ( or whoever ) orders warp speed , and we see the stars turn into lines sweeping by the ship .
But how realistic is this picture ?
Here we will briefly overview what an astronaut approaching light speed would really see , according to the theory of special relativity .
It is a similar question to that addressed in " Can You See the Lorentz - Fitzgerald Contraction ? " , so you may want to read that section first .
Let us consider two effects separately , the geometric effect on the direction from where photons come , called aberration , and the effect on the radiation , including Doppler and beaming effects .
What is aberration ?
Imagine the astronaut Celesta being in her spaceship at rest with respect to the distant stars .
Photons from these stars come in isotropically from all directions .
Accelerating to relativistic speeds , she sees how the whole field of view seems to shrink in the direction of travel .
Even photons from stars that Celesta knows are behind , come in from the forward direction .
This is the effect of aberration .
Figure 1 .
The figure shows arriving photons from 12 fixed distant stars placed evenly around the circle .
To the left the spaceship is at rest with respect to the stars , and the photons arrive as expected .
In the centre figure the spaceship travels at half the velocity of light , and the directions of arriving photons are clearly skewed to come from the forward direction .
To the right the ship travels at 0.99c , and almost all photons arrive from the front , even photons that originate from stars that actually are located behind .
Although not entirely correct , a useful picture to understand aberration intuitively is to think of the photons as hard balls travelling with a finite velocity .
When the spaceship moves , in its own inertial frame the photons get a velocity component added in the opposite direction to the spaceship movement .
Therefore the photons seem to come from a direction closer to the forward direction .
Figure 2 .
This figure shows aberration effects for the ship travelling towards the constellation of Orion , assuming a 30 degrees field of view .
The field of view is kept constant , only the speed is changed from 0 to 0.99 c , showing dramatic effects on the perceived field .
No radiative effects are considered , only geometrical aberration .
Doppler shift and beaming
Now let us focus on the light itself , coming from the stars .
Starlight consists of light in a wide range of wavelengths , so while it is true that an approaching star will have its light Doppler shifted into shorter wavelengths ( except for very high and inclined velocities ) , it is not necessarily true in general that the star will show a bluer colour .
The reason is that the whole spectral energy distribution is shifted , so that a previously invisible infrared part may contribute considerably to a redder colour , and similarly , light from the blue part of the spectrum may be shifted out to the invisible UV .
Considerations of the flux lead to what is generally called beaming .
Beaming is related to aberration in that flux intensity is increased in the forward direction due to the squeezing of the total flux .
In addition , if we consider a steady stream of photons , they tend to arrive more often if one travels towards the source , and less often if one recedes .
This results in higher flux intensity , and causes stars in front to get brighter , and from rear to get fainter .
Figure 3 .
The sensitivity of the eye cones as a function of wavelength .
The Human Eye
The human eye is really only sensitive to a limited range of wavelengths .
Evaluating what Celesta would see in her spacecraft , we therefore also need to consider her eye physiology .
Figure 3 shows approximate curves for the relative sensitivities of the three different cones of a human eye as a function of wavelength .
To calculate the appearance of a star , we need to integrate its spectral energy distribution multiplied with each sensitivity curve to get the RGB ( red - green - blue ) signal .
Figure 4 .
In this figure we see how Doppler shift and beaming effect the appearances of stars , without taking aberration into account .
This is the same field as in figure 2 , the constellation of Orion , and we are imagining the ship speeding to the centre of Orion .
The bright red star is the upper left corner is the red supergiant Betelgeuse , and the bright blue star in the lower left is the blue supergiant Rigel .
In the left panel the two stars are of about the same brightness , but as we increase the speed , Betelgeuse starts to outshine Rigel .
This is due to the Doppler shift ; the red Betelgeuse gets its large infrared spectral energy distribution shifted into the visible region , while the blue Rigel gets its spectral energy distribution shifted out to UV and x-ray wavelengths until it fades away .
Many previously invisible or faint stars in the background get boosted enough by the beaming effect that they become visible .
Note particularly the somewhat faint star to the lower right of Orion ’s belt , the red giant star 31 Orionis .
In the first panel it is definitely fainter than the stars in the Orion belt , while in the last it is the second brightest star in the field , because of its intrinsic very red colour .
Travelling very far , very fast
By combining the geometric and radiative relativistic effects we get a picture of what the surrounding space would look like to Celesta .
Orion is shown again in figure 5 , now without the constellation lines and with both relativistic effects taken into account .
The combined effect makes the beaming of the field become very apparent at high velocities ; at 0.99 c almost all visible radiation from the universe is confined to a region 10 degrees in radius around the direction of travel .
Figure 5 . Both relativistic effects switched on .
Even at these speeds Celesta hardly notices any motion at all .
At 0.99 c she experiences time about 7 times slower than the surrounding universe , and thus speeds on at about 7 light years in a year ship - time ( note that she only measures a covered distance of about 1 light year from her own inertial frame , but space from there is Lorentz - Fitzgerald contracted 7 times ) .
To get to the nearest extrasolar star alpha Centauri would take her about 7 months ship - time .
To see stars fly by like in certain sci - fi series , she would have to travel much faster , on the order of light years per experienced ship second .
This corresponds to the actual velocity of 0.9999999999999994 c , or ( 1 − 6×10 − 16 ) c .
At this extremely high ultra-relativistic velocity , radiation from the universe would emanate from a single point in the direction of travel , and all radiation , even the cosmic background , would be Doppler shifted out to gamma ray wavelengths or far radio , with next to nothing in between .
Not exactly as seen on TV ( surprise ! ) .

Former military personnel are twice as likely to kill themselves as people who have not seen combat reports a study in the July issue of Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health .
The results suggest that doctors need to look out for signs of suicidal intentions in soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Researchers in the United States followed up 320,000 men aged over 18 years for 12 years and found that those who had served in the armed forces at some time between 1917 and 1994 were twice as likely to die from suicide compared with men in the general population .
The risk was highest in veterans who could not participate fully in home , work or leisure activities because of a health problem .
Veterans that killed themselves were also more likely to be older , white , better educated and less likely to have never been married than other suicides .
Interestingly , former soldiers who were overweight were far less likely to kill themselves than those of normal weight .
However , a tour of duty in the military did not increase the risk of dying from natural or accidental causes , or of being a homicide victim .
The authors concluded : ' With the projected rise in functional impairments and psychiatric morbidity among veterans of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq , clinical and community interventions that are directed towards these patients are needed . '
' Clinicians need to be alert for signs of suicidal intent among veterans , as well as their access to firearms . '
The researchers found that veterans were 58 % more likely to use a gun to kill themselves than other suicides .

Using Rankings
In Your College Research
College rankings are some of the most sought - after data when it comes to identifying superior colleges and universities .
People often seek rankings data out of a desire to attend the best online colleges , or maximize the value of their education .
However , to maximize the usefulness of rankings , you must look closely over the raters ' methodology , or the formulas they use to come to their ranking conclusions .
Why does this matter ?
Because what 's important to you in a college may not be what 's important to a rankings institution .
The Chronicle of Higher Education identified 30 ways to rank a college , including emphasizing factors like total cost to students and student loan debt , or emphasizing admissions selectivity and the quality of the institution 's teaching staff .
Since raters focus on so many different aspects of a school , it 's important to look carefully over the methodology for any rankings you come across to ensure that your priorities are reflected .
OEDb 's rankings differ from others in that they are limited solely to online schools .
We 've created a set of objective , quantitative rankings that should help shed some light on how the top online colleges stack up against each other in 11 areas of study .
For each college , we gathered data for eight different metrics — the number of full - time faculty per part - time faculty member , institutional financial aid rate , acceptance rate , retention rate , graduation rate , years accredited , default rates , and job placement rates .
And unlike some other rankings , we gave all of these metrics equal weight because we believe that no one metric is more valuable than another .
While rankings are a good means of comparing the best online colleges using largely quantitative data , keep in mind that this is only one way of evaluating a school .
Qualitative data , such as how happy a student is attending a specific school , the attitude and values of the student body or instructors , or how successful a student is upon graduation , are factors that are harder to quantify , but equally as important .
Let our rankings help you with your initial research to determine which schools could be a good fit for you .

Of all Leonardo ’s bridge designs , the self - supporting bridge is certainly the most ingenious in the simplicity of its structure and construction .
We do not know whether this bridge was ever put to practical use , but it is not hard to believe that such a modular construction , extremely easy to transport and to assemble , must have met with great favor from the Renaissance lords who were always on the lookout for new technologies to put to military use .
It is in fact a structure composed of simple circular section beams , which are assembled without the use of fastenings or interlocking joints .
Once assembled , the weight of the bridge should be sufficient to exert the necessary pressure so that the longitudinal beams – closing like a pair of scissors – lock the transverse beams in place , thus preventing the structure from collapsing .
The greater the pressure on the upper part of this bridge , the greater its stability .

The swing bridge was probably also one of the projects mentioned in Leonardo ’s letter of self - recommendation to Ludovico , the Moor , and is one of the most spectacular and futuristic of his designs .
Even though it was probably never built , it forms part of his urban studies which , as is well - known , envisaged new settlements around a close network of canals that were to serve as drains and as waterways for commercial
traffic .
By means of an articulated system of winches and wheels , the bridge is made to rotate by 90° , thus allowing boats to pass , or both banks of the canal to be cut off .
To maintain the bridge ’s balance during the opening phase , and to prevent the whole structure giving way beneath its own forward weight , Leonardo provided a caisson full of stones to act as a counterbalance until the bridge came to rest on the opposite
bank .

Excavation is carried out by 26 workmen on two levels .
The large machine has two crane booms mounted one above the other on the same vertical axis .
The machine is mounted on wood tracks in the canal , and when pulled by a screw mechanism slides forward .
The two crane booms function using the same rope , acting on the principle of counter - balance : the laborers work in teams so that when a bucket in the canal is full , another has already been emptied onto the embankment .
The men on the embankment climb into the empty bucket which moves downward and by means of the counter - weight the rope in turn lifts the other filled bucket .

This is a hydraulic saw .
The wheel at the front is operated by a stream of running water .
The water - powered device activates a system of connecting rods that use reciprocating motion to work the saw at the top .
At the same time , a winch slowly and gradually moves the carriage at the top , thus pushing the tree trunk or planks as they are sawn .

In the center of the sheet is the paddle boat ’s “ motor ” .
The external paddles are only outlined .
Two pedals set the mechanism in motion that are linked to a belt creating a reciprocating motion .
The mechanism transforms the reciprocating motion into a continuous rotary motion for the paddles .
At top right , the device is shown with a large flywheel .

The folio 172r , which has a red background , shows a number of ideas for a ship with a cannon and moveable protective shield .
At the top , there are a number of winches and naval supports .
At the bottom , there are two drawings of the ship .
There is a detailed study of the metal point of the prow , especially in regard to the system for anchoring and opening the shields .
The two open and closed shields have different shapes because of the difficulty of finding the correct geometrical format .
The shields are opened and closed by means of a winch set on the prow .

To be manufactured from copper , the breech of the canon would be built into a brazier of burning coals which would heat it to very high temperatures .
Following this , a small amount of water would be injected just behind the iron ball .
When the water turned to steam it would drive the ball out under pressure .
Given that Leonardo even quoted how large a cannonball this weapon could fire , and how far it would travel , it is quite feasible that this weapon was actually built and test - fired .

The Renaissance concept of the ideal city is expressed by Leonardo in his rigorously geometric urban planning .
His ideal city is characterised by the perfect integration of a network of canals , which are used both for commercial purposes as well as a sewage system .
Leonardo conceived of buildings as hydraulic machines which distributed water in all the rooms of the house as well as in the artisan workshops through a mechanical lifting system .
In the workshops the energy released in this way was used to drive various types of machines .
The ideal city , therefore , was organised in a functional way and Leonardo describes , in Manuscript B in particular , some of the buildings and its mechanisms .
This image depicts a hypothetical location with a lock in the foreground which is used to manage the navigation on different levels .
On the right hand side one can see the reconstruction of the building that Leonardo draws on folio 16 in Manuscript B .
Here he also describes the function of each street and level .
Each street is twelve metres wide and the distance between each level is three and a half metres .

Fra le macchine volanti concepite da Leonardo la vite aerea costituisce un'alternativa ai modelli ad ala battente .
La particolarità di questa macchina consiste nell ' ipotesi tecnico scientifica su cui si basa la possibilità di volare : l'enorme vela ad elica ruotando doveva avvitarsi nell 'aria sollevando la macchina .
Leonardo si richiama qui al principio della vite dal quale fu affascinato fin dalla gioventù quando , a Firenze , aveva visto all ' opera le macchine per il sollevamento dei pesi ideate da Brunelleschi .
Questa ipotesi del volo presuppone anche l'idea che l'aria abbia un certo spessore materiale , necessario perché la vite possa procedere attraverso esso .

Leonardo progetta questa macchina per velocizzare le operazioni di rimozione della terra durante gli scavi per la realizzazione di canali .
Essa è in grado di spostarsi grazie a un ingegnoso sistema di rotaie e viti per seguire l' avanzamento dei lavori .
Si tratta di un ' enorme gru a doppio braccio azionata da una sola corda che funziona sul principio del saliscendi : le squadre di scavatori lavorano su tre livelli sincronizzando le loro operazioni in modo che ogni volta che un contenitore di terra è pieno viene sollevato rispedendo in basso il contenitore scarico per mezzo del peso dei lavoratori , che lo utilizzano come ascensore per tornare sul posto di lavoro .
Il lavoro era organizzato nel seguente modo : mentre una squadra di scavatori riempiva il cassone in basso , un ' altra squadra scaricava il cassone legato all ' altro capo della corda fuori dal canale .
Quando il cassone in basso era riempito , la squadra all 'esterno , che nel frattempo aveva recuperato energie , saltava dentro il cassone raggiungendo il proprio posto di lavoro , mentre gli operai in basso uscivano dal canale e andavano a scaricare il cassone pieno di terra .

414 ~ Cuscinetto cilindrico verticale ~ Codex Madrid , f. 101v
414_mad101v_01
Al tempo di Leonardo venivano largamente impiegate per il sollevamento di carichi pesanti le binde , azionate girando una vite .
La loro utilità era però limitata perchè , sotto una forte pressione , si sviluppava un grande attrito fra il dado girante e il disco su cui esso pesava .
Tra gli studi di Leonardo per ridurre l'attrito fra il dado girante e la placca della binda , vi è anche la tipologia del cuscinetto cilindrico verticale .
415 ~ Cuscinetto cilindrico orizzontale ~ Codex Madrid , f. 101v

Nei suoi studi , Leonardo giunse a formulare parecchi principi generali sull ' attrito e inventò veri e propri cuscinetti a sfere e a rulli , anticipando sin nei particolari quelle componenti così essenziali ai meccanismi moderni , dai pattini a rotelle alle automobili .
Una di queste è il cuscinetto cilindrico orizzontale .

The teacher , a Christian , was attacked after supervising an exam in Gombe city .
It is not clear what she had done to anger the students .
The authorities , concerned that communal unrest could break out , have ordered all the city 's schools to shut .
Similar accusations sparked riots in neighbouring Bauchi State last year .
At least 15,000 people have been killed in religious , communal or political violence since the country returned to civilian rule in 1999 .
' Restored calm '
Nigerian police say students beat the teacher to death outside the school compound after she had been invigilating an exam .
The students had apparently accused her of desecrating the Koran , though it is not clear exactly what she had done .
The police arrived at the scene to restore calm and say their intervention stopped a riot .
The BBC's Alex Last in Lagos says violence based on such accusations is not new .
Last year , in Bauchi State , a rumour swept the city that a Christian teacher had also desecrated the Koran , which prompted riots in which at least five people were killed .
In fact , the teacher had confiscated the Koran from a pupil who was reading it in class .
Religious differences have long been used to justify all kinds of violence in Nigeria , our reporter says .
In reality it is often fuelled by ethnic or political conflicts and competition for resources , which can be fierce , given that so many people live in poverty , he says .
It has been legal to make wine at home since the end of prohibition , and legal to make beer since 1978 , but it 's still illegal to distill spirits for beverage purposes without going through so much fuss and bother that the government admits flat out that it's " impractical . "
That 's too bad , because homemade moonshine is incredibly frugal .
( See also : 21 Great Uses for Beer )
Making moonshine is easy .
In one sense , making any alcoholic beverage is easy , because the yeast do all the work .
But moonshine is especially easy because running it through a still makes all the delicate balancing of flavors that mark a great beer or wine irrelevant .
I learned most of what I know about moonshine from the classic book Possum living :
How to live well without a job and with almost no money by Dolly Freed .
( A great book and well worth reading . )
[ Updated 2010 - 01 - 14 to add : ; I 've just learned that Tin House books has reissued Possum Living !
It 's wonderful to see this classic once again available a reasonable price . ]
Alcoholic beverages all start with yeast and with sugar for the yeast to eat .
The sugar for wine usually comes from grapes ( although other fruits are used , especially for homemade wine ) .
The sugar for beer usually comes from malted barley ( although other grains are also used ) .
The sugar for commercially produced spirits can come from almost anything — corn for bourbon , barley for scotch , rye for rye , sugar cane for rum , and so on .
For moonshine , what you want is the cheapest sugar you can find .
Dolly Freed found that the cheapest sugar she could find was white granulated sugar .
Nowadays , corn syrup might be cheaper .
Let me take a moment here to praise yeast .
I 'm a huge fan of yeast .
They work tirelessly to make our bread and our booze , then uncomplainingly give up their lives that we may eat and drink .
If there were an American Yeast Council , I 'd want to be their spokesman .
The main difference between brewer 's yeast and baker 's yeast is that brewer 's yeast has been bred to survive a higher alcohol content .
That lets wine makers work with natural fruit juices that have a high concentration of sugar and get a higher concentration of alcohol before the yeast die of alcohol poisoning .
If you 're going to make your own sugar solution to grow the yeast in , though , you can just make the sugar solution 's strength match what the yeast can convert before they die .
It all comes out even with no waste .
According to Dolly Freed , it is a happy coincidence that 5 pounds of sugar in 3 gallons of water works out just right for ordinary baker 's yeast .
[ Updated 2007 - 12 - 30 to add :
A lot of people have asked how much yeast to add .
I answered that in comment # 16 below , but that 's an obscure place to look for the answer , so I 'm copying what I said up here .
I 'd add one packet .
Since the yeast reproduce , it almost does n't matter how much you add — after 20 minutes you 've got twice as much , so if you add half as much it changes your total fermentation time from 10 days to 10 days 20 minutes .
All you need to do is add enough that your yeast overwhelms any wild yeast that happen to get in .
( There are wild yeast in the air everywhere , so you really can't avoid them . ) ]
There are lots of good books on making beer and making wine .
Any of them will describe the fermentation process , but very briefly you just :
add sugar to the water bring to a boil ( to kill any wild yeast in it and make it easy to dissolve the sugar ) wait until the temperature comes down to 110 °F ( so you do n't kill your own yeast ) add yeast wait
The fermenting liquid is called the " must . "
You want to leave it loosely covered to keep other things from getting into it ( wild yeasts , mold spores , etc. ) , but the yeast produce carbon dioxide as well as alcohol and you want to make sure the carbon dioxide can easily escape .
If you seal it up tightly , it could explode .
Give it 10 to 25 days ( depending on various things , but mainly how warm it is ) .
You 'll know its done when it :
quits bubbling
begins to turn clear
no longer tastes sweet
Now , if you were making beer or wine you 'd have several more steps : bottling , aging , etc .
Making moonshine , though , all you need to do is distill the stuff .
For that , you need a still .
You can buy a still , but you probably do n't want to .
( They cost money , and the federal government — which scarcely polices this activity at all — probably does keep tabs on people who buy stills from commercial outlets . )
A still , though , is just :
a pot with a lid with a hole in it
with a with a in it a tube , closely fit to that hole , running to a jar
something to cool that tube
You bring the pot to a boil , the alcohol evaporates , the vapor goes out the hole , into the tube , and the condenses back into liquid alcohol .
Conveniently , an old - fashioned pressure cooker is a pot with a hole in the lid .
Modern pressure cookers wo n't work as well , because they have a fancy valve to release the pressure , but with an old - fashioned one you just remove the weight and then fit the tube to the valve .
If you 've got some room , you can just make the tube long enough and you do n't need to do anything extra to condense the alcohol .
Using a tube that coils some can save space .
Alternatively , you can run your tube through a sleeve and run cold tap water through the sleeve .
( Dolly Freed has a diagram of just such a setup . )
The things to be sure of here are that your entire set - up needs to be of food - quality materials : copper , aluminum , stainless steel are all fine .
Plastics are iffy as some may leach stuff into the alcohol .
Lead is right out , as is putting the pieces together with solder that includes lead .
Make sure the hole can't get plugged up , which could lead to your still exploding .
Set up your still and bring it to a light boil .
Pretty soon you 'll have almost pure alcohol dripping into your jar .
The water content of the distillate will gradually increase .
At some point a sample taken from the tube will no longer taste of alcohol , and you 're done .
As I said , it 's too bad it 's illegal .
Otherwise you could make some pretty good booze ( well , let 's say barely drinkable booze ) for the price of a few pounds of sugar .

Relatives of the hostages want the US to take action
They visited the US embassy in Seoul on Wednesday , and were told their plea would be passed to Washington .
The Taleban have already killed two of the 23 hostages , and threatened to shoot more if their demand of a prisoner release is not met .
South Korean officials have reportedly been holding talks with the Taleban to try to secure the hostages ' release .
Mounting pressure
The 23 Korean Christian aid workers - 18 of them women - were seized on 19 July as they were travelling on a bus down the Kabul to Kandahar highway .
The aid workers ' leader , Pastor Bae Hyung - kyu , was the first to be shot dead by the militants .
His death was reported over the weekend .
On Tuesday , South Korea confirmed that a second hostage had been killed - 29 - year - old Shim Sung - min , a former IT worker .
The family members who visited the US embassy in Seoul said they were determined to do all they could to save their loved ones .
" We will hold on to any small hope to save them , " said Ryu Haeng - sik , whose 35 - year - old wife Kim Yoon - yong is one of the captives .
" We can not say we 're relieved , but there is no other way but to believe their words , that they 're going to do their best , " he said of the American officials .
The Seoul government has also appealed for " flexibility " in negotiations with the Taleban - which analysts say is effectively a request for the US to make an exception to its policy of refusing to acquiesce to the group 's demands .
The presidential office issued a statement on Tuesday , admitting that Seoul was powerless to grant Taleban demands , " because it does n't have any effective means to influence decisions of the Afghan government " .
The international community , and the US in particular , is seen to have much greater leverage .
But Afghan President Hamid Karzai has already refused to swap prisoners for hostages , after he was criticised for releasing five Taleban members from jail in March in exchange for an Italian reporter .
' Do n't kill , negotiate '
As the hostage saga continues , anti-US sentiment in South Korea is rising , with local people angry that Washington has not stepped in to help .
About 100 protesters held a rally outside the US embassy on Wednesday , carrying banners reading " Bush : Don't kill , negotiate " and shouting : " The US is responsible for the killing of hostages " .
US President George Bush " has a responsibility to intervene and negotiate with the Taleban " , activist Oh Hye - ran told the Associated Press .
Outrage over the killing has also sparked increasing calls for South Korea to pull out its 200 troops in Afghanistan , or even to send these troops to rescue the remaining captives .
A Kentucky grand jury indicted one of the three officers involved in Breonna Taylor ’s case , but not her death .
The other officers were not charged .

Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) suggested Tuesday that people who download copyright materials from the Internet should have their computers automatically destroyed .
But Hatch himself is using unlicensed software on his official website , which presumably would qualify his computer to be smoked by the system he proposes .
The senator 's site makes extensive use of a JavaScript menu system developed by Milonic Solutions , a software company based in the United Kingdom .
The copyright - protected code has not been licensed for use on Hatch 's website .
" It 's an unlicensed copy , " said Andy Woolley , who runs Milonic .
" It 's very unfortunate for him because of those comments he made . "
Hatch on Tuesday surprised a Senate hearing on copyright issues with the suggestion that technology should be developed to remotely destroy the computers of people who illegally download music from the Net .
Hatch said damaging someone 's computer " may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights , " the Associated Press reported .
He then suggested the technology would twice warn a computer user about illegal online behavior , " then destroy their computer . "
Any such technology would be in violation of federal antihacking laws .
The senator , who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , suggested Congress would have to make copyright holders exempt from current laws for them to legally destroy people 's computers .
On Wednesday , Hatch clarified his comments , but stuck by the original idea .
" I do not favor extreme remedies – unless no moderate remedies can be found , " he said in a statement .
" I asked the interested industries to help us find those moderate remedies . "
Just as well .
Because if Hatch 's terminator system embraced software as well as music , his servers would be targeted for destruction .
Milonic Solutions ' JavaScript code used on Hatch 's website costs $ 900 for a site - wide license .
It is free for personal or nonprofit use , which the senator likely qualifies for .
However , the software 's license stipulates that the user must register the software to receive a licensing code , and provide a link in the source code to Milonic 's website .
On Wednesday , the senator 's site met none of Milonic 's licensing terms .
The site 's source code ( which can be seen by selecting Source under the View menu in Internet Explorer ) had neither a link to Milonic 's site nor a registration code .
However , by Thursday afternoon Hatch 's site had been updated to contain some of the requisite copyright information .
An old version of the page can be seen by viewing Google 's cache of the site .
" They 're using our code , " Woolley said Wednesday .
" We 've had no contact with them .
They are in breach of our licensing terms . "
When contacted Thursday , Woolley said the company that maintains the senator 's site had e-mailed Milonic to begin the registration process .
Woolley said the code added to Hatch 's site after the issue came to light met some – but not all – of Milonic 's licensing requirements .
Before the site was updated , the source code on Hatch 's site contained the line : " * i am the license for the menu ( duh ) *"
Woolley said he had no idea where the line came from – it has nothing to do with him , and he had n't seen it on other websites that use his menu system .
" It looks like it 's trying to cover something up , as though they got a license , " he said .
A spokesman in Hatch 's office on Wednesday responded , " That 's ironic " before declining to put Wired News in contact with the site 's webmaster .
He deferred comment on the senator 's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee , which did not return calls .
The apparent violation was discovered by Laurence Simon , an unemployed system administrator from Houston , who was poking around Hatch 's site after becoming outraged by his comments .
Milonic 's Woolley said the senator 's unlicensed use of his software was just " the tip of the iceberg . "
He said he knows of at least two other senators using unlicensed copies of his software , and many big companies .
Continental Airlines , for example , one of the largest airlines in the United States , uses Woolley 's system throughout its Continental.com website .
Woolley said the airline has not paid for the software .
Worse , the copyright notices in the source code have been removed .
" That really pisses me off , " he said .
A spokesman for Continental said the airline would look into the matter .
Woolley makes his living from his software .
Like a lot of independent programmers , he struggles to get people to conform to his licensing terms , let alone pay for his software .
" We do n't want blood , " he said .
" We just want payment for the hard work we do .
We work very , very hard .
If they 're not prepared to pay , they 're software pirates . "

Austin , Tex .
THE term “ food miles ” — how far food has traveled before you buy it — has entered the enlightened lexicon .
Environmental groups , especially in Europe , are pushing for labels that show how far food has traveled to get to the market , and books like Barbara Kingsolver ’s “ Animal , Vegetable , Miracle : A Year of Food Life ” contemplate the damage wrought by trucking , shipping and flying food from distant parts of the globe .
There are many good reasons for eating local — freshness , purity , taste , community cohesion and preserving open space — but none of these benefits compares to the much - touted claim that eating local reduces fossil fuel consumption .
In this respect eating local joins recycling , biking to work and driving a hybrid as a realistic way that we can , as individuals , shrink our carbon footprint and be good stewards of the environment .
On its face , the connection between lowering food miles and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions is a no-brainer .
In Iowa , the typical carrot has traveled 1,600 miles from California , a potato 1,200 miles from Idaho and a chuck roast 600 miles from Colorado .
Seventy - five percent of the apples sold in New York City come from the West Coast or overseas , the writer Bill McKibben says , even though the state produces far more apples than city residents consume .
These examples just scratch the surface of the problem .
In light of this market redundancy , the only reasonable reaction , it seems , is to count food miles the way a dieter counts calories .
But is reducing food miles necessarily good for the environment ?
Researchers at Lincoln University in New Zealand , no doubt responding to Europe ’s push for “ food miles labeling , ” recently published a study challenging the premise that more food miles automatically mean greater fossil fuel consumption .
Other scientific studies have undertaken similar investigations .
According to this peer - reviewed research , compelling evidence suggests that there is more — or less — to food miles than meets the eye .
NEW YORK — Corals get cold sores too .
Only , for corals , a herpes virus infection is n’t just annoying .
It can be lethal , and it and other diseases are possibly a big factor in the deaths of coral reefs that humans are causing throughout the world ’s oceans , new research shows .
Scientists have known for years that humans are killing corals indirectly and directly through global warming , overfishing and pollution .
Many reefs off populous coasts have been decimated , while those near uninhabited areas are often thriving .
“ For some reason , when you put people next to reefs , they die , ” said microbiologist Forest Rohwer of San Diego State University at a recent symposium at the American Museum of Natural History here .
A 2004 study found that 70 percent of the world ’s reefs had been destroyed or were threatened by global warming and other human activities .
But just how these problems translate into a death sentence for corals has been difficult to work out .
Millions of microbes
Corals reefs are some of the most stunningly diverse habitats on the planet .
They are home to thousands of species at all levels of the food chain : invertebrates such as sponges and starfish , small fish such as angelfish and clown fish , big fish such as parrot fish , barracuda , groupers and snappers , and even sharks .
“ These are basically the most beautiful thing on the planet , ” Rohwer said .
But the most amazing variety , he said , is actually found in the realm we ca n’t see : “ We know [ from DNA sequencing ] that the most diverse things on a coral reef are actually the microbial community . ”
There are about 10 million bacteria and 1 billion archaea on every square centimeter of coral , and two neighboring corals can have completely different microbes living on their surfaces .
The reefs are also constantly interacting with the water surrounding them — in only a milliliter of ocean water ( about one - fifth of a teaspoon ) there are about one million bacteria and 10 million viruses .
Organic carbon , a food source for the microbes , is produced by algae around the reef , but is usually gobbled up by small fishes , which are eaten by big fishes , which in turn are eaten by sharks , so very little of the carbon is left in the water column to feed the microbes .
“ This allows the coral to actually control their microbial community by providing the food source to them through their mucous , ” Rohwer explained .
Normally , corals use their cilia ( tiny finger - like structures ) to pass the bacteria along and push them off in balls of mucous that come off the corals and burst , Rohwer said .
But when humans come into the picture , microbes get the upper hand .
A microbial explosion
When humans overfish a reef , there ’s nothing left to eat the food produced by the algae , so all that carbon builds up in the water column and feeds the microbes , sort of like " MicrobeGro " fertilizer , building up their numbers and overwhelming the coral .
“ The coral is actually losing control of its microbial community , ” Rohwer said .
Even though these microbes normally live in a harmonious balance with the coral , they are still potential pathogens .
Rohwer and his colleagues tested their idea by putting pieces of Panamanian corals in cups with seawater , and adding different “ treatments ” to each cup , and essentially “ just look[ing ] for the coral to die , ” Rohwer said .
Organic carbon was indeed the biggest coral killer .
Herpes outbreak
Rebecca
Thurber , one of Rohwer ’s postdoctoral researchers , also took pieces of coral and changed conditions such as nutrients , temperature and water pH , then cut up the coral and sequenced the DNA of the microbes that grew on their surface .
And what was the number one disease affecting the corals ?
Herpes viruses .
“ They dominate almost all the viruses that are present , ” Thurber told LiveScience .
Herpes viruses are naturally found in many different animals ( 95 percent of humans carry some kind of herpes virus ) .
“ Everybody in this room has at least a couple herpes viruses running around , ” Rohwer said at the symposium , causing some in the audience to chuckle .
“ And when you get stressed , or immuno - compromised , they ’re going to start hopping out and giving you little cold sores or other wounds that we wo n’t talk about . ”
“ That seems to be what ’s going on in the corals too , ” he added .
Rohwer and Therber ’s findings suggest that these disease outbreaks are just one of the many ways human activity is killing off corals .
“ They ’re screwed no matter what we do to them , ” Rohwer said .

Baudrillard was a prolific writer , penning more than 50 works
Baudrillard , a leading post - modernist thinker , is perhaps best known for his concept of hyper-reality .
He argued that spectacle is crucial in creating our view of events - things do not happen if they are not seen .
He gained notoriety for his 1991 book The Gulf War Did Not Take Place and again a decade later for describing the 9/11 attacks as a " dark fantasy " .
Baudrillard focused his work on how our consciousness interacts with reality and fantasy , creating from them a copy world he called hyper-reality .
He said that mass media led to hyper - reality becoming a dominant force in today 's world - an argument taken to a provocative extreme in his statement that the 1991 Gulf War primarily took place on a symbolic level .
Since little was changed politically in Iraq after the conflict , all the sound and fury signified little , he argued .
' Dark fantasy '
In his essay The Spirit of Terrorism : Requiem for the Twin Towers , he caused controversy again by describing the 9/11 attacks as a fusion of history , symbolism and dark fantasy , " the mother of all events " .
While terrorists had committed the atrocity , he wrote : " It is we who have wanted it .
Terrorism is immoral , and it responds to a globalisation that is itself immoral . "
Born in Rheims into a peasant family , he studied German at the Sorbonne , later working as a teacher and translator .
He taught sociology throughout the 1960s .
He was a prolific writer , penning more than 50 works including : Simulacra and Simulation ( 1981 ) , America ( 1986 ) , and The Spirit of Terrorism : An Requiem for the Twin Towers ( 2002 ) .

His daughter Sandy quotes Will Crowther as saying , “ You know I 've done all sorts of wonderful things in my career , it 's funny that the one thing I 'm remembered for is ‘ Adventure ’ ” [ Lawrence 2002 ] .
Before he coded his legendary game , Crowther had helped map the complex network of caverns on which the game is based ; and before that , he had already secured a place in history due to his contributions to a different network .
As a member of the team of programmers at Bolt , Beranek and Newman ( BBN ) , he helped create the ARPANET , the immediate forerunner to the internet .
Crowther has described himself putting a copy of the game on his BBN computer , leaving for a month 's vacation , and returning to find the game being played all over the internet [ Hafner 1994 ] .
Among those who found the game at this stage were two Stanford graduate students , Don Woods and John Gilbert .
According to Gilbert ( 2005 ) , someone ( possibly the instructor , Bob Floyd ) mentioned the game in their CS204 class ( a “ programming and problem - solving seminar ” ) — after which Gilbert and Woods “ stayed up all night at the AI lab playing the game and mapping the cave , including scanning the binary code for character strings in order to guess what the possibilities were . ”
After contacting Crowther and requesting the source code , Woods greatly increased the game 's size , complexity , and polish .
“ In early 1977 …. [ w ] henarrived at MIT , the reaction was typical : after everybody spent a lot of time doing nothing but solving the game ( it 's estimated thatset the entire computer industry back two weeks ) , the true lunatics began to think about how they could do it better ” [ Anderson 1985 ] .
During this time , Tom Van Vleck was a managing engineer at Honeywell .
He describes “ Adventure ” as just another fad .
“ [ S ] ome staff members spent many hours at it .
Others played it once or twice , showed it to relatives and friends , and lost interest .
Gaming was not a source of interest in computing , or a way of recruiting people to the field : it was something we could do with the machine that was comprehensible to non-computer folks , who were often baffled about what a computer was and what we did ” [ Van Vleck 2001 ] .
But at MIT , a group of hackers was sufficiently captivated by “ Adventure ” that they developed a similar game , “ Zork , ” along with a company , Infocom , to market it [ Anderson 1985 ] ; [ Briceno et al. 2000 ] .
While BBN was actively researching artificial intelligence at the time Crowther was building “ Adventure ” , the game “ was just some rather simplistic logic and a small table of known words — of course backed up by some very clever thinking , ” according to Kraley ( 2004 ) , whose office was across from Crowther's .
Kraley joined Crowther in a months - long Dungeons and Dragons campaign ( led by Eric Roberts and including future Infocom co-founder Dave Lebling among the core of about eight participants ) .
“ [ O ] ne day , a few of us wandered into [ Crowther 's ] office so he could show off his program .
It was very crude in many respects —
Will was always parsimonious of memory — but surprisingly sophisticated .
We all had a blast playing it , offering suggestions , finding bugs , and so forth . ”
Crowther 's original Adventure impressed his colleagues .
“ Will was very proud - or more accurately amused - of how well he could fool people into thinking that there was some very complex AI behind the game , ” according to Kraley .
Nevertheless , “ once it was working , Will was n't very interested in perfecting or expanding it . ”
Crowther 's prose was lean and condensed , as we see in item 3 .
The subject “ DWARF ” is followed by a tight array of six verbs , of which the first three ( “ WALKED , ” “ SAW ” and “ THREW ” ) pertain to the subject , the next ( “ MISSED ” ) pertains to the direct object ( “ AXE ” ) , and the final two ( “ CURSED ” and “ RAN ” ) pertain to the subject .
The compressed structure leads to an amusing ambiguity , suggesting that the axe not only missed , but also cursed and ran away .
This short table ( 24 items ) includes descriptions of game states that represent lasting changes to the environment .
For example , if the player drops the keys in a room , then every time the player returns to the room , a message will indicate the presence of the keys .
Some of these table entries describe obstacles , and others describe room features .
Exclamation points emphasize the importance of valuable items , threats , and unexpected consequences .
An examination of this table reveals several insights .
Crowther 's original version contains no vocabulary words to represent commands for saving a game , reporting the score , or taking inventory of possessions ; all these elements were added by Woods .
One of the most versatile objects in the Crowther / Woods collaboration , the bottle — which can be empty or full , and refilled with water or oil — exists in a greatly simplified form in the Crowther original .
The word “ BOTTL[E ] ” and the word “ WATER ” both have the number 1020 , indicating that the container and its contents were treated by Crowther as the same object .
There are table entries for “ POUR ” and “ DRINK , ” both of which will set a flag that indicates the bottle is empty ; yet there are no commands for refilling the bottle .
Since the last prop in this list is 1023 , the numbering suggests Crowther added the bottle at a late stage in the game 's development .
Item 1018 and item 1022 are both given as “ KNIFE ” , but only item 1018 is set up to accept the synonym “ KNIVE [ S ] ” .
Note that “ HEADL [ AMP ] ” is given as a synonym for “ LAMP , ” reflecting the caving practice of keeping the hands free by mounting the light source on one 's head .
( Don Woods added the synonym “ LANTE ” and referred to the light source as a “ LANTERN . ” )
A second group of 35 items , numbered from 1001 - 1023 with some omissions and duplication , represents objects , including props that can be picked up ( e.g. the keys and various treasures ) , scenery items that affect the player 's motion ( e.g. the rough stone steps and the fissure in the Hall of Mists ) , and adversaries ( the snake and the dwarves ) .
While navigation by compass directions is perhaps one of the most recognizable features of the text - adventure genre , the compass directions seem to have been added relatively late to the vocabulary data table .
Thus , dozens of names for locations from the initial above - ground sequence ( “ HOUSE ” , “ GATE ” , “ FORES [ T ] ” ) and words associated with a more linear navigation style ( “ FORWA [ RD ] ” , “ BACK ” , “ ENTER ” and “ EXIT ” ) are numbered 2 - 26 , with synonyms such as “ NULL ” and “ NOWHE [RE ] ” sharing numbers .
Terms for the concepts “ UP ” and “ DOWN ” and several synonyms appear at numbers 29 and 30 , respectively , while the four cardinal compass directions appear in numbers 43 - 46 , and the diagonals at 60 and 62 - 64 .
William F. Mann , a caver who “ helped a bit with the mapping of the Bedquilt area ” depicted in the game , recalls playing “ several versions of ADVENTURE as they were being developed ” [ Mann 2003 ] .
According to Mann , the game had always included compass directions ; he suggests that the late appearance of the compass directions in the vocabulary table indicates that Crowther moved that feature from the code file to the data file at that stage of development .
Further evidence that supports the assertion that compass directions were always an important way of navigating in the game is found in Table 6 , in which items 10 , 11 and 14 are displayed variously when the player is having trouble navigating .
Each of these first suggests navigation by compass points , then via place names ( e.g. item 10 : “ I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING .
USE COMPASS POINTS OR NEARBY OBJECTS . ” ) .
The numbering identifies the typed commands “ ENTER ” , “ DOOR ” and “ GATE ” with a value of 3 , marking them as synonyms .
The last item in this section , numbered 70 , is “ BEDQU [ ILT ] ” .
Most of these words are the names of specific locations , but words for general motion ( “ BACK ” , “ RETUR [ N ] ” and “ RETRE [ AT ] ” ) are also on the list . [ 17 ]
While Adventure lore commonly reports that Crowther created the game for his young daughters , the keyword table suggests Crowther also had adult players in mind .
The last keyword is an expletive .
This long table ( 193 items ) represents every word the game recognizes , though all input is truncated to the first 5 characters .
The first group of 93 lines stores strings that the game recognizes as attempts to move .
These are numbered from 2 -70 with some omissions and many duplicates .
The line “ 3 11 48 ” will move the player from inside the building ( 3 ) to “ YOU'RE IN DEBRIS ROOM ” when the player types the keyword 48 — the famous magic word “ XYZZY ” .
Likewise , “ 3 33 65 ” describes how the player moves from inside the building to “ YOU'RE AT Y2 ” ( room 33 ) after invoking the magic word “ PLUGH ” ( 65 ) .
The table handles some special events very efficiently .
For instance , the Table 3 [ Map Data ] line “ 3 79 5 14 ” defines what happens when the player is in room 3 ( “ YOU'RE INSIDE BUILDING ” ) and types “ DOWNS ” or “ STREAM ” — a reasonable request , but one that the game does not permit .
The game prints out the strings from Table 1 marked with value 79 , or “ THE STREAM FLOWS OUT THROUGH A PAIR OF 1 FOOT DIAMETER SEWER / PIPES .
IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO USE THE DOOR . ”
Since the game has refused the requested action , the player should not end this turn in room number 79 ( which does not exist ) , but rather should stay in room 3 .
The Table 3 [ Map Data ] entry for value 79 is “ 79 3 1 ” , which we may translate as “ When temporarily in fake room 79 , move the player to room 3 if the player has entered vocabulary keyword group 1 . ” But there is no vocabulary keyword group 1 ; the vocabulary word groups start with a value of 2 .
Just as room 79 is a room the player cannot visit , vocabulary group 1 represents a keyword that the player can never type .
The code is set up to respond to these values by delivering a customized rejection message and returning the player to the room where the turn started .
The line “ 3 1 3 11 32 44 ” represents several ways to get from room 3 ( “ YOU'RE INSIDE BUILDING ” ) to room 1 ( “ YOU'RE AT END OF ROAD AGAIN ” ) .
These include several words ( “ ENTER ” , “ DOOR ” and “ GATE ” ) that Table 4 lists with a value of 3 ; another set ( “ OUT ” , “ OUTSI ” , “ EXIT ” , and “ LEAVE ” ) with a value of 11 ; the word “ OUTDO [ ORS ] ” ( which has a value of 32 ) and “ WEST ” and “ W ” ( which we have already seen carry the value of 44 ) .
Table 3 links map locations with vocabulary word groups .
Experienced coders are invited to spelunk the FORTRAN source directly [ Crowther 1976 ] ; those who are unfamiliar with the language may appreciate a brief guided tour on how this table handles player navigation .
The line “ 1 2 2 44 ” , when interpreted by the code , means “ When in room 1 ( ‘ YOU'RE AT END OF ROAD AGAIN ’ ) , print out the strings in Table 1 marked with value 2 ( ' YOU HAVE WALKED UP A HILL , STILL IN THE FOREST / THE ROAD NOW SLOPES BACK DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL .
/ THERE IS A BUILDING IN THE DISTANCE .') in response to the player typing keyword 2 ( ‘ ROAD ’ ) or a keyword from group 44 ( ‘ WEST ’ or ‘ W ’ ) .
Then , move the player to room 2 , ‘ HILL IN ROAD ’. ”
Table 2 holds 27 one - line items , numbered from 1 - 68 , with many gaps .
The entries in Table 1 that report failed attempts to move to the requested location , such as items 20 - 23 above , have no corresponding labels in Table 2 .
Rooms with short descriptions , such as # 29 ( “ YOU ARE IN THE SOUTH SIDE CHAMBER . ” ) and most maze locations , also have no corresponding Table 2 entry .
The first line in the data file is not the first text displayed when the game starts , or the first instruction executed by the computer ; rather , it is simply the first row in a table that stores long descriptions of game locations .
Its 149 lines present 78 separate items numbered from 1 - 79 ( omitting number 26 ) .
Items 42 - 58 include ten locations with the identical description “ YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES , ALL ALIKE , ” representing locations in a challenging three - dimensional maze .
( Woods added a separate maze , with rooms that are “ ALL DIFFERENT . ” )
Typically , the items in this table are displayed when the player has changed location , but some describe an unexpected game state .
The earliest source code for Crowther 's PDP - 10 “ Adventure ” game [ Crowther 1976 ] , exists in two FORTRAN files — one for data , and one for code , dated 11 Mar 1977 .
According to Woods ( 2007 ) , these files show the program as Crowther left it , before Woods began debugging and expanding the code .
The data file comprises six separate tables that contain most of the game 's text : 1 ) long descriptions , 2 ) short room labels , 3 ) map data , 4 ) grouped vocabulary keywords , 5 ) static game states , and 6 ) hints and events .
Embedded in the code file are the static components of variable strings , such as “ I SEE NO ‘, A5 , ’ HERE . ” ( where “ A5 ” represents the name of an object ) .
All text was written in all - caps due to the limitations of the PDP - 10 .
Notes on the Woods Expansion
Mann 's assessment of the Crowther / Woods collaboration offers an apt summary : “ Crowther was interested in using the cave as a setting for a game , with magic , puzzles , conflict , and humor .
Woods carried that forward , but without the feel for being in an actual cave , and with a need to limit the use of the machine to off hours .
He added mostly policy , puzzles and humor ” [ Mann 2004 ] .
Crowther supplied the original text - parser and established the basic principles of gameplay , leaving Woods free to concentrate on expansion , creative variation , and real - world resource management ( such as a system for resuming a suspended game and a password - protected method of restricting access to the game during working hours ) .
Woods retained the general structure of the code when he expanded the game , typically adding on to the end of the existing tables , and squeezing creative variations out of his own imagination and out of possibilities he found in Crowther 's original material .
For example , Crowther 's original responds to the command “ BLAST ” with the message “ BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE , ” but none exists in his game .
Woods , however , incorporates “ BLAST ” into the finale .
Woods added several rooms to Crowther 's existing “ ALL ALIKE ” maze ( making the maze more challenging to navigate ) , and created his own maze , where the passages were “ ALL DIFFERENT . ”
He also created a randomly - moving pirate who steals the player 's treasures .
Crowther supplied the humorous solution to the snake obstacle , but when the player tries to unleash the same feathered fury on Woods ’s dragon , the results are comically disastrous .
While Crowther 's bottle of water can only be emptied , Woods adds complexity by making it refillable and capable of carrying water or oil .
Woods also supplied puzzles for Crowther 's consumable items ( the food and the water ) .
In a variation on the crystal bridge that can appear , Woods adds a bridge that can collapse .
Where Crowther was an efficient minimalist , Woods was comparatively lavish with scenery .
Crowther did not create corpse objects for vanquished opponents ; once defeated , the snake and the dwarves simply vanish .
Woods , on the other hand , implements separate functional and destroyed objects for the dragon , the bear , and the troll bridge .
He also created a plant that exists in three states – thirsty and small , thirsty and large , and sated and climbable .
Because Woods added objects with complex behavior , his code had to deal with an even greater number of potential events .
( For example , what happens when a wandering dwarf encounters the bear or the dragon ? )
Woods edited for standard usage , and occasionally for clarity .
Upon starting “ Adventure ” , the player 's first choice is whether to ask for instructions ( see Example 1 , below ) .

1 CONTACT DON IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS , COMMENTS , ETC .
Woods retained the purely aesthetic portion of Crowther 's instructions ( offering a motivation for the player 's actions and introducing the fantasy element ) , but added details pertaining to the text parser , session mechanics , and authorship .
While Crowther ended his instructions with a no- nonsense , “ IF STUCK TYPE HELP FOR HINTS , ” Woods expanded , qualified , and punctuated the statement thus : “ SHOULD YOU GET STUCK , TYPE ‘ HELP ’ FOR SOME GENERAL HINTS ” .
Woods also added a note about the parser 's inability to tell the difference between “ NORTH ” and “ NORTHEAST , ” illustrating the attention he paid to improving the playing experience .
Both versions offer hints accessible by typing “ HELP ” ( see Example 2 , below ) .
To Crowther 's original “ HELP ” text , Woods added a reference to the new verb “ INVENTORY , ” and clarified a passage referring to manipulating objects .

Crowther had written “ USUALLY PEOPLE TRYING TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR ( OR MY ! ) CAPABILITIES … ” Because players see this passage only after typing “ HELP , ” the context suggests that this passage refers to a player having difficulty manipulating an object ; yet a novice player who encounters that passage very early in the game might conclude that the game does not permit any manipulation at all .
Woods 's revision refers more precisely to “ TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ” ( emphasis added ) .
Likewise , where Crowther referred to manipulating objects using “ ONE OF THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW ” , Woods avoided giving the impression that an object can be manipulated with only one action word , so that his passage refers instead to “ SOME OF THE ACTION WORDS ” ( emphasis added ) .
While the player is informed that the chamber is “ splendid , ” the text does not explicitly state what emotional effect the height of the chamber or the proximity of the “ frozen rivers of orange stone ” is supposed to have .
Rather , we see this location through seasoned , critical eyes , duly noting the presence of geological wonders , but then immediately evaluating the next possible move , as one must do when exploring in a real cave .
As it happens , the “ awkward ” exit from the Orange River Room is the way back to the surface , and the “ good passage ” leads deeper into the cave .
Without clumsily announcing something like , “ The west exit looks so intriguing that you can hardly wait to explore it , ” the text subtly discourages the player 's premature exit , and reinforces the exploratory premise of classic text adventures .
[ Jerz and Thomas 2005 ]
Crowther 's potent writing features in Room 13 , “ …A SPLENDID CHAMBER THIRTY FEET HIGH .
THE WALLS ARE FROZEN RIVERS OF ORANGE STONE .
AN AWKWARD CANYON AND A GOOD PASSAGE EXIT FROM EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE CHAMBER . ”
A forthcoming study of caves as computer game environments assesses this passage as follows :
“ Adventure ” succeeds in large part due to the depth and realism of the scenery , which is rendered in concise prose that calls interesting details to the reader 's attention , yet leaves much to the imagination .
The “ Breath - Taking View ” ( Crowther and Woods , Room 126 ) is an exception ; co-authored by Gilbert , the graduate student who played Crowther 's version of “ Adventure ” with Woods late into the night , its effusive language not only tells what the room looks like , but also informs the reader what emotions the scene is supposed to invoke ( cf. the gorge “ FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF ” ) .
When Nelson analyzes the tension between Crowther 's austere fantasy vision and the often comical set pieces supplied by Woods , he finds the stylistic conflict an agreeable part of the game 's charm .
“ Stretching a point , you could say that there is a Crowther and a Woods in every designer , the one intent on recreating an experienced world , the other with a really neat puzzle which ought to fit somewhere ” [ Nelson 2001 , 345 ] .
Notable tension is evident in changes to the cave environment that occur in the Woods expansion , such as 1 ) the underground volcano , 2 ) the battery - dispensing vending machine , and 3 ) announcements from a public address system warning that the cave is closing .
Lacking firsthand experience of caves , Woods had to rely upon his own imagination .
Yet even these details logically extend , respectively , Crowther 's use of 1 ) intriguing geography , 2 ) treasure items , and 3 ) magic words .
Some of Woods 's additions , such as the Soft Room and the Oriental Room , seem completely out of place when considered separately ; but once it becomes clear that objects found in these two locations work together to solve an inventory puzzle , these two incongruities make perfect sense as gaming elements .
In 1994 , Crowther reflected on the success of the game : “ And why did people enjoy it ?
Because it 's exactly the kind of thing that computer programmers do .
They 're struggling with an obstinate system that can do what you want but only if you can figure out the right thing to say to it ” [ Hafner 1994 , 2 – 3 ] .
Crowther 's children both recall instances in which their father deflected their frustration with “ Adventure ” by noting that they were stuck on one of Woods ’s details ( see Section 4 ) .
According to Crowther ( 2001 ) , “ My intent was that the deeper you went into the cave , the more fantasy appeared .
Don made it appear faster than ever I would have , which in retrospect was good ” .
Woods 's most striking diversions from Crowther 's initial realism occur on the far side of the troll bridge , yet this region is only accessible after the player has encountered Crowther 's earlier scenery , which involves capturing a strangely passive little bird , watching the improbable defeat of a fierce snake , conjuring up a magical crystal bridge , teleporting via magic words , and fighting with dwarves whose corpses vanish .
Given this context , the fairy - tale elements that Woods supplied ( including a dragon , a troll , a beanstalk , more magic words , and a friendly bear ) seem perfectly in keeping with Crowther 's fantasy premise .
This is a guest blog from Munir Chalabi , an Iraqi political analyst living in the U.K .
As deadline after deadline and benchmark after benchmark passes and with all the pressure imposed by the IMF , the US Administration , the US oil lobby and International Oil Companies ( IOCs ) on the Iraqi government , the oil law , against all the odds , refuses to be born .
Despite all the attempts by the Occupation ’s Governing Council ( GC ) and its appointed puppet , Allawi ’s Government , as well as the efforts by both of the elected governments , several US / IMF deadlines have passed including one in December 2006 , then in March , May and the latest one in July 2007 , but the draft of the law has not even been presented officially to the Federal Parliament in Baghdad .
In parallel with all these deadlines and benchmarks , we have seen several versions of the drafts for the new Iraqi oil law leaked one way or another to the international press .
This includes one in June 2006 , another on January 15 , then February 15 , June 25 , and finally July 3 , 2007 .
Many international political analysts and oil experts cannot comprehend how such unprecedented pressure can fail to produce results .
The answer to this is to be found within the methodology used in investigating the reasons behind the failure of the US Administration in achieving their objectives .
Analysts must not only look for external influences on any US plan in Iraq but they should also study and analyze the internal Iraqi causes affecting the success or the failure of the plan .
A. External factors and influences :
1. External influences were for the most part , behind the approval of a draft of the oil law , which will be the first and major step in the privatization of Iraqi oil wealth and will ensure that the oil will be produced and marketed by the IOCs with enormous profit to them .
2. Neither the US Republican administration nor the Democrats had any disagreement with this policy and made the approval of the oil law a benchmark for future US strategy in Iraq within the Iraqi Study Group report . [ 1 ]
3 . The IMF made the approval of the oil law one of the main conditions for reducing the Iraqi international debts , as declared in December 1 , 2005 in the Paris meetings between the IMF and representatives of the Iraqi Government .
4 . The IOCs were united in their approval of the oil law and there were no indications from any of them to the contrary .
5 . In addition , we have to remember that Iraq is still under US occupation .
Over 180,000 US / multinational troops and over 50,000 active mercenaries are putting all types of pressure on the Iraqi government and parliament to ensure the success of the US oil plans .
6. Several international organizations which oppose the oil Law , including a number of environmental groups , anti-occupational movements and several international trade unions [ 2 ] provide vital support to the Iraqi anti-oil law movements and had very positive media campaigns .
However , their effectiveness was understandably limited , as they could not influence the international decision - making powers .
B. Domestic influences and factors :
There are several Iraqi factors behind all the delays in the delivery of the oil law and these include :
1 . The Disagreement between the Central Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government on several issues of the law including who should control the strategic oil policies and which giant oil fields should be given to the IOCs .
The Kurdish Government insisted that several of the major oil fields which are allocated to the Iraqi National Oil Company under annex 2 of the draft , be moved to annex 3 in order to be given to the IOCs .
2. Increased Iraqi public awareness and pressure — the public awareness has increased noticeably in the past year against the oil law .
We have seen this public pressure mounting because of :
• An increased awareness by the public of the Iraqi civil society
organizations , trade unions , in particular the IFOU ( “ Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions ” [ 3 ] ) , oil experts [ 4 ] , economists and the Iraqi media concerning the threat of the oil law on the future of the sovereignty of the nation , which has consequently increased the opposition to the law .
• More and more MPs are calling for the law to be carefully studied before its approval .
The Iraqi parliament has gone into summer recess without discussing the oil law , but up until now the only members who are openly standing against the oil law are the MPs from Sadr ’s Movement and some individual members from the “ Iraqi Accord , ” the Dawa Party and some independent MPs .
• The “ State Shuraa Council , ” which is the highest legal office in the Iraqi Ministry of Justice , submitted on July 25 , 2007 , 13 legal comments on the “ Draft Oil & Gas Law ” to the Iraqi government .
The main points included the need to first re-establish the Iraqi National Oil Company which was dissolved by the Baath regime in 1987 ( in their first step to privatize the nation ’s oil wealth ) before the Oil & Gas Law is be put to parliament .
Also the Council emphasized the importance of the leading role of the central government in planning the strategic policies concerning the future of the nation ’s oil and gas wealth in accordance with the needs of article 111 of the Iraqi Constitution .
The third vital comment by the Council was their recommendation that all agreements with any international oil companies should be approved by the Iraqi Parliament .
The Council ’s comments made it more difficult for the Iraqi Government to push the Draft Oil Law through the Iraqi Parliament .
• The latest Oil poll , which was carried out in June and July 2007 by KA Research , has shown that the Iraqis oppose plans to open the country ’s oil fields to foreign investment by a factor of two to one ( 63 % oppose to 31 % for ) .
3 . The security crises : More and more Iraqis are questioning the wisdom of trying to rush the Oil & Gas law through parliament while the country is in such a devastating state .
• Thousands of innocent civilians are slaughtered every month due to suicide bombings by the Al - Qaeda / Baathist terrorists , the occupying forces ’ military attacks , the secret CIA controlled death squads and the sectarian clashes .
• Most Iraqi cities and towns have either no or severe shortages of electricity , clean water and other basic life necessities
• People are afraid to stay in their homeland and around four million are displaced , many driven from their homes by force .
Conclusions :
1- The legislation of the new Iraqi Oil & Gas Law by the Iraqi parliament has become the most important benchmark of the US Administration , its oil lobbies , the IOCs , the IMF , and the occupying forces .
The Bush administration wants this law to be passed as soon as possible , whatever the cost to the Iraqi people .
2- The failure of the US policies in the occupation of Iraq , the success of the Democratic Party in the 2006 elections in controlling both legislative houses in the US , and the presidential elections next year , have made the Bush Administration and its allies more desperate in their attempts to reach a successful conclusion on the oil law in order to prepare the ground for a partial US withdrawal from Iraq , within the lifetime of this administration .
3- This has led to enormous pressure being imposed by the US administration and its forces on the ground in Iraq on Al - Maliki ’s government in the past eight months .
They insisted that the government should go ahead and get this oil law approved by parliament , together with the re-Baathification law , and other privatization laws such as the privatization of the Iraqi oil processing industries which they succeeded in passing through parliament three days before the start of summer session .
4- The Bush Administration and their Ambassador in Baghdad had openly threatened to replace Al - Maliki ’s government with a new government , headed by their man in Iraq — the old Baathist , Iyad Allawi .
Al - Maliki has openly accused Allawi in several speeches of attempting to overthrow his government with the help of some units of the Iraqi army and security generals including the head of the Iraqi security forces , the old Baathist general Mohammed Al - Shahwani .
These generals were appointed to their positions during Allawi ’s appointed government by the last US official administrator Paul Bremer back in May 2004 , and are still taking their orders directly from the US embassy in Baghdad .
5- The US administration recognized that a US - led military coup d’etat would not result in any laws being recognized as legitimate by the international community if parliament were to be dissolved .
They therefore moved to a new policy , which involved direct interference with the political process in Iraq through their more reliable allies to reorganize the political alliance on which the government relied in order to achieve their goals .
They finally succeeded in achieving the establishment of such a front , which was called the “ The front of the moderates ” on August 15 , between the two main Kurdish parties ( KDP and PUK ) , two of the Shiite parties ( the SCIRI and Al - Dawa party — the Al - Maliki wing is called the “ External organization ” ) , with negotiations still ongoing to persuade the Islamic Party / Accord front — the main Sunni party — to join this new alliance .
The US administration made it clear that the new Iraqi government has important targets to accomplish , and they listed the oil law as the first priority and the re-Baathification law as a second main concern .
6- The claim of the US Administration that the oil and gas law will allow all Iraqis to share the oil revenue is no more than another peace of misinformation , as the “ Revenue Sharing Law ” is a separate federal revenue law which is still being negotiated between the different Iraqi parties representing all sectors of Iraqi society .
7- The US Administration is aware that time is not on their side , especially when it concerns the oil law .
They now recognize that as more people come to understand the law , this will increase the chance of its defeat .
This was the main reason behind all the attempted secrecy that surrounded any information about the oil law .
The latest oil poll which was carried out in June and July 2007 by KA Research has shown that the vast majority of Iraqis ( 91 % ) did not feel informed enough about the oil law .
This included the 33 % who said they knew a little information on the law , 30 % who said that they were not very informed and 28 % that stated that they knew nothing about it .
8- If the formation of the new political right wing alliance succeeds , then this will create for the first time , perilous circumstances which will allow the oil and gas law together with other US benchmarks to be passed through the Iraqi parliament within the next few months .
This danger is very real and should be seriously considered by all the parties who are opposing the law in their future planning .
9 - There have been several attempts by some Iraqi groups opposing the law to raise several important issues , in order to prevent the law being approved by parliament within the near future .
Issues such as this law should be treated as sovereignty issues due to their affect on the future of the nation and therefore should only be passed by a referendum .
10 - It is time for the US administration to recognize that their attempts to get the Iraqi parliament to approve this oil law by using all manner of pressure and threats , will not guarantee their chances of succeeding in implementing a law which does not reflect the interests of Iraqis in any shape or form , in the near and long term future , as was the case with many of their original plans .
11 - It is international law which states that the occupying forces have no right to impose laws which reflect their interests only , and do not reflect the interests of the occupied people and that such laws are null and void if any future elected Iraqi parliament declares them to be so .

Amnesty secretary - general Irene Khan said the fear generated by leaders such as Mr Howard " thrives on myopic and cowardly leadership " .
Ms Khan lumped Mr Howard in with Mr Mugabe , US President George W Bush and Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir in a paragraph about leaders who used fear to suit their political agenda .
In statement today , Mr Howard rejected the way Australia was characterised in the Amnesty report .
" The report 's entry on Australia contains a string of assertions , unsupported by evidence and devoid of context , " he said .
" The report 's treatment of Australia amounts to little more than a shoddy caricature .
" Nowhere is the report 's political agenda clearer than the paragraph in its foreword which seeks to bracket Australian and US policies with the horrendous human rights situation in Darfur and Robert Mugabe 's disastrous misrule in Zimbabwe . "
Ms Khan stood by her comments today , accusing the Howard government of having an " appalling " domestic human rights record regarding its treatment of asylum seekers and indigenous people .
These failures had undermined its good work overseas , she told ABC Radio .
Mr Howard said he respected Amnesty , but its current leadership had lost sight of the need for balance or rigour .
" I believe many Australians will be as offended by this report as I am , " he said .
" My government makes no apology for taking appropriate , balanced steps to protect the Australian public from the very real threat of terrorism and to protect our borders . "
Refugee exchange deal
Ms Khan also said Australia 's refugee exchange deal with the US is a panicked response to failed policies of offshore processing .
Canberra and Washington have agreed to a deal under which asylum seekers detained on Nauru can be sent to the US once their claims are approved , while US - bound Haitian refugees detained in Guantanamo Bay can be resettled in Australia .
Ms Khan said today the agreement was a bid to save face because both governments realised their hardline stance on refugees was a sham .
" This is a desperate measure by two governments to cover up the fact that their offshore processing policy on refugees has basically failed , '' she told ABC radio .
" So what they 're doing is sending people from Nauru to the US and people from Cuba - the Haitians from Cuba - to Australia so that they do not have to face the shame of having to release these people into their own countries .
" It 's a cover - up , it 's not a solution and it creates ... huge impact on the individuals themselves . ''
Hicks
The Howard government had an " appalling ' ' domestic human rights record over its treatment of asylum seekers and indigenous people which had undermined its good work overseas , she said .
Ms Khan said she was pleased confessed terrorism supporter David Hicks was back in Australia , but he never received a fair trial in Guantanamo Bay .
" The Military Commissions
Act does not provide for fair trial because it allows evidence obtained under torture , it does not provide for proper legal representation , there is no separation from the administration , '' she said .
" He had an unfair trial , in our view , and he had to wait five years for it . ''
Hicks was only returned because his case was becoming an embarrassment for the Australian government , she said .
Ms Khan also urged Australian voters to think about giving others a " fair go ' ' at this year 's election .

Amnesty says a white Antonov 26 was spotted at Nyala in March
A report by the rights group says the weapons end up in the hands of the government - backed Janjaweed militia .
It also includes apparent photographic evidence of Sudan using military aircraft camouflaged white in Darfur .
China said its exports to Sudan were legal , limited and on a small scale .
Russia also denied any embargo breach .
A Russian foreign ministry official said Moscow " unswervingly " observes the UN restrictions .
The use of all - white aircraft and helicopters ... in Darfur is in violation of applicable norms of international humanitarian law
Amnesty International
Quick guide : Darfur Pressure builds
Under the terms of a UN Security Council resolution passed in March 2005 , an embargo is in place on the supply of arms to all parties in the conflict in Darfur .
The Sudanese ambassador to the UN , Abdel Mahmood Abdel Haleem , said the Amnesty allegations were " baseless and unfounded " .
More than 200,000 people have died during a four - year conflict in Darfur , and the Janjaweed militia are accused of displacing and killing tens of thousands of people .
Photographs
In its report , Amnesty calls on the UN Security Council to strengthen the arms embargo on Darfur , which was extended in March 2005 to cover all parties .
Amnesty says it is " dismayed " that two permanent members of the UN Security Council are " allowing ongoing flows of arms to parties in Sudan " .
UN ARMS EMBARGO Imposed by Resolution 1591 , 29 March 2005
Cuts the supply of arms to all parties to the conflict in Darfur Some nations regard arms exports to Sudan 's government as allowed under the embargo Sudan is permitted to run humanitarian flights into Darfur , but only with UN permission - never requested Source : Amnesty
The report provides photographs of what it says were a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter at Nyala in Darfur and Chinese Fanfan fighters at Nyala earlier this year .
It also pictures an all - white , Russian - built Antonov 26 military plane , with the registration code ST - ZZZ .
It says it appears there are " three planes with this registration number " and said it was " highly likely " they were used in bombing raids .
The Amnesty report backs up a UN study , leaked to the New York Times last month , which said Sudan was painting aircraft white to make them look like UN planes - a practice banned by the Geneva Convention .
" The use of all - white aircraft and helicopters ... in Darfur is in violation of applicable norms of international humanitarian law , " the new report says .
Sudan denies using any white aircraft for military purposes , but says it has some white helicopters to transfer officials .
Amnesty says its report is based on eyewitness accounts from Darfur and " confidential sources " .
Trade
The Amnesty report backs the UN findings suggesting that Sudan is flying weapons into Darfur in breach of UN Security Council resolutions , a claim denied by Sudan .
Chinese - made Fantan fighters have been seen at Nyala , Darfur
The human rights group says Russia and China are aware of the eventual uses of arms exported to Sudan .
It cites 2005 trade figures as showing China sold $ 24 m and Russia $ 21 m of military material to Sudan .
Amnesty has also accused Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Belarus of supplying arms .
China has a close relationship with Sudan , increasing its military co-operation with Khartoum earlier this year .
The relationship is based around Khartoum 's plentiful supply of oil , which China needs to fuel its booming economy , says the BBC's Daniel Griffiths in Beijing .
We are not using these aircraft for any military function in Darfur
Abdel Mahmood Abdel Haleem
Sudanese UN ambassador
However , Amnesty now says it wants a list made of all items prohibited for transfer and for UN personnel to be stationed at all ports of entry in Sudan .
Amnesty also wants all UN states to suspend the transfer of any arms and ammunitions likely to be used by the parties in Darfur .
But Mr Haleem said military assets were simply being moved around the country .
Mr Haleem told the BBC : " We are moving these military assets to their respective places .
We are not using these aircraft for any military function in Darfur . "
In a gCaptain exclusive we were able to discuss the May 2007 abandonment of the s/v Sean Seamour II with her captain Jean Pierre de Lutz .
This story was first brought to us by Robin Storm , Marine Salvage Specialist and Maritime Severe Weather Spotter .
The Background Story
Here is a clip to bring you up to date on the Sean Seamour ’s voyage but for the full story visit Robin ’s coverage of the incident : LINK
On or around 7 May 2007 the s/v Sean Seamour II was struck by a what is believed to be a “ freak wave ” , during Subtropical Storm Andrea .
The sailboat was broadsided by a wave that did an great deal of damage to the boat and sent the crew flying about the cabin doing 360’s and causing its Master to break his ribs .
The wave caused the sailboat to immediately list starboard .
After a harrowing time riding the waves a EPIRB signal was received by the USCG and a C - 130 over fight located the wave riding crew .
A J - Hawk Helicopter was dispatched to the area and launched a rescue swimmer , who injured his back during the insertion into the water , when a wave dropped from beneath him and he dropped some 50 to 70 feet .
All of this done in 50 to 70 foot seas , with winds estimated at 80 knots .
To continue here are the captain ’s own words :
10 Lessons learned from the Incident
1 . No two passages are alike , do not consider that setting sail at what is deemed the most appropriate time is reason for less vigilance .
Weather routers are not only for racers , they add a level of security through objective analysis of far broader data than one can access on board within economically reasonable parameters .
2 . All security equipment should all be grouped together in the most central , least vulnerable and most accessible area inside the vessel .
Heavy weather requires as much crew as operationally possible to be secure inside the vessel where security equipment can be accessed in anticipation of catastrophic events .
The most vulnerable element of a sailboat is the rig .
Such was the case for Sean Seamour II with the exception of cold water protection suits that were in a rear port deck locker that ended up under the crushed rig .
Had these been kept with all other security equipment in a compartment at the base of the companionway the crew would have been able to don these after the first knockdown and avoid hypothermia .
3 . Pumps are never redundant : whale pumps are great , I had three installed on board , only the cockpit pump could have been used , the stern and bow units were not accessible due to debris or water levels .
Again these should be centrally installed on the highest floor level within the vessel .
2000 gph electric
Rule pumps should be permanently installed in tandem to avoid debris plugging the pump .
Ours had to be constantly monitored against floating paper and other debris .
4. Redundancy saved my crew but not my vessel .
The second EPIRB I always considered a luxury , eleven years later it still tested operational , which it ended up being .
Had I planned this redundancy with purpose it would also have been sent for recertification , would have been kept with the main unit inside for deployment , would have been initiated and efforts to save the vessel accomplished .
Redundancy is a must , but making sure you are not carrying duds as a feel good notion of redundancy is almost as important .
5. Reliability of equipment , considering the above , both ACR 406 EPIRB units tested operational yet both performed below specifications .
The ACR Globalifix died within thirty minutes after being sent for verification and recertification two weeks prior , the second old ACR self tested positive but battery life was only ten hours , had we been further out to sea its remaining ten hours of battery would have been insufficient to guide help our way .
6 . Lashing is too often considered and applied to on deck equipment , openings , doors , etc .
Within the vessel we generally secure for heavy weather thrashing forgetting what happens during knockdowns and 360’s .
Start with floorboards – these are the first to pop under such circumstances either through simple gravitational action , let alone kinetic energy that can be created during a knockdown .
Besides half of my floorboards that were not secured , the one most forgotten in my case was the salon table which detached and was probably the cause for half of my ten broken ribs .
Had it knocked me unconscious or worse my crew would have likely perished .
7. Gulf Stream , staying away from the core is not sufficient when confronting opposing direction weather systems .
I left the stream well before the storm but did not take into account the size of the eddies in that area .
I had used the stream carefully avoiding the eddies in my 1996 crossing , but over the past five years I had noticed the eddies diminishing in strength in the North Atlantic .
Had I tacked further east from the night of the 4th I would have probably been less punished by Andrea .
New data seems to correlate this .
8. Stowing and backup usage of vital electronic equipment must be designed into contingency plans .
Sean Seamour II had most everything but contingency plans did not take into account such catastrophic circumstances .
VHF , a backup antennae was pre-wired to enable the DSC VHF to function , but the stowed antennae was unfindable after the 360 which crushed the rig .
The SSB antennae used one of the backstays , gone with the rig , also the tuner was positioned too low and was shorted by water .
The Iridium satfone should have been kept in a waterproof skin , it was soaked in the 360 .
9 . Securing the vessel at least for the short term must remain a priority .
With the knowledge that the GPIRB had been initiated securing the vessel was to be my first objective by dumping the rig , 100 meters of chain and bow anchors and plugging the mast passage .
These actions would have secured the vessel for at least extra hour or two , taking other actions could have put us under way with engine propulsion .
Although for years I have prepared myself mentally for this type of situation , given the level of panic , physical trauma and the ensuing disorientation too much time was lost attempting to get electronic equipment to function — if it does n’t work it is not going to , redundancy yes dependence no .
10 .
Although substantial time had been dedicated to briefing the crew prior to departure on the security equipment inventory , whereabouts and deployment , showing them how collision mats , rule pumps and other equipment should be sued , as well as other procedures such as rerouting whale pumps , effective drills are far better .
Had I been incapacitated during these catastrophic events I am not sure the crew would have survived .

A scan across Saturn 's incredible halo of ice rings yields a study in precision and order .
This natural color mosaic was acquired by the Cassini spacecraft as it soared 39 degrees above the unilluminated side of the rings .
Major named gaps are labeled at the top .
The main rings themselves , along with the F ring , are labeled at the bottom , along with their inner and outer boundaries .
This mosaic was constructed from narrow - angle camera images taken immediately after the wide - angle camera mosaic PIA08388 .
Radial features can be seen in the rings that are about ten times smaller than in the wide - angle view .
This scan is rotated 180 degrees compared to PIA08388 in order to present the rings with distance from Saturn increasing left to right .
The view combines 45 images -- 15 separate sets of red , green and blue images -- taken over the course of about 2.5 hours , as Cassini scanned across the rings .
The images in this view were obtained on May 9 , 2007 , at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers ( 700,000 miles ) from Saturn .
Image scale in the radial ( horizontal ) direction is about 6 kilometers ( 4 miles ) per pixel .

この日記の検 索
2007 - 10 -07 ( Sun ) の日記はありません 。
数日前に 「
ニコ動のアカウント取ったら負けかな団」が結成されてたりして、完全ニコ中のおれとしては「意固地になってないで、とっとと取ればいいのに」と思ったり。この3連休、2日も出社する羽目になって、何が悲しかったってニコ動を思う存分見られなかったことだよ!
つーかですね、個人的には1993年あたり(?)からインターネットを使うようになって以来、ニコ動はかつてないほど最高に面白いサービスだと言い切ってもいい。これに触れずにいるなんて、なんてもったいない人生を送っておるんだ、キミたちは。
( beginエチケットペーパー ) おれはニコ動でもほとんどアイマスMAD しか見てないので、もしかするとアイマス特有の話になっているかも知れないけど気にしない方向で( エチケットペーパーend ) 。
まぁ、どうせ2ch発祥だし(違うけど)、素人お断りの殺伐とした雰囲気なんでしょ、と思い込んでる人が多いんじゃないかと思うんだけど、ニコ動のコミュニティはぜんぜん違う。2chだって殺伐としてるのは特定の板だけで、実際はそんなことないんだけど、ニコ動コミュニティの「温かさ」はそれともちょっと違う。
例えば、初めて自作の動画を公開した人がいるとする。まぁ、アイマスMADはスーパー職人が多数入り乱れるハイレベルな世界なので、初心者の作品ははっきりいってしょぼい。そんな動画につくコメントといえは、多くが「ここをこうしたらもっといい」とか「前半はイマイチだけど後半よくがんばってる!」とか、お前ら見ず知らずの人にどうしてそこまで親切になれるんだと呆れるくらいに前向きで、一所懸命いいところを探してあげているものばかり。そして最後には「GJ!」とか「次回作に期待」といった、ねぎらいの言葉できちんと締める。こんな風に言われたら、そりゃ次はもっとがんばろうって思うよな。
自分でもコメントをつけているとわかるけど、これは「自分もこのコンテンツを飾るメンバの一員なんだ」という当事者意識の発露なんだ。この、動画を生かすも殺すも自分次第という場の圧力が、下手なことを言わせない雰囲気を生んでいる。もちろん、たまには空気の読めない荒しも来るけど、大勢の良質な参加者の圧力がそれを無制限にのさばらせたりしない。
動画作者というのは、自分たちがコメントをつけて完成させる「作品」のベース提供者なのだから、大切にしなくてはいけない。だから、ニコ動の動画作者はとても優遇されるし、尊敬の対象だ。これはうまく運営されているOSSのコミュニティに近い。こういうコミュニティでは先駆者が後続を導くのも当然の流れになるから、ノウハウが公開・蓄積されるのはごく自然なことだ。ノウハウ共有のような「実」よりも先に、そういう風土を育てる温かいコミュニティがあったという点を指摘しておきたい。自分のノウハウを公開するモチベーションとして、よいコミュニティの存在は欠かせない。
システム的な面からすると、コメント表示のチューニングがこの風土の成立をうまく助けている。手前味噌になるが、tDiaryという「コメント(ツッコミ)機能」をビルトインした最初期の日記システムを開発するにあたって、おれはユーザに対して「ツッコミは短く鋭く愛を込めて」というスローガンを掲げてきた。コメント機能を搭載したシステムやサービスには、この観点は不可欠だと今も考えている。実はニコ動は、このスローガンにすごくマッチしている。
まず、コメントは長くなるほど画面を早く横切ってしまうので、ちゃんと読んでもらおうと思ったら短く簡潔にしなくてはいけない。かといってぶっきらぼうな書き方に対しては、先に書いたように場を荒れさせたくないという圧力がかかるので、おのずと優しさに溢れたコメントをすることになるのだ。開発陣がここまで狙って作っているとは思えないけれど、結果的にコンテンツをいい雰囲気に保っている。「GJ!」というより他はない。
そんなわけで、痛くないから入っておいで、と言いたいのでした。そりゃまぁ、ユーザの増加にシステム増強が追いついていない昨今、なかなか快適に使うわけにはいかないだろう。でも良質のユーザが増え続けて、良い雰囲気を保ったままで価値が高まれば、社会的にも認められて、投資が増えるかも知れない。YouTubeみたいに誰でもログインなしで見られるようになるには、やっぱりユーザがこの調子で増え続けるしかないんじゃないの。
なんにせよ、遠くからDISってないで、中に入って盛り上げたほうがよっぽど楽しいよ。
America is now seen as a threat to world peace by its closest neighbours and allies , according to an international survey of public opinion published today that reveals just how far the country 's reputation has fallen among former supporters since the invasion of Iraq .
Carried out as US voters prepare to go to the polls next week in an election dominated by the war , the research also shows that British voters see George Bush as a greater danger to world peace than either the North Korean leader , Kim Jong - il , or the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Both countries were once cited by the US president as part of an " axis of evil " , but it is Mr Bush who now alarms voters in countries with traditionally strong links to the US .
The survey has been carried out by the Guardian in Britain and leading newspapers in Israel ( Haaretz ) , Canada ( La Presse and Toronto Star ) and Mexico ( Reforma ) , using professional local opinion polling in each country .
It exposes high levels of distrust .
In Britain , 69 % of those questioned say they believe US policy has made the world less safe since 2001 , with only 7 % thinking action in Iraq and Afghanistan has increased global security .
The finding is mirrored in America 's immediate northern and southern neighbours , Canada and Mexico , with 62 % of Canadians and 57 % of Mexicans saying the world has become more dangerous because of US policy .
Even in Israel , which has long looked to America to guarantee national security , support for the US has slipped .
Only one in four Israeli voters say that Mr Bush has made the world safer , outweighed by the number who think he has added to the risk of international conflict , 36 % to 25 % .
A further 30 % say that at best he has made no difference .
Voters in three of the four countries surveyed also overwhelmingly reject the decision to invade Iraq , with only Israeli voters in favour , 59 % to 34 % against .
Opinion against the war has hardened strongly since a similar survey before the US presidential election in 2004 .
In Britain 71 % of voters now say the invasion was unjustified , a view shared by 89 % of Mexicans and 73 % of Canadians .
Canada is a Nato member whose troops are in action in Afghanistan .
Neither do voters think America has helped advance democracy in developing countries , one of the justifications for deposing Saddam Hussein .
Only 11 % of Britons and 28 % of Israelis think that has happened .
As a result , Mr Bush is ranked with some of his bitterest enemies as a cause of global anxiety .
He is outranked by Osama bin Laden in all four countries , but runs the al - Qaida leader close in the eyes of UK voters : 87 % think the al - Qaida leader is a great or moderate danger to peace , compared with 75 % who think this of Mr Bush .
The US leader and close ally of Tony Blair is seen in Britain as a more dangerous man than the president of Iran ( 62 % think he is a danger ) , the North Korean leader ( 69 % ) and the leader of Hizbullah , Hassan Nasrallah ( 65 % ) .
Only 10 % of British voters think that Mr Bush poses no danger at all .
Israeli voters remain much more trusting of him , with 23 % thinking he represents a serious danger and 61 % thinking he does not .
Contrary to the usual expectation , older voters in Britain are slightly more hostile to the Iraq war than younger ones .
Voters under 35 are also more trusting of Mr Bush , with hostility strongest among people aged 35 - 65 .
· ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,010 adults by telephone from October 27 - 30 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
Polling was by phone in Canada ( sample 1,007 ) , Israel ( 1,078 ) and Mexico ( 1,010 )
A CBS News poll released today has devastating news for the Bush " administration " anyone who still cares :
Just 21 percent approve of President Bush 's handling of the war , the lowest number he 's ever received , and an 8 - point drop from just a month ago .
Most of that drop has been among Republicans and conservatives .
An eight point drop since the elections .
Full details available here ( PDF ) .
The highlights :
The bulk of the losses are from among Republicans and conservatives .
( And how could they not be ?
You can't get less than zero from Democrats . )
62 % now say it was " a mistake " to send troops to Iraq .
53 % now say it 's not very or not likely at all that we 'll succeed in Iraq .
85 % of Americans now consider Iraq to be in civil war .
Sen . Gordon Smith may be the first to jump ship post - election , but he wo n't be the last .
And with Bush now insisting that the ISG report supports his policies , but majorities calling for troop withdrawals , hard timetables , engagement with Iran and Syria , etc. , Bush 's last best hope is that the Republicans on the ISG blow up the bipartisan facade and allow him to pretend their report does n't really require anything of him .
Will they permit it ?
Will Republicans , as a party , continue to allow Bush to abuse them this way ?
UPDATE : Another key nut from the full report :
Approve of Bush 's job handling Iraq
Now 11/14
GOP 47 % 70 %
Dem 5 % 3 %
Ind 17 % 23 %
Cons. 34 % 60 %
Look at that drop .
Look at that !
UPDATE II :
More delicious morsels :
Overall job approve / disapprove : 31/63
Will make right decisions on war : Dems in Congress , 53 % ; Bush , 27 %
62 % say Iraq a mistake ; in 1971 , 61 % said the same of Vietnam
This is about as vicious an ass - kicking as I 've seen in a poll on an issue like this .
Which , by the way , 35 % of respondents now identify as the country 's most important problem .
Next leading contender : economy and jobs at just 9 % .
The ISG is looking less like political cover and more like a courtesy flush with every passing minute .
Tony Snow : Call in sick tomorrow .
A while ago I wrote about the futility of voting for third party candidates , and I ’d like to clarify / modify what I said now that the primaries are starting to come in .
When the primaries come around , if you do n’t vote for your conscience then you ’re not only hurting the candidate you ’d like to see win , you ’re also hurting the direction the race may go in .
Let me explain .
One of the biggest points I had brought up then was that if you vote based purely on who lines up with your positions and ignore chance of victory , then it ’s entirely possible that someone who is far removed from your interests will win while the person who may have been closer to you will lose .
What I had neglected to consider was what happens even when your “ lesser of two evils ” candidate wins .
Let ’s take a look at two graphs , each showing hypothetical primary turnouts for the Democratic candidates .
Now , both of these end up with the “ main frontrunners ” winning in the end and both end up with Clinton taking it .
That the end results are no different in either case is exactly what I wanted for my purposes .
Primaries are more than just a selection of the candidate for the national race , they ’re also a gauge of national opinion within the party .
Take a look at hypothetical situation A , where Clinton squeaked out a victory with a scant 17 % of the vote .
Yes , when November comes around she ’ll be on the ticket and there ’s a good chance that Edwards or Obama will take Veep position , but the undeniable message is that Clinton ’s platforms were the most popular , but not by much .
By having nearly a quarter of the vote go for Gravel / Kucinich and another 29 % for the other “ unwinnables ” , the candidate will have to realize that half of the Democratic electorate supports those positions , and a significant chunk is simply not going to stand for more “ yes we should get out of Iraq , but not that soon … ” rhetoric that amounts to zero change .
Now on to Hypothetical Primary B. Clinton wins again , but this time with more than a third of the votes , and nearly all of the votes went for the “ big 3 ” .
Gravel and the rest got almost nothing at all because their supporters shifted up into the “ guaranteed winners ” in order to avoid throwing their vote away on a “ loser ” .
What ’s the message this time around ?
That people simply do n’t support the “ radical agendas ” of Kucinich et al .
When it comes time to set an agenda down , Clinton will have no reason to think that anyone cares about universal health care or other radical reforms along the lines of what the further left candidates espouse .
Why ?
Because no one voted for them .
In the end , by not supporting any smaller candidates we are implicitly showing no support for their positions .
The mainstream candidates will then feel no compunction for continuing along the same way we ’ve been going .
In 2006 the Democrats took over Congress .
Over the past year , none of the things we wanted to see happen came to pass .
We ’re still in Iraq , the deficit ’s out of control , and we ’re still being spied upon .
Unless there is an outpouring of support for the only candidates who have voted contrary to the GOP ’s failed agenda , why in the world can we expect anything different to happen in 2009 ?
This goes for Ron Paul folk who I was previously criticizing .
If that ’s what you truly support , then by all means vote for him even if you do n’t think he can win .
You ’ll be showing the Republican candidates that you do n’t support their imperialist agenda while still pumping for the more “ free market ” ideas and whatnot .
The primaries are going to be an important chance to make a stand , and if views are compromised in order to avoid a “ wasted ” vote , you ’ll be spitting in the face of democracy and doing yourself a disservice .
Now , the elections themselves are another matter , but I ’ll tackle that in another article …

URGENT : Planned Parenthood under attack http://ga3.org/ct/V1AZBO61YXC2/
**********************
Dear Friend ,
Planned Parenthood is under attack .
Ground zero in the fight for women ’s access to reproductive health care has landed in a town in the middle of America .
Aurora , Illinois .
Aurora ’s not really a town .
It ’s a fast growing city outside
Chicago where Planned Parenthood just built a large clinic .
Just a few weeks ago , the usual suspects in the anti-choice fringe showed up in droves – and by droves , I mean more people are protesting this clinic than we ’ve seen in decades .
What ’s worse ?
They ’ve managed to keep our clinic doors closed .
Last week , a U.S. district court judge denied our request to open the clinic .
We need your help .
Today .
Right now .
We must demonstrate that Planned Parenthood and the women we serve have enormous support not only in Illinois , but everywhere .
From wherever you live , and with whatever time you have – you can help .

You see , what ’s happening in Aurora is n’t an isolated incident .
What ’s happening in Aurora today is what ’s happening in America .
It ’s not a war on a clinic .
It ’s a war on women ’s access to reproductive health care – in
Aurora , and across our country .
Every day that our clinic remains closed further encourages the anti-choice extremists ’ harassment and intimidation of patients and staff here in Aurora and at clinics across the country .
And every day our health center is not open , more women go without pap tests , birth control supplies and breast exams .
That is a real shame for a region , and a country , in the middle of a catastrophic health care crisis .
The situation in Aurora is the most challenging we ’ve faced in a long time , to be sure .
But Planned Parenthood has been fighting this battle for 90 years , and we ’re not going to stop now .
We ’ll be back in court as soon as possible to present additional facts , and we WILL open this clinic .
Here ’s how you can help :
:: Please take action .
Planned Parenthood , our clinic staff , and the women of Aurora need all the visible support we can get .
Your action today will add a ribbon of support at the clinic – we ’re at over 30,000 ribbons and counting !
Send your ribbon signifying your support of the Aurora clinic .

Planned Parenthood is showing up for this fight .
I hope you will , too .
Thank you .

Statement before the Financial Services Committee , September 20 , 2007
Mr. Chairman , the situation facing us now in the mortgage industry has its roots in the Federal Reserve ’s inflationary monetary policy .
Without addressing the roots of the current crisis , any measures undertaken to improve the situation will be doomed to fail .
As with asset bubbles and investment manias in past history , the fuel for the current housing bubble had its origins in monetary manipulation .
The housing boom was caused by the Federal Reserve ’s policy resulting in artificially low interest rates .
Consumers , misled by low interest rates , were looking to consume , while homebuilders saw the low interest rates as a signal to build , and build they did .
One of the primary means the Federal Reserve uses to stimulate the economy is manipulation of the federal funds rate and the discount rates , which are used as benchmark rates throughout the economy .
The interest rate is the price of time , as the value of a dollar today and the value of a dollar one year from now are not the same .
Just like any price in the market , interest rates have an important informational signaling purpose .
Government price fixing of the interest rate has the same deleterious effects as price controls in other areas .
Reduction in the interest rate has two major effects : it encourages consumption over saving ; and it makes long - term , capital - intensive projects cheaper to undertake .
Under Chairman Greenspan ’s tenure , the federal funds rate was so low that the real interest rate ( that is the nominal interest rate minus inflation ) was negative .
With a negative real interest rate , someone who saves money will literally lose the value of that money .
The Federal Reserve continued and still continues to increase the money supply .
After ceasing the publication of M3 last February , private economists have calculated that M3 has risen at an annual rate of almost 12 % , which is faster than we have seen since the 1970’s .
Millions of Americans now find themselves stuck in a financial quandary that is not their fault .
The result of manipulation of the interest rate , money supply , and mortgage markets are the recently popped housing bubble .
Further regulation of the banking sector , of mortgage brokers , mortgage lenders , or credit - rating agencies will fail to improve the current situation , and will do nothing to prevent future real estate bubbles .
Any proposed solutions which fail to take into account the economic intervention that laid the ground for the bubble are merely window dressing , and will not ease the suffering of millions of American homeowners .
I urge my colleagues to strike at the root of the problem and address the Federal Reserve ’s inflationary monetary policy .

What 's wrong with America 's high schools ?
As number of dropouts climbs , schools struggle to reverse tide Editor 's note :
The following is a summary of this week 's Time magazine cover story .
Researchers are saying that nearly one out of three public high school students wo n't graduate .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Indiana George W. Bush or or Create Your Own ( Time.com ) --
It 's lunchtime at Shelbyville High School , 30 miles southeast of Indianapolis , Indiana , and more than 100 teenagers are buzzing over trays in the cafeteria .
Like high schoolers everywhere , they have arranged themselves by type : jocks , preps , cheerleaders , dorks , punks and gamers , all with tables of their own .
Shawn Sturgill , 18 , had a clique of his own at Shelbyville High , a dozen or so friends who sat at the same long bench in the hallway outside the cafeteria .
They were , Shawn says , an average crowd .
These days the bench is mostly empty .
Of his dozen friends , Shawn says just one or two are still at Shelbyville High .
If some cliques are defined by a common sport or a shared obsession with Yu - Gi - Oh !
cards ,
Shawn 's friends ended up being defined by their mutual destiny : nearly all of them became high school dropouts .
Shawn 's friends are not alone in their exodus .
Of the 315 Shelbyville students who showed up for the first day of high school four years ago , only 215 are expected to graduate .
In today 's data - happy era of accountability , testing and No Child Left Behind , here is the most astonishing statistic in the whole field of education : an increasing number of researchers are saying that nearly one out of three public high school students wo n't graduate , not just in Shelbyville but around the nation .
For Latinos and African - Americans , the rate approaches an alarming 50 percent .
Virtually no community , small or large , rural or urban , has escaped the problem .
There is a small but hardy band of researchers who insist the dropout rates do n't quite approach those levels .
They point to their pet surveys that suggest a rate of only 15 percent to 20 percent .
The dispute is difficult to referee , particularly in the wake of decades of lax accounting by states and schools .
But the majority of analysts and lawmakers have come to this consensus : the numbers have remained unchecked at approximately 30 percent through two decades of intense educational reform , and the magnitude of the problem has been consistently , and often willfully , ignored .
That 's starting to change .
During his most recent State of the Union address , President Bush promised more resources to help children stay in school , and Democrats promptly attacked him for lacking a specific plan .
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has trained its moneyed eye on the problem , funding " The Silent Epidemic , " a study issued in March that has gained widespread attention both in Washington and in statehouses around the country .
The attention comes against a backdrop of rising peril for dropouts .
If their grandparents ' generation could find a blue - collar niche and prosper , the latest group is immediately relegated to the most punishing sector of the economy , where whatever low - wage jobs have n't yet moved overseas are increasingly filled by even lower - wage immigrants .
Dropping out of high school today is to your societal health what smoking is to your physical health , an indicator of a host of poor outcomes to follow , from low lifetime earnings to high incarceration rates to a high likelihood that your children will drop out of high school and start the cycle anew .
Identifying the problem is just the first step .
The next moves are being made by towns like Shelbyville , where a loose coalition of community leaders and school administrators have , for the first time , placed dropout prevention at the top of the agenda .
Now they are gamely trying to identify why kids are leaving and looking for ways to reverse the tide .
" Ten years ago , " says Shelbyville principal Tom Zobel , " if we had a problem student , the plan was , ' OK , let 's figure out how to get rid of this kid . '
Now we have to get them help . "

No matter how much PC and mobile gaming has evolved , there are not gamers that do not enjoy the console experience when it comes to video games .
And as a consequence of that , the market is booming and new models are released every year .
For many years , Xbox and PlayStation have been competitors .
While it is true that Nintendo Switch managed to earn a reputation as well , many gamers are still trying to settle the PlayStation vs Xbox debate .
Right now , if you are looking for a console you can choose between PlayStation 4 Pro , PlayStation 4 Slim , Xbox One S and soon Xbox One X will become available as well .
Therefore , it can be a bit difficult to make a choice .
That is why we have decided to give you a hand and we compared the two brands so you can know which one is better for your needs .

That is why we have decided to give you a hand and we compared the two brands so you can know which one is better for your needs .
Exclusive games
Popular titles can be an important advantage for a console , and gamers will buy a console if their favorite game is only available for it .
Therefore it is important to know which games are available on these consoles .
For example , Sony ’s PlayStation 4 comes with Uncharted , No Man ’s Sky and Bloodborne , while Microsoft ’s Xbox One has Gears of War , Forza Motorsport and Halo .
Online gaming
Since video games are all about being part of a community , it is important to know which console comes with better online service offers .
Both Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus can offer you a 1 year membership that will cost £ 40 - 50 .
Xbox subscription used to offer you two free games a month with the Games with Gold package , while PlayStation fives you six games a month .

6500 pot plants : ' personal use '
Another example of how they do things differently in Canada : a 30 - year - old man was caught red - handed with a marijuana grow operation on his property .
Plants worth approximately $ 2.5 million were found .
The man claimed they were for " personal use " and the judge , believing this particular individual to have a high likelihood of rehabilitation , sentenced him to an 18 month probation , including 9 months of house arrest , and 100 hours of community service .
It 's not every day the cops find 6500 marijuana plants in your backyard and essentially let you off the hook for it ; even though he claimed personal use , he wound up pleading guilty to " possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and production of marijuana , " which in America would have had a much higher minimum sentence as well as offering the guy a great likelihood of getting shot when they busted down his door .
Way to go , Canada !
Keep blazing that trail for , uh , slightly less insane drug policies .

Version Control ( aka Revision Control aka Source Control ) lets you track your files over time .
Why do you care ?
So when you mess up you can easily get back to a previous working version .
You ’ve probably cooked up your own version control system without realizing it had such a geeky name .
Got any files like this ?
( Not these exact ones I hope ) .

It ’s why we use “ Save As ” .
You want the new file without obliterating the old one .
It ’s a common problem , and solutions are usually like this :
Make a single backup copy ( Document.old.txt ) .
( Document.old.txt ) .
If we ’re clever , we add a version number or date : Document_V1.txt , DocumentMarch2015.txt
: Document_V1.txt , DocumentMarch2015.txt
We may even use a shared folder so other people can see and edit files without sending them over email .
Hopefully they relabel the file after they save it .
So Why Do We Need A Version Control System ( VCS ) ?
Our shared folder / naming system is fine for class projects or one - time papers .
But software projects ?
Not a chance .
Do you think the Windows source code sits in a shared folder like “ Windows2007 - Latest - UPDATED !! ” , for anyone to edit ?
That every programmer just works in a different subfolder ?
No way .
Large , fast - changing projects with many authors need a Version Control System ( geekspeak for “ file database ” ) to track changes and avoid general chaos .
A good VCS does the following :
Backup and Restore .
Files are saved as they are edited , and you can jump to any moment in time .
Need that file as it was on Feb 23 , 2007 ?
No problem .

Synchronization .

Track Changes .
As files are updated , you can leave messages explaining why the change happened ( stored in the VCS , not the file ) .
This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time , and why .

Check out for edit : Checking out an “ editable ” version of a file .
Some VCSes have editable files by default , others require an explicit command .
And a typical scenario goes like this :
Alice adds a file ( list .
txt ) to the repository .
She checks it out , makes a change ( puts “ milk ” on the list ) , and checks it back in with a checkin message ( “ Added required item . ” ) .
The next morning , Bob updates his local working set and sees the latest revision of list .
txt , which contains “ milk ” .
He can browse the changelog or diff to see that Alice put “ milk ” the day before .
Visual Examples
This guide is purposefully high - level : most tutorials throw a bunch of text commands at you .
Let ’s cover the high - level concepts without getting stuck in the syntax ( the Subversion manual is always there , do n’t worry ) .
Sometimes it ’s nice to see what ’s possible .
Checkins
The simplest scenario is checking in a file ( list .
txt ) and modifying it over time .
Each time we check in a new version , we get a new revision ( r1 , r2 , r3 , etc . ) .
In Subversion you ’d do :
svn add list .
txt ( modify the file ) svn ci list .
txt -m " Changed the list "
The -m flag is the message to use for this checkin .
Checkouts and Editing
In reality , you might not keep checking in a file .
You may have to check out , edit and check in .
The cycle looks like this :
If you do n’t like your changes and want to start over , you can revert to the previous version and start again ( or stop ) .
When checking out , you get the latest revision by default .
If you want , you can specify a particular revision .
In Subversion , run :
svn co list .
txt ( get latest version ) … edit file … svn revert list .
txt ( throw away changes ) svn co - r2 list .
txt ( check out particular version )
Diffs
The trunk has a history of changes as a file evolves .
Diffs are the changes you made while editing : imagine you can “ peel ” them off and apply them to a file :
For example , to go from r1 to r2 , we add eggs ( + Eggs ) .
Imagine peeling off that red sticker and placing it on r1 , to get r2 .
And to get from r2 to r3 , we add Juice ( + Juice ) .
To get from r3 to r4 , we remove Juice and add Soup ( - Juice , + Soup ) .
Most version control systems store diffs rather than full copies of the file .
This saves disk space : 4 revisions of a file does n’t mean we have 4 copies ; we have 1 copy and 4 small diffs .
Pretty nifty , eh ?
In SVN , we diff two revisions of a file like this :
svn diff - r3:4 list.txt
Diffs help us notice changes ( “ How did you fix that bug again ? ” ) and even apply them from one branch to another .
Bonus question : what ’s the diff from r1 to r4 ?
+ Eggs + Soup
Notice how “ Juice ” was n’t even involved — the direct jump from r1 to r4 does n’t need that change , since Juice was overridden by Soup .
Branching
Branches let us copy code into a separate folder so we can monkey with it separately :
For example , we can create a branch for new , experimental ideas for our list : crazy things like Rice or Eggo waffles .
Depending on the version control system , creating a branch ( copy ) may change the revision number .
Now that we have a branch , we can change our code and work out the kinks .
( “ Hrm … waffles ?
I do n’t know what the boss will think .
Rice is a safe bet . ” ) .
Since we ’re in a separate branch , we can make changes and test in isolation , knowing our changes wo n’t hurt anyone .
And our branch history is under version control .
In Subversion , you create a branch simply by copying a directory to another .
svn copy http://path/to/trunk
http://path/to/branch
So branching is n’t too tough of a concept : Pretend you copied your code into a different directory .
You ’ve probably branched your code in school projects , making sure you have a “ fail safe ” version you can return to if things blow up .
Merging
Branching sounds simple , right ?
Well , it ’s not — figuring out how to merge changes from one branch to another can be tricky .
Let ’s say we want to get the “ Rice ” feature from our experimental branch into the mainline .
How would we do this ?
Diff r6 and r7 and apply that to the main line ?
Wrongo .
We only want to apply the changes that happened in the branch !.
That means we diff r5 and r6 , and apply that to the main trunk :
If we diffed r6 and r7 , we would lose the “ Bread ” feature that was in main .
This is a subtle point — imagine “ peeling off ” the changes from the experimental branch ( + Rice ) and adding that to main .
Main may have had other changes , which is ok — we just want to insert the Rice feature .
In Subversion , merging is very close to diffing .
Inside the main trunk , run the command :
svn merge - r5:6 http://path/to/branch
This command diffs r5 - r6 in the experimental branch and applies it to the current location .
Unfortunately , Subversion does n’t have an easy way to keep track of what merges have been applied , so if you ’re not careful you may apply the same changes twice .
It ’s a planned feature , but the current advice is to keep a changelog message reminding you that you ’ve already merged r5 - r6 into main .
Conflicts
Many times , the VCS can automatically merge changes to different parts of a file .
Conflicts can arise when changes appear that do n’t gel :
Joe wants to remove eggs and replace it with cheese ( - eggs , + cheese ) , and Sue wants to replace eggs with a hot dog ( - eggs , +hot dog ) .
At this point it ’s a race : if Joe checks in first , that ’s the change that goes through ( and Sue ca n’t make her change ) .
When changes overlap and contradict like this , the VCS may report a conflict and not let you check in — it ’s up to you to check in a newer version that resolves this dilemma .
A few approaches :
Re-apply your changes .
Sync to the the latest version ( r4 ) and re-apply your changes to this file :
Add hot dog to the list that already has cheese .
.
Sync to the the latest version ( r4 ) and re-apply your changes to this file :
Add hot dog to the list that already has cheese .
Override their changes with yours .
Check out the latest version ( r4 ) , copy over your version , and check your version in .
In effect , this removes cheese and replaces it with hot dog .
Conflicts are infrequent but can be a pain .
Usually I update to the latest and re-apply my changes .
Tagging
Who would have thought a version control system would be Web 2.0 compliant ?
Many systems let you tag ( label ) any revision for easy reference .
This way you can refer to “ Release 1.0 ” instead of a particular build number :
In Subversion , tags are just branches that you agree not to edit ; they are around for posterity , so you can see exactly what your version 1.0 release contained .
Hence they end in a stub — there ’s nowhere to go .
( in trunk ) svn copy http://path/to/revision
http://path/to/tag
Real - life example : Managing Windows Source Code
We guessed that Windows was managed out of a shared folder , but it ’s not the case .
So how ’s it done ?
There ’s a main line with stable builds of Windows .
with stable builds of Windows .
Each group ( Networking , User Interface , Media Player , etc. ) has its own branch to develop new features .
These are under development and less stable than main .
You develop new features in your branch and “ Reverse Integrate ( RI ) ” to get them into Main .
Later , you “ Forward Integrate ” to bring the latest changes from Main into your branch :
Let ’s say we ’re at Media Player 10 and IE 6 .
The Media Player team makes version 11 in their own branch .
When it ’s ready and tested , there ’s a patch from 10 – 11 which is applied to Main ( just like the “ Rice ” example , but a tad more complicated ) .
This is a reverse integration , from the branch to the trunk .
The IE team can do the same thing .
Later , the Media Player team can pick up the latest code from other teams , like IE .
In this case , Media Player forward integrates and gets the latest patches from main into their branch .
This is like pulling in the “ Bread ” feature into the experimental branch , but again , more complicated .
So it ’s RI and FI .
Aye aye .
This arrangement lets changes percolate throughout the branches , while keeping new code out of the main line .
Cool , eh ?
In reality , there ’s many layers of branches and sub - branches , along with quality metrics that determine when you get to RI .
But you get the idea : branches help manage complexity .
Now you know the basics of how one of the largest software projects is organized .
Key Takeaways
My goal was to share high - level thoughts about version control systems .
Here are the basics :
Use version control .
Seriously , it ’s a good thing , even if you ’re not writing an OS .
It ’s worth it for backups alone .

It ’s worth it for backups alone .
Take it slow .
I ’m only now looking into branching and merging for my projects .
Just get a handle on using version control and go from there .
If you ’re a small project , branching / merging may not be an issue .
Large projects often have experienced maintainers who keep track of the branches and patches .

Senator 's sexy bathroom stall ' flush ' with tourists
John Byrne
Published : Monday September 17 , 2007

A spokeswoman for the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport told the Associated Press in a little - noticed article Monday visitors are asking where Sen. Larry Craig ( R - ID ) was arrested for soliciting an undercover male police officer .
" It 's become a tourist attraction , " spokeswoman Karen Evans said in a brief that ran in the Chicago Sun - Times .
" People are taking pictures . "
The brief 's headline ?
" Site of sex sting flush with tourists . "
Craig , who was arrested June 11 for " lewd conduct " after soliciting an undercover police officer and ducked the media radar until a copy of the arrest document surfaced in Roll Call in August , said he would resign his seat , changed his mind , and then said he would likely resign his seat again .
Remarked AP , " When tourists ask for the bathroom in the Minneapolis airport lately , it 's usually not because they have to go . "
Craig has since said his guilty plea in the matter was a mistake and is fighting to have it reversed .
He disputes contention that he is gay .
" Let me be clear : I am not gay , " he told reporters in an Idaho press conference .
" I never have been gay . "
George W. ( " I demand an up - or - down - vote " ) Bush believes in the majority rule only when it favors his own beliefs .
When it does n't , he believes in something else .
Something else happened this week when hard - core Republican functionaries twice blocked the Senate from protecting constitutional rights and the welfare of American soldiers .
In the first action , the Senate voted 56 - 43 to end a Republican filibuster against a proposal to allow terrorism suspects to challenge in court their detention and treatment .
Sixty votes , however , are needed to end a filibuster .
The bipartisan bill was written by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , chair of the Judiciary Committee , and Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , the Committee 's senior Republican .
The filibuster was the only thing in the way of the Senate asserting that the Constitution matters .
The habeas corpus clause ( Article I , Section 9 , Clause 2 ) of the Constitution , guarantees the right of prisoners to challenge why they are incarcerated .
It has often been used to guarantee against arbitrary and capricious imprisonment .
The 14th amendment , which guarantees due process and equal protection rights , also guarantees rights to non-citizens who are in U.S. territory .
The Supreme Court had previously ruled that detainees at the Guantanamo Naval Base have those rights .
However , it gave a loophole to Congress to assert its own interpretation .
The Republican - dominated Congress prior to the November 2006 election significantly limited the rights of prisoners .
A new Congress , however , thought different .
Fifty Democrats and six Republicans voted to affirm the Constitution .
The Bush - Cheney Gang disagrees , and began a blab - fest that spilled from the White House onto talk radio and bloviators everywhere .
Critics huffed and puffed and blew hot wind , whining that giving constitutional rights to prisoners would somehow put the U.S. at even greater risk .
Sens .
Specter , Leahy , and a majority of senators shredded that argument .
Prior to the vote , Specter , a former Philadelphia district attorney , pointed out that the right of habeas corpus existed since the Magna Carta in 1215 , that it is a part of the U.S. Constitution , and that several Supreme Court decisions since 9/11 uphold that right .
" It is from the strength of our freedoms , our Constitution , and the rule of law that we shall prevail , " said Leahy after the vote .
Equating the fear - mongering after 9/11 and the enactment of the Military Commissions Act , Leahy noted , " Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II , the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear , and it was a stain on America 's reputation in the world . "
Ironically , the filibuster that blocked a Constitutional protection occurred Sept. 19 , 2007 , exactly 220 years and two days after the Constitution was ratified , ten years after Constitution Day was proposed , three years after George W. Bush enthusiastically signed Public Law 108- 447 that mandates nationwide observance and discussion of the Constitution , and exactly two days after Constitution Day 2007 .
In the second vote , the Senate , 56 - 44 , failed to end a filibuster against a proposal to require combat troops be given as much time at home as they spent in war before a subsequent redeployment .
The Senate amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act was written by Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) and Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . )
Webb was a highly - decorated Marine combat officer during the Vietnam War who later served as secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan ; Hagel ( R - Neb . ) , was a twice - wounded infantry squad leader in Vietnam .
Thousands of troops are in their second and third deployment to Iraq , each deployment lasting up to 16 months .
Gen. David Petraeus says American combat troops could be in Iraq at least 10 years .
When it seemed that Webb was close to lining up 60 votes to override any filibuster , the Department of Defense and White House double - teamed the Senate to try to explain how giving combat soldiers a rest would perpetuate the war and , apparently , allow the terrorists to win .
McClatchy Newspapers projects there will be more than 150 filibusters by the end of this Congressional session , at least four times as many as any previous session and at least 25 times more filibusters by Southerners who tried to block civil rights legislation during the mid-1960s .
By this filibuster , the Senate vote gave the Bush - Cheney Administration all that it needs to continue an indefinite war , and a commitment of about 130,000 American troops in a country which Osama bin Laden does n't even visit .
Shortly after the vote , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) claimed in a press release that the amendment was nothing but a " power grab " by the Democrats and a " back door attempt to stop the war in Iraq . "
But , he was more candid than that and revealed both a truth and naivete .
" The Republicans own this war , " Graham told the New York Times , and noted , " If it goes bad , the nation loses and the Republican Party loses disproportionately compared to the Democratic Party . "
If it goes bad ?
For a man who is in his 15th year as a Senator , apparently truth stopped at the office door of blind loyalty to a President and Vice - President who launched a war based upon lies they fed to the American people , and then perpetuated the dishonesty by further lies and incompetence .

The John Frum Movement worships a mysterious spirit that urged them to reject the teachings of the Church and maintain their traditional customs .
The cult was reinforced during WWII , when US forces landed with huge amounts of cargo - weapons , food and medicine .
Villagers believe the spirit of John Frum sent the US military to their South Pacific home to help them .
Devotees say that an apparition of John Frum first appeared before tribal elders in the 1930s .
He urged them to rebel against the aggressive teachings of Christian missionaries and instead said they should put their faith in their own customs .
Stars and Stripes
World War II and the arrival of American troops on Vanuatu was a turning point for the John Frum Movement .
Villagers believe that their messiah was responsible for sending the generous US military and its cargo to them .
Speaking in local pidgin , the movement 's head , Chief Isaac Wan , said that John Frum was a god who would one day return .
He 's " our God , our Jesus , " he said .
Islanders are convinced that John Frum was an American .
Every year they parade in home - made US army uniforms beneath the Stars and Stripes .
They hope one day to entice another delivery of cargo .
This 50th anniversary marks the formal establishment of the John Frum Movement .
It also recognises the day when villagers raised the American flag for the first time in this isolated corner of the South Pacific .
[ Update : We ’ve just received the audio … ]
This bombshell just dropped by Rep. Dennis Kucinich on the Ed Schultz show .
Kucinich is considering forcing an impeachment vote on a “ privileged resolution ” on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives .
“ We ’re preparing for another war , and they ’re going to destroy America , ” Rep. Dennis Kucinich said Thursday .
“ We have a government in place right now that has to be challenged .
I ’m seriously thinking about calling a privileged resolution on impeachment of the vice president and forcing a vote on the floor of the House . ”
Time to call your representative and let him / her know that you will not support any candidate who does n’t support accountability and the rule of law .
You can reach the Capitol switchboard toll - free at 1-800-426-8073 .
Here ’s the Audio :
More details to follow on this post as this news develops …
As a result of this article , Impeach for Peace has been asked this question :
What is a “ privileged resolution ? ”
The following was found on InetResults.com :
1. High Constitutional Privilege .
In order to qualify as a resolution or memorial of high constitutional privilege , the House member must contain a “ direct ” or “ positive ” proposal to impeach .
A mere proposition to investigate conduct of a civil officer does not qualify as a high constitutional privilege even though impeachment may be contemplated as a possibility or even if the resolution or memorial is presented with “ a view to impeachment . ”
See IMPEACHMENT : Selected Materials pp. 66-71 ( Sections 2045 - 2052 ) and pp. 767-69 ( Sections 468-69 ) .
A direct or positive proposal to impeach retains its high constitutional privilege even though the resolution or memorial proposing impeachment also contains a resolution that the impeachment matter be referred to an appropriate House Committee for inquiry or investigation .
See IMPEACHMENT : Selected Materials pp. 67-69 ( Sections 2046 - 48 ) .
At the same time the resolution calling for an investigation or inquiry cannot also request an appropriation for funds to support the investigation or inquiry .
Id. at pp. 767-68 ( Section 468 ) .
A direct or positive proposal to impeach takes precedence over everything , ” even over pending business before the House under a unanimous consent agreement .
Id. at p. 770 ( Section 469 ) .
Indeed , impeachment is a question of constitutional privilege which may be presented at any time irrespective of previous action of the House .
Id. at 71 ( Section 2053 ) .
2. Rights of the House member Presenting a Privileged Impeachment Resolution .
A member submitting a privileged resolution , memorial or motion proposing impeachment is entitled to recognition for one hour in which to debate it .
A member recognized to present a privileged resolution may not be taken from the floor by a motion to refer .
IMPEACHMENT : Selected Materials p. 769 ( Section 468 ) .
In order to secure this privilege of debate , however , the proposal must be put in writing and submitted to the Clerk of the House .
Id. at pp. 770-71 ( Section 470 ) .
Once having submitted an impeachment resolution against a civil officer , then that member ’s high privilege has expired .
Id. at pp. 769-70 ( Section 469 ) .
This rule apparently does not apply if the member files an amended impeachment resolution containing new charges or other new matters .
Id. at 767-69 ( Section 468 ) .
3. Disposition of a Privileged Impeachment Resolution .
Even when an impeachment resolution does not contain within it a referral to a committee for inquiry or investigation , it appears to be the normal procedure for such a resolution to be referred to an appropriate committee — even when the resolution clearly has absolutely no support in the full House .
IMPEACHMENT : Selected Materials pp. 769-70 ( Section 469 ) .
According to Jerome Zeifman , however , it is possible that such a resolution could be called up for an immediate vote ; but that option appears to be within the control of the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader .
See Zeifman , Without Honor : The Impeachment of Richard Nixon and the Crimes of Camelot pp. 46-47 ( 1995 ) .
Hence , Congressman Robert Drinan ’s Resolution impeaching Richard Nixon — filed on July 31 , 1973 when there was absolutely no sentiment for impeachment was referred to the House Judiciary Committee .
Later , on October 23 and 24 , 1973 , when 84 such resolutions were introduced , all were referred to the Judiciary Committee .
With all of his limbs now broken or shot up , he spent the next six years in captivity , undergoing mock executions , hung again repeatedly by his feet , often not permitted to urinate , beaten senseless in scenes " out of the Mongol Hordes " with whips that made his testicles like charred meat .
When prison guards burst in on him and other POWs during a clandestine Christian service , Day stared into their muzzles and sang " The Star - Spangled Banner . "
A recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor , Day took the greatest pride in never revealing information to his captors about the Misty program .
" If I were to divulge our secrets and tactics , it was highly likely that many of my fine , young , loyal pilots would die as a result ... "
I met Bud Day in September 2005 at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station where Navy flyers had lined up to buy his book , for which he had to take payments in cash .
I thought it demeaning that he had to sell his book this way .
It says something about the blind spots of a Manhattan - based publishing industry that Day had to go to what is essentially a vanity press .
The publication of Coram 's book is , therefore , a welcome event .
The relative obscurity of Day 's autobiography and other books like it about Vietnam constitutes a lesser - known aspect of our civilian - military divide .
The books to which I refer should be part of our recollection of Vietnam , but they generally are n't .
They are n't so much stories that soldiers tell civilians as those that soldiers tell each other .
Of course , there are exceptions : most famously James Webb 's Fields of Fire ( 1978 ) , a book that overlaps with this category and which , in fact , did become a bestseller .
But there is a range of books of lesser literary merit , yet of equal historical worth , that either have small readerships or readerships consisting overwhelmingly of military personnel , active duty and retired .
The authors of these lesser - known books include marines and Green Berets ( Army Special Forces ) who were involved in counterinsurgency operations .
Their writing reveals a second divide — that between professional warriors and conventional , citizen soldiers — which is but another facet of the warrior 's alienation from the civilian world .
To explore this second divide , I must also bring into the discussion a French writer and a British soldier , whose legacies include not only Indochina , but Algeria and pre-World War II Palestine — scenes , too , of messy , irregular warfare .
Thus , my notion of another Vietnam library goes beyond the subject at hand .
Reading habits are influenced by the people you meet .
If I had n't had the opportunity to embed with professional warriors , I would never have heard of some of these books .
For example , I learned a great deal about Bud Day and Duty Honor Country from Air Force Captain Jeremiah Parvin of Rocky Mount , North Carolina , a young A - 10 Warthog pilot with a " Misty " patch on his arm .
The A - 10 is essentially a flying Gatling gun .
Its pilots hover low to the ground and loiter over the battlefield at great risk .
Even as they disdain the rest of the Air Force , marines and Green Berets consider A - 10 pilots true warriors .
A - 10 pilots feel the same bond toward combat infantry .
It is a trait of professional warriors that they feel closer to those in other armed services who take similar risks than toward men and women in their own service who do n't .
Being in the military is not enough for these men :
To earn their respect , you had to have joined in order to fight — not to better your career , or your station in life .
Success At Woomera As Scramjet Clips Mach 10
by Staff Writers
Canberra , Australia ( SPX ) Jun 18 , 2007
Australia 's Defence Science and Technology Organisation ( DSTO ) has today launched one of the world 's fastest air - breathing engine experiments , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence , Mr Peter Lindsay announced .
The scramjet engine experiment reached speeds of up to Mach 10 , approximately 11,000 km per hour , or ten times the speed of sound .
Scramjets are air - breathing supersonic combustion ramjet engines that could make it possible for a two hour flight from Sydney to London .
" This research is a major boost to Australian and international scramjet technology research , " Mr Lindsay said .
" Today 's flight rocketed to an altitude of 530 km , and reached Mach 10 during re-entry , " Mr Lindsay said .
" Australia is a world leader in hypersonics research . "
" Scramjet research has taken place in Australia for over three decades .
We have active research programs in niche technologies of scramjet propulsion as well as guidance and control at hypersonic speeds . "
The flight took place at the Woomera Test Facility in South Australia under a collaborative effort between the United States ' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) and DSTO , also representing the research collaborators in the Australian Hypersonics Initiative ( AHI ) .
" This test has obtained the first ever flight data on the inward - turning scramjet engine design , " said Dr. Steven Walker , Deputy Director of the Tactical Technology Office at DARPA .
" DARPA will compare this flight data to ground test data measured on the same engine configuration in the US . "
" We are pleased with this joint effort between the US and Australia and believe that a hypersonic airplane could be a reality in the not to distant future . "
While DSTO was the lead Australian research agency for the flight , the AHI 's collaborative partners include the University of Queensland , the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy , and the Australian National University , together with the State Governments of South Australia and Queensland .
DSTO scientist Dr Warren Harch said hypersonic propulsion using supersonic combustion ramjet ( scramjet ) technology offered the possibility of very high speeds and fuel efficiencies .
" This technology has the potential to put numerous defence and civilian aerospace applications within our reach during the next couple of decades , " Dr Harch said .
Hypersonics is the study of velocities greater than five times the speed of sound ( Mach 5 ) and could have a significant impact on Defence as well as on international transport and future access to space .
Future defence applications for hypersonic vehicles include long - range time critical missions , with civilian applications including low - cost satellite launching and high - speed aircraft .
Dr Harch said DSTO 's scientific contributions to the research program had been the computer modelling of the combustion processes , non-linear mechanics , guidance and control , and trajectory analysis .
" Assisting with telemetry collection is another important area , which presents quite a challenge when working with a vehicle travelling at hypersonic speeds , " Dr Harch said .
Mozilla Corp. will release some of its homegrown security tools to the open - source community , the company 's head of security said Wednesday , starting with a " fuzzer " it uses to pin down JavaScript bugs in Firefox .
The JavaScript fuzzer , said Window Snyder , Mozilla 's security chief since last September , will be handed over Thursday morning , following a presentation at Black Hat , a two - day security conference that opened Wednesday in Las Vegas .
" We 're announcing that we 'll be sharing our tools with the community , and releasing the JavaScript fuzzer then , " said Snyder .
Other tools will follow , including fuzzers that stress - test the HTTP and FTP protocols .
Those two tools , however , are not ready to offer to outsiders , largely because Mozilla wants to wrap up talks with other browser vendors before they are shared .
Fuzzing , a technique used by both white - and black - hat researchers trolling for vulnerabilities , and by developers to finger flaws in their code before it goes public , drops data into applications or operating system components to see if -- and where -- breakdowns occur .
Typically , the process is automated with a fuzzer , the term for software that hammers on application inputs .
The JavaScript fuzzer , Snyder said , has identified " dozens " of vulnerabilities in Firefox code .
Snyder said Firefox developers have created many tools , and though a lot of them are small , special - purpose ones , all of them could be useful to others .
" We want to make the work we 're already doing available to other people and to other products " in the hope that the tools might help developers outside Mozilla spot problems in their code , she said .
Snyder sees a direct benefit to Mozilla , too .
The more people who bang on the tool , tweak it and modify it , the better the tools should become , she said .
She seemed unconcerned that any tool Mozilla released would prove a significant danger to users .
Although hackers also use fuzzers in their vulnerability - sniffing tool kits , " the tool is n't bad or good on its own , " Snyder argued .
" They use debuggers all the time .
Debuggers are n't bad " because of that .
Mozilla might have wished it had fuzzed Firefox a bit more over the past three weeks , when it was caught in a name - calling contest between it and Microsoft Corp. supporters .
Early last month , Danish researcher Thor Larholm found what he said was a critical input-validation bug in Internet Explorer that let the browser pass potentially malicious URLs to other programs , including Firefox .
He laid blame on IE , while other security experts said it was Firefox 's fault .
Shortly after that , Snyder hinted that she saw the whole mess as an IE problem , but within days acknowledged that Firefox was guilty of the same behavior .
" We thought this was just a problem with IE , " she said July 23 .
" It turns out , it is a problem with Firefox as well . "
Wednesday , she said that the very public disagreements between security experts as to which browser was to blame had actually been a good thing .
" Debate is healthy , " she said .
" And if we 're wrong , we say we 're wrong and move on . "
Mozilla updated Firefox twice in July , first on July 17 with 2.0.0.5 , and then Monday when it released Version 2.0.0.6 .
Both updates included fixes for the URL protocol handling bug that started the brouhaha .
" We were n't twiddling our thumbs during all of this , " said Snyder .
" We were also on the back end moving forward with fixes . "
At Black Hat , Snyder and fellow Mozilla executive Mike Shaver , the company 's technology strategist , also plan to discuss the new security features of Firefox 3 , the major update that currently is in preview testing .
Firefox 3 is expected to ship sometime this year .

Since late August , British commandos in the deserts of far southeastern Iraq have been testing one of the most serious charges leveled by the United States against Iran : that Iran is secretly supplying weapons , parts , funding and training for attacks on U.S. - led forces in Iraq .
. . . .
There 's just one thing .
" I suspect there 's nothing out there , " the commander , Lt. Col .
David Labouchere , said last month , speaking at an overnight camp near the border .
" And I intend to prove it . "
Other senior British military leaders spoke as explicitly in interviews over the previous two months .
Britain , whose forces have had responsibility for security in southeastern Iraq since the war began , has found nothing to support the Americans ' contention that Iran is providing weapons and training in Iraq , several senior military officials said .
" I have not myself seen any evidence -- and I do n't think any evidence exists -- of government - supported or instigated " armed support on Iran 's part in Iraq , British Defense Secretary Des Browne said in an interview in Baghdad in late August .
For all the aggressive rhetoric , however , the Bush administration has provided scant evidence to support these claims .
Nor have reporters traveling with U.S. troops seen extensive signs of Iranian involvement .
During a recent sweep through a stronghold of Sunni insurgents here , a single Iranian machine gun turned up among dozens of arms caches U.S. troops uncovered .
British officials have similarly accused Iran of meddling in Iraqi affairs , but say they have not found Iranian - made weapons in areas they patrol .
The lack of publicly disclosed evidence has led to questions about whether the administration is overstating its case .
I 've come to a much darker interpretation of Iranian actions in the past 12 to 18 months . . .
There is a clear line of evidence that points out the Iranians want to punish the United States , hurt the United States in Iraq , tie down the United States in Iraq .
UPDATE
Something odd occurred this week : Fox News -- spewing filth churned out by the lowest depths of right - wing innuendo swamps -- was " reporting " the two - pronged falsehood that Barak Obama attended a " madrassa " as a child and that it was Hillary Clinton 's campaign which maliciously disclosed that story .
There is , of course , nothing at all odd about any of that .
But in response , the national media -- rather than merely passing those accusations along -- decided instead to subject them to critical scrutiny , investigate the claimed basis for the accusations , found that there was no basis , and then reported that the story was completely unfounded .
Or , to put it another way , they fulfilled their most basic and defining function as " journalists " by investigating , rather than reciting , other people 's claims .
Encouragingly , the media is beginning to engage in a similar exercise concerning the President 's war - pushing accusations towards Iran .
And they are finding that those accusations have about as much basis as Fox 's Obama / Hillary story did .
In his " surge " speech two weeks ago , the President claimed that " Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops . "
As a result , he vowed : " We will disrupt the attacks on our forces .
We 'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria .
And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq . "
By all accounts , he intends to repeat that accusation and those threats against Iran in his State of the Union speech .
If this were 2003 , every front page headline and lead - in to every television news programs would declare : " Iran responsible for attacks on U.S. troops . "
The more conscientious ones might add the phrase " , the President reveals . "
But all of the stories would contain one paragraph after the next asserting the administration 's claims about Iran as fact , and would include no investigation of those claims or any real contrary assertions .
That was government propaganda masquerading as " independent reporting " -- entire stories , day after day , published as fact based on nothing other than the claims of the government ( " Bush officials said " ; " senior administration officials today disclosed " , etc. etc. ) .
But , at least in some notable places , the opposite is occurring with Bush 's provocative Iran claims .
Back in October , The Washington Post published an excellent article by Ellen Knickmeyer -- headlined : British Find No Evidence of Arms Traffic from Iran -- which detailed the fact that the British military in Southern Iraq , where one would expect to find evidence of Iranian arms traffic if it actually existed in any substantial form , has found nothing of the sort :
Today , The LA Times published a similar article -- headlined : Scant Evidence Found of Iran - Iraq Arms Link .
Detailing the ( largely futile ) efforts to find evidence of Iranian arms shipments in the Southern border province of Diyala ( a highly likely locale for such activity , if it existed ) , the Times reports that while the U.S. military claims to have found some Iranian mortars and antitank mines in Iraq , " there has been little sign of more advanced weaponry crossing the border , and no Iranian agents have been found . "
The article added : And , to the extent there is any evidence of Iranian involvement in Iraq , it is to aid Shiite factions ( such as The Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution ) which " arethose that have led attacks against U.S. forces .
Instead , they are nominal U.S. allies .
" The gradual revelation of the total lack of any credible evidence to support the Bush administration 's claim that Iran is all but fueling a war on the U.S. inside Iraq coincides with increasingly absolutist claims by Bush officials that Iran is guilty of such acts .
Here is what CIA Director Michael Hayden said at a recent Congressional hearing : But when Bush officials claim they have " evidence " of Iran 's violent behavior towards the U.S. in Iraq , what they mean by " evidence " is the same kind of " evidence " on which the pre-war Iraq claims of WMDs and Iraq - Al Qaeda alliances were based : namely , wild , unverified claims from Chalabi - like , AEI - touted , pro-Iran - war " sources " -- the kind who rant recklessly to Michael Ledeen and other warmonger pundits .
As Justin Raimondo pointed out , there is a critical difference between " intelligence " and " evidence . "
In the Bush world , " intelligence " includes " anything said by ' sources ' no matter their credibility or agenda , " and they then characterize those unverified claims as " evidence " ( as in : " There is a clear line of evidence that points out the Iranians want to punish the United States , hurt the United States in Iraq " ) .
But as was true for the administration 's pre-war Iraq claims , they have " intelligence " but no " evidence " ( despite extensive searching ) to support what they hope are their pre-war accusations against Iran .
And no rational person -- and , apparently , even fewer journalists this time around -- are going to accept Bush accusations towards Iran without " evidence .
" While it is certainly encouraging to see national media outlets subjecting Bush claims to genuine scrutiny , that alone is not going to defuse the grave threat posed by the President 's clear intent to confront Iran one way or the other .
It is highly doubtful that the administration believes it can roll out some grand marketing campaign for a new war against Iran similar to the one it unleashed for Iraq .
That is not what it is attempting here .
Instead , the administration wants to take a more circuitous route to creating a conflict with Iran -- by provoking the Iranians , contriving a pretext for an attack , fostering war - generating miscalculation , etc .
These increasingly bellicose accusations against Iran are designed to create and fuel that climate .
Exposing the utter falsity of the President 's statements regarding Iran is an important and valuable exercise , but it is not sufficient to impede an American attack of some sort on Iran .
The President 's desire for war with Iran does n't depend upon convincing Americans and the Congress as part of some grand debate of the need for a new war .
They know they can't achieve that .
The plan depends upon the hope ( and belief ) that nobody and nothing can stop the administration as it finds a way to escalate what we are doing in Iraq until it gradually includes Iran .
The administration and its allies have already begun aggressively asserting that the President does not need Congressional authorization or anything else in order an outright attack on Iran .
When it comes to their war plans , they do n't care about public opinion anymore .
For that reason -- as was amply demonstrated by the President 's now already underway " surge " plan -- merely winning the public debate over Iran will not be anywhere near sufficient to impede the President 's plans regarding Iran . * * * * * * * I will be on Air America with Sam Seder this morning at 9:20 a.m. EST to discuss the testimony of Alberto Gonzales last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Local listings are here and you can listen by audio feed here : Via Steve Clemons this is a somewhat disturbing ( though not at all surprising ) account from The Financial Times ' Gideon Rachman of an event ( attended by Rachman ) held in Herzliyah , Israel in which Iran War fervor was everywhere ( h/t Freedom ) .
The participants included John McCain and Rudy Guiliani ( by satellite ) and , in person : Newt Gingrich , Ehud Olmert , Benjamin Netanyahu , Richard Perle , James Woosley , the State Department 's Nicholas Burns , and the Defense Department 's Gordon England .
John Edwards will appear by satellite , too .
Anyone who doubts that an Iran - U.S. military confrontation is possible should read Rachman 's account .
1953 ?
That ’s impressive .
I did n’t know you could tighten up the graphics on punch cards .
Why beat this horse corpse when the internet has delivered such a resplendent flogging already ?
Joystiq just posted an article from Game Career Guide that prompted me to remember how shitty those commercials were .
An anlysis encompassing both the Gen1 ( or O.G ) Westwood commerical and the Gen2 ( with the spinning robot model on the projector ) .
Even if you were developing a game for the PSOne , your do n’t program it with the controller .
I ca n’t explain how many different ways that this is just wrong
Your boss is n’t a moderately hot chick who needs you to finish programming this game because she needs you to program another one .
Again , too many levels of wrong to elaborate on .
You do n ’… you can ’t….ugh .
It ’s pointless .
You do n’t view the game you are “ coding ” on a wall sized projector screen .
You dont “ add the sound effect we used in the last level ” with an 8 channel instrument mixing board with some XLR cables plugged into it .
They might as well have been “ injecting ” the sound effects with a turkey baster .
And lastly , sing it with me , “ There ’s no such thing as tightening up the graphics on level 3 ! ”
Thats like saying “ we just need to reverse entropy , then we ’ll be done . ”
I do n’t mean to rag on the students of Westwood .
On the contrary , I feel for them .

Real gaming studios do n’t take these colleges - in - a - box that seriously .
You have a much better shot of landing a game job by learning 3DS Max at home over the summer .

Update :
If someone told me years ago that he or she had found a way to do an end run around the sweat equity of traditional gardening , a way around digging , weeding , and rototilling , a way to produce more regardless of time constraints , physical limitations , or power - tool ineptness ... well , I would have checked that person for a head injury .
Yet such a system is actually possible , though I never would have believed it if I had n't stumbled upon the basics myself .
Lasagna gardening was borne of my own frustrations .
After my husband retired from the U.S. Navy , we began our next period of work as innkeepers .
When the demands on my time became so great that I could no longer do all that was required to keep both the business and the garden going , the garden suffered .
I 'd plant in the spring , then see the garden go unattended .
I needed a way to do it all .
Just when I was about to give up , it happened : a bountiful harvest with no work .
I 'd planted , late again because of a late spring .
And again , when the seasonal demands of the business began claiming all of my time , my plantings were forgotten .
In midsummer , I made a much belated foray into the garden .
I had to hack through a jungle of weeds to find the vegetable plants — but what a payoff !
I discovered basketfuls of ripe tomatoes , cucumbers , squash , peppers , and egg plant .
True , there were also basketfuls of rotted , overgrown , and unusable vegetables ( the product of neglect ) , but the abundance was truly amazing .
To gain some measure of control that year , I simply stomped the weeds flat in between rows and put down cardboard boxes to walk on .
The harvest continued , with carrots , onions , garlic , and potatoes persisting among the weeds .
Stout stems of collard greens pushed the plants up to tower above the mess , despite the native morning glory that tried to hold back growth .
Lower - growing
Swiss chard also persevered , though I had to cut out the shriveled leaves and pull a few weeds to get to the good growth .
Flower seeds , planted in a border around the garden in the spring , came up and bloomed .
As I poked about that messy old garden , I found patches of basil , parsley , sage , and thyme that had done battle with weeds and grass and won .
I was suddenly very excited about the possibilities .
And the timing could n't have been better .
The inn had caught on , making my time in the garden more limited .
And , as much as I hated to admit it , I was getting older and losing some strength .
I was by then living and working alone , so there was no one to run the tiller .
I bought a smaller model but could n't cope with cleaning the carburetor and mixing gas and oil .
Inspired by my no -work harvest , late that fall I began my first attempt to make and maintain a garden without digging or tilling .
Using no power tools and little more than what was at hand , I layered for the first time .
A neighbor 's son had promised to bring me a load of horse manure in a spreader in exchange for pizza and sodas for himself and his friends .
This seemed like a fair exchange to me .
I removed all the cardboard from the paths and gave him access to back the spreader right up to the garden .
He spread about four to six inches of fresh manure on the entire plot .
I waded in and covered it with a layer of peat moss .
In the spring I had more weeds ( smart weed , pig weed , dumb weed ) than ever before , but they were easy to stomp down .
I covered the garden paths with cardboard , then set about hand - pulling weeds from the garden spaces , easily keeping them clear just long enough to plant .
Once the plants were in , I mulched with compost and peat moss .
As the plants grew , I mulched with grass clippings and more peat moss .
My garden spaces were smaller with wider paths , and I planted closer .
I expected that as the plants grew they would crowd out the weeds .
To plant seeds , I created a weed - free planting space with a mixture of peat moss , sand , and sifted compost laid on top of the rather untidy garden base .
The business — a country inn and restaurant — was year - round , but from July 4th to Labor Day I danced as fast as I could to keep up with the heavy seasonal trade .
By midsummer , I found myself once again ignoring the garden .
Yet , once again , the garden produced more than I expected , though it was still weedy and messy .
There was something missing .
I knew I could control the weed growth with plastic or landscape material , but it was n't what I wanted .
I needed a ground cover that would suppress weeds , deteriorate , be easy to come by , and cost nothing .
As I lugged tied bundles to the curb for recycling , I found my answer : newspaper .
Creating Layers in the Garden
That fall , I covered the entire garden : the paths with new cardboard and bark chips and the garden spaces with two or three sheets of wet newspaper and peat moss , layered with grass clippings and chipped leaves .
It was looking good .
In fact , it was beautiful - neat and beautiful !
In the spring , I pulled the weedless layers of dark , rich soil aside , right down to the newspaper , and planted .
I took time to add compost , peat moss , and grass clippings as mulch to the plants .
It was some year — a great harvest , few weeds , and no work to speak of .
That 's when I began to think about a garden built on top of the sod , requiring none of the traditional preparation : no lifting the sod , no digging or tilling , just neat layers of organic ingredients left to decompose over the winter .
Once I found the spot — a level , grassy parking lot near a water source — I drew a sketch of a garden of herbs and flowers in a formal Williamsburg design .
It was all about measuring : two - foot garden spaces and three - foot paths , all leading to a circle at the center with space for a sundial and thyme garden .
While waiting for my daughter , Melissa , and surveyor son - in - law , Bill , to stake out the lines , I stockpiled the ingredients : newspapers , flattened cardboard boxes , wood chips , compost , grass clippings , leaves , rotted barn litter , old hay , horse manure , sand ( left over from a building project ) , and bags of soil amendments bought on sale at the garden center .

When Bill was through with the survey and gutter nails were tied with bright survey tape at corners , I connected them with string .
Next , I laid cardboard on the paths and covered the cardboard with bark chips .
I then covered the garden spaces with thick layers of wet newspaper , overlapping the ends , and covered the paper with one to two inches of peat moss .
Then I laid a three - to four - inch layer of dried grass clippings over the peat moss and added another one or two inches of peat moss .
I continued to alternate layers of waste material and peat moss .
Midway through , it struck me that the peat moss was akin to the cheese layer in a real lasagna .
By the time I was finished with all the material I had collected , the garden spaces were 24 or more inches high , and it was well into November .
I worked at the last of it until late in the day and quit only when I felt snow covering my head and shoulders .
Just before walking away , I sprinkled a dusting of wood ashes on top of the layers .
It was like the parmesan cheese you add to the top of a real lasagna just before you put it in the oven .
This was all done on top of the sod — without lifting , digging , or tilling .
Rich , Fertile Soil
My winters at the inn were long and cold .
Snow covered the top of the mountain from November until late April .
When I took the first spring walk in the gardens , I carried a trowel to check on the frost depth .
I poked about in the earth in gardens from the front of the inn to the back by the barn , leaving the layered garden till last .
Eventually I found myself standing in front of the new garden .
What had been two feet of layered soil amendments was now just about six or eight inches high .
I pushed the trowel down through rich , black soil to the paper layer and found most of the sheets gone and another five to six inches of loose earth below .
I could plant anything in this much loose material .
The lasagna layering had worked beautifully !
When the weather finally warmed , I pulled the soil apart in the new garden and planted herbs and flowers .
I continued mulching each time I cut the grass .
That 's it !
No other work — - no weeding , no watering , nothing !
I could n't believe how the plants thrived and how easy it was .
I did n't need to worry about garden chores during my busy season anymore .
The guests at the inn admired the new garden , and I shared the process .
The old vegetable garden , previously kept hidden , was now a showplace .
Folks who admired my gardens could see they were weed - free .
I told everyone about the lasagna method , but I could see that few really got it .
They either did n't believe me or had no grasp of what it all meant .
But I knew .
It meant I could be a really good gardener and still be able to keep up with the demands of being an innkeeper .
It meant I could put the rototiller up for sale .
Best of all , I stopped worrying about getting older and not being able to keep it all going by myself .
I could have it all !
For those who are in doubt , I suggest you take a walk in the forest and renew your relationship with Mother Nature .
She is the original lasagna gardener , though not as neat as me .
In nature , debris drops to the forest floor , and without any help from man , creates layers of dark , rich humus .
Tree and wildflower seeds fall into the debris - turned - humus , sprout , and grow .
Unless you live in the forest , you probably want a neater , more organized garden .
But to have any kind of garden — neat or otherwise — you first need good soil .
Traditionalists would agree on the good soil premise and either crank up the tiller or get out the cultivator .
My neat layers promote good soil without tillers or cultivators .
You take the first step by simply covering the earth , creating a moist dark place where earthworms will come .
Once you see worm activity , you know you 're on the right track to having good soil .
All additional layers of organic material encourage and feed the earthworm population .
Worms are nature 's rototillers .
But wait : what about the Ruth Stout advocates who say , " So what ?
It 's all been done before . "
Well , perhaps I am Ruth Stout reincarnated , only neater , and with some fundamental differences .
I do n't just use spoiled hay on top of a garden that has been plowed every year for 30 or 40 years .
I layer right on top of sod , flattened weeds , or between rocks .
I do n't throw all the refuse back on top of the hay .
I tuck unsightly waste under the paper , both for worm food and to keep it out of sight .
Also , I do n't have to worry a whole lot about snakes or rodents .
I do n't like to share too much of my space with either , and they do love that loose hay .
Last , I never take my clothes off in the garden , no matter how much I would like to .
Lasagna Gardening 101
Before you buy the first plant , or lay down the first sheet of wet newspaper , take a look around your property .
Check to see where you get the best light ; that 's where you 'll put your garden .
Decide on the shape and contents of your garden .
The size of your plot will determine how much material you need to make your first lasagna .
Your material list will change depending on where you live .
Some folks have more leaves than others , some have seaweed , others ground cornstalks or apple pulp .
Some of the lucky ones have access to animal manure .
There 's no hard and fast rules about what to use for your layers , just so long as it's organic and does n't contain any protein ( fat , meat , or bone ) .
Before I go any further , let me just say that the basics of making garden lasagnas are simple :
You need less loose material to plant in than you might think .
In the spring of ' 98 , I layered an area where a dog pen had stood for years .
The property belongs to a 79 - year - old man who was upset about his inability to garden as he once had .
Until recently , a 100 - year - old white pine tree had occupied the center of the fenced - in area .
But its roots had begun to do real damage to my friend 's house and surrounding properties , and so the tree had to be taken down .
Once the tree was removed , the area was bright and sunny , but , unfortunately , the ground contained 100 years worth of layered pine needles .
First , we covered the area with lime , then laid whole sections of wet newspaper on top of the pine needles and covered the paper with peat moss .
We bought a small truckload of barn litter mixed with our local clay soil and covered the peat with two inches of this mix and then two more inches of peat moss .
Additions of one to two inches of grass clippings , two inches of peat moss , one to two inches of compost , and more peat gave us a total of about six to eight inches to plant in .
We pulled the layers apart and planted 31 tomato plants , four squash , six cucumber , four basil , two rosemary , four parsley , and twelve cosmos .
It was a jungle , but with staking , pruning , and tying , the garden produced so much fruit that the entire neighborhood helped eat the harvest , and the cosmos were so beautiful they took our breath away .
Once the harvest was finished , I pulled the stems and disturbed the layers for the first time .
Pieces of the paper layer came up with the roots .
So , too , did the biggest earthworms you can imagine .
The soil was still probably a bit acidic , but it will get better in time .
To prepare the new garden for another year of planting , we spread the contents of a large composter onto the space , and the garden took on several inches in height .
The last mowing of grass provided enough clippings to add another few inches .
When the fall came , we mowed the leaves for a top dressing of four inches of chipped leaves .
I love an edged garden and so the last thing I did was cut a sharp , clean border around the sides , throwing the edging material up onto the garden , with grass side down , for another layer of more good dirt .
It looked beautiful !
Close planting and mulching greatly reduced the amount of weeds in the dog pen garden , as they do in all my gardens .
It also meant less watering , since the paper and mulch kept the soil around the root zone cool .
Even though we pushed it a bit by planting 31 tomato plants , the staking , tying , and pruning , in addition to close planting , created a healthy growing environment , with few garden pests .
It was another test , and the results have left my friend confident that , as he enters his 80th year , he will be able to continue gardening with the lasagna method .
Indeed , lasagna gardening is so simple that the hardest part may be getting started .
I suggest beginning with that walk around your property to determine what you can do with what you have .
If you get lots of shade , plant a shade garden or cut some tree limbs .
Track the light for a couple of days during the spring and summer .
You probably have more light than you think — not sun , but light .
Lots of rocks ?
Try rock gardening .
You might learn to love the wonderful world of small plants that thrive in rocky terrain .
Too little space ?
Look again .
If there 's a foot of space , you can plant in it .
There 's no such thing as work - free gardening , but the lasagna method is close .
Once you train yourself to think layering , and learn to stockpile your ingredients , you will work less each year .
Following are some of my favorite vegetables , along with tips on how I grow them the lasagna way :
Asparagus
Many gardeners shy away from this tasty crop , mainly because it 's difficult to grow through traditional means .
Not so with lasagna gardening .
I still remember the first year I planned my asparagus patch .
Turned out to be one of my best vegetable trials yet .
For fun , I grew a tray of plants from seed , started indoors in February .
In early spring , I added the small seedlings to the assembly of roots — one , two , and three years old — that I had accumulated to plant together .
Using a mattock blade , I scraped a shallow opening in a newly made lasagna bed , an inch or two deep .
I combined the roots and seedlings in the opening and covered them with a sifting of soil and peat moss .
Once the roots were planted , I covered the top of the row with a mixture of manure and peat moss .
As the roots sprouted and grew , I added sifted compost and grass clippings .
In the fall , I added more manure and a thick layer of chipped leaves for winter mulch .
During the first spring , I watched the asparagus emerge and grow .
I invited inn guests into the garden to help me cut and eat the first tender stalks .
Then I mulched , mulched , then mulched some more .
The second spring , I cut so much asparagus we had some to freeze .
It was all so easy : plant , mulch , harvest , and enjoy .
Site and soil .
A heavy feeder , asparagus needs well - drained soil and at least six hours of sun .
The fall before planting , build a lasagna garden on the site you 've chosen for your asparagus , using a base of newspaper topped with 18 to 24 inches of layered organic material .
By spring , the lasagna bed will have composted to ideal soil conditions for asparagus .
Planting and harvest .
The time is right when the soil is thawed and crumbles in your hand .
Plant in rows two feet apart in two shallow trenches , with a rise in between .
This lets the crowns sit on top of the rise , with the roots in the trenches .
Plants should be 18 inches apart and covered with two to three inches of soil and compost mixture .
As the plants grow during the summer , continue covering with the compost enriched mixture until crowns are four inches deep .
In the fall , cover the entire bed with a blanket of eight to ten inches of chopped leaves or other organic mulch .
Each spring , feed the bed compost enriched with manure .
In colder regions , pull the mulch back on half the bed to get an extra early harvest , saving half the bed for later harvesting .
Once the harvest is over , the remaining shoots expand into ferny top growth .
When the ferns turn bronze , cut them back .
Beans
I usually wind up planting many more beans than I actually need .
But with so many varieties — all so much types to grow — who can resist !
Once the last chance of frost is past , plant your favorite bean seeds .
Divide your seeds into thirds and plant every two weeks for a longer harvest .
Once I have a lasagna bed in place , I plant bush bean seeds along the edges .
They only need a few inches , since the plants will lean out over the sides of the garden , leaving room for taller crops .
I plant pole bean seeds around the base of teepees made from six - foot bamboo poles .
Plant seeds around the base of each pole , and when they start to climb , give them a boost up the trailing twine you have tied from the top .
Site and soil .
Beans grow best in well - drained soil that 's high in organic matter .
A new or established lasagna bed in full sun works best for all types .
Planting and harvest .
Fix supports in place before planting pole bean seeds .
For both types , pole and bush , just push the seeds into loose soil about two inches apart .
Cover the seeds and press the soil around them for direct contact .
Keep the soil evenly moist until seeds emerge , then cover the soil with a good mulch to keep the soil cool , the leaves clean , and the garden weed - free .
To avoid rust , do n't work beans when foliage is wet .
Once beans start to appear , keep crop picked to encourage new bloom .
Rotate crops every year to avoid pests and disease .
Cucumbers
Bush cucumbers can be grown in small spaces and containers .
Climbing cucumbers need strong support , so plant close to a fence or trellis .
I like the climbers and try to see what kind of new supports I can come up with each year to make the garden more interesting .
I loved the string cradles we tied to a stockade fence one year .
The vines grew up strings hanging down into the row , then up the string cradles and onto the fence .
Site and soil .
Cucumbers need good drainage and rich soil .
Lasagna gardens are just the thing , when enriched with fresh manure .
However , wait three years before planting in the same place to avoid pests and disease .
Planting and harvest .
Wait until the last frost is past , then plant prestarted seeds covered with floating row cover in colder regions , and seeds sown directly in the garden in milder climates .
Keep mulched and do n't till , as cucumbers are shallow rooted .
Maintaining at least six inches of mulch at all times keeps the roots cool and moist , but they still need an inch of water each week .
Pick the fruit when it 's small and most flavorful .
Once the harvest starts , do n't miss a day , or you 'll have candidates for the compost pile instead of the salad bowl .
Garlic
If you 've never tried growing garlic , you 've missed something special .
I make a rich lasagna bed , let it cook for four to six weeks under black plastic , set strings up to keep my rows straight , and push in single cloves just enough to see they are covered .
When the foliage is full and seed heads form , I cut and use them just as I would cloves .
When the foliage turns yellow or brown , it 's time to lift the garlic .
Loosen the earth and gently shake off any dirt .
Let the cloves cure by hanging them in a dry place .
The individual cloves will each make a head , so you will have plenty to use , as well as to save for next year 's seed .
Site and soil .
Good drainage , full sun , and plenty of manure - rich compost are best .
A well - built lasagna bed has the perfect growing conditions to start , then all you have to do is add grass clippings or chipped leaves for mulch to keep the soil evenly moist and weeds at a minimum .
Planting and harvest .
Gardeners in the Northeast and zone 5 and colder climates will get best results from hard - neck garlic planted in the fall and harvested the next summer .
Milder climates can grow soft - neck ; plant in the spring and harvest that same fall .
If you have n't room for an entire bed just for garlic , plant some in groups of three to five cloves in flower or vegetable beds .
Folks who have bug problems swear by the positive effect garlic has on its companions .
Lettuce
Anyone can grow lettuce .
The problem is most folks grow too much at one time .
Use a little restraint and make successive plantings .
Mix lettuce seed with sand so you will not have to do so much thinning .
I broadcast a mixture of cut - and - come - again lettuce once a month for the duration of growing time for my zone .
Site and soil .
Lettuce likes it cool and so is ideally suited for spring and fall plantings .
I use other taller plants to shade my lettuce in summer .
It 's best to prepare a site for lettuce in the fall , adding a high nitrogen amendment ( such as fresh grass clippings ) to the top two inches of soil .
Planting and harvest .
Lettuce is a fun crop to grow in containers , as borders , and in tiny spaces that would only go to waste otherwise .
There 's really no safe place to hide when I start looking for places to plant .
I 've planted Ruby Red and Oakleaf lettuce in my herb and edible flower containers and flower boxes .
I interplant herbs and lettuce in the border gardens that surround my antique roses .
The Mesclun mixes are wonderful in big terra cotta saucers that stand alone in part shade .
When guests come for dinner , I give them a colander and a pair of scissors and point them toward the garden .
They come back with an interesting collection of edibles and never forget the experience .
Lots of good gardeners start out by getting their feet dirty in someone else 's garden .
Potatoes
No need to dig trenches or to hill up .
Build a lasagna bed to eliminate grass and weeds , do n't use any lime or nitrogen rich materials ( such as grass clippings ) , lay down one or two sheets of wet newspaper , lay seed potatoes on top of the paper , and cover with spoiled hay or compost .
You can use pretty much anything you have that is dried .
Chipped leaves are great for covering the tubers .
I use hay that is well - cured and lying next to my potato bed , so I do n't have to carry it too far .
Site and soil .
Potatoes need full sun , good drainage , and can tolerate acid soil .
Preparing a lasagna bed and adding bone meal or rock sulfate produces a good harvest and large tubers .
Avoid planting potatoes where you have grown them or their relatives ( including eggplant , peppers , and tomatoes ) for the past three years .
Planting and harvest .
Be ready to plant in early to mid spring and have enough material to cover the bed with ten inches of mulch .
Be prepared to add several inches of cover to the bed as plants grow .
The important thing here is to keep the tubers covered so they will not see the light of day .
By the end of the growing period , the plants will be propped up with hay or other soil amendments .
Slip your hand under the mulch to harvest a few small potatoes when the beans are ready to pick .
Let the rest continue growing until the foliage has yellowed .
Do n't try to dig !
Lift the mulch and pick the clean tubers up off the newspaper .
Be on the watch for potato bugs .
Try to catch them when they are small .
Sweep across the foliage with a broom .
They will fall into the mulch and , when small , not be able to find their way back up to the leaves .
Tomatoes
The toughest part of growing tomatoes is choosing the kinds you will grow .
You 'll likely want to plant several different varieties each year : there 's early , mid season , and late ones ; tiny pear shaped , cherry , patio , plum , slicing , and cooking varieties ; plus , tomatoes for juice and for stuffing , not to mention new types and heritage .
Site and soil .
Tomatoes need full sun , an inch of water per week , and protection from the wind .
Ideal conditions are a lasagna bed that has been around for at least a year and has not grown any of the relatives : potatoes , eggplant , or other tomatoes .
I prepare my site by installing water jugs buried up to their shoulders between where every two plants will be .
A pin hole in the sides facing the plans should let enough seep out to keep up consistent watering .
I place a tall stick in each jug , its top colored with red paint or nail polish .
This helps me find the sticks , which helps me find the openings to the jugs when all the foliage hides them from view .
I fill the jugs with a funnel and the water hose .
You can add liquid plant food to the water if you like .
Planting and harvest .
Wait until after the last frost , then plant the seedlings .
Create a well of soil around the stem to help catch any rain .
If you have prepared the lasagna bed in advance , all you will have to do is scrape the soil aside and lay the plant down up to the last four leaves .
Press the soil around the plant to make direct contact and push out any air pockets .
Once the jugs and plants are in place , make a collar of one or two sheets of wet newspaper , place it around the stem , and cover the paper with mulch .
Depending on the type of tomatoes you have chosen , you will need to stake , tie , prune , and pinch .
Keep the water jugs full and check plants regularly for bugs or disease .
Do n't get impatient ; tomatoes need lots of long hot sunny days and warm nights .
Again , depending on the cultivar you have chosen to grow , you can look forward to your first harvest in 55 to 100 days after you set the plants out .
And , oh , what a delicious harvest !
I love tomatoes warm from the garden - standing over the row , biting into one , the juice running off my chin , dripping from my elbow , the acid tingling my tongue .
It just does n't get any better than that .

The human beings that most of us believe ourselves to be , actually encompass only a tiny fraction of the grand spectra of existence .
Indeed , we are an integral part of the unfolding of reality .
We are sentient self - aware beings , distinct from most of the other beings that exist on this planet .
The limited and docile Earthly persons that we , by default , tend to envision ourselves as , are actually far greater beings capable of , heretofore , unimagined feats .
“ In the beginner ’s mind there are many possibilities , in the expert ’s mind there are few ” ~ Sunryu Suzuki
Transcendence of our differences and re-invigoration of the primordial drive to transfigure our inner-selves into something more novel is the key .
We have to move beyond this repetitive , cyclical , propaganda - induced lifestyle .
To do this , we need to abolish ritual and instead follow our innate sense of compassion by living in each and every moment as if it is the very first moment ever experienced .
This is a return to the mind of a beginner .
The ancient Taoist philosophers wrote the following about ritual , in the Tao Te Ching :
Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted ;
Closely held beliefs are not easily released ;
So ritual enthralls generation after generation .
Harmony does not care for harmony , and so is naturally attained ;
But ritual is intent upon harmony , and so can not attain it .
Harmony neither acts nor reasons ;
Love acts , but without reason ;
Justice acts to serve reason ;
But ritual acts to enforce reason .
When the Way is lost , there remains harmony ;
When harmony is lost , there remains love ;
When love is lost , there remains justice ;
And when justice is lost , there remains ritual .
Ritual is the end of compassion and honesty ,
The beginning of confusion ;
Belief is a colorful hope or fear ,
The beginning of folly .
The sage goes by harmony , not by hope ;
He dwells in the fruit , not the flower ;
He accepts substance , and ignores abstraction .
The author of this passage is trying to tell us that we need to stop basing our lives on rituals and beliefs , but instead we need to use the mind that we were given and think for ourselves , reacting to the events that take place and creating our own novel events , in each moment , with our intuition , instead of retreating to our beliefs to tell us what the world is and what our place is in this world .
These are revolutionary concepts that even the most “ spiritual ” among us have little to no understanding of .
It seems somewhat like having the “ faith ” that is so - often talked about by “ spiritual ” people , but instead of having faith in the words of someone you admire or the words of a book , you simply have faith in your own ability to discern the meanings of ever - evolving circumstances , without the blinders of belief standing between you and the reality of existence .
I put the word “ spiritual ” in quotes because I , for one , do n’t feel that it is very spiritual to do what someone else tells you to do simply because you think they know something you do n’t know or you feel that they are some sort of “ guru . ”
The individuals that a “ guru ” tends to attract to his or her belief - induced obedience , are less likely to use their own powers of discernment and live in the way that best suits them as opposed to some “ one - size - fits - all ” guru recommendation .
I have also observed that individuals who subscribe to the dictates of a “ guru ” tend to quickly rush to a judgment of others , without giving them the benefit of the doubt .
Often , their arguments are often filled with fire - and - brimstone explanations for what happens if one does n’t follow their line of thinking , and they tend to exclude themselves from , what might have otherwise been , rich experiences .
Fearful of the possibility that we might actually enjoy something different , something outside of our current paradigm , we return to our beliefs , seeking a response that does not interrupt the supremacy the preferred belief set .
It is sad , when you really sit and think about it , how we fall in and out of these simple traps .
The traps seem to be strewn about in every direction , as we are surely a ritual - enthralled society that has lost its way long ago .
Rituals are belief - based and they are fed by the fear of the unknown , so they reinforce themselves by leaving the “ believer ” in the dark , afraid of change , afraid to venture into the light and challenge these closely - held ties .
Those who are completely enthralled and entranced by ritual are as good as dead .
Though faithful and sincere , their hearts are blind and unable to generate compassion without turning to their dogma .
A resurgence of novelty is needed if we are to break free from these vane cycles and begin seeing things that we figured were not there .

These prosecutors have enormous power : they can wiretap people ’s homes , seize property and put people in jail for life .
They can destroy businesses , and affect the outcomes of elections .
It has always been understood that although they are appointed by a president , usually from his own party , once in office they must operate in a nonpartisan way , and be insulated from outside pressures .
This understanding has badly broken down .
It is now clear that United States attorneys were pressured to act in the interests of the Republican Party , and lost their job if they failed to do so .
The firing offenses of the nine prosecutors who were purged last year were that they would not indict Democrats , they investigated important Republicans , or they would not try to suppress the votes of Democratic - leaning groups with baseless election fraud cases .
The degree of partisanship in the department is shocking .
A study by two professors , Donald Shields of the University of Missouri at St. Louis and John Cragan of Illinois State University , found that the Bush Justice Department has investigated Democratic officeholders and office seekers about four times as often as Republican ones .

Dennis Ross , the former senior American Middle East peace negotiator , says he thinks " there is a risk of war " between Israel and Syria this summer .
In an exclusive telephone interview with Ynetnews before next week 's Conference on the Future of the Jewish People in Jerusalem , Ross said that " nobody has made any decision ( about going to war ) , but the Syrians are positioning themselves for war . "
The ex-State Department official criticized the Bush administration for being " tough rhetorically and soft practically " on Damascus , saying that " we have reached the worst of all worlds .
The Syrians do n't see what they have to lose by not changing their behavior and they do n't see what they would gain by changing their behavior .
" Syria has rearmed Hizbullah to the teeth – there should be a price to pay for that , " Ross insisted , pointing out that the Bush administration had failed to implement its own Syria Accountability Act .
He said the US and Europe should aim to " squeeze the Syrian economy " and use a policy of " sticks before carrots " in their dealings with Damascus .
As far as Israel 's relations with Syria were concerned , Ross said that Jerusalem had " its own ways of communications " with Damascus , and that not talking with Syria only increased the chance of war while " if you talk , then that reduces the chance of war . "
' Fatah has to change '
Ross also warned of the dangers to Israel following Hamas ' takeover of the Gaza Strip .
" I do n't share the view ( of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ) that we have a new opportunity … there should be a new sense of urgency . "
The competition between Fatah and Hamas " is very important .
If Hamas takes over then it ( the Israeli - Palestinian conflict ) becomes a religious conflict .
Israel has a huge stake in the nature of this conflict . "
Fatah will only remain in charge of the West Bank if it changed , said Ross , noting that it had lost the Palestinian Authority elections because it had lost the confidence of the Palestinian people .
" It has to end the image and reality of its corruption …
It has to show it can deliver on a better life for Palestinians and achieve Palestinian national aspirations .
If it does n't , it will lose in the West Bank . "
Ross said the onus was also on Fatah to deliver in terms of fighting terrorism .
" If the security situation does not change , all the fine words will be for nothing .
There has to be coordination between Israel and Fatah , but Fatah has to deliver . "
The former diplomat said he thought the US and Tony Blair , the Quartet 's new Middle East envoy , could help facilitate the strengthening of Palestinian institutions , but stressed " we 're going to have see leadership from Fatah . "
The Bush administration , he said , should be focused on " the 18 months they have left to ensure that Fatah is in a better situation vis - à - vis Hamas . "
Ross also criticized the Bush administration for its passivity during Israel 's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 .
He said Washington should have made it a priority to have tried to coordinate the withdrawal with Fatah , so that it was not just a case of Israel leaving Gaza " and throwing the keys over the fence . "
Slow - motion diplomacy
Ross , the author of the recently published " Statecraft : and How to Restore America 's Standing in the World " , also said that the West had to ratchet up the sanctions against Iran to stop its nuclear program .
" We have slow - motion diplomacy matched against their fast - paced nuclear development , " he said , arguing that Europe was not applying enough economic pressure " to get the attention of the Iranian leadership " .
While he doubted that economic sanctions would deter Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , he said others in the Iranian leadership would take notice and work towards changing the country 's policy .
Conference for the Future of the Jewish People
The chairman of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute , Ross will be in Jerusalem next week for the Conference for the Future of the Jewish People , which the JPPPI has organized .
He said the aim of the conference was " to create a different type of conversation " between Israeli and Diaspora leaders and to identify the priorities that the Jewish world had to face .
A third aim of the conference , he said , was to create an ongoing set of discussions to see how its recommendations could be implemented .
When something bad happened , it ’s not unusual for the party who ’s responsible to find a scapegoat to take the blame .
The convenient scapegoat in Mattel ’s massive toy recalls this summer is obviously the Chinese manufacturers .
They are thousands of miles away and ca n’t defend themselves here in the US amid media frenzy of the safety of Chinese products , among the other issues between the two countries such as the trade imbalance and the value of Chinese currency .
There ’s no excuse to sell substandard , unsafe goods , whether they are for domestic markets or exports , and there are problems with “ Made in China ” products as we all know .
I feel sad every time news like this comes out .
However , it ’s just not right to immediately start finger - pointing before the facts are all in , then makes “ extraordinary apology ” when the damage is already done .
It will take much longer time and more effort to rebuild the reputation than destroying it .
Let ’s see what Thomas A. Debrowski , Mattel ’s executive vice president for worldwide operations , has to say when he was in China ( from AP , Reuters , USA Today , and New York Times ) .
“ And Mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you , the Chinese people , and all of our customers who received the toys , ” Debrowski said . ……
On Friday , Debrowski acknowledged that “ vast majority of those products that were recalled were the result of a design flaw in Mattel ’s design , not through a manufacturing flaw in China ’s manufacturers . ”
Lead - tainted toys accounted for only a small percentage of all toys recalled , he said , adding that : “ We understand and appreciate deeply the issues that this has caused for the reputation of Chinese manufacturers . ”
In a statement issued by the company , Mattel said its lead - related recalls were “ overly inclusive , including toys that may not have had lead in paint in excess of the U.S. standards .
“ The follow - up inspections also confirmed that part of the recalled toys complied with the U.S. standards , ” the statement said .
This does n’t make Mattel look good !
According to a Time magazine story , Mattel recalled a total of 19.6 million toys world - wide .
Of them , 17.4 millions were recalled for reasons not even related to lead paint and the toys were sold as far back as 2002 .
Yet , Mattel decided to mix the recall of toys due to design flaws together with the lead paint toys .
From what I can see , they did that for an obvious reason : they can put the blame solely on Chinese manufactures .
And why does Mattel go back to China and apologize now ?
Li Changjiang , Chinese product safety chief , may have the answer :
“ a large part of your annual profit … comes from your factories in China . ”
That ’s right , Mattel ca n’t afford to lose the factories in China and the revenues generated from toys made in China .
As the Time article pointed out
Mattel needs China just as much as China needs Mattel , and it cannot afford to jeopardize its relationship with the country that produces 65 % of its toys .
Then who should bear the ultimate responsibility of those lead - tainted toys ?
Material suppliers ?
Manufacturers ?
Product designers ?
Importers ?
( My friend Golbguru at Money , Matter , and More Musings also discussed this issue . )
After the first recall , the boss of the Chinese factory which supplied those Mattel toys committed suicide .
Could that life be saved if Mattel did n’t rush to blame the manufacture ?
I just hope that after these “ high profile ” incidents , Chinese manufactures can make their products safe and reliable , not only for international consumers , but for the 1.3 billion people in China as well , so everybody can enjoy them , not simply because they are cheap .
After I posted this entry , another recall for products made in China was issued .
This time , it ’s the cribs under the Simplicity and Graco brands .
The headline at CNN.com reads
My first reaction was “ No , not again . ”
Then after I read the news , I had nothing but questions of the intention of CNN for using such a provoking title .
From its own article ,
Failures in the crib ’s drop side are due to a combination of hardware and design flaws that allow consumers to unintentionally install the drop side upside down .
This installation could weaken the hardware and cause the drop side to detach from the crib , creating a gap that could lead to the entrapment and suffocation of infants .
Does it even have anything to do with “ Made in China ” ?
One of the most influential business books ever written is a 1,200 - page novel published 50 years ago , on Oct. 12 , 1957 .
It is still drawing readers ; it ranks 388th on Amazon.com ’s best - seller list .
( “ Winning , ” by John F. Welch Jr. , at a breezy 384 pages , is No. 1,431 . )
The book is “ Atlas Shrugged , ” Ayn Rand ’s glorification of the right of individuals to live entirely for their own interest .
For years , Rand ’s message was attacked by intellectuals whom her circle labeled “ do - gooders , ” who argued that individuals should also work in the service of others .
Her book was dismissed as an homage to greed .
Gore Vidal described its philosophy as “ nearly perfect in its immorality . ”
But the book attracted a coterie of fans , some of them top corporate executives , who dared not speak of its impact except in private .
When they read the book , often as college students , they now say , it gave form and substance to their inchoate thoughts , showing there is no conflict between private ambition and public benefit .
They ’re evil ; they ’re nasty ; we hate them ; and we ’re still pissed at Sony for bringing them into the limelight .
Rootkits .
Ugly bits of malware code that dig deep into your OS kernel , there to hide and do their nefarious business beneath the radar of your average AV program .
Sony ’s ill - thought out rootkit served to ‘ protect ’ their music CDs from being ripped by customers .
That ’s actually tame compared to what rootkits do nowadays .
They ’re usually in place to hide some real destructive code like a keylogger .
I talked to David Moll , CEO of Webroot , about a year ago about the changing trends in malware .
He mentioned keyloggers being installed as rootkits specifically .
Worse , he explained that keyloggers are now getting smart .
Used to be they ’d just snapshot everything you entered for X number of hours , then zap the info off to the bad guy as an ASCII file .
No longer .
Today ’s keyloggers are smart enough to know when you ’re entering stuff they want to steal .
Moll said these things are often coded to activate only when you ’re hitting either a certain kind of Web site or even just a specific list of Web sites –like your bank ’s Web site , for example .
Only then do they start logging key info .
It ’s a nastier world out there every day .
Fortunately , Grisoft , the guys behind AVG , is trying to help .
These guys put out a free anti-virus program , which has long been one of my favorites when I ’m reviewing a loaner PC .
Now they ’ve got a freebie rootkit detector , too .
It ’s for Windows , detects rootkits and removes them , too .
You can download it here with a 30 - day free commercial license included .
After that , it ’s free for home / non - business users only .
AVG put the thing through a 6 month open beta test , so it should be fairly solid , but I ’d still go easy before trying that removal tool in the wild .
Whether or not the remover is free is n’t the issue–its that rootkits are n’t necessarily coded to any single set of rules and we ’ve already experienced trouble when trying to simple yank some of them .
Best to watch the Web for word on the effects of removing a specific rootkit before taking that risk .
I ’d tell you to check Grisoft ’s ongoing security blog to find out how it works on specific rootkits … but they do n’t do one .
An oversight if you ask me .
Fortunately , there are independent sec info sources you can hit to find out about the effects of a removal tool before actually trying one .
Garza over at InfoWorld ’s Zero - Day usually knows what he ’s talking about , so do the guys at ZoneLabs ( tho they probably wo n’t help with AVG ) , but somebody over at Dark Reading definitely will .

Many of the bodies recovered in Baghdad show signs of torture
They say that 540 corpses - many of them tortured or mutilated - were discovered in the city in June .
The number is still considerably lower than in 2006 , when the monthly total of bodies found at times exceeded 1,000 .
Nearly 30,000 extra US troops were deployed in Baghdad to curb sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis .
Daily average
The discovery of bodies on the streets of Baghdad has been a grim feature of life in the Iraqi capital , the BBC's Mike Sergeant in the Iraqi capital says .
The total number dropped sharply between February and April , after the US military " surge " began , our correspondent says .
But the number of bodies found dumped in the city has risen sharply again in the last two months - to an average of about 20 a day in June , according to the Iraqi police .
Earlier this week , the Iraqi government said that the number of civilians killed across the country fell in June to the lowest level since the Baghdad crackdown began .
It said 1,241 civilians were killed in June - a drop of nearly 40 % compared with 1,951 violent deaths in May .
The US military also claims that civilian fatalities have fallen significantly since the beginning of the year .
However , the Iraqi government figures cannot be verified independently , and many deaths are believed to go unreported , correspondents say .
When Blockbuster bought Movielink in August for $ 6.6 million , we commented that the seven - figure sale price had to be a disappointment for the five movie studios that had launched it , given that their expenditures were in the nine - figure range and they had originally wanted in the neighborhood of $ 50 million .
Thanks to a recent 8 - K filing from Blockbuster , we know know exactly how painful that $ 6.6 million sale price was .
During Movielink 's five - year run , the studios dropped just over $ 148 million on the download service .
In fact , Movielink has been a big money loser throughout its entire existence .
During the first half of 2007 , the company lost $ 10.2 million on revenues of $ 1.9 million .
That 's a slight improvement over the same period in 2006 , when losses were $ 11.6 million on revenues of $ 1.9 million .
Looking back to 2005 , the movie download service lost almost $ 31.2 million on revenues of $ 3.2 million for the whole year .
The company 's financial woes come as little surprise given the stumbles made by MGM , Paramount , Sony , Universal , and Warner Brothers — the studios that launched Movielink — since its launch .
When the service first launched in 2002 , we noted its limited selection ( 200 movies ) , insane restrictions ( a 24 - hour window to watch movies once started ) , and technological lock - in ( Windows and Internet Explorer only ) .
Unfortunately , little changed over the next few years .
The DRM restrictions became slightly less draconian , but for years , subscribers were required to watch their rentals on a PC due to the lack of a DVD - burning option .
In 2006 , Movielink announced a download - and - burn service , but even that has taken a long time to arrive .
In the meantime , Netflix managed to get its own streaming service up and running early this year , while Amazon made its Unbox download service available to TiVo owners .
Those moves put more pressure on Blockbuster to make a play for some online video action , culminating in its purchase of Movielink .
Blockbuster has some big plans for the unpopular service .
The video rental chain wants to use Movielink as a distribution platform for all kinds of content , including that targeted at mobile devices .
But with Blockbuster 's independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers saying that Movielink 's track record raises " substantial doubt about the Company 's ability to continue as a going concern , " Blockbuster 's plans for the service may never come to fruition , especially if it has to keep pumping the kind of money into the venture as the studios did .
Enlarge By George Walker IV , The Tennesseean Supporter Cheryl Scott campaigns recently for Ron Paul at an intersection in Nashville .
She says Paul is " really one of us .
He does n't seem like a politician . "
USA TODAY INTERACTIVE QUIZ USA TODAY INTERACTIVE QUIZ Enlarge By Saul Loeb , AFP / Getty Images Ron Paul 's candidacy is " no laughing matter , " said David Ali , a Republican strategist and Internet expert .
WASHINGTON 
For several sweltering days in August , Cheryl Scott and several other Nashville residents stood on downtown overpasses bearing eight - foot - long signs that urged rush - hour drivers to " Google Ron Paul . "
Scott 's campaign is one measure of the Internet - driven support Paul has sparked in his long - shot bid for the presidency .
He has never polled above 4 % in national surveys , according to Jeffrey Jones , managing editor of the Gallup Poll .
Yet the Republican Texas congressman 's supporters helped him collect $ 5 million over the summer .
While that amount is dwarfed by the more than $ 10 million Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani each raised in the last three months , Paul 's money is significant .
It 's five times the cash collected by former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who finished second in Iowa 's GOP straw poll , an early sign of organizational strength .
Paul also has more money in the bank than Arizona Sen .
John McCain , who is third in national polls .
" Ron Paul is no laughing matter .
He 's tapping into a side of the Republican Party that 's never had its issues addressed , " said David All , a GOP strategist and Internet expert .
" And he 's doing it by running a truly Web 2.0 campaign . "
Paul 's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton said his Internet popularity demonstrates that his message is resonating .
Paul is the only GOP candidate who wants to immediately withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq .
" These national polls are still about name recognition , and that 's an obstacle we have to overcome , " Benton said .
A former Libertarian Party candidate for president , Paul is not the only contender this year who has used technology to generate interest and money for the 2008 race .
Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton , for instance , drew more than 500,000 viewers to her website in a single day in June with an online spoof of The Sopranos .
Romney this week launched his own social networking tool , dubbed the " Team Mitt Action Center , " that allows supporters to raise money online and participate in Web chats with top campaign aides .
Overall , Democrats have collected three times as much cash online as their GOP counterparts during the first six months of the year , according to TechPresident , which tracks candidates ' Internet efforts .
Still , Internet experts compare Paul to Democrat Howard Dean , who raised $ 30 million online for the 2004 presidential primaries .
They say Paul has used the Internet to generate interest and mobilize supporters on the ground better than any other Republican candidate in the race .
" He is the heir to the Howard Dean campaign in recognizing that individual donors talking to one another and building websites and blogging can do more for a campaign that any campaign staffer sitting in an office , " said Andrew Rasiej , a former Dean adviser and TechPresident co-founder .
Paul tops the GOP field in the number of supporters on the social networking sites , MySpace and Facebook .
He also leads all presidential candidates in the number of times his videos have been viewed on YouTube , the popular video - sharing site .
As of late Wednesday afternoon , Paul had 4.5 million views , according to TechPresident and TubeMogul.com , which tracks online video traffic .
The leading Democrat was Illinois Sen. Barack Obama with 3.6 million views .
Scott , a Nashville dentist , runs one of nearly 1,000 groups dedicated to Paul on Meetup.com , a site that links people who share interests .
Her 400 - member group helped organize a rally last Saturday in Nashville , which she said drew about 1,600 people to hear Paul speak .
Scott , who has contributed $ 2,300 to Paul , launched the group last May to help counter a petition drive by Michigan GOP Chairman Saul Anuzis to bar Paul from Republican debates .
" He 's really one of us , " she said .
" He does n't seem like a politician . "
Anuzis criticized Paul for saying in a May 15 debate that U.S. policy in the Middle East was a reason for the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Paul continues to participate in the debates , including the one Tuesday in Dearborn , Mich .
For all of his Internet savvy , Paul lags behind Giuliani , Romney , McCain and Fred Thompson in money and in the polls .
Even so , Bruce Buchanan , an expert on presidential politics at the University of Texas at Austin , said Paul has achieved an important goal :
He 's collected the cash he needs to maintain a presence in the contest .
" It 's pretty clear to him and to everybody else that he 's unlikely to win the presidency , but he now has enough money to hang around to continue to articulate his position and provide a place for the disaffected to go , " Buchanan said .
Benton said the congressman is working on his first television ad , which will run in New Hampshire , home to the first 2008 primary .
Radio ads also are planned for at least six early voting states .
By comparison , Romney has already spent $ 8 million on TV advertising — the most of any GOP or Democratic candidate .
" We 're lean and efficient .
We do n't spend money on focus groups or polls to tell us what language to use , " Benton said .
" He 's going to talk about what he wants to talk about . "

Office Collar has been designed in response to the open - plan .
The collars act as isolators , narrowing the field of vision , therefore enabling their wearer to focus on the tasks in front of them , The 15 individual hand made , white leather masks are to be worn on the head , the variation between each model explores the different actions undertaken whilst working and thinking .
Office Collar Explained
How did you decide to start this project ?
The project began as a direct response to the open - plan office environment .
I was given the opportunity to design an installation for an architecture office in Milan , Italy Instead of creating an inanimate object that could sit on d plinth , I wanted to use the workers of the office to express my thoughts on working conditions , and the connection that architecture and garment have on the individual .
Where did your inspiration come from ?
After doing my first degree in architecture , I saw this as an opportunity to reassess what architecture could be , on the more local scale of the body .
I had been looking at how the body could begin carrying or generating its own , more immediate architectural language and space .
Also , with the growing addition of body add - ons we have with mp3 players , headphones , even palm pilots , I saw it as a natural progression to wear something on your body .
The aesthetic design of the collar came through an exploration process , which found me researching both past and future concepts of attire .
This leads me to look upon works as wide as 16th Century painter Johannes Vermeer ( Girl With the Pearl Earring ) , where you would find Dutch women wearing white head cloths for their daily work ; or the photographs of Edward Burtynsky ’s Manufactured Landscapes .
in which he observes the daily working uniforms of those in Asia .
Who do you see wearing it ?
see the Collars as having two If we look at it in terms of pure functionality , we may be lead to miss the questions it evokes about our daily working life , isolation , and the movement from the group to the individual pods we surround ourselves with .
In this way it is much more of a commentary on current working , However , having worked with one myself , and having tested them with my colleagues , it ca n’t be denied that they do aid concentration ; by simply blinkering its wearer , the focus is far easier attained .
However , the final destination of the Collar will be as much dependant upon how society Looking at some of the uniforms of factory workers , or even training flight pilots , such an instrument would not be so alien .
Are they in production yet ?
There are 15 variations of these collars , all of which I have personally handmade out of leather .
So far only this one set exists , which were made for the office workers and their specific duties
There are no plans to put them into mass production , but they can be ordered on request from me through contact via my website , However , more than dwelling upon this as the only final product , I see this as the first step in a series of objects and explorations that I will undertake , surrounding working attire and the working environment as a hole .
Scientists have found a virus associated with the destruction of a large fraction of American commercial bee colonies , but they have not been able to prove that it is the cause of the mysterious disease that has wreaked havoc on the bee industry .
The virus , Israeli acute paralysis , may have been introduced by bees from Australia whose importation was first permitted in 2004 , about the same time that the disease , Colony Collapse Disorder , or CCD , began appearing in the United States .
Australian bees do not suffer from the disorder , leading researchers to speculate that the virus interacts with chemicals in the environment or with another infectious agent , such as the varroa mite , which is not common in Australia .
Experiments are underway to determine which combination of virus and chemical or infectious agent might cause the disease , an answer that may come this year .
Researchers are also examining archived bee specimens to determine whether the virus was present before 2004 .

“ Our results indicate that [ the virus ] is a significant marker ” for the disorder , said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University ’s Mailman School of Public Health , a co-author of the report published online Thursday by the journal Science .
“ The next step is to ascertain whether [ the virus ] , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce [ the disorder ] in healthy bees . ”
Entomologist May Berenbaum of the University of Illinois said the find was “ compelling . ”
But researchers from the Army ’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Maryland cautioned that they had unpublished results in which the Israeli virus had been found in colonies without the disorder .
Although the United States has experienced other bee die - offs , the latest episode has been one of the worst , affecting about 23 % of beekeepers .
Typically , 50 % to 90 % of a keeper ’s colonies are affected as worker bees fail to return to their hives , leaving the queen with a handful of newborns .

Agricultural experts view the deaths with alarm because bees are required to pollinate about a third of the nation ’s food crops , including almonds , cherries , pears , blueberries , strawberries and pumpkins .
The number of bee colonies in the country is about 2.5 million , half as many as in the 1940s and ‘ 50s .
“ We do n’t have a great deal of buffer ” for dealing with bee losses , said entomologist Diana Cox -Foster of Pennsylvania State University .
In May , scientists from across the country formed a working group led by Cox - Foster and entomologist Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track down the cause of the deaths .

They enlisted virologist Lipkin to look for pathogens infecting the sick bees , using samples from four sick colonies from different regions of the United States and healthy colonies from Hawaii and Pennsylvania .
Lipkin and his colleagues ground up the bees , extracted RNA , sequenced it and matched the non-honeybee sequences to known databases .
The results surprised everyone .
All of the bees -- both healthy and sick -- had a set of eight distinctive bacteria “ that have not been found in any other environment or host , ” said co-author Nancy A. Moran of the University of Arizona .
“ They are all unnamed species about which we know very little .
They probably perform essential functions in bees , providing essential nutrients or contributing defenses against pathogens . ”
Similarly , there was “ a remarkably high viral burden in bee populations , both those with [ the disorder ] and those without it , ” said co-author Edward C. Holmes of Pennsylvania State University .
“ There were seven different viruses , but only one was consistently found with [ the disorder ] . ”
Israeli acute paralysis virus was found in all specimens with the disorder but in neither of the healthy specimens .
It was also present in some bees imported from Australia and in two of four samples of royal jelly imported from China .
The imported jelly is normally used as a cosmetic , but some beekeepers feed it to larvae to produce queens .
All of the infected colonies , moreover , had bees from Australia or were housed close to bees from that country .

U.S. officials were considering reinstating the ban on bees from Australia , Pettis said , but it may be too late to limit the damage already done .
Israeli acute paralysis virus was discovered in 2002 in dead bees from Israeli colonies by virologist Ilan Sela of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
In experiments reported this summer , Sela found that 98 % of the bees that were injected with the virus died within days .
The symptoms in the Israeli bees -- shivering wings , paralysis and death -- were different from those exhibited by American bees .
But Holmes speculated that the virus might have undergone slight genetic changes that had altered its pathogenicity .
“ We know from other viruses that very small genetic changes can turn a benign virus into a very virulent one , ” he said .
Or it may be that the symptoms are different in bees whose immune systems are stressed by the varroa mite or by being trucked from farm to farm during the growing season .

The finding does offer one ray of hope .
Sela reported that about 30 % of bees he studied in Israel had incorporated the viral genome into their genetic blueprint and had become resistant to the virus .
If the virus is shown to be the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder , it may be possible to replace current bee colonies with hives of resistant specimens .

6 Keys to Understanding Modern CSS - based Layouts
Much of CSS is pretty straightforward and , I suspect , quite easy for most people to grasp .
There 's font styles , margin , padding , color and what not .
But there 's a wall that people will run into ... that point where a number of key elements need to come together to create a solid CSS - based layout that is consistent cross - browser .
These are the six things that will help people get over the hump .
Box Model
At the very core of it , is an understanding of the box model within CSS .
Sure , you may know your margin and padding but what happens when elements start to interact with each other .
Suddenly things that look good in one browser go all to hell in the other .
Consistently in working with the box model comes from understanding the difference between quirks mode and strict mode .
It 's also a good idea to know how to hack it up for older browsers .
Floated Columns
While absolute positioning was one of the first approaches that people took when attempting to replace table - based layouts , it was floating content that opened the doors of possibility .
Along with learning how to float , you must also learn how to clear floats so that content that follows or backgrounds will appear correctly .
Sizing Using Ems
There are two different issues at play here when it comes to sizing with ems : fonts and layouts .
With fonts , Internet Explorer 6 and lower do n't allow you to resize the text when specified using pixels ( px ) .
Those with vision issues may wish to set their font size larger in order to more readily read what you 've written .
Specifying your font sizes using ems has proven to be the popular approach to this problem .
The importance of sizing text using ems is waning as users move on to better browsers .
Sizing layouts with ems can also offer up a whole other avenue of flexibility .
When playing with text size , it can often throw an entire design out of whack .
Styling elements using ems allow the containers of content to grow along with the text , maintaining the consistency of the design .
Image Replacement
Boring text elements dont ' excite us .
We want to use lots of graphical flair along with gradients and glass effects .
And we want to use custom fonts ; fonts that browsers just can't offer us yet .
Image replacement techniques allow us to replace the existing content - rich and SEO - friendly text with stylish images or Flash files with embedded fonts .
Floated Navigation
If you 've mastered floating columns , the other tricky piece to the puzzle and one that is heavily used , is floated navigation .
The web - standards - lovin ' folk love their unordered lists of navigation and there are a myriad of ways to style them up .
Sprites
Like video games of yore , packing multiple images into one single image has become a popular technique to solve a couple problems .
The first is CSS - based rollovers .
More recently , it 's been proven to be advantageous to combine multiple images — in particular background images used in image replacement techniques — into a single file .
This reduces the number of requests your browser has to make , improving the time required to download all files from your server .
What do you got ?
Of course , there 's always more to learn and if you think there 's a technique that you think is especially important for the beginner , be sure to add it to the comments .

And then there 's the Kleiman Strategyl , which makes much more sense than my suggestion that Dodd filibuster Levin - Reed .
So what will the Dems do ?
We 're getting close to Magic Time for the Dems , right ?
Was n't October when they promised us they would attack again after falling back so spectacularly in the spring ?
Do n't worry , they said , there are authorization bills to pass .
We 're keeping our powder dry !
Well , now 's their big chance .
Or is this their big chance to string us along another six months while they pretend to want the war to end before the 2008 elections ?
Avedon had the Dems ' strategy nailed back in August when she talked about their aversion to impeachment :
As much as some Broderesque types would like to convince us that all those investigations , as well as the desire for impeachment , are mere partisanship , it is really Pelosi 's fears for the party 's fortunes in 2008 that have kept the lid on those investigations going where they should lead .
So yes , at long last , we have an example of the Democrats being calculatedly partisan - in their refusal to begin the impeachment of George Walker Bush and Richard Bruce Cheney .
And in choosing to continue this occupation .
It 's a good cop / bad cop scam and in my big book of judgment , the good cop is by far the eviler of the two because it's his job to make us hold out unwarranted hope .
It 's exactly that hope that keeps us from acting in our own best interest - and , not for nothing , in the best interest of our country and the military families who defend it .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Cindy Sheehan , who became a leading anti-war activist after her son died in Iraq , said on Monday she will run against House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi if the Democratic leader fails to seek the ouster of President George W. Bush within the next two weeks .

The 49 - year - old , whose soldier son Casey died in combat in Iraq in 2004 , told Reuters she would run for Pelosi ’s house seat in 2008 if the California Democrat fails to endorse impeachment proceedings against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney by July 23 .
That is the date when Sheehan and a group of supporters are due to arrive in Washington as part of a cross-country caravan and walking trip for humanity , set to begin from Bush ’s hometown of Crawford , Texas , on Tuesday .
“ If Nancy Pelosi does n’t support articles of impeachment ... by the time we get there , then I will announce my candidacy against her , ” she said in a telephone interview from Crawford .
Sheehan said Bush and Cheney should be impeached for lying to the American people about Iraq and anti-terrorism policies that she believes violate U.S. law and international treaties banning torture .
“ In November ‘ 06 , Americans went to the polls to vote for change and what we ’ve gotten in the last six months since the Democrats have been in control of Congress is more politics as usual , ” she said .
Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said in a statement that the Democratic leader is focused on ending the war .
“ She believes that the best way to support our troops in Iraq is to bring them home safely and soon , ” the statement said .
Sheehan , who has never held public office , is also encouraging others to challenge Democratic incumbents .
Sheehan gained prominence as an anti-war activist in 2005 when , as the mother of a dead soldier , she said she wanted to meet with Bush as he vacationed at his ranch in Crawford .
She announced in May that she would end her public role in the anti-war movement , saying she had reached the conclusion that her son “ did indeed die for nothing ” and was “ killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think . ”
A California resident , Sheehan said she would run as an independent in Pelosi ’s northern California congressional district , which is centered in San Francisco .
A glorious blend of forces came together to save Gordon Hendrickson ’s life : smart doctoring , luck , kindness , and his own wisdom and abundant grit .
Only his insurance company tried to stand in the way .
Five years ago , when Mr. Hendrickson was 66 , routine blood work found something amiss with his liver .
One test led to another , and then to an awful diagnosis : pancreatic cancer , one of the deadliest kinds .
His doctors thought he was among the lucky few with pancreatic cancer found early enough to be cured by surgery .
But they warned him not to have the surgery in his home city , Albuquerque .
They said the operation he needed , a Whipple procedure , was so risky and complicated that it should be done only by a surgeon who performed it often and at a hospital with many similar cases .
But neither was available locally .
Albuquerque ’s population was less than half a million , and the entire state of New Mexico had fewer than two million people , not enough to give local surgeons much practice with a relatively uncommon operation .
Currently the most - emailed New York Times article is ’omg my mom joined Facebook !!’
The article is a humorous recount of a Mom who , feeling disconnected from her daughter , joins Facebook ( now open to everyone ) only to find that her daughter is n’t exactly happy with her decision ’
The article highlights an issue that became apparent to me tonight while talking with my youngest sister .
A college senior who has been on with Facebook from its very beginnings , my sister shocked me tonight by announcing that she was DONE with Facebook and plans to delete her profile .
’ It sucks now ’ was her exact statement .
What I realized tonight is that Facebook has three worlds of users ’â€œ its core community of college students who made it popular , the VCs and tech people who love Facebook from a technology and investment perspective and then ’everybody else . ’
The problem is that the core users like my sister do n’t really care for all the new feeds , applications and 24/7 updates .
We as the tech / investment community have been singing the praises of new applications , such as iLike with 486,000 + users .
Guess what , that ’s just a tiny fraction of the total Facebook community .
Could be that the people adding these applications are not core users , but in fact the ’ everyone elses ’ who core users despise ?
YES !
Reality check .
College students detest the ’everyone else crowd . ’
They resent people like their parents invading their turf and who can blame them ?
Here we are thinking that Facebook is the next Google because people never have to leave their profile pages ’
VCs are excited because maybe Facebook is the next big IPO .
The new F8 platform could be the key to social media monetization .
And , now that Facebook is ’ open to all ’ membership growth will be through the roof !
MySpace lookout !
Right ?….
Well guess what ?
When you loose the core , the people who made you famous , it ’s not a good sign .
Facebook became popular because it was simple and its community was engaged with each other .
Increasingly teh emphasis on Facebook is shifting away from interaction among people , to interaction with widgets and advertising and outsiders .
I think Facebook ought to bear in mind that young people are fickle and an account can be deleted much faster than it can be created .
Staff at Cancun 's five - star Hotel Coral Beach appear to have assumed this was another street vendor or beggar , so without asking questions they ordered her to leave .
Except the woman was Rigoberta Menchú , the Nobel peace prizewinner , Unesco goodwill ambassador , Guatemalan presidential candidate and figurehead for indigenous rights .
The attempted eviction , an example of discrimination against indigenous people common in central and south America , backfired when other guests recognised Ms Menchú and interceded on her behalf .
The human rights activist was in the Mexican coastal resort at the request of President Felipe Calderón to participate in a conference on drinking water and sanitation and was due to give interviews at the hotel .
David Romero , a journalist and newsreader who was due to interview her for state radio Quintana Roo , told local media that hotel security tried to eject Ms Menchú from the lobby .
They relented when told who she was .
It was said not to be the first time a hotel has tried to throw her out .
Ms Menchú , 48 , was awarded the 1992 Nobel peace prize for protesting against human rights abuses during Guatemala 's brutal civil war .
Commentators noted the irony of upmarket resorts discriminating against real Maya while trying to attract tourists with fake Mayan architecture and spectacles .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran rejected on Wednesday U.S. accusations it was fomenting instability in Iraq , a day after President George W. Bush said Tehran ’s atomic ambitions could put the Middle East “ under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . ”
Iran 's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini speaks to journalists during a news conference in Tehran February 12 , 2007 .
Iran rejected on Wednesday accusations by U.S. President George W. Bush that Tehran was fomenting instability in Iraq , and called on Washington to change its policies in the region .

The two old foes are embroiled in a standoff over Iran ’s disputed nuclear program , which the West suspects is aimed at developing weapons but the Islamic state says is peaceful .
They also blame each other for the bloodshed in Iraq .
In a further sign of growing tension , U.S. forces in Iraq said they had detained eight Iranians overnight and seized a suitcase full of money from their central Baghdad hotel but later freed them after consultations with the Iraqi government .
Iran ’s Foreign Ministry reacted angrily to the incident in the Iraqi capital , summoning the Swiss charge d’affaires to voice “ harsh objections , ” Iranian state television said .
A media adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said the men had been members of an Iranian delegation invited to Iraq by the Ministry of Electricity to discuss construction of a new power plant .
The United States severed ties with Iran shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution and the Swiss embassy represents its interests in the country .
U.S. officials have often accused Iran of supplying weapons to insurgents in Iraq , but in a speech on Tuesday Bush hardened his stance by lumping Tehran and al Qaeda together .
“ Iran has long been a source of trouble in the region .
It is the world ’s leading state sponsor of terrorism , ” Bush said .
“ And Iran ’s active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust , ” he told a gathering of veterans in Reno , Nevada .
Bush ’s verbal attack on Iran came just hours after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the power of the United States was rapidly collapsing in Iraq and that Tehran was ready to step in to help fill the vacuum .
U.S. PATH “ NOT FRUITFUL ”
With 164,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and patience growing thin in the Democratic - controlled U.S. Congress and the American public , Bush has been defending his Iraq war strategy .
A report by the U.S. commander on the ground in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , due by September 15 , could trigger a change in Iraq policy .
Bush warned that extremist forces would be emboldened if the United States were driven out of the region , leaving Iran to pursue a nuclear weapon and set off an arms race .
He said U.S. forces had recently seized Iran - made rockets and that attacks on American bases and troops in Iraq with Iran - supplied weapons had increased in the past few months .
“ Iran ’s actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
And that is why the United States is rallying friends and allies around the world to isolate the regime , to impose economic sanctions .
We will confront this danger before it is too late . ”
He added : “ I have authorized our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran ’s murderous activities . ”
The U.N. Security Council has imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran since December over its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear work and Washington has made clear it will be pushing for more punitive measures against Tehran .
Asked about the U.S. accusations , the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters : “ They are not true . ”
Spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini did not specifically comment on Bush ’s remarks on the nuclear issue , but Iran has repeatedly said its activities are solely aimed at generating electricity .
Hosseini said the U.S. path was neither “ useful or fruitful ” , adding : “ It is better for him ( Bush ) to change his point of view and political decisions . ”
As with all matters of investment , everything is clear in hindsight .
Had you bought gold mutual funds earlier this year , they might have appreciated more than 100 percent .
Gold has risen $ 60 since March 2001 to the latest spot price of $ 326 .
Why was n’t it obvious ?
The Fed has been inflating the dollar as never before , driving interest rates down to absurdly low levels , even as the federal government has been pushing a mercantile trade policy , and New York City , the hub of the world economy , continues to be threatened by terrorism .
The government is failing to prevent more successful attacks by not backing down from foreign policy disasters and by not allowing planes to arm themselves .
These are all conditions that make gold particularly attractive .
Or perhaps it is not so obvious why this is true .
It ’s been three decades since the dollar ’s tie to gold was completely severed , to the hosannas of mainstream economists .
There is no stash of gold held by the Fed or the Treasury that backs our currency system .
The government owns gold but not as a monetary asset .
It owns it the same way it owns national parks and fighter planes .
It ’s just another asset the government keeps to itself .
The dollar , and all our money , is nothing more and nothing less than what it looks like : a cut piece of linen paper with fancy printing on it .
You can exchange it for other currency at a fixed rate and for any good or service at a flexible rate .
But there is no established exchange rate between the dollar and gold , either at home or internationally .
The supply of money is not limited by the amount of gold .
Gold is just another good for which the dollar can be exchanged , and in that sense is legally no different from a gallon of milk , a tank of gas , or an hour of babysitting services .
Why , then , do people turn to gold in times like these ?
What is gold used for ?
Yes , there are industrial uses and there are consumer uses in jewelry and the like .
But recessions and inflations do n’t cause people to want to wear more jewelry or stock up on industrial metal .
The investor demand ultimately reflects consumer demand for gold .
But that still leaves us with the question of why the consumer demand exists in the first place .
Why gold and not sugar or wheat or something else ?
There is no getting away from it : investor markets have memories of the days when gold was money .
In fact , in the whole history of civilization , gold has served as the basic money of all people wherever it ’s been available .
Other precious metals have been valued and coined , but gold always emerged on top in the great competition for what constitutes the most valuable commodity of all .
There is nothing intrinsic about gold that makes it money .
It has certain properties that lend itself to monetary use , like portability , divisibility , scarcity , durability , and uniformity .
But these are just descriptors of certain qualities of the metal , not explanations as to why it became money .
Gold became money for only one reason : because that ’s what the markets chose .
Why is n’t gold money now ?
Because governments destroyed the gold standard .
Why ?
Because they regarded it as too inflexible .
To be sure , monetary inflexibility is the friend of free markets .
Without the ability to create money out of nothing , governments tend to run tight financial ships .
Banks are more careful about the lending when they ca n’t rely on a lender of last resort with access to a money - creation machine like the Fed .
A fixed money stock means that overall prices are generally more stable .
The problems of inflation and business cycles disappear entirely .
Under the gold standard , in fact , increased market productivity causes prices to generally decline over time as the purchasing power of money increases .
In 1967 , Alan Greenspan once wrote an article called Gold and Economic Freedom .
He wrote that :
An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions .
They seem to sense — perhaps more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez - faire — that gold and economic freedom are inseparable , that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez - faire and that each implies and requires the other …
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists ’ tirades against gold .
Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth .
Gold stands in the way of this insidious process .
It stands as a protector of property rights .
He was right .
Gold and freedom go together .
Gold money is both the result of freedom and its leading protector .
When money is as good as gold , the government cannot manipulate the supply for its own purposes .
Just as the rule of law puts limits on the despotic use of police power , a gold standard puts extreme limits on the government ’s ability to spend , borrow , and otherwise create crazy unworkable programs .
It is forced to raise its revenue through taxation , not inflation , and generally keep its house in order .
Without the gold standard , government is free to work with the Fed to inflate the currency without limit .
Even in our own times , we ’ve seen governments do that and thereby spread mass misery .
Now , all governments are stupid but not all are so stupid as to pull stunts like this .
Most of the time , governments are pleased to inflate their currencies so long as they do n’t have to pay the price in the form of mass bankruptcies , falling exchange rates , and inflation .
In the real world , of course , there is a lag time between cause and effect .
The Fed has been inflating the currency at very high levels for longer than a year .
The consequences of this disastrous policy are showing up only recently in the form of a falling dollar and higher gold prices .
And so what does the Fed do ?
It is pulling back now .
For the first time in nearly ten years , some measures of money ( M2 and MZM ) are showing a falling money stock , which is likely to prompt a second dip in the continuing recession .
Greenspan now finds himself on the horns of a very serious dilemma .
If he continues to pull back on money , the economy could tip into a serious recession .
This is especially a danger given rising protectionism , which mirrors the events of the early 1930s .
On the other hand , a continuation of the loose policy he has pursued for a year endangers the value of the dollar overseas .
How much easier matters were when we did n’t have to rely on the wisdom of exalted monetary central planners like Greenspan .
Under the gold standard , the supply of money regulated itself .
The government kept within limits .
Banks were more cautious .
Savings were high because credit was tight and saving was rewarded .
This approach to economics is the foundation of a sustainable prosperity .
We do n’t have that system now for the country or the world , but individuals are showing their preferences once again .
By driving up the price of gold , prompting gold producers to become profitable again , the people are expressing their lack of confidence in their leaders .
They have decided to protect themselves and not trust the state .
That is the hidden message behind the new luster of gold .
Is a gold standard feasible again ?
Of course .
The dollar could be redefined in terms of gold .
Interest rates would reflect the real supply and demand for credit .
We could shut down the Fed and we would never need to worry again what the chairman of the Fed wanted .
There was a time when Greenspan was nostalgic for such a system .
Investors of the world have come to embrace this view even as Greenspan has completely abandoned it .
What keeps the gold standard from becoming a reality again is the love of big government and war .
If we ever fall in love with freedom again , the gold standard will once more become a hot issue in public debate .

Companies like Google scan their e-mail users ’ in - boxes to deliver ads related to those messages .
Will people be as willing to let a company listen in on their phone conversations to do the same ?
Pudding Media , a start - up based in San Jose , Calif. , is introducing an Internet phone service today that will be supported by advertising related to what people are talking about in their calls .
The Web - based phone service is similar to Skype ’s online service — consumers plug a headset and a microphone into their computers , dial any phone number and chat away .
But unlike Internet phone services that charge by the length of the calls , Pudding Media offers calling without any toll charges .
The trade - off is that Pudding Media is eavesdropping on phone calls in order to display ads on the screen that are related to the conversation .
Voice recognition software monitors the calls , selects ads based on what it hears and pushes the ads to the subscriber ’s computer screen while he or she is still talking .
A conversation about movies , for example , will elicit movie reviews and ads for new films that the caller will see during the conversation .
Pudding Media is working on a way to e-mail the ads and other content to the person on the other end of the call , or to show it on that person ’s cellphone screen .
David Neumark of UC Irvine , and Judith Hellerstein and Melissa McInerney of Maryland find that “ racial mismatch ” affects low - skill employment [ " Spatial Mismatch or Racial Mismatch ? , " NBER W1361 ] :
Race , not space , key to lower black male employment rate , Today@UCI :
A new study finds that in areas where low - skilled jobs are predominantly held by whites , black men who live nearby are less likely to get hired .
“ The problem is not lack of jobs at appropriate skill levels where blacks live , but lack of jobs available to blacks , ” said UC Irvine economist David Neumark , co-author of the study .
For years , it ’s been widely accepted that space is a primary barrier to employment – meaning there are not enough low - skilled jobs where less - skilled black workers live .
But by analyzing the employment , education level and location of more than 533,000 black males across the United States , Neumark and his colleagues found that the issue is not simply whether jobs are available nearby , but whether they are available to one ’s own race .
“ It ’s an exaggeration to say blacks do n’t live where the jobs are , ” said Neumark .
“ In reality , there are many jobs held by non -blacks in areas where blacks live – including at lower education levels . ”
And the greater the proportion of those jobs that are held by whites , the lower the chance the local blacks will get hired into those jobs .
“ The jobs simply are not available to their race , ” Neumark added .
The study does not answer the question of why this happens , but the researchers suggest discrimination or lack of labor market networks are likely causes .
Jobs for low - skilled workers are often advertised informally through word of mouth in social networks , such as among friends or church members , Neumark explained .
In many communities , this means that blacks may not have good information about job openings in businesses employing mainly whites .
Neumark and his colleagues call this effect “ racial mismatch , ” a new spin on the term “ spatial mismatch , ” which has been used to describe the lack of the right jobs in the right place .
Recently , programs like “ Wheels to Work ” and “ Moving to Opportunity ” have emphasized getting the workforce to the appropriate jobs by providing transportation or relocation .
But when Neumark and his colleagues ran a simulation based on their data , they found that eliminating location differences between blacks and whites would only close the racial employment gap for low - skilled individuals by 10 to 15 percent .
“ That ’s not a significant improvement in employment , ” Neumark said .
“ Policies focused on getting people to the jobs miss the bigger barriers facing low - skilled blacks . ”
‘ We ’re confusing 1950s culture with the teaching of Scripture ’
I can appreciate that much of modern feminism is about women have the power to choose , but choosing a life short of equality strikes me as troubling .
The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary , for example , is offering courses on homemaking — in which women are taught that “ men make decisions ; women make dinner . ”
This fall , the internationally known seminary — a century - old training ground for Southern Baptists — began reinforcing those traditional gender roles with college classes in homemaking .
The academic program , open only to women , includes lectures on laundering stubborn stains and a lab in baking chocolate - chip cookies .
Philosophical courses such as “ Biblical Model for the Home and Family ” teach that God expects wives to graciously submit to their husbands ’ leadership .
A model house , to be completed by next fall , will allow women to get credit toward bachelor ’s degrees by learning how to set tables , sew buttons and sustain lively dinnertime conversation .
It all sounds wonderful to sophomore Emily Felts , 19 , who signed up as soon as she arrived on campus this fall .
Several relatives have told Felts that she ’s selling herself short .
They want her to become a lawyer , and she agrees she ’d make a good one .
But that ’s not what she wants to do with her life … .
“ My created purpose as a woman is to be a helper , ” Felts said firmly .
“ This is a college education that I can use . ”
That ’s one small step for a woman ; one giant leap backwards for modern gender roles and family structure .
More moderate Southern Baptists disagree , and counter with their own biblical references .
When Jesus dined at the home of two sisters , he praised Mary , who spent the evening studying his teachings , above Martha , who did chores .
Elsewhere in the New Testament , the Apostle Paul writes that “ there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ . ”
“ We ’re confusing 1950s culture with the teaching of Scripture , ” said Wade Burleson , a Southern Baptist pastor in Oklahoma .
“ I nowhere see where the Lord Jesus places limitations on the role of women in our culture . ”
Alas , students who sign up for the courses do n’t see it that way .
Home - schooled by her mother , Felts is poised , articulate and unfailingly polite ; she calls her elders “ ma’am ” and expresses surprise with a genteel “ goodness ! ”
She commutes to college from her family ’s Fort Worth home , so she has plenty of opportunity to work on her helper skills .
She ’s sewing a pink - and - brown polka - dot dress for herself .
She dusts , mops and vacuums .
She often makes dinner for her family : Noodles from scratch , or quiche with a homemade crust .
Does she enjoy these tasks ?
Except for vacuuming , absolutely , Felts said .
And if she did n’t ?
“ It really does n’t matter what I think , ” Felts said .
“ It matters what the Bible says . ”
Wow .
Apple just slapped NBC down hard .
Responding to reports NBC was pulling out of the iTunes Store , Apple announced that it was prematurely canceling their partnership —
Because NBC wanted $ 5 per episode of its shows !
Apple® today announced that it will not be selling NBC television shows for the upcoming television season on its online iTunes® Store ( www.itunes.com).
The move follows NBC ’s decision to not renew its agreement with iTunes after Apple declined to pay more than double the wholesale price for each NBC TV episode , which would have resulted in the retail price to consumers increasing to $ 4.99 per episode from the current $ 1.99 .
ABC , CBS , FOX and The CW , along with more than 50 cable networks , are signed up to sell TV shows from their upcoming season on iTunes at $ 1.99 per episode .
Incredible .
NBC has benefited from iTunes more than anyone else , and they ’re throwing out crazy price increases .
I mean , that would have made Friday Night Lights Season 1 cost $ 110 !
NBC is selling the DVD for less than $ 20 brand - new with more special features !
If this is any indication of Hulu ’s pricing scheme , it ’s screwed out of the gate .

A senior official of Indian capital Delhi died today after he suffered severe head injuries while trying to escape from a group of aggressive monkeys , officials said .
Delhi deputy mayor SS Bajwa , 52 , a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , was reading a newspaper on his terrace on Friday when he was attacked by the monkeys , party official Harsh Vardhan said .
Bajwa fell from the terrace while trying to escape his attackers .
OCTOBER 8-- An Alabama minister who died in June of " accidental mechanical asphyxia " was found hogtied and wearing two complete wet suits , including a face mask , diving gloves and slippers , rubberized underwear , and a head mask , according to an autopsy report .
Investigators determined that Rev. Gary Aldridge 's death was not caused by foul play and that the 51 - year - old pastor of Montgomery 's Thorington Road Baptist Church was alone in his home at the time he died ( while apparently in the midst of some autoerotic undertaking ) .
While the Montgomery Advertiser , which first obtained the autopsy records , reported on Aldridge 's two wet suits , the family newspaper chose not to mention what police discovered inside the minister 's rubber briefs .
Aldridge served as the church 's pastor for 16 years .
Immediately following his death , church officials issued a press release asking community members to " please refrain from speculation " about what led to Aldridge 's demise , adding that , " we will begin the healing process under the strong arm of our Savior , Jesus Christ . " ( 5 pages )
The Google Web Accelerator is back with a vengeance David 150 comments Latest by Richard W. Cox
Google has reintroduced their Google Web Accelerator with a vengeance .
It was evil enough the first time around , but this time it ’s downright scary .
In version 1.0 , web masters at least had a fighting chance as the GWA identified its requests with a “ X - moz : prefetch ” header ( as prescribed by Mozilla ) .
Sure , everyone in the world had to change their web applications to fit Google ’s vision of a perfect world , but at least they could .
Not so for version 2.0 of this virus .
It ships with a brand new mutation :
The header is gone !
There ’s now no way to identify a pre-fetch from a regular request , which means that it ’s no longer possible to block the GWA .
While one should always be cautious to ascribe to malice that which could be explained by ignorance , this appears like double up on evil with a smirk of dark lord .
I can not fathom that Google would not merely repeat the mistake from round 1 , but actually tweak the offering to increase the chances and scope of hurt ?!
Someone , somewhere , please tell me this is not so .
That we accidently got a bastard , mutant version of the GWA .
That it ’s not actually software that Google is allowing unknowing souls everywhere to download and rampage with .
This is bad .
UPDATE : Profanity is a tool reserved for special occasions .
This is one such : WHAT THE FUCK !?!
Two minutes after I posted this , Google pulled the same stunt they did last time around :
Thank you for your interest in Google Web Accelerator .
We have currently reached our maximum capacity of users and are actively working to increase the number of users we can support .
First , it ’s great they ’re paying faster attention to the backlash .
But second , how could this happen again and worse than before ?
How little memory do they equip the release managers with ?
This is shocking .
UPDATE 2 : The missing header is a bug , not evil .
For the readers who were talking about sporks last week .

La suppression de l’impôt sur la fortune sera un peu moins douloureuse qu’attendu pour le budget de l’Etat .
Selon les premières remontées à Bercy , l’impôt sur la fortune immobilière ( IFI ) , qui s’est substitué à l’ISF , ferait rentrer dans les caisses de l’Etat un peu plus de 1 milliard d’euros en 2018 , sa première année d’existence .
Ce chiffre s’entend après plafonnement de l’IFI , le mécanisme hérité du bouclier fiscal , qui limite l’impôt à 75 % des revenus .
Maintenu dans le cadre de la réforme , ce plafonnement aura un coût bien inférieur depuis que l’assiette de l’ISF a été réduite à l’immobilier .
Lors de l’adoption de la réforme dans le projet de loi de finances 2018 , Bercy avait estimé les recettes de ce nouvel impôt à 850 millions d’euros .
Cette prévision était entourée de nombreuses incertitudes , le plus difficile étant d’estimer la part de l’immobilier dans le patrimoine des ménages fortunés .
Les redevables dont le patrimoine taxable était inférieur à 2,57 millions d’euros ne détaillaient plus la composition de leur patrimoine depuis 2011 .
La part des dettes déductibles n’était pas non plus connue .
Enfin , l’administration ne disposait d’aucune information sur les détentions d’immeubles par des entreprises .
A l’automne , le débat s’était polarisé sur le faible rendement de l’IFI .
La gauche critiquait un « cadeau » de 3 milliards aux plus riches , sans garantie que l’argent ne « ruisselle » sur le reste de l’économie .
La droite défendait une suppression totale de l’impôt sur la fortune plutôt qu’un remplacement par un impôt au périmètre complexe , et dont le rendement était faible au regard des taches qu’il ferait supporter aux services fiscaux .
Données éclairantes
Ces chiffres provisoires sur la première collecte de l’IFI montrent que la réforme coûtera un peu moins de 3 milliards aux finances de l’Etat , sachant que l’ISF a rapporté en 2017 près de 4 milliards d’euros après déduction du plafonnement .
D’après ces premières remontées , quelque 120.000 ménages ont déposé une déclaration d’IFI .
C’est trois fois moins qu’à l’époque de l’ISF .
L’estimation qui avait été officialisée à l’automne dernier , et sur laquelle s’étaient appuyés les débats , était de 150.000 contribuables .
Mais les services techniques de la direction générale des finances publiques ( DGFIP ) tablaient plutôt sur 90.000 déclarations .
Difficile , donc , de dire si ce chiffre de 120.000 déclarations est supérieur ou non aux attentes tant le flou régnait sur cette prévision .
D’autres données , mais qui ne sont pas encore disponibles , seront éclairantes .
Il serait instructif de connaître la répartition de cet impôt par décile de patrimoines pour voir s’il pèse davantage sur des patrimoines plus faibles que l’ISF .
La droite avait notamment reproché à cet IFI de se concentrer sur les « petits riches » , comme les surnomme l’ancien président de la commission des finances , Gilles Carrez ( LR ) .
Il désigne par là les patrimoines composés de quelques biens immobiliers , parfois hérités , par opposition aux grandes fortunes basées sur des titres financiers .
Adaptation
A l’avenir , les recettes de cet impôt pourraient être portées par la dynamique des prix de l’immobilier .
Elles pourraient aussi pâtir d’ une adaptation des comportements de la part des contribuables .
Dans son rapport sur le projet de loi de finances 2018 , le rapporteur du budget au Sénat , Albéric de Montgolfier , attirait l’attention sur le fait que Bercy réalisait des chiffrages « à comportement constant « . «
Il y a fort à parier qu’une fois que les grandes fortunes auront modifié la composition de leur patrimoine au détriment de l’immobilier , le rendement de l’IFI sera inférieur à celui escompté par le gouvernement « , indiquait -il .

Indigenous animals are dying out as commercial breeds sweep the world .
The hardy African Ankole cow is expected to be fully replaced by black - and - white Holstein - Friesians within the next 50 years .
International Livestock Research Institute
Many of the world 's indigenous livestock breeds are in danger of dying out as commercial breeds take over , according to a worldwide inventory of animal diversity .
Their extinction would mean the loss of genetic resources that help animals overcome disease and drought , particularly in the developing world , say livestock experts .
" Valuable breeds are disappearing at an alarming rate , " says Carlos Seré , director general of the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi , Kenya , one of the organizations involved in the survey .
The entire inventory , compiled by the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization , contains details of some 7,600 breeds of cattle , pigs , sheep , poultry and other animals in 169 countries .
The survey reports that 11 % of the investigated breeds are now extinct ( some having disappeared many decades ago ) , 16 % are currently at risk , 38 % are unthreatened , and the security of the remaining 35 % is unknown .
Discussing the findings at a meeting of policy - makers , breeders and livestock scientists in Interlaken , Switzerland , Seré called for the establishment of ' gene banks ' containing frozen sperm and eggs from endangered breeds , similar to the facilities currently being set up to preserve the world 's crop strains .
Locally sourced
“ Until recently , natural selection allowed animals to adapt , but now a lot of this is falling through the cracks . ”
Carlos Seré
International Livestock Research Institute
Local breeds , nearly 70 % of which are found in the developing world , are often better suited to their environments than commercially marketed animals bred for their high yields and short - term profitability , Seré argues .
Red Maasai sheep , for example , are naturally resistant to intestinal parasites , and Uganda 's indigenous Ankole cattle are particularly drought - hardy .
But the dominance of big breeding companies , mostly based in industrialized countries , means that these populations are being supplanted by the most common commercial breeds .
Holstein - Friesian cattle , the stereotypical black - and - white dairy cow , are now found in more than 120 countries throughout the world .
The spread of such animals means that many farmers are now working with livestock that are poorly adapted to their environment , Seré says .
" Until recently , natural selection allowed animals to adapt , but now a lot of this is falling through the cracks , " he says .
The pursuit of high - yielding animals means that genetic diversity is in crisis even in the established commercial breeds , says Shirley Ellis of the Institute for Animal Health in Compton , UK .
She estimates that the roughly one billion Holstein - Friesians in the world were sired by the same few dozen bulls in North America .
The advent of cloning for the most prized males will make the inbreeding problem worse still , she says .
Exporting strains such as Holstein - Friesians to the developing world is short - sighted , experts point out .
" They do n't cope very well with local climate and diseases , " Ellis says .
Banking for the future
Gene banks to preserve local diversity should be set up in the areas where this genetic diversity is found , argues Seré .
He wants to see an international effort to raise perhaps US $ 2 million to begin the process of establishing either national or regional centres for storing genetic material .
" Many rich countries are already setting up genetic stores , but we do n't have it in the south where it 's needed , " he says .
The main threat facing local livestock is the pre-eminence of short - termism in livestock breeding , and the fact that it is controlled by large Western companies , Seré says .
But the political volatility of much of the developed world also plays a part , he argues .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the wake of human conflicts such as the Darfur crisis , in which livestock were slaughtered by marauding militias , aid agencies can only replace these animals with Western breeds , Seré points out .
But such animals are less valuable to local farmers in the long run .
Preserving the genetic heritage of indigenous breeds could also save breeders the trouble of trying to promote traits , such as drought - tolerance , from scratch .
" Breeding is sophisticated , but it 's cheaper to spot a breed that can do the job already , " Seré says .
" Nature may have already produced what you need . "

Senate committee subpoenas Gonzales for Rove e-mails Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee today issued a subpoena compelling Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to turn over e-mails written by top White House aide Karl Rove .
The subpoena , signed by Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , describes the materials it seeks as " complete and unredacted versions of any and all emails and attachments to emails to , from , or copied to Karl Rove related to the Committees investigation into the preservation of prosecutorial independence and the Department of Justices politicization of the hiring and firing . "
The subpoena seeks the e-mails by May 15 .
Notably , the subpoena also seeks e-mails " obtained by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald as part of the investigation into the leak of the identity of a covert CIA officer by officials in the Administration that led to the conviction of I. Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby . "
In his letter to Gonzales , Leahy noted that an earlier request had not been fulfilled .
" At the hearing last Thursday and again in a letter dated April 25 , 2007 , I asked you whether you would provide Karl Roves e-mails in the possession of the Justice Department to the Committee without a subpoena , " Leahy wrote .
" You responded at the hearing that you did not know but would check and get back to me .
I have not heard back from you since in response to my question or the letter . "
The Vermont Democrat also criticized the Justice Department for failing to comply with other Senate Judiciary Committee requests .
" In document productions and interviews with Department employees , the Department continues to insist on providing information within only a highly limited scope inconsistent with the Committees inquiry and over the Committees objection , " Leahy wrote .
Subsequently , a bipartisan group of Senators , including Leahy and the Committee 's ranking minority member Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) wrote a second letter , seeking a copy of the confidential order delegating authority from Gonzales to his subordinates Kyle Sampson and Monica Goodling , both of whom have resigned , which was first publicized in the National Journal on Monday by Murray Waas .
" The order appears to be responsive to the Committees requests insofar as it dealt with the appointment and removal of inferior officers who are not subject to Senate confirmation , which would include interim and acting U.S. Attorneys .
Consequently , we ask that you please produce the order and all related documents immediately , " they wrote .
Forty per cent of Australians hold an unfavourable view of the United States and most of those say it is due to President George W Bush , a comprehensive opinion poll has found .
The Lowy Institute has released its annual survey of Australian public opinion on foreign policy and global affairs .
Mr Bush is due to arrive in Australia next week for APEC , just as his friend , Prime Minister John Howard , prepares for an election .
But the Lowy poll shows many Australians disapprove of Mr Bush .
However 60 per cent of people continue to hold a favourable view of the US .
Among those who do not , most cite Mr Bush and American foreign policy as the reasons why .
Of all the external threats to Australia , climate change causes the most concern , with 55 per cent of people very worried about it .
That rates well above fears for international terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism .
Let ’s say that your family spent 50 % of your income on mortgage or rent .
Would a financial advisor tell you that your spending was way out of line ?
If 50 % of your take home pay was for any one thing , it would n’t take long for you to end up in financial trouble now , would it ?
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out , all it takes is a little common sense .
Now , if I told you that almost 50 % of the Unites States tax receipts went to military spending , would you think me a liar ?
Well I would be , because it ’s more than 50 % .
Ask yourself why , when we have a friendly nation to our north and a friendly nation to our south and an ocean to our east and one to the west , and a missile system and an Air force that could knock out an invading navy without a problem , then why are we spending half of our budget on military expenditures ?
Would it upset you to know that China , the # 2 country for military expenditures only spends 6 % of its budget on the military ?
Russia , # 3 , is the same .
Iran , the big boogie man of the Middle East that we are so worried about according to Dick Cheney , is # 27 with a whopping $ 4.9 Billion Dollar budget with 1 % of their budget spent on the military .
It ’s estimated that the United States will spend 52 % of its budget , and 481.4 Billion dollars on defense this year , and that ’s not counting the money for the war in Iraq which so far we have spent $ 130 Billion Dollars on this year and another $ 190 Billion that the President has requested .
Is n’t this a little bit of overkill ?
The United States spends a little over 6 % of its budget for education , and 5.6 % for health .
I guess if you do n’t care about health and education , than the figures should n’t leave you breathless .
I figure that if the US cut its military budget by 1 / 2 to where we only spent about $ 250 Billion dollars , we could increase the health and education budgets by 100 % and still have a little over $ 200 Billion dollars left over .
Why are we spending so much on defense ?
Remember , these figures are not including the war in Iraq .
Do n’t you believe that the Military Industrial Complex is a part of this ?
Why was everyone so surprised when former Senator Mike Gravel brought the MIC up in the first debate in South Carolina ?
The Democratic Candidates are quite aware of how much we spend on defense .
The fact is that the United States spends 48 % of the world ’s total military spending .
What would happen to Northrop - Grumman , Lockheed - Martin , General Dynamics , Raytheon and all of the other defense contractors if we cut our budget by 50 % ?
I guess they would have to look for other things to build .
As long as we spend half the nation ’s wealth on the military , we are going to be a belligerent power in the world .
When we spend 100 times more than Iran spends , I guess it ’s safe to say we can push them around with impunity .
Sadly , this is exactly what we are doing .
The sad truth is that with all the publicity about Global Warming , we only spend 19 % of our budget on science , energy and the environment .
Who cares if the planet dies as long as we are the winner militarily ?
I know reading the figures on what we spend is n’t glamorous and exciting , but when you look at what we are spending compared to the rest of the world you have to ask yourself two important questions .
The first question is the one that Mike Gravel asked the other Democratic Candidates ; “ Who are you afraid of ? ”
The second question is that if we are spending 48 % of the entire world spending on the military , where is the payoff ?
Most of this money goes to weapons systems that are obsolete after a short time , so are we going to keep this same insane rate of spending up indefinitely ?
How can we possibly do this ?
So far , we have kept this up since the beginning of World War II .
Another question you must ask yourself is how long will this “ Global War on Terror ” go on ?
Has the world ever been terror free ?
Are we going down the same road as the War on Drugs ?
Will the world ever be drug - free ?
Every time you kill a terrorist , another will take his or her place .
The people of Afghanistan are growing opium poppies right under our nose and we can’t even stop that .
How the hell are we to eliminate terror from the world ?
You can ’t , it ’s just not possible .
This war , along with the attacks on our liberties , will go on forever .
There is absolutely no difference in the War on Drugs and the War on Terror .
Both so - called wars are self - perpetuating and will last two lifetimes , if not forever .
Every time you kill or imprison a drug - dealer , there will be someone to take their place .
Eliminate the causes of terrorism , the poverty , the injustice and the fanatics that these things foster , and you will eliminate a great deal of terrorism .
Bomb the hell out of these people and run them out of their homes and invade their nations , and all you do is foster more terrorism .

Scientists know little about how the brain assigns cells to participate in encoding and storing memories .
Now a UCLA / University of Toronto team has discovered that a protein called CREB controls the odds of a neuron playing a role in memory formation .
The April 20 edition of Science reports the findings , which suggest a new approach for preserving memory in people suffering from Alzheimer 's or other brain injury .
" Making a memory is not a conscious act , " explained Alcino Silva , principal investigator and a professor of neurobiology and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Learning triggers a cascade of chemicals in the brain that influence which memories are kept and which are lost .
" Earlier studies have linked the CREB protein to keeping memories stable , " added Silva , a member of the UCLA Brain Research Institute .
" We suspected it also played a key role in channeling memories to brain cells that are ready to store them . "
Silva and his colleagues used a mouse model to evaluate their hypothesis .
They implanted CREB into a virus , which they introduced into some of the cells in the animal 's amygdala , a brain region critical to emotional memory .
Next they tested the mouse 's ability to recall a specific cage it had visited before .
The cage was outfitted with patterned walls and a unique smell .
To visualize which brain cells stored the mouse 's memories about the cage , the scientists tracked a genetic marker that reveals recent neuron activity .
When the team examined the animals ' amygdalas after the experiment , they found substantial amounts of CREB and the marker in neurons .
" We discovered that the amount of CREB influences whether or not the brain stores a memory , " said Silva .
" If a cell is low in CREB , it is less likely to keep a memory .
If the cell is high in CREB , it is more likely to store the memory . "
Human implications of the new research could prove profound .
" By artificially manipulating CREB levels among groups of cells , we can determine where the brain stores its memories , " he explained .
" This approach could potentially be used to preserve memory in people suffering from Alzheimer 's or other brain injury .
We may be able to guide memories into healthy cells and away from sick cells in dying regions of the brain . "
Our memories define who we are , so learning how the brain stores memory is fundamental to understanding what it is to be human , Silva observed .
" A memory is not a static snapshot , " he said .
" Memories serve a purpose .
They are about acquiring information that helps us deal with similar situations in the future .
What we recall helps us learn from our past experiences and better shape our lives . "

I ’m giving up !
Here is what happened :
I concluded that HaskellDB is , in fact , dead , or so barely alive that it wo n’t be working well enough for my purposes any time soon .
So I looked at Takusen , another high level DB library , instead .
However , it does n’t seem to have a backend that will cope with MySQL .
library , instead .
However , it does n’t seem to have a backend that will cope with MySQL .
So I gave up on high level libraries , and investigated just using HSQL and HDBC .
HDBC requires ODBC for accessing MySQL , which is n’t ideal , and ODBC requires machine level configuration of connections , AFAIK , which I ca n’t do on my budget host .
So I tried HSQL instead , which I already had got to work .
and .
requires for accessing MySQL , which is n’t ideal , and requires machine level configuration of connections , , which I ca n’t do on my budget host .
So I tried instead , which I already had got to work .
I got as far as cobbling together a binary that would do some database stuff and return a web page with the result , printing any exceptions if they occurred .
It worked completely on my local box , but when I built it with the static flags , I got a bunch of ominous warnings ( e.g. “ warning : Using ‘ gethostbyname_r ’ in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking ” ) .
Sure enough , when I uploaded it to my host , I could n’t get anything out of it .
My budget host could n’t actually show me the real error message or error logs , so I ’m just going to presume I ’ve been scuppered by the linking problem .
But although this project has been killed by a logistical problem , I ’m actually fairly glad .
I was n’t enjoying it much , mainly because half the libraries are in such a poor state .
Once you know how to use them , they are great , but documentation is very patchy , and the project pages are all neglected .
The best was HDBC , because at least that had a Wiki which encourages additions .
Still , the only documentation it had was API documentation ( really not good for getting started with , and it is usually really patchy anyway ) , and links to some programs that use the library .
I guess I ’ve been spoilt by Django — picking it up was rewarding and fun from the beginning .
Since I was doing this Haskell project just for fun , the fun-killers were project - killers .
I think this is a problem in general with Haskell — until you get a critical mass of developers who have worked on these things and are still working on them , writing tutorials , hanging out on IRC for the sake of the newbies etc , things are just not going to take off .
And the problem is that none of these things are particularly fun either , especially if you are an expert Haskell coder — I imagine it is much more satisfying to be off writing Soduko solvers in Haskell ’s type system than getting hs - plugins to work with GHC 6.6 on Linux , or whatever .
Well , that concludes this little project .
I did n’t succeed , and unfortunately I did n’t have much fun either .
The former was caused by the latter .
Madeline Levine is a clinical psychologist and expert on adolescents and teens from affluent families .
Throughout more than 25 years of practice , she came to observe a counterintuitive phenomenon : that along with their list of achievements and accomplishments , these kids often have developed significant depression , anxiety , substance abuse , and psychosomatic disorders .
An effect of being " indulged , coddled , pressured , and micromanaged , " Levine writes , is that they have n't been able to develop a sense of self .
In her book The Price of Privilege : How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids , Levine dissects her experience working with these affluent kids , and explores why they report feeling less close to their parents than any other group of teens and have three times the national rate of emotional problems .
U.S. News & World Report caught up with her to talk about it .
These are the kids who often are very successful and high - achieving , plus they seem to have all the iPods , nice cars , and designer clothes they could want .
Why are so many of them in such emotional trouble ?
When a parent 's love is experienced as conditional on achievement , children are at risk for serious emotional problems .
We know there 's no correlation between money and happiness , but in this culture of affluence , stuff counts more than relationships and people are struggling to keep up .
And the current view of success is so narrow it 's eliminating a large group of kids .
It 's just not possible for everybody 's child to be in the top 10 percent .
Everybody wants to have an outstanding kid , but what makes an outstanding kid ?
Parents do nothing but get in the way when they insist on replicating their own interests , values , and even professions in their children .
One of the things we know is that a warm , involved parent is a silver bullet .
The other equally important side of parenting is limit - setting .
A mom needs 17 years of a good relationship so that her teenage son cares about what she thinks when she says , " No . " Unless you have a warm relationship with your teen , you have no leverage for " No . "
What 's your experience been as a parent ?
I have three sons and I 've learned so much .
In particular : I 'd better see the child I 've been given .
It 's normal for parents to have a sense of their " fantasy child " and have aspirations for their kids , but the problem is kids need the opportunity to develop parts of themselves .
What has the cost been of not letting them do so ?
Since the '50s , preteen and teen suicide have quadrupled , substance abuse has increased , depression has increased — all the problems typically associated with deprivation .
But most of these kids have learned all the social skills — they shake hands and look somebody in the eye when talking to him — so when suicides happen , it comes as such a shock to the community .
Why is it so important for kids to have " parental prohibitions , " as you 've called them ?
Without them , kids do n't develop self - management , frustration tolerance , delay of gratification , impulse control — those things that make people successful .
It 's the only way they get to internalize rules and regulations for academics , psychologically and interpersonally .
If young children can't sit in their seat , they can't learn .
Doubtful any kid would admit it , but do teens and children actually want to hear " No " from parents or have limits set for them ?
Sometimes I 'll hear teens in my practice say , " It would 've been so much better if my mom had said , ' No . ' "
Children borrow the parents ' ego in a situation in which they do n't yet have skills to manage on their own .
Especially under peer pressure , it 's much easier to say , " My mom would kill me . "
Why do some parents seem to struggle to set limits for their kids ?
Well , I remember when my sons all wanted to marry me — that was great !
As a parent , saying , " Yes I love you .
Yes , you can have it , " is incredibly gratifying .
But I also think there 's a fear we 're depriving them — if we do n't give in to our kids we 're somehow damaging them .
The other challenge is that so many [ adults ] themselves are exhausted , tired , and unhappy .
If you work two jobs — or had a miserable day at work — and you come home to an eye - rolling , door - slamming 13 - year - old who says , " I hate you , " it 's kind of like , who needs it ?
You 've got no reserves left at the end of the day .
You suggest parents also have less support than past generations in raising kids .
I 'm a baby boomer and we did a tremendous job of tearing down institutions that needed to be torn down , but we did a miserable job of replacing them with viable institutions .
Participation in all organizations has gone down , from religion to bowling , and people are at their wits ' end trying to do this alone .
What if parents of a teen realize they 've been shortchanging their kid ?
Is there hope for that family ?
Neighbor vs. Neighbor : Shut Your Kids Up !
A couple was taken to court because their kids made too much noise in the pool .
June 21 , 2007  --
How loud is too loud when kids are playing in the yard ?
And do the neighbors have the right to tell parents and kids to keep it down ?
Those questions ended up in front of a village court in Bayville , N.Y. , Wednesday night , in a hearing that attracted scores of community members .
William and Rachel Poczatek were charged with violating local noise ordinances after their neighbors complained that the Poczateks ' two daughters , ages 5 and 11 , were making too much noise around the family 's pool .
The couple could have faced a $ 250 fine and 15 days in jail , but the village court dismissed the charges .
The neighbors say they hope the Poczatek girls will learn to keep it down .
Not Just Kids Being Kids , Neighbors Say
Neighbor Mark Kostackis says he put up a fence and a hedge and installed a waterfall to try and block out the noise from next door .
Nothing helped , Kostackis said .
" Not when they 're making the noise like that . "
The noisemakers on the other side of the wall are 5 - year - old Chloe and 11 - year - old Ashley .
Rachel Poczatek says the girls never swim past 9 p.m. , and while she says they might squeal , the girls do n't curse .
" When is it a crime for our kids to play and be kids ?
That 's what we want our kids to do , " she said .
But the neighbors disagree .
They even made a 30 - minute audiotape to record the noise from the Poczateks ' backyard .
Three Years of Noise
For three years , a group of neighbors say they 've put up with excessive , outrageous noise — not just kids being kids .
" We know when children play .
If that 's all it was , was children playing , having a good old time , screaming , yelling doing their rambunctious thing that children do , that would be fine , " said neighbor Sheila Brown .
Angie and Mark Kostackis say they have as much right to enjoy their home and yard as the Poczatek children do .
But the noise , they say , has prevented them from doing that .
" It 's not about the children , it 's about the quality of life for everyone in the neighborhood , " Angie Kostackis said .
" We all should be able to enjoy the interior and exterior of our homes . "
And expectant mother Laurann Webb , who already has a toddler , said parents needed to monitor their kids ' behavior .
" All children need some sort of discipline , and they have to learn how to respect people around them , " Webb said .
Neighbors on both sides said they could n't believe the dispute ended up in court , calling it " blown out of proportion . "
After the case was dismissed Wednesday night , the Poczateks said they 'd try to be better neighbors .
" I do n't feel they were noisy — kids are kids , you know , but we will try to keep them quieter , " William said .
But he said that Chloe and Ashley would be back in the pool as soon as the sun shone .
The neighbors will be listening .
" Maybe after all this they 'll get the picture .
I hope so .
Nobody wants any of this , " Mark Kostackis said .

In the news , O.J. Simpson is in jail for trying to reclaim some items in Las Vegas that an alleged thief stole from him .
If O.J. is found guilty of asking a thief to return his belongings , he could go to jail for 30 years .
I assume O.J. is kicking himself for not killing everyone in the room , covering himself in their DNA , and going golfing .
You have to stick with what works .
What the Hell was he thinking ?
This incident should be good for the reputation of Las Vegas .
They pride themselves on being a place where activities that are normally immoral or illegal are encouraged .
In Las Vegas , you can gamble all day , have sex with a stranger , and , apparently , steal her watch .
In Las Vegas , it ’s illegal for her to ask you to return it .
Unfortunately for O.J. , his old attorney Johnny Cochrane has passed away .
He ’s the one who coined the phrase “ If the glove does n’t fit , you must acquit . ”
In my opinion , that rhyme freed O.J. I recall reading a study that says people perceive things that rhyme to be more persuasive than things that do n’t .
Who will create the new rhyme that sets O.J. free ?
I have a few suggestions .
“ If he reclaimed his own shit , you must acquit ! ”
“ If he did n’t get rough , you must uncuff ! ”
“ If he has a bad knee , you must set him free ! ”
That ’s why I ’m not a lawyer .
Do you have anything better ?
In response to President Bush 's announcement that he will withdraw 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer , Senator John Edwards released the following statement :
" President Bush has stated that he will withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer .
The truth is that because the president 's Iraq policy has brought our military close to the breaking point , these forces would have been withdrawn anyway — unless the president planned to extend tours to an unconscionable 18 months .
The president taking credit for this withdrawal is like taking credit for gravity .
" It 's time to end this sad game of excuses and Beltway double - talk .
Last November , the American people voted for real change in Iraq , but instead the president has clung to the status quo and Congress has caved .
For over a year , I have called for an immediate withdrawal of 40 - 50,000 troops — not by next summer , but today — to jump - start the comprehensive political solution that will end the violence in Iraq and allow a complete troop withdrawal within a year .
In the face of the president 's irresponsible tactics , Congress must stand united and say with one voice :
No timetable , no funding .
No excuses . "
Edwards Response To Troop Withdrawal Announcement
We will be to where we were in January , 2007 , by June or July 2008 .
And it was not good enough last January !
John Edwards was right in January .
Alone among the top three , he supported the Kennedy Bill to defund the escalation :
Jan 23 , 2007 Chapel Hill , North Carolina –
Tomorrow , Senator John Edwards will run a full - page ad in Roll Call , the newspaper read by all of Congress , calling on members of Congress to use their power to stop President Bush from escalating the war in Iraq .
( Click here to view a PDF copy of the ad . )
The ad will include the names of thousands of Americans who have signed Edwards ’ petition demanding that Congress block funds for an escalation of troops in Iraq .
Over 80,000 Americans from across the country have joined Edwards in speaking out and urging Congress to use its power of the purse to stop the President from escalating the war , as it has in the past , including in Vietnam , Lebanon , Nicaragua and Colombia .
The text of the ad will read : " LAST NIGHT , YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SPEAK .
TODAY , LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE .
The names printed here represent a sample of more than 80,000 people who have joined John Edwards in calling on Congress to block funding of Bush ’s escalation of the war in Iraq .
Members of Congress :
You have the power to block this escalation .
Use it .
Edwards And Over 80,000 Americans Call On Congress To Block Funds
And in May , Edwards led the campaign to SEND THE SAME BILL BACK :
Now he is leading an effort to help Congress learn how to stand up to Bush .
" In 2006 , the American people elected a Democratic Congress to change course and end this war .
It 's the whole reason the American people voted for change .
Yet , 10 months after the election , we still have the status quo and Congress has still failed to do the people 's will .
That might be the way they do it inside the Beltway , but it 's not the American way .
It 's time to stand up for the American people and against President Bush 's failed , stubborn policy .
Without a firm deadline , a small withdrawal of only some of the surge troops wo n't cut it -- that 's not a solution , it 's an excuse .
Congress must not send President Bush any funding bill without a timeline to end this war .
No timeline , no funding .
No excuses . "
Edwards Statement On Report That Congress May Cave
We need to pressure Congress and mobilize people to end the occupation of Iraq .
NO TIMETABLE , NO FUNDING .
NO EXCUSES !!!
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
It was last Sunday in western Baghdad .
Helicopters circled overhead while armed guards , privately hired by the U.S. government , were conducting an ordinary mission to protect U.S. State Department employees .
Hasan Jaber Salman , wounded in the incident , says of Blackwater contractors : " No one fired on them . "
But within minutes there was an explosion , a hail of gunfire , and bodies in the streets .
The Iraqi Interior Ministry says at least 10 Iraqis were killed and 10 wounded .
Another government spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , told CNN that at least 20 people died , with 35 wounded .
So what happened on that day on a square in the Mansour district of Baghdad ?
It depends on whom you ask .
Blackwater USA , the private security firm at the center of the controversy , says its employees simply defended themselves against armed attackers .
Two men hospitalized with gunshot wounds disagree .
They say the guards fired on people for no reason .
Hasan Jaber Salman lies in Yarmouk Hospital , bandages covering gunshot wounds in his back .
Salman says he is a lawyer who was headed from a courthouse to the Ministry of Justice when he found his route blocked by four armored Blackwater SUVs .
The roadblock soon caused a traffic snarl , so armed Blackwater guards began waving at the drivers , telling them to turn around and leave the area .
" So we turned back , and as we turned back they opened fire at all cars from behind , " Salman said .
" All my injuries , the bullets are in my back .
" Within two minutes the security force arrived in planes -- part of the security company Blackwater .
They started firing randomly at all citizens . "
Blackwater , in a statement issued after the incident , denied that gunfire came from aircraft .
" The helicopters providing aerial support never fired weapons , " it said .
The firm also said its employees " acted lawfully and appropriately in response to a hostile attack . "
But Salman claims the attack was unprovoked .
" No one fired at them , they were not attacked by gunmen , they were not targeted by an explosion , " he said .
Watch the survivors describe what happened »
The firing continued until Salman 's car crashed into a police checkpoint and flipped over , he said , adding that eight bullets struck his car and four struck him .
" My left shoulder is broken ... and my arm is broken .
I had a surgery .
...
They opened up my stomach , " he said .
" I swear to God no one did anything to them at all . "
The lawyer said he intends to sue Blackwater , which he already did in 2005 after his son was involved in a similar incident outside al - Muthana Air Base near Baghdad 's international airport .
That lawsuit has not yet been resolved , he said .
Laborer Abul - Raheem
Amir said he was on his way to a job when the minibus he was in got caught in a traffic jam caused by an explosion .
" A security company called Blackwater , they got out and kept on firing randomly at people , starting with the people walking or working the street -- even the traffic policeman , even the people who work in the area , " Amir said .
" People at first thought we were safe in the minibus , but when they realized they were not , they started getting out and went to other places to save themselves , " he recounted .
" Unfortunately that did not work .
As they got out , people were shot and killed . "
He said he tried to make a run for it after the driver and two women next to him on the minibus were shot .
" I ran about 50 meters [ about 55 yards ] and then was shot , the first bullet .
Still I kept running , but the second bullet dropped me to the ground .
...
It broke my bones , and the third one made me start crawling . "
Some people helped get him off the street and away from the carnage .
The shooting lasted for about a half - hour , and there were some 30 bodies in the street , he said .
" I remember people strewn on the streets , children , elderly , young men , elderly women .
...
The street turned into the street of the dead , a graveyard , " he said .
" There was nothing I could do .
Every man was for himself . "
Amir wonders what the Blackwater employees were thinking .
" Is this some kind of a show of force for them to flex their muscles ? " he said .
" Are they doing this to us , the victims , so they can advertise and promote their abilities through the Western media ? ...
Is their mission to protect one person by killing 10 unarmed people ?
And if they are protecting two people , then they shoot 100 unarmed people .
...
Is this Vietnam ? ...
" Enough , enough , " he said .
" Enough of all that 's happening .
God 's fury is coming .
Enough of this .
Enough . "

All About Blackwater USA • Iraq War
ALBANY , N.Y . --
After a bloody raid by US military forces on an enemy camp in Rawah , Iraq , on June 11 , 2003 , a Defense Department report took inventory .
Eighty suspected terrorists killed .
An enormous weapons cache recovered .
And , in what the report called " pocket litter , " a notebook with the name and phone number of the imam of a mosque halfway around the world , in Albany .
Prompted by that notebook and records of 14 phone calls between the imam , Yassin M. Aref , and Damascus , the FBI quickly began a sting operation aimed at Aref .
Federal agents used an informant with a long history of fraud who spun tales to Aref about a fictitious plot involving shoulder - launched missiles and the assassination of a Pakistani diplomat in New York .
Aref and a friend who owned a pizzeria were convicted of supporting terrorism by agreeing to help launder money for the fake operation , and in March the two men were sentenced to 15 years in prison .
But their case seems far from over , and it has become a centerpiece in the effort to challenge one of the Bush administration 's signature espionage programs .
Lawyers for Aref say they have proof that he was subjected to illegal surveillance by the National Security Agency , pointing to a classified order from the trial judge , unusual testimony from an FBI agent , and court documents concerning the calls to Syria .
If they are right , the case may represent the best chance for an appellate ruling about the legality of the NSA program , which monitored the international communications of people in the United States without court approval .
Unlike earlier and pending appeals disputing the program , all of them in civil cases , Aref 's challenge can draw on the constitutional protections available to criminal defendants .
In the civil cases , appeals courts have confronted significant threshold questions , including whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue .
" There are dodges available in civil cases that just are n't available in criminal cases , " said Corey Stoughton , a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union , which has filed supporting briefs in the case .
" This case might be able to put this issue to the test . "
In a brief filed this month , Aref 's lawyers urged the federal appeals court in New York to rule that the program was unlawful and to reverse the convictions .
Last month , the federal appeals court in Cincinnati dismissed one appeal challenging the NSA program , ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue , and the federal appeals court in San Francisco heard arguments in appeals from two other challenges this month .
The workstation can increase energy expenditure
The designers , the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , said it could help obese people to lose up to 30kg a year .
Fifteen obese volunteers burned an average of 191 calories an hour using the treadmill , compared to 72 calories just sitting at their desk .
The study features in the British Journal of Sports Medicine .
This is clearly something that is slightly gimmicky , but if it is a way of getting people with sedentary lifestyles off of their backsides then that has got to be a good thing
John Brewer
Lucozade Sports Science Academy
Exercise and work - we put theory into action
The workstation , which is designed to be used for two to three hours a day , comprises a computer , keyboard and treadmill .
The steel frame of the device is shaped in the form of the letter " H " and is supported by four locking rubber wheels , so that it can be moved about easily .
The frame holds a Plexiglass panel on to which two adjustable arms are bolted - one to hold the computer screen and the other for the keyboard and mouse .
Slats provide storage for personal items such as flower vase , cup holder , pen holder or paper tray .
The adjustable design enables users to walk and work , stand and work , or , if the treadmill is replaced by a high chair , sit and work .
The speed of the treadmill can also be adjusted by the user .
Sedentary jobs
The 14 men and one women who took part in the trials all had sedentary office jobs , and none took part in any regular exercise .
While using the workstation , they walked at the equivalent of one mile an hour .
Their energy expenditure while using the workstation for 35 minutes every hour was compared to that while working at their desk .
The researchers said : " If sitting computer time were replaced by walking - and - working , energy expenditure could increase by 100 kcal ( calories ) per hour .
" Thus , if obese individuals were to replace time spent sitting at the computer with walking computer time by two to three hours a day , and if other components of energy balance were constant , a weight loss of 20 - 30 kilograms per year could occur . "
Obesity rates are soaring across much of the developed world , and many people blame a hectic lifestyle for failing to make time to exercise .
An increase in sedentary leisure activities , such as using a computer , has also been blamed .
More than 12 m adults and one million children in England alone will be obese by 2010 if no action is taken , a report by the Department of Health predicted last year .
John Brewer , director of the Lucozade Sports Science Academy , said : " The growing obesity epidemic is something that requires drastic action .
" This is clearly this is something that is slightly gimmicky and unusual , but if it is a way of getting people with sedentary lifestyles off of their backsides then that has got to be a good thing . "
Mr Brewer said the workstation could potentially appeal to people who found pounding out miles on a treadmill tedious by allowing them to combine it with a more interesting activity .
The desks cost £ 1,000 each .
The number of prosecutions resulting from those referrals is zero .
That may help explain why no one — not Justice Department officials , not Mr. Wolf , not even the religious antipornography crusader who runs the program — seems eager to call the project a shining success .
The department Web site invites citizens to report material that they believe is obscene so it can be investigated and , perhaps , prosecuted .
Clicking on the site to make a report takes the user to Obscenity Crimes.org , which is run by Morality in Media , the grant recipient .
Morality in Media is a conservative religious group that has worked since 1962 to “ rid the world of pornography ” and whose headquarters is , improbably , on the Upper West Side of Manhattan .
Morality in Media has received two annual grants from Mr. Wolf ’s earmarks and is hoping that Justice Department officials decide on their own to award a third , as Mr. Wolf ’s ability to obtain an earmark for the program has apparently waned with the Democrats ’ control of Congress .
Department officials , however , seemed less than keen to talk about Obscenity Crimes.org .
Spokesmen for the criminal division said officials there had nothing to do with the program , which they had been obliged to start because of the earmark .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Taliban kidnappers shot dead a male South Korean hostage on Monday , a spokesman for the group said , accusing the Afghan government of not listening to rebel demands for the release of Taliban prisoners .
“ We killed one of the male hostages at 6.30 this evening ( 1400 GMT ) because the Kabul administration did not listen to our repeated demands , ” spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an unknown location .
The Taliban seized 23 Korean Christians , 18 of them women , 11 days ago from a bus in Ghazni on the main highway south from Kabul and killed the leader of the group on Wednesday after an earlier deadline passed .
The spokesman said the Taliban would kill more hostages if Kabul ignored their demand to release rebel prisoners but set no new deadline .
He said the body of the Korean shot on Monday had been dumped on a roadside .
The shooting was a bloody rejection of the authorities ’ request for more time for talks on freeing the hostages after the expiry of a rebel deadline earlier in the day .
Al Jazeera television broadcast a video showing at least seven of the female hostages , wearing head scarves and apparently unharmed .
Four were sitting on the ground , the rest standing beside men in Afghan robes , apparently militants .
The face of one Asian man also wearing traditional Afghan robes was shown , but it was not clear if he was a hostage or an insurgent .
Al Jazeera said it had obtained the footage “ from a source outside Afghanistan . ”
The television said an off - camera speaker was reading a statement but it did not report what he said .
The hostages were not speaking in the video .
The hostage crisis has focused attention on growing lawlessness in Afghanistan with Taliban influence , suicide bombs and attacks spreading to many areas previously considered safe and making road travel between major cities a risky affair .
A spokesman for the governor of Ghazni province , southwest of the capital Kabul , where the hostages were seized , said earlier that Afghan authorities had asked for two more days in which to settle the hostage crisis peacefully .
The Taliban had earlier insisted the release of Taliban prisoners was the only way to settle the crisis .
On Sunday , the Taliban ruled out further talks after they said government negotiators demanded the unconditional release of the hostages and a senior Afghan official said that force might be used to rescue them if talks failed .

DEMANDS LED TO DEADLOCK
The government had wanted the Taliban to first release the 18 women hostages , but the insurgents demanded the government release its prisoners first , leading to deadlock , said a Kabul - based Western security analyst who declined to be named .
President Hamid Karzai has remained silent throughout the hostage ordeal , except for condemning the abduction , the largest by the Taliban since U.S. - led forces overthrew the movement ’s radical Islamic government in 2001 .

He was harshly criticized for freeing a group of Taliban in March in exchange for the release of an Italian journalist .
The body of the South Korean Christian pastor shot dead by the Taliban last week arrived in South Korea on Monday .
The bullet - riddled body of Bae Hyung - kyu was found last Wednesday , the day he would have turned 42 .
His brother , Bae Shin - kyu , told reporters the family would not hold a funeral until the other hostages returned to South Korea .
In Seoul , family members of the hostages gathered at Saemmul Church on hearing news that a second male hostage had been shot , said a pastor at the church , which sent the volunteers to Afghanistan .
Broadcaster KBS said the foreign ministry and the presidential Blue House were trying to verify the report .
A South Korean shipment of emergency medical supplies and daily necessities has been delivered to the Taliban , but Seoul does not know if the goods have reached the Koreans , Yonhap news agency quoted a presidential spokesman as saying earlier .
The Koreans were abducted a day after two German aid workers and their five Afghan colleagues were seized by Taliban in neighboring Wardak province .
The body of one of the Germans has been found with gunshot wounds .
The first evidence was the bombs themselves , packed into a pair of suitcases and left on two passenger trains in northwest Germany .
Because of a technical flaw , they never exploded , but not for lack of planning .
The laptop of one of the suspects in last year ’s bungled bombings contained plans , sketches and maps -- a virtual road map to an attack that could have killed dozens .
What if law enforcement agents had been able to secretly scan the contents of the computer before the attempted attack was carried out ?
To the unease of many in a country with a history of government spying through the era of the Gestapo and communist rule in East Germany , law enforcement authorities are using the suitcase bomb case to argue for measures that would significantly expand their ability to spy on the once - private realm of My Documents .
Expanded surveillance laws since the Sept. 11 attacks already have enabled many Western governments to monitor telephone and e-mail traffic , the conversation in Islamic militants ’ chat rooms and the websites visited by terrorism suspects .
Now , along with several other European countries , Germany is seeking authority to plant secret Trojan viruses into the computers of suspects that could scan files , photos , diagrams and voice recordings , record every keystroke typed and possibly even turn on webcams and microphones in an attempt to gain knowledge of attacks before they happen .
“ What this case showed us is that they are using laptops , they are using computers , and it would have been very , very helpful to track them down with online searches , ” said Gerhard Schindler , director of the German Interior Ministry ’s counter - terrorism bureau .
The proposal significantly raises the stakes in the balance between privacy and security here in Germany , where the idea of a watchful government calls up images of agents sitting in basements at old typewriters listening to secret microphones .
Here in Berlin , T - shirts with a photograph of Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and the logo “ Stasi 2.0 , ” a reference to the former German Democratic Republic ’s infamous secret police , have suddenly become popular .
Many fear a return to the 1970s , and the often - severe anti-terrorism measures wielded by then - West Germany to fight the devastating tactics of the leftist Red Army Faction .
And in today ’s high - tech world , the proposed measure causes a chill to those who see hard drives as the new window to the soul .
“ Back in the ‘ 80s when people were fighting the census , it was because they feared the state could find out that they were not honest toward the tax authorities or something like that , ” said Sven Lueders , head of the Humanist Union of Berlin , which helped organize a recent protest against the so - called Bundestrojaner , or federal Trojans .
“ Now what people fear is that the state can actually look into your computer .
Because almost everybody has something on his computer that he does n’t want somebody else to see . ”
“ If you spy on my telephone calls , you can never have as big a picture of me as if you can read my hard drive , ” said Constanze Kurz , an activist with the Berlin - based hacker organization the Chaos Computer Club , which has pledged to find and publicize the first government Trojan .
“ My communications , my private photos , my private films , all of my research .
And if you install that Trojan on the computer , you can look not only at this data on the hard drive , but you can see what I ’m typing , you can collect my thoughts as I ’m typing them in , ” she said .
“ If you give me your computer for one hour , I will know everything about you . ”
Already , Romania , Cyprus , Latvia and Spain have laws that allow “ online searches , ” according to a report from Germany ’s Interior Ministry , which conducted an informal survey in Europe .
Switzerland and Slovenia appear to also allow such searches , and Sweden is in the process of adopting similar legislation , the report said .
In the U.S. , where battles are being fought over warrantless surveillance of telephone and Internet communications , the FBI is known to have implanted software designed to identify target computers .
But it is unknown , and the FBI wo n’t say , whether the government has tried to surreptitiously search the contents of hard drives .
“ I ’m not aware of that technique being used in the United States , ” said Marc Rotenberg , president of the Washington - based Electronic Privacy Information Center .
“ But it ’s also not clear , given the current view of the president on his powers to conduct electronic surveillance , that it has n’t been used . ”
Europe has been scrambling in recent months to adopt new counter - terrorism measures as recent arrests in Britain , Germany and Denmark have shed light on the increased number of militants raised in Europe .
On Nov. 6 , the European Union ’s justice commissioner , Franco Frattini , will propose a new set of counter - terrorism measures that is expected to include proposals to block Internet sites offering bomb - making recipes and to make online recruiting of terrorists a criminal offense .
“ The picture of the terrorist of today does n’t have an AK - 47 under his arm , but he has a laptop on his lap , ” Schindler said in an interview at his well - guarded Interior Ministry office .
The mood in Germany since the latest wave of arrests in September has been tense , with senior officials warning that they cannot hope to stop all the plots believed to be underway .
“ A terrorist attack with nuclear weapons is certain .
The question is no longer whether such an attack could be carried out by terrorists , but when , ” Schaeuble told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper in September .
Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung has warned that he would be prepared to order the shooting down of a commercial airliner hijacked by terrorists under emergency laws , despite a court ruling that held such a measure illegal .
Police say that although the current authority to enter a suspect ’s home and seize computers and storage drives for inspection is helpful , there are times when the ability to probe without the suspect ’s knowledge , by way of an e-bug implanted when he unknowingly opened an e-mail attachment , might yield crucial information .
“ I can imagine lots of cases where it ’s sensible not to do a physical search first , ” said Konrad Freiberg , chairman of Germany ’s police union , who is an advocate of the proposed new authority .
“ For example , if a suspect is under telephone wiretapping and we know from his phone calls that he ’s planning an attack .
At the moment , we would have to go to his apartment and search his apartment .
But then he would know that we are there .
And maybe in this case , it would be more sensible to let it go for a couple of days , look at what he ’s doing , see what he ’s planning , and do that secretly , in hiding , ” he said .
Federal intelligence agencies already had been conducting these kinds of online searches but were forced to halt the practice in February , when the Federal Court of Justice ruled it was illegal .
The interior minister said such searches would not resume before the passage of legislation , and possibly an amendment of Germany ’s Basic Law , to allow them .
The government is awaiting a decision from the federal Constitutional Court , which is hearing a legal challenge to the procedure brought in a provincial case , and , depending on the outcome , could present proposed legislation by the end of the year .
Critics of the proposed policy complain that it could circumvent the normal , adversarial legal procedures for searches precisely because of its secrecy .
“ It is already possible with the decision of a judge to physically search computers , but it has to be approved by a court .
And since it is necessary to have it approved by a court , it is also possible to object , ” said Hans - Christian Stroeble , a member of parliament from the Green Party .
“ But if you want to do it secretly , it runs completely out of the control of legal procedure .
“ What we fear is that without any hint of a criminal background , police can secretly go into computers , maybe even the computers of political opponents , and spy them out , gaining access to personal data like photos , diaries , love letters , things like that , ” Stroeble said .
Law enforcement authorities emphasize that they are seeking an official legislative sanction to ensure that proper protections are in place .
“ We need to put this into a clear framework of rules , which means it has to be clearly defined who is going to allow online searches , ” Schindler said .
“ It ’s not going to be a police officer who decides that ; it of course will be a judge who decides . ”
Computer aficionados say it ’s doubtful that any criminal worth his salt would be foolish enough to open an e-mail attachment with a Trojan virus embedded in it .
Government officials responded that they might embed the programs in communications from the tax authorities -- a proposal that raised more controversy , with critics saying it would cause the public to mistrust all government communications .
German authorities are also trying to regulate the distribution of militant material on the Internet .
In a groundbreaking case in the city of Celle , an Iraqi Kurdish immigrant identified only as Ibrahim R. is on trial for forwarding videos made by Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders , available elsewhere on the Internet , into Islamic militant chat rooms .
Prosecutors , who have charged him with supporting terrorism , say his postings amount to conducting a “ virtual jihad . ”
But Klaus Ruether , his defense lawyer , said anyone might forward such videos ; Ibrahim R.'s crime is that he seemed to agree with the points of view expressed , the lawyer said .
“ If a person can be punished only because of what they suppose he has in his mind , ” Ruether said , “ then we have crossed an important line . ”

North Korea is Dark
South Korea is bright , North Korea is dark .
This amazing image is included in the standard US Department of Defense briefings on North Korea .
It was mentioned in a news briefing on 23 December 2002 by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , who stated that " If you look at a picture from the sky of the Korean Peninsula at night , South Korea is filled with lights and energy and vitality and a booming economy ; North Korea is dark . "
There are a number of versions of this image in circulation , with visible differences that vary according to the conditions at the time the imagery was acquired .
The image was made by the orbiting Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ( DMSP ) satellite over regions of the world at night .
The DMSP is a Department of Defense ( DoD ) program run by the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center ( SMC ) .
The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites carry the Operational Linescan System ( OLS ) in low - altitude polar orbits .
These satellites record nighttime data .
The Operational Linescan System has a unique low - light imaging capability developed for the detection of clouds using moonlight .
In addition to moonlit clouds , the OLS also detects lights from human settlements , fires , gas flares , heavily lit fishing boats , lightning and the aurora .
It is possible to distinguish four primary types of lights present at the earth 's surface : human settlements , fires , gas flares , and fishing boats .
The image below was used during an October 11 , 2006 , DoD News Briefing , shortly after North Korea conducted a nuclear device test in Kilju County , North Hamgyeong Province .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Late summer brought no relief from soaring foreclosures .
The number of homes in some stage of default jumped 36 percent month - over - month in August , according to a regular monthly survey .
Delinquencies and defaults more than doubled year over year to 243,947 , according to August figures released Tuesday by RealtyTrac , a marketer of foreclosed properties .
Realty Trac 's forecast is for total foreclosure filings to exceed 2 million this year .
" The jump in foreclosure filings this month might be the beginning of the next wave of increased foreclosure activity , as a large number of subprime adjustable rate loans are beginning to reset now , " James Saccacio , chief executive of Realty Trac , said in a statement .
October is expected to be a peak month for hybrid adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) to reset , with the interest rates on some $ 50 billion worth of loans poised to go up dramatically .
In the past few months , the foreclosure story has become a tale of two regions .
Some of the hardest - hit states have traditionally been in the Midwest , where plant closings and job losses have hit the economy there hard .
The other region is the Sun Belt , which is showing even more significant foreclosure growth as out - sized price increases in the first half of the decade led to virtually unchecked real estate speculation .
Nevada led all the other states in the rate of August foreclosure filings : one for every 165 households for a total of 6,197 .
Other hard - hit , Sun Belt states were California ( one in 224 ) , Florida ( one in 243 ) , Georgia ( one in 271 ) , Arizona ( one in 289 ) , Colorado ( one in 312 ) and Texas ( one in 532 ) .
Rust Belt states in the top 10 included Ohio ( one in 281 ) , Michigan ( one in 288 ) and Indiana ( one in 544 ) .
California placed six cities among the top 10 metro areas for the number of filings .
Modesto led the way with one of every 79 households .
Stockton , Merced , Vallejo - Fairfield , Riverside - San Bernardino and Sacramento also hit the top 10 .
Detroit , Cleveland , Ft. Lauderdale and Las Vegas rounded out the list of worst hit metro areas .
California , by far the most populous state , also led the nation in the actual number of foreclosures .
Some 57,975 households were in some stage of default during the month .
Florida was next with 33,932 and Ohio , with 17,793 , was third .
Saccacio also pointed out that many more of the delinquent homes are winding up back in the hands of the lenders under the designation REO ( real estate owned ) properties .
When borrowers can't catch up on their mortgages , their homes are often sold before the actual foreclosure takes place .
Even if they go on to the next step in the process - auction - they may not draw higher enough bids for lenders to accept the sales .
In that event , they return to the banks as REO properties .
When housing markets were hot , many delinquent borrowers escaped actual foreclosure because their home equity had grown enough so that it well exceeded the amount of the loan 's debt .
That enabled them to sell their properties at a profit or refinance and use the money to pay off past loans .
Because of the housing slump , far fewer homeowners are in that position today .
Indeed , many are underwater , owing more on their mortgages than the homes are worth .
All told , fewer borrowers have the resources they need to work out their debts without being foreclosed on .
FINNS enjoy more paid statutory holiday every year than anyone else in the rich world , getting an average of 44 days off in which to relax ( including annual leave and public holidays ) .
Most European countries allow more than the EU legal minimum of four weeks .
Even Britain , the most slave - driving , has an additional eight public holidays .
And it 's not just Europeans who laze about ; Cubans get 36 days off .
By contrast , Japanese employees get 18 days off a year .
But American workers have perhaps the most to feel aggrieved about : theirs is the only rich - world country that does not give any statutory paid holiday .
( In practice , most workers get around 14 days off . )
All work and little play does provide some consolation , however — America and Japan are the world 's biggest economies .

James D. Watson , the eminent biologist who ignited an uproar last week with remarks about the intelligence of people of African descent , retired today as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island and from its board .
In a statement , he noted that , at 79 , he is “ overdue ” to surrender leadership positions at the lab , which he joined as director in 1968 and served as president until 2003 .
But he said the circumstances of his resignation “ are not those which I could ever have anticipated or desired . ”
Dr. Watson , who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for describing the double - helix structure of DNA , and later headed the American government ’s part in the international Human Genome Project , was quoted in The Times of London last week as suggesting that , overall , people of African descent are not as intelligent as people of European descent .
In the ensuing uproar , he issued a statement apologizing “ unreservedly ” for the comments , adding “ there is no scientific basis for such a belief . ”
But Dr. Watson , who has a reputation for making sometimes incendiary off - the - cuff remarks , did not say he had been misquoted .
Applications Satellites witness lowest Arctic ice coverage in history
14/09/2007 7472 views 21 likes
The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its lowest level this week since satellite measurements began nearly 30 years ago , opening up the Northwest Passage – a long - sought short cut between Europe and Asia that has been historically impassable .
In the mosaic image above , created from nearly 200 images acquired in early September 2007 by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) instrument aboard ESA ’s Envisat satellite , the dark gray colour represents the ice - free areas while green represents areas with sea ice .
Leif Toudal Pedersen from the Danish National Space Centre said : " We have seen the ice - covered area drop to just around 3 million sq km which is about 1 million sq km less than the previous minima of 2005 and 2006 .
There has been a reduction of the ice cover over the last 10 years of about 100 000 sq km per year on average , so a drop of 1 million sq km in just one year is extreme .
Mosaics of Arctic Ocean for 2005 , 2006 , 2007 " The strong reduction in just one year certainly raises flags that the ice ( in summer ) may disappear much sooner than expected and that we urgently need to understand better the processes involved . "
Arctic sea ice naturally extends its surface coverage each northern winter and recedes each northern summer , but the rate of overall loss since 1978 when satellite records began has accelerated .
The most direct route of the Northwest Passage ( highlighted in the top mosaic by an orange line ) across northern Canada is shown fully navigable , while the Northeast Passage ( blue line ) along the Siberian coast remains only partially blocked .
To date , the Northwest Passage has been predicted to remain closed even during reduced ice cover by multi- year ice pack – sea ice that survives one or more summers .
However , according to Pedersen , this year ’s extreme event has shown the passage may well open sooner than expected .
The previous record low was in 2005 when the Arctic area covered by sea ice was just 4 million sq km .
Even then , the most direct Northwest Passage did not fully open .
A 2007 ice - free portion of the Northwest Passage The Polar Regions are very sensitive indicators of climate change .
The UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted the Arctic would be virtually ice free by the summer of 2070 .
Still other scientists predict it could become ice free as early as 2040 due to rising temperatures and sea ice decline .
Because sea ice has a bright surface , the majority of solar energy that hits it is reflected back into space .
When sea ice melts , the dark - coloured ocean surface is exposed .
Solar energy is then absorbed rather than reflected , so the oceans get warmer and temperatures rise , making it difficult for new ice to form .
The Arctic is one of Earth ’s most inaccessible areas , so obtaining measurements of sea ice was difficult before the advent of satellites .
For more than 20 years , ESA has been providing satellite data to the cryosphere communities .
Currently , ESA is contributing to the International Polar Year ( IPY ) – a large worldwide science programme focused on the Arctic and Antarctic .
Since 2006 , ESA has supported Polar View , a satellite remote - sensing programme funded through the Earthwatch GMES Service Element ( GSE ) that focuses on the Arctic and the Antarctic .
In 2009 , ESA will make another significant contribution to cryosphere research with the launch of CryoSat - 2 .
The observations made over the three - year lifetime of the mission will provide conclusive evidence on the rates at which ice cover is diminishing .
Currently no commercially viable quantum computer exists .
While a usable , functional quantum computer may exist in a few months , years , or even a few millenia ( or a superposition of these states ) we have covered them fairly extensively here at Ars and Nobel Intent .
Spurred earlier this year by DWave 's claims of having constructed an adiabatic quantum computer we devoted a series of articles to DWave 's showing , what an adiabatic quantum computer is , and what types of problem may be solved using one .
One topic we did not dive into is how certain problems might be solved .
In the article that discussed what types of problems could be solved using a quantum computer I mentioned a complexity class known as " bounded error , quantum , polynomial time " ( BQP ) .
One of the more well known algorithms in BQP that is also important in quantum computing is Shor 's algorithm .
This algorithm lays out how one can use a quantum computer to factor numbers .
Many readers of Ars have a basic understanding of how a traditional computer works ; it contains memory that holds numbers and can perform a set of basic arithmetic operations on those stored numbers .
Using this , people have come up with many ways to factor numbers but in general they are inefficient .
This inherent inefficiency is at the heart of much of computer security today as many of the ideas rely on the fact that it would take a computer an excessively long amount of time to factor very large numbers .
As the number you wish to factor grows larger and larger , a traditional computer will take exponentially more time to factor .
A quantum computer on the other hand , can do the operation in polynomial time .
The " how " of the quantum computer is beyond the space for this column , but a two - part essay published on the American Mathematical Society 's ( AMS ) website covers just that .
Tony Phillips , a professor of mathematics at Stony Brook University , discusses the math behind Shor 's algorithm and how it can be carried out on a quantum computer .
The astute reader will realize that these articles are the May and June / July essays , respectively , meaning I am a bit late in bringing them to Nobel Intent 's audience 's attention .
Even though they do not represent breaking news , I thought our readers would still find them interesting .
Observe good faith and justice towards all nations ; cultivate peace and harmony with all .
Religion and morality enjoin this conduct ; and can it be , that good policy does not equally enjoin it ? . . . . .
In the execution of such a plan , nothing is more essential than that permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others , should be excluded ; and that , in place of them , just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated .
The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave .
It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection , either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest .
Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury , to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage , and to be haughty and intractable , when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur .
Hence , frequent collisions , obstinate , envenomed , and bloody contests .
The nation , prompted by ill - will and resentment , sometimes impels to war the government , contrary to the best calculations of policy .
The government sometimes participates in the national propensity , and adopts through passion what reason would reject ; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride , ambition , and other sinister and pernicious motives .
The peace often , sometimes perhaps the liberty , of nations , has been the victim .
So likewise , a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils .
Sympathy for the favorite nation , facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists , and infusing into one the enmities of the other , betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification .
It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions ; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained , and by exciting jealousy , ill - will , and a disposition to retaliate , in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld .
And it gives to ambitious , corrupted , or deluded citizens ( who devote themselves to the favorite nation ) , facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country , without odium , sometimes even with popularity ; gilding , with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation , a commendable deference for public opinion , or a laudable zeal for public good , the base or foolish compliances of ambition , corruption , or infatuation .
As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways , such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot .
How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions , to practice the arts of seduction , to mislead public opinion , to influence or awe the public council ?
Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter .
Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ( I conjure you to believe me , fellow - citizens ) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake , since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government .
But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial ; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided , instead of a defense against it .
Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side , and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other .
Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious , while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people , to surrender their interests .
The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations , to have with them as little political connection as possible .
So far as we have already formed engagements , let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith .
Here let us stop .
Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none ; or a very remote relation .
Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies , the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns .
Hence , therefore , it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics , or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities .
George Washington 's 1796 Farewell Address is an amazingly prescient warning to the U.S. to avoid certain dangers with regard to foreign policy .
As we become more and more entangled in the intricacies not only of regional politics in the Middle East , but also in the domestic political conflicts of virtually every significant Middle East country , it almost seems as though we have purposely set out to violate every principle of foreign affairs which Washington articulated :
One could , I suppose , debate the extent to which some of Washington 's specific warnings are currently being ignored by our foreign policy and by our debates over that policy .
But what seems beyond dispute is that our foreign policy is being driven by three principal goals -- ( 1 ) shaping , dictating and even changing ( through various means ) the governments of almost every Middle Eastern country that exists ( " regime change " is a concise summary of the policy against which Washington most stridently warned ) ; ( 2 ) what Washington called " inveterate antipathy " against a particular nation -- Iran -- notwithstanding its repeated efforts ( all of which have been rebuffed by the Bush administration ) to achieve rapprochement with the U.S. ; and ( 3 ) equating hostility towards Israel with hostility , even threats , towards the U.S.
If one set out with the specific objective of creating a foreign policy in the Middle East that sought out as much as possible the dangers against which Washington warned --" permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others " as well as " frequent collisions , obstinate , envenomed , and bloody contests " caused by " [ a ] ntipathy in one nation against another dispos[ing ] each more readily to offer insult and injury , to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage , and to be haughty and intractable " -- one would end up with our current Middle East policy .
In this week ’s eSkeptic , we present a correction to the Grand Canyon Story , Creationism in Our National Parks , that we ran in last week ’s eSkeptic .
Fact Checking 101
How Skeptic magazine was Duped
by an Environmental Activist Group
by Michael Shermer
In last week ’s eSkeptic , we published highlights from a press release issued by PEER ( Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ) , a Washington D.C. - based environmental watchdog group .
That press release , dated December 28 , 2006 , was headlined :
HOW OLD IS THE GRAND CANYON ?
PARK SERVICE WON’T SAY
Orders to Cater to Creationists Makes National Park Agnostic on Geology
The first sentence of the release reads :
Washington , DC — Grand Canyon National
Park is not permitted to give an official estimate of the geologic age of its principal feature , due to pressure from Bush administration appointees .
Unfortunately , in our eagerness to find additional examples of the inappropriate intrusion of religion in American public life ( as if we actually needed more ) , we accepted this claim by PEER without calling the National Park Service ( NPS ) or the Grand Canyon National Park ( GCNP ) to check it .
As a testimony to the quality of our readers , however , dozens immediately phoned both NPS and GCNP , only to discover that the claim is absolutely false .
Callers were told that the Grand Canyon is millions of years old , that no one is being pressured from Bush administration appointees — or by anyone else — to withhold scientific information , and all were referred to a statement by David Barna , Chief of Public Affairs , National Park Service as to the park ’s official position .
“ Therefore , our interpretive talks , way - side exhibits , visitor center films , etc. use the following explanation for the age of the geologic features at Grand Canyon , ” the document explains .
If asked the age of the Grand Canyon , our rangers use the following answer : ‘ The principal consensus among geologists is that the Colorado River basin has developed in the past 40 million years and that the Grand Canyon itself is probably less than five to six million years old .
The result of all this erosion is one of the most complete geologic columns on the planet . ’
Understandably , many of our readers were outraged by both the duplicity of the claim and our failure to fact check it .
One park ranger wrote us :
You ’re a day late and a dollar short on this one .
As a national park ranger , I found most of PEER ’s findings to be bogus .
So have others : http://parkrangerx.blogspot.com
A Grand Canyon park interpreter wrote :
This is incorrect .
I have NEVER been told to present non-science based programs .
In fact , I received “ talking points ” demanding that Grand Canyon employees present programs BASED ON SCIENCE and that we must use the scientific version supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences .
As an interpreter I have shared the “ creation ” story of the Hopi people and the Paiute people because it is culturally relative .
I used these stories as a tool to introduce the scientific story .
Be confident there are good people running government , too .
One of our readers directly challenged Jeff Ruch , the Executive Director of PEER :
When I challenged that PEER guy to show me some evidence and provided him evidence to the contrary , he did n’t have much .
I would say PEER did more than jump the gun .
I ’d say they are spreading misinformation .
Another Grand Canyon park interpreter offered this explanation :
Ruch ’s attempts to insinuate a conspiratorial link between the NPS and organized religion are misguided and founded in fervent anti-Christian opposition , not reason or the law .
Ruch ’s anti-Judeo - Christian bias is evidence by his lack of opposition to GCA ’s selling of Native American creation myths .
His misinformation campaign aims to tarnish the reputation of the NPS to leverage his position that creationism books should not be sold in the GCA bookstore .
I ’ve emailed a few of my contacts at GRCA , and so far , all deny any conspiracy and all freely give the canyon ’s age in education programs ( as does all official GRCA print material ) .
I ’ll post updates as information becomes available .
Until then , do n’t believe everything you read .
The reference to the creationism book being sold in the Grand Canyon bookstore — Grand Canyon : A Different View by Tom Vail — is true .
It is sold in the “ inspiration ” section of the bookstore , alongside other books of myth and spirituality .
In any case , the story is an old one now , and completely irrelevant to the claim that NPS employees are withholding information about the age of the canyon , and / or are being pressured to do so by Bush administration appointees .
Embarrassed and angered by all of this , I promptly phoned Jeff Ruch myself and inquired what evidence he has to support this claim .
He initially pointed to the creationism book and the fact that the NPS has failed to address numerous challenges to the sale of same in their bookstore .
When I pointed out that this is irrelevant to the claim in the press release , he then reminded me of the biblical passages that have been posted at places along the rim of the canyon .
Again , I admonished , this is not evidence for his central claim .
We went round and round on the phone until I finally gave up and hung up , convinced that he simply made up the claim out of whole cloth .
Not wishing to simply call Ruch a liar , and allowing myself to calm down a bit , I emailed him and asked :
Can you tell us who in the Bush administration put pressure on park service employees ?
Can you name one person in the GCNP staff who says that they are not permitted to give the official estimate of the age of the canyon ?
He responded :
I do not know — it is at the Director ’s level or above .
We have been trying to find out for three years .
Julie Cart , Los Angeles Times .
I contacted Julie Cart at the Los Angeles Times , who was out of town on assignment , and got her editor , Frank Clifford , on the phone .
Clifford knew all about the creationism book and the biblical passages on the rim of the canyon , but said that he had heard nothing about this new claim of Bush administration appointees silencing park service staff , and that if Julie knew of such a thing the Times would be most interested in following up with the story .
I then reached Julie by email , who said that she too knew of no such silence on the part of park staffers regarding the age of the canyon .
Once again outraged and enraged , I emailed Ruch to ask him why he referenced Cart , who denied his central claim .
He responded :
I referred you to Julie because of the response she got from the superintendent ’s office when she covered the issue earlier — not for any new claim .
Thanks a lot .
I wasted several hours tracking down that false lead .
Now at my wit ’s end with this guy , I point blank asked him if he made it all up .
He responded :
The interpretive staff at GCNP we are working with do not want to be identified and have gone into deep underground as the atmosphere at the park is now somewhat volatile .
Well , it would have been nice ( not to mention ethical ) if he would have said so in the first place .
( I have now wasted about 10 hours of research time on this instead of other projects . )
The referencing of sources who wish to remain anonymous is quite common in journalism and , in fact , there are laws protecting whistleblowers .
The fact that no such reference was made until I pointedly accused Ruch of flatout lying makes me , well , skeptical of this explanation .
His final statement to me does n’t make me any less skeptical :
We are issuing an amended release today that deletes reference to what interpretive staff can and cannot say and features the NPS official statement that they provide geological information to the public .
Then why did PEER issue that statement in the first place ?
In my opinion , this is why :
PEER is an anti-Bush , anti-religion liberal activist watchdog group in search of demons to exorcise and dragons to slay .
On one level , that ’s how the system works in a free society , and there are plenty of pro-Bush , pro-religion conservative activist watchdog groups who do the same thing on the other side .
Maybe in a Hegelian process of thesis - antithesis - synthesis we find truth that way ; at least at the level of talk radio .
But journalistic standards and scholarly ethics still hold sway at all levels of discourse that matter , and to that end I believe we were duped by an activist group who at the very least exaggerated a claim and published it in order to gain notoriety for itself , or worse , simply made it up .
To that end I apologize to all of our readers for not fact checking this story before publishing it on eSkeptic and www.skeptic.com.
Shame on us .
But shame on you too , Mr. Ruch , and shame on PEER , for this egregious display of poor judgment and unethical behavior .

Troops detained thousands of people during the crackdown
Win Shwe was arrested on 26 September near Mandalay , as the government began its bloody crackdown on the protesters .
The National League for Democracy ( NLD ) member died during questioning , the Thailand - based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( AAPP ) said .
His death raises fresh concerns for the hundreds of people still in custody .
The 42 - year - old activist died " as a result of torture during interrogation " , the AAPP said .
" His body was not sent to his family and the interrogators indicated that they had cremated it instead . "
Sources close to Win Shwe confirmed to the BBC that officials had come to tell his family of his death and had not returned his body .
He had a heart condition , they said .
The White House has demanded an investigation into his death .
" The United States strongly condemns the atrocities committed by the junta and calls for a full investigation into the death of Win Shwe during his detention in Burma , " spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
UN statement
Thousands of people were arrested last month when the military used force to end days of anti-government protests in the main city , Rangoon , and other towns and cities around the country .
Ten people died and about 1,000 are still being held , the government says , but foreign diplomats and analysts fear both figures could be far higher .
Than Shwe has offered conditional talks with Aung San Suu Kyi
The BBC's South East Asia correspondent , Jonathan Head , says the military operates a network of about 80 prisons and interrogation centres and some 60 labour camps .
Conditions in them are known to be atrocious , with torture routinely used on the prisoners , our correspondent says .
The government has faced strong international condemnation for its actions and has in recent days taken what could be conciliatory steps .
It has appointed a liaison officer to hold talks with the NLD 's leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , who is under house arrest .
Burma 's top General Than Shwe has also offered talks - but only if she agrees to drop what he called her " confrontational attitude " .
Correspondents say many Burmese are sceptical of the regime 's sincerity , and believe the offer of talks is just a delaying tactic until international pressure fades away .
At the United Nations , Security Council members the US , UK and France are pushing to agree a statement condemning the military crackdown and calling for prisoners to be released .
But the language of the statement has had to be watered down after objections from China , which is Burma 's main trading partner .
Both China and Russia argue that the violence in Burma is an internal issue that does not threaten regional peace .
Darfur town where AU peacekeepers were attacked burned down - UN
7 October 2007 – The South Darfur town of Haskanita that witnessed a deadly attack against African Union ( AU ) peacekeepers last weekend has been burned down , the United Nations Mission in Sudan ( UNMIS ) reported today .
Haskanita , “ which is currently under the control of the Government , was completely burned down , except for a few buildings , ” UNMIS said today , after conducting a joint assessment mission to the area yesterday with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
“ The market area had been looted .
Few civilians had returned in search of food and water , ” the Mission added .
The civilian population had reportedly fled to neighbouring areas of Haskanita when the first attack took place on 29 September .
The town was the site of a deadly attack on AU peacekeepers just a week ago that killed nearly a dozen people and wounded many more , with several people also reported missing .
The attack took place in the lead - up to peace talks set to begin in Libya on 27 October between the Sudanese Government and Darfur 's many rebel groups in an effort to resolve a conflict that has led to the deaths of more than 200,000 people since 2003 .
As part of the ongoing preparations for the talks , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon 's Special Envoy for Darfur just concluded a series of meetings in Khartoum , UNMIS reported .
Jan Eliasson briefed Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol on the preparations for the negotiations , and also met with the President 's Senior Assistant Minni Minawi .
The Special Envoy also met with the Joint Mediation Support Team , AU - UN Joint Special Representative Rodolphe Adada , Acting UN Special Representative Taye - Brook Zerihoun and Deputy Representative Ameerah Haq .
While in Khartoum , he also met with United States Special Envoy Andrew Natsios .
Mr. Eliasson is now in Addis Ababa , where he will chair , together with his AU counterpart Salim Ahmed Salim , a two - day meeting with the Joint Mediation Support Team on the preparations for the upcoming talks .
From there he will return to Khartoum for further discussions .
DALLAS , Oct. 22  A federal judge declared a mistrial on Monday in what was widely seen as the government ’s flagship terrorism - financing case after prosecutors failed to persuade a jury to convict five leaders of a Muslim charity on any of the charges , or even to reach a verdict on many of the 197 counts .
The case , involving the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and five of its backers , is the government ’s largest and most complex legal effort to shut down what it contends is American financing for terrorist organizations in the Middle East .
President Bush announced he was freezing the charity ’s assets in December 2001 , saying that the radical Islamic group Hamas had “ obtained much of the money it pays for murder abroad right here in the United States . ”
But at the trial , the government did not accuse the foundation , which was based in a Dallas suburb , of paying directly for suicide bombings .
Instead , the prosecution said , the foundation supported terrorism by sending more than $ 12 million to charitable groups , known as zakat committees , which build hospitals and feed the poor .
The prosecution said the committees were controlled by Hamas and contributed to terrorism by helping Hamas spread its ideology and recruit supporters .
The government relied on Israeli intelligence agents , using pseudonyms , to testify in support of this theory .
Researchers from MIT ’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory have uncovered a molecular mechanism that governs the formation of fears stemming from traumatic events .
The work could lead to the first drug to treat the millions of adults who suffer each year from persistent , debilitating fears – including hundreds of soldiers returning from conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The team will report their results in the July 15 advance online publication of Nature Neuroscience .
A study conducted by the Army in 2004 found that one in eight soldiers returning from Iraq reported symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
According to the National Center for PTSD in the United States , around eight percent of the population will have PTSD symptoms at some point in their lives .
Some 5.2 million adults have PTSD during a given year , the center reports .
Li-Huei Tsai , Picower Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , and colleagues show that inhibiting a kinase ( kinases are enzymes that change proteins ) called Cdk5 facilitates the extinction of fear learned in a particular context .
Conversely , the learned fear persisted when the kinase ’s activity was increased in the hippocampus , the brain ’s center for storing memories .
Cdk5 , paired with the protein p35 , helps new brain cells , or neurons , form and migrate to their correct positions during early brain development .
In the current work , the MIT researchers looked at how Cdk5 affects the ability to form and eliminate fear - related memories .
“ Remarkably , inhibiting Cdk5 facilitated extinction of learned fear in mice .
This data points to a promising therapeutic avenue to treat emotional disorders and raises hope for patients suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder or phobia , ” Tsai said .
Emotional disorders such as post - traumatic stress and panic attacks stem from the inability of the brain to stop experiencing the fear associated with a specific incident or series of incidents .
For some people , upsetting memories of traumatic events do not go away on their own , or may even get worse over time , severely affecting their lives .
Treating these disorders involves methods geared toward making the behavior go away , or become extinct , but the molecular mechanisms underlying the extinction process are not well understood .
However , Tsai said , studies have shown that some of the molecular machinery that initially encodes the troubling memories also regulates their extinction .
In the current work , genetically engineered mice received mild foot shocks in a certain environment and were re-exposed to the same environment without the foot shock .
Mice with increased levels of Cdk5 activity had more trouble letting go–or extinguishing –the memory of the foot shock and continued to freeze in fear .
Conversely , in mice whose Cdk5 activity was inhibited , the bad memory of the shocks disappeared when the mice learned that they no longer needed to fear the environment where the foot shocks had once occurred .
“ In our study , we employ mice to show that extinction of learned fear depends on counteracting components of a molecular pathway involving the protein kinase Cdk5 , ” said Tsai , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator .
“ We found that Cdk5 activity prevents extinction , at least in part by negatively affecting the activity of another key kinase .

WASHINGTON --
After exhaustively compiling a list of the 237 reasons why people have sex , researchers found that young men and women get intimate for mostly the same motivations .
It 's more about lust in the body than a love connection in the heart .
College - aged men and women agree on their top reasons for having sex - they were attracted to the person , they wanted to experience physical pleasure and " it feels good , " according to a peer - reviewed study in the August edition of Archives of Sexual Behavior .
Twenty of the top 25 reasons given for having sex were the same for men and women .
Expressing love and showing affection were in the top 10 for both men and women , but they did take a back seat to the clear No. 1 : " I was attracted to the person . "
Researchers at the University of Texas spent five years and their own money to study the overlooked why behind sex while others were spending their time on the how .
" It 's refuted a lot of gender stereotypes ... that men only want sex for the physical pleasure and women want love , " said University of Texas clinical psychology professor Cindy Meston , the study 's co-author .
" That 's not what I came up with in my findings . "
Forget thinking that men are from Mars and women from Venus , " the more we look , the more we find similarity , " said Dr. Irwin Goldstein , director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego .
Goldstein , who was n't part of Meston 's study , said the Texas research made a lot of sense and adds to growing evidence that the vaunted differences in the genders may only be among people with sexual problems .
Meston and colleague David Buss first questioned 444 men and women - ranging in age from 17 to 52 - to come up with a list of 237 distinct reasons people have sex .
They ranged from " It 's fun " which men ranked fourth and women ranked eighth to " I wanted to give someone else a sexually transmitted disease " which ranked on the bottom by women .
Once they came up with that long list , Meston and Buss asked 1,549 college students taking psychology classes to rank the reasons on a one - to - five scale on how they applied to their experiences .
" None of the gender differences are all that great , " Meston said .
" Men were more likely to be opportunistic towards having sex , so if sex were there and available they would jump on it , somewhat more so than women .
Women were more likely to have sex because they felt they needed to please their partner . "
But this is among college students , when Meston conceded " hormones run rampant . "
She predicted huge differences when older groups of people are studied .
Since her study came out Tuesday , people are coming up with new reasons to have sex .
" Originally , I thought that we exhaustively compiled the list , but now I found that there should be some added , " Meston said .

“ There are many applications for ultracold neutrons in fundamental physics , ” Oliver Zimmer tells PhysOrg.com .
“ And we will find even more applications with a stronger source of ultracold neutrons . ”
Zimmer , a scientist at the Institut Laue Langevin in Grenoble , France , thinks that he and his colleagues may have found a way to tap a better source for ultracold neutrons by extracting them from superfluid helium .
“ Right now , ” Zimmer explains , “ the best source provides not more than 50 neutrons per cubic centimeter .
When we extract them from superfluid helium , we could get a factor 100 more . ”
Zimmer led a team of scientists from the physics faculty of the Technical University Munich in Germany , the Laboratory of Nuclear Problems in Russia , the ILL in Grenoble , the Munich research reactor FRM II and the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland in creating a prototype that shows how neutron extraction from superfluid helium works .
Their findings are published in Physical Review Letters in a piece titled , “ Superfluid - Helium Converter for Accumulation and Extraction of Ultracold Neutrons . ”
“ Extracting the neutrons from the superfluid is particularly important for a neutron lifetime measurement because when left in the helium , it can be absorbed by impurities , or get additional energy by scattering , even at a low temperature , ” Zimmer says .
He explains that extraction solves these problems , and it makes the use of ultracold neutrons also more versatile .
“ More possibilities for broader application of these neutrons open up when you do n’t have to do experiments in the superfluid helium . ”
The international team is building on an idea that was first suggested 30 years ago .
However , a first attempt 20 years ago to extract ultracold neutrons accumulated in helium did n’t work because the scientists involved were using “ windows ” to try and extract the neutrons horizontally .
Instead , Zimmer and his colleagues switched the direction .
“ With the windows , ” he explains , “ the neutrons had to pass through a series of foils to get out .
We use a vertical extraction , so the neutrons do n’t have to pass through any material .
In the earlier experiments , the neutrons were probably being eaten away by absorption in the foil material and by leakage through gaps in the neutron guide . ”
Most of the present uses for ultracold neutrons are to do with fundamental physics .
Zimmer points out that even though everyday applications with ultracold neutrons are a long way off , experiments with this neutral particle advance the understanding in many areas , including “ the synthesis of chemical elements in the early universe during the first minutes after the big bang , or the question why there is so much matter found in the universe but practically no anti-matter .
Experiments on the neutron lifetime and the search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron are crucial for this . ”
He continues , expounding via email : “ And when we have a stronger source for these neutrons , we will probably find more applications for ultracold neutrons because their present low number is severely limiting the counting statistical accuracy in any experiment . ”
Zimmer insists that this ultracold neutron extraction method adds the missing piece to creating a source for experimental purposes : “ First , scientists discovered that this high rate of production in ultracold neutrons is possible .
Next , they found that these neutrons can accumulate for a long time , allowing you to get a higher density of them . ”
He emphasizes : “ These things have been done in helium .
The last missing part is to get the neutrons out of the helium , and our prototype has shown we can do this . ”
How close are ultracold neutrons to being extracted from superfluid helium for cutting edge experimental purposes ?
According to Zimmer , not far off .
“ Our second apparatus currently being constructed will already serve as a facility for this .
As a first application , I think within the next two years , we will carry out a compelling neutron lifetime experiment . ”

Albemarle School Superintendent Pam Moran says she was slammed with over 1,000 email messages in - box .
PHOTO COURTESY ALBEMARLE COUNTY
This fall , the load of papers coming home with Albemarle County kids in backpack mail will be lighter : no Boy Scouts recruitments , no YMCA sign - ups , no mention of vacation Bible school .
And no fliers touting atheist camp .
In the end , distributing religious and nonreligious materials through the schools was miring teachers , principals , administrators , and the Albemarle School Board in controversy .
And a majority of School Board members wants to eliminate any fliers that are n't school - or government - related at its June 28 meeting .
" We want to get back some of the instructional time that 's been lost , " says School Board Chair Sue Friedman .
The brouhaha stems from a 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling – Child Evangelism Fellowship v. Montgomery County Schools– that says schools that allow nonprofits like Little League and Boy Scouts to send home fliers can't discriminate against religious nonprofits that want to send home Good News Club fliers .
About a year ago , Mat Staver with the conservative Christian Liberty Counsel brought that ruling to Albemarle 's attention when a local administrator refused to allow a student to distribute a vacation Bible school flier .
The county began allowing religious activity fliers but promised to revisit the issue in a year .
And over the past school year , a Pagan flier in December and one for the atheist - oriented Camp Quest this spring sparked more controversy .
Superintendent Pam Moran told the School Board her email inbox shut down when a national organization– Vision America headquartered in Lufkin , Texas– got wind of the " beyond belief " Camp Quest fliers and flooded her with messages protesting school - abetted " atheistic indoctrination . "
Technicians had to work over the weekend to get her email back up and running .
Friedman denies the Camp Quest flier spurred the board to ban all fliers .
" For me , it was n't about the content , " Friedman explains .
" At the end of the day , we had to make sure our highly qualified teachers were doing highly qualified instruction . "
That 's what the teachers wanted all along .
" Last year , 16 out of 16 elementary principals recommended we not do this , " admits Friedman .
" We did not listen . "
The School Board looked at the fliers as a community service , and the idea of a child in the rural area who would n't otherwise know about , say , soccer leagues , was " persuasive , " says Friedman .
Two School Board members– Brian Wheeler and Jon Stokes– argued for continuing to let private fliers go home in backpacks .
" I think it 's an important service to families of Albemarle County schools that allowed us to be a community , " says Stokes .
Stokes says that fewer fliers went home this past school year than in 2005 - 2006 , and he disputes the notion that distributing fliers takes up too much instructional time
" I asked my son how he got his , " says Stokes .
" The teacher puts them on the table and says ' Take one . ' "
And teachers still have to hand out school and government fliers , which cuts into instructional time .
Stokes sees the matter as a freedom of speech issue and a " teachable moment . "
But even he concedes the fliers have taken up School Board time .
" That 's not the reason for being on the School Board , " he says .
" I 'd rather deal with educational issues . "
Secular humanist Mary Ellen Sikes has mixed feelings .
A Camp Quest volunteer , she prepared the notice to go out through the schools .
" It was extremely disruptive , " she acknowledges .
" But it seemed more about the burden on the School Board . "
She worries that minority viewpoints , such as the notion that human decency can be learned from places other than a 2,000 - year - old story collection , will be lost in the controversy over the flier policy .
" I feel sad because it was changed to accommodate prejudice rather than by formulating a policy based on what they feel are the needs of students to get information about community events , " says Sikes , who attended the June 14 School Board meeting , where there was a " heated " discussion .
After Vision America , a conservative Christian organization , urged its followers to " protest atheist indoctrination in schools " with this email , Albemarle changed its policy and now allows only school or government fliers to go home with students – much to the chagrin of nonprofits like the YMCA .
SCREEN CAPTURE FROM THE VISION AMERICA WEBSITE
There 's one issue Sikes feels the School Board sidestepped : reports on conservative websites of Albemarle teachers who did not distribute the Camp Quest fliers because they found them " offensive " and " outrageous . "
School administrator Diane Behrens told the board she did not find any evidence of teachers not distributing the fliers , according to Sikes .
" We 're very skeptical of , if you 'll pardon the pun , ' a good faith ' investigation , " says Sikes .
She reports board member Diantha McKeel saying in January that she had spoken to teachers who have not sent home fliers that they 're not comfortable with , so Sikes wonders why the central office was unable find any of those teachers .
McKeel and Behrens did not return phone calls by press time .
For organizations that have traditionally used backpack mail to spread word of their activities , the change in policy is particularly painful .
" Most YMCAs rely on getting their information out through schools because most of our programs are geared to kids , " says the Y's new CEO , Bill Blewitt , who was unaware of the county 's impending policy change until contacted by a reporter .
" It certainly will be detrimental to us how we get information out . "

The orangutan - an icon in peril ... like so many other species
In pictures
The Red List of Threatened Species for 2007 names habitat loss , hunting and climate change among the causes .
The World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) has identified more than 16,000 species threatened with extinction , while prospects have brightened for only one .
The IUCN says there is a lack of political will to tackle the global erosion of nature .
Governments have pledged to stem the loss of species by 2010 ; but it does not appear to be happening .
The rate of biodiversity loss is increasing
Julia Marton - Lefevre
" The rate of biodiversity loss is increasing , and we need to act now to significantly reduce it and stave off this global extinction crisis . "
One in three amphibians , one in four mammals , one in eight birds and 70 % of plants so far assessed are believed to be at risk of extinction , with human alteration of their habitat the single biggest cause .
Critical list
The tone of this year 's Red List is depressingly familiar .
Of 41,415 species assessed , 16,306 are threatened with extinction to a greater or lesser degree .
RED LIST DEFINITIONS
Extinct - Surveys suggest last known individual has died Critically Endangered - Extreme high risk of extinction - this means some Critically Endangered species are also tagged Possibly Extinct Endangered - Species at very high risk of extinction Vulnerable - Species at high risk of extinction Near Threatened - May soon move into above categories Least Concern - Species is widespread and abundant Data Deficient - not enough data to assess
Numbers have declined by more than 60 % over the last 20 - 25 years .
Forest clearance has allowed hunters access to previously inaccessible areas ; and the Ebola virus has followed , wiping out one - third of the total gorilla population in protected areas , and up to 95 % in some regions .
Ebola has moved through the western lowland gorilla 's rangelands in western central Africa from the southwest to the northeast .
If it continues its march , it will reach all the remaining populations within a decade .
The Sumatran orangutan was already Critically Endangered before this assessment , with numbers having fallen by 80 % in the last 75 years .
But IUCN has identified new threats to the 7,300 individuals that remain .
Forests are being cleared for palm oil plantations , and habitat is being split up by the building of new roads .
Governments know they are going to fail to reach that target
Jean - Christophe Vie
So fragmented have some parts of the Bornean forest become that some isolated orangutan populations now number less than 50 individuals , which IUCN notes are " apparently not viable in the long term " .
Straight to zero
The great apes are perhaps the most charismatic creatures on this year 's Red List , but the fact they are in trouble has been known for some years .
Perhaps more surprising are some of the new additions .
" This is the first time we 've assessed corals , and it's a bit worrying because some of them moved straight from being not assessed to being possibly extinct , " said Jean - Christophe Vie , deputy head of IUCN 's species programme .
The first formal assessment of corals shows many are at risk
IUCN is now embarking on a complete assessment of coral species , and expects to find that about 30 % to 40 % are threatened .
The most glaring example of a waterborne creature failed by conservation efforts is probably the baiji , the Yangtze river dolphin , which is categorised as Critically Endangered , Possibly Extinct .
This freshwater species appears to have failed in its bid for survival against the destructive tides of fishing , shipping , pollution , and habitat change in its one native river .
Chinese media reported a possible sighting earlier this year , but the IUCN is not convinced ; with no confirmed evidence of a living baiji since 2002 , they believe its time on Earth may well be over .
If so , it will have become a largely accidental victim of the various forces of human development .
Not so the spectacular Banggai cardinalfish ; a single decade of hunting for the aquarium trade has brought numbers down by an astonishing 90 % .
Intensive conservation work has brought numbers up from about 50 to above 300 .
But the gharial , a crocodilian found in the major rivers of India and Nepal , provides a cautionary tale of what can happen when conservation money and effort dry up .
A decade ago , a programme of re-introduction to the wild brought the adult population up from about 180 to nearer 430 .
Deemed a success , the programme was stopped ; numbers are again hovering around 180 , and the gharial finds itself once more on the Critically Endangered list .
Climate of distraction
IUCN says that it is not too late for many of these species ; that they can be brought back from the brink .
It is something that the world 's governments have committed to , vowing in the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity " to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global , regional and national level " .
" We know that it is possible to reverse the trend , but the causes are so huge and massive and global , and there is still a lack of attention to the crisis that biodiversity faces . "
Many in the environmental movement argue that too much money and attention has gone on climate change , with other issues such as biodiversity , clean water and desertification ignored at the political level .
IUCN 's assessment is that climate change is important for many Red List species ; but it is not the only threat , and not the most important threat .
There are conflicts between addressing the various issues , with biofuels perhaps being the obvious example .
Useful they may turn out to be in reducing greenhouse gas emissions ; but many conservationists are seriously concerned that the vast swathes of monoculture they will bring spell dire consequences for creatures such as the orangutan .

Because Robots have Powers too
The Thunder of Turkish War Drums
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
The current crisis between Turkey and the Kurds has been building up for decades .
In recent weeks , Turkish - Kurdish tensions burst into flames .
Marxist - nationalist PKK guerrillas fighting for an independent nation for Turkey ’s 20 million or so Kurds killed a score of Turkish soldiers and captured eight .
Hundreds more Turkish soldiers have been killed in eastern Anatolia by increasingly effective Kurdish fighters known as " pesh - merga , " who have been receiving more and better weapons from fellow Iraqi Kurds .
Fiercely nationalist Turks demand their armed forces invade Iraq ’s autonomous Kurdish mini-state to destroy PKK bases .
The Turks have massed 100,000 troops and armor on their mountainous border with Iraq .
Limited Turkish air attacks and ground probes inside Iraq began last week .
A decade ago , I covered the brutal guerilla war in the hills of bleak , windswept Eastern Anatolia between Kurdish PKK guerrillas ( Turks brand them " terrorists " ) and the Turkish Army .
At the time , the world ignored this ugly conflict in which 35,000 people had by then died .
I came away torn by sympathy for both sides in this tragic conflict .
No one should be surprised by this crisis .
Critics long warned the US invasion of Iraq would inevitably release the genie of Kurdish nationalism .
Creation of a virtually independent , US - backed Kurdish state in northern Iraq was certain to provoke a violent reaction by Turkey .
Ankara has warned for a decade it would never tolerate creation of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq which it fears would quickly spark demands by Turkey ’s restive Kurds for their own state .
Washington has been piously urging " restraint " on Turkey , a key US ally .
By contrast , after two Israeli soldiers were captured last year in a routine border clash with Hezbullah guerrillas , the White House gave Israel a green light to bomb and invade Lebanon , killing over 1,100 civilians and causing $ 4 billion of damage .
This crisis is a huge mess for all concerned .
Turkey provides 70 % of air - delivered supplies to US forces in Iraq and allows US military aircraft to use its airspace .
Turkey also quietly allows Israel certain overflight rights , which may eventually include the right to launch an air blitz against Iran through Turkish air space .
Israel ’s recent air attack on a mysterious Syrian building was flown over Turkish territory .
Turkey ’s military approved the Israeli overflight ; its civilian government knew nothing about the attack until afterwards .
Meanwhile , anti-Americanism is peaking in Turkey .
Turkey ’s powerful army and civilian government make conflicting policies .
Turkey ’s popular democratic government wants no part of America ’s war in Iraq and is loathe to attack Iraq , fearing getting embroiled in the US - created debacle .
But Turkey ’s powerful military establishment , a state within the state with very close links to the Pentagon and Israel , is pressing for an invasion of Iraq .
Iraq ’s Kurds , America ’s only ally in that strife - torn nation , discreetly back the PKK , and are working for fully a independent Kurdish state .
The Kurdish mini-state in northern Iraq is already de facto independent , with its own government , finances , army , and flag .
The feeble US - installed regime in Baghdad has almost no influence over the Kurds , even though its president , Jalal Talabani , is also one of the two senior Kurdish leaders .
Turkey ’s government must respond to surging public outrage , but fears major military action in Iraq will foreclose its hopes of getting into the European Union , and put it on a collision course with the US in Iraq .
Interestingly , US forces in Iraq have turned a blind eye to the PKK ’s operations there and to its cross - border attacks into Turkey .
Israel , which has its eye on Mesopotamia ’s oil , is secretly backing Iraq ’s Kurdish mini-state and hopes one day to build an oil pipeline from Iraqi Kurdistan to Haifa , either via Jordan or through a splintered Syria — which is also high on Israel ’s hit list .
But Israel is also a close ally of Turkey ’s right - wing generals who hate Kurds as much as their own democratic government led by able PM Recep Erdogan .
The Israelis are thus caught in the middle of the Turkish - Kurdish conflict , just as they were recently during the bitter dispute between Turkey and the Armenians .
A new danger looms .
The US invasion devastated Iraq and effectively split into three pieces — fulfilling the first step in Israel ’s grand strategy of fragmenting Iraq , Lebanon , and Syria .
Iraq ’s Mosul oil region , which formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire , is a mere 119 kms from Turkey ’s border .
Kirkuk is only a bit further .
After World War I , the British Empire grabbed this oil - rich region , cobbling together the unnatural state of Iraq to safeguard the oil .
If Iraq slides further into the abyss , Turkey and Iran may partition Iraq .
Today , Turkey has no oil .
Its fragile economy is hammered by having to earn US dollars to buy oil .
But if Turkey repossessed Iraq ’s northern oil fields , this nation of 70 million with 515,000 men at arms would become an important power that would reassert traditional Turkish influence in the Mideast , Balkans , Caucasus , and Central Asia .
" Pan -Turanism , " the idea of spreading Turkish influence from its eastern border across the Turkic lands of Central Asia to the Great Wall of China remains dear to the hearts of many Turkish nationalists and far rightists .
Iraq ’s huge oil reserves are a big temptation Ankara cannot ignore .
After all , if the US can invade Iraq for oil , why not neighboring , ex-owner Turkey ?
Meanwhile , Washington mutters about launching attacks on PKK , which it also brands " terrorists . "
But with the glaring double standards typical of US Mideast policy , Washington closes its eyes — and may be secretly arming — Iraqi Kurds who are attacking Iran .
Turkey insists it is fighting " terrorism " and has every right to strike into Iraq to protect its national security — one of President George Bush ’s justifications for invading Iraq .
This Kurdish fracas comes just as Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush are fanning hysteria over Iran and threatening war .
Their latest claim : Iran " might " have nuclear knowledge , so is a world danger .
Welcome to Washington ’s new bogeyman : " thoughts of mass destruction ( tmd’s ) . "
Throw in the growing crisis in key US ally Pakistan , and we face one unholy mess .

E-mail received from Dan Monte of : “ impeach coalition ”
By Robert Parry
B y now , the Republican Rights goal should be obvious : a power grab of historic proportions , the ouster of a twice - elected president for lying about his sex life .
New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis grasped some of what was afoot .
On Sept. 29 , he wrote ,  There is an effort under way to bring about a fundamental change in the political direction of this country , effectively changing the results of our last two national elections .
It would be a coup detat . 
But what is under way is more than a coup detat .
It is a change not just in leadership but in the American system of government .
If a well - organized conservative apparatus can engineer a presidential impeachment for an offense so common , then a kind of political veto has been asserted -- no one to the left of George W. Bush need apply .
Anyone who crosses the right 's power structure -- now anchored in the Congress , the federal courts , well - funded attack groups , the conservative media and the special prosecutor apparatus -- can expect the same .
The future of American democracy , as the right is sketching it , is more the stuff of Orwell and Kafka than Jefferson and Madison .
Indeed , in some ways , the triviality of Clintons offense makes the severity of the impeachment punishment all the more momentous .
In that sense , the Clinton case is a demonstration .
It shows how smoothly the parts of this well - oiled political machine mesh together : ideologically driven civil suits , conservative media drumbeat , right - wing judges who pick partisan special prosecutors , Republicans in Congress mounting their own investigations .
Many Democrats hope that the destruction of this flawed president is just another case of Clinton exceptionalism .
But the Clinton impeachment model can easily be replicated to fit any set of circumstances .
To highlight the point , Republicans have made clear that Vice President Al Gore could be next in line -- despite his Boy Scout reputation .
Gore allegedly used the wrong phone to make some fund - raising calls .
Most pollsters expect the Republicans to notch gains in the Nov. 3 elections .
But assuming the Republicans at least hold their own , House Speaker Newt Gingrich clearly plans to press for Clintons impeachment .
The House Judiciary Committee is almost sure to recommend Clinton 's removal and the full House is nearly as certain to go along .
The real battle is expected in the Senate , where a two - thirds majority is needed to oust a president .
But even if Clinton can block his removal , he will go down in history as a disgraced figure -- and leave office with millions of dollars in legal bills .
Many of his supporters have suffered similar fates -- burdened with huge debts to personal lawyers -- and more will follow in the next two years .
Yet , while Washington focuses on Clintons denouement , little attention has gone to the recent evidence of an impeachment conspiracy ,  documentary support for Hillary Clintons vast right - wing conspiracy . 
More of that conspiracy 's outline came into view with the congressional release of thousands of documents intended to buttress the allegations against Clinton .
But there was another side to the disclosures .
The documents and tape - recordings revealed that key anti-Clinton figures may have committed more serious crimes than Clinton , but won protection from conservative special prosecutor Kenneth Starr .
Linda Tripp , for instance , taped herself egging Monica Lewinsky into blackmailing the president for a high - paying job .
The evidence further shows that Lewinsky made veiled extortion threats to the president .
Though a blackmail conspiracy would rank as a far more serious crime than Clinton 's alleged perjury in a civil suit , Tripp and Lewinsky received immunity deals from Starr .
Tripp also was engaged in taping Lewinsky though aware -- at least near the end -- that secret phone recordings were illegal in Maryland .
Starr himself withheld details of his earlier role in the Paula Jones civil case when he sought Attorney General Janet Renos approval to expand his inquiry to include Clintons sex life .
As the evidence spills out , Starr appears to have been a kind of point man not only for Republicans who desire Clintons removal , but for conservative lawyers and jurists whose appointments to the bench depend on who occupies the Oval Office .
Though the media may focus on Gingrich and Hyde and Hatch , many of the key players in the Clinton drama have worn black robes .
Indeed , Clintons impeachment could be viewed , in part , as a judicial coup .
One of President Reagans strategies for putting his conservative stamp on the government was to place right - wing judges on the federal courts in Washington , especially the U.S. Court of Appeals where many low - profile constitutional decisions are made .
The strategy served Reagan well when the two most prominent Iran - contra convictions -- of Reagans national security aides Oliver North and John Poindexter -- were on appeal .
The North case reached the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1990 and the Poindexter case followed in 1991 .
Iran -contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh , a Republican himself , encountered what he termed " a powerful band of Republican appointees [ who ] waited like the strategic reserves of an embattled army . "
Walsh recognized that many of the appeals judges held a " continuing political allegiance " to the conservative Federalist Society , an organization dedicated to purging liberalism from the federal courts .
" It reminded me of the communist front groups of the 1940s and 1950s , whose members were committed to the communist cause and subject to communist direction but were not card - carrying members of the Communist Party , " Walsh wrote .
[ For details , see Walsh 's Firewall . ]
A leader of this partisan faction was Judge Laurence H. Silberman , a bombastic character known for his decidedly injudicious temperament .
Silberman had served as a foreign policy advisor to Ronald Reagan 's 1980 campaign and had joined in a controversial contact with an emissary from Iran behind President Carter 's back .
[ See Robert Parry 's Trick or Treason . ]
On the appeals court , Silberman took hardline conservative positions and demonstrated an animosity toward Walsh during a hearing on the constitutionality of independent counsels .
Silberman also lashed out publicly at U.S. Appeals Court Judge George MacKinnon , an old - school Republican who ran the three - judge panel which had picked Walsh to investigate the Iran - contra affair in 1986 .
" At a D.C. circuit conference , he [ Silberman ] had gotten into a shouting match about independent counsel with Judge George MacKinnon , " Walsh wrote .
" Silberman not only had hostile views but seemed to hold them in anger . "
To Walsh 's dismay , Silberman and another conservative judge , David Sentelle , were two of the three judges to hear the appeal of North 's conviction .
A North Carolina protege of Sen. Jesse Helms , Sentelle was not as obstreperous as Silberman .
But Sentelle carried with him a pugnacious pride in his Republican conservatism .
Sentelle had served as chairman of the Mecklenburg County Republican Party and had been a Reagan delegate at the 1984 GOP convention .
He named his daughter , Reagan , after the president .
Though normally law - and - order judges , Silberman and Sentelle overturned North 's conviction by expanding the protections that a witness receives from a grant of limited immunity .
In 1991 , Sentelle again served with another Republican judge as the majority on the Poindexter appeal .
This time , the GOP judges overturned the convictions by applying a novel argument : that lying to Congress did not constitute the crime of obstruction .
Ironically , by expanding the rights of defendants , Sentelle became a conservative judicial hero .
Sentelle also wasnt shy about joining the ideological battle against the left .
In the winter 1991 issue of the conservative Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy , Sentelle praised the writings of right - wing jurist Robert Bork .
" Leftist heretics perceive our system of separated and federated powers as a stumbling block to their goal of remaking the Republic into a collectivist , egalitarian , materialistic , race - conscious , hyper - secular , and socially permissive state , " Sentelle wrote .
Sentelle and Bork shared the view that the American left was riding roughshod over the nation .
" Modern liberalism , " according to Bork 's 1996 book , Slouching Toward Gomorrah , " is what fascism looks like when it has captured significant institutions , most notably the universities , but has no possibility of becoming a mass movement . "
Only " the rise of an energetic , optimistic and politically sophisticated religious conservatism " can counter " the extremists of modern liberalism , " Bork argued .
[ For an examination of the intellectual underpinnings of the new religious conservatism , see The New York Times Magazine , Oct. 11 , 1998 . ]
Unlike Bork , however , Sentelle had the opportunity to do more than fume about a domineering left .
After the North and Poindexter reversals , Sentelle caught the eye of another Reagan appointee , Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist .
Amid mounting Republican anger over Walshs Iran - contra probe , Rehnquist removed MacKinnon , the judge who had picked and protected Walsh .
In an interview , Walsh told me that he received a call from MacKinnon in early 1992 .
MacKinnon , who like Walsh was an Eisenhower - type Republican , had troubling news : Rehnquist was appointing Sentelle to head the three - judge panel that chooses and oversees special prosecutors .
" He was giving me a heads up , " Walsh said , adding that it was clear that MacKinnon would have liked to continue in the post .
" He really loved that job . "
MacKinnon died in 1995 , but his widow , Elizabeth , confirmed Walsh 's account that her husband did not want to be replaced .
" If Rehnquist had asked him to stay on , he probably would have , " she told me .
Rehnquist has never explained publicly why he replaced MacKinnon with Sentelle .
But the Sentelle choice was unusual in several respects .
First , the 1978 Ethics in Government Act , which created the independent counsel apparatus , specifically stated that " priority shall be given to senior circuit judges and retired judges , " a stipulation that was meant to minimize partisanship and careerism .
Unlike the senior judges who had filled the slots since 1978 , Sentelle was relatively young , in his 40s .
Sentelle also had a reputation as an active Republican , while most of the judges on the panel were known as relatively non-partisan .
" They were reformers first and party members second , " commented Walsh .
Sentelle 's choice reversed that pattern .
Ted Arrington , a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , said Sentelle " takes politics seriously enough that he would do what it takes to make sure his party comes out on top . "
[ Legal Times , March 24 , 1997 ]
In the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary for 1998 , lawyers described Sentelle as a staunch conservative .
Sentelle " has a very conservative outlook , " said one lawyer .
" He is conservative and very opinionated , " commented another .
The elevation of Sentelle to be chief of the independent - counsel panel effectively gave the Republican Right control over who would get to investigate crimes in both Republican and Democratic administrations .
Not surprisingly , Sentelle 's panel has steered nearly all sensitive investigations into the hands of reliable Republicans .
When the Bush administration was caught searching Bill Clinton 's passport file in 1992 , Sentelle gave the job to Republican stalwart Joseph diGenova , who found no wrongdoing .
Yet , after Clinton took office , alleged Democratic miscreants found themselves pursued by aggressive Republican prosecutors , even for relatively minor offenses .
When Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros was accused of understating how much he paid a mistress , Sentelle picked David Barrett , who had run Lawyers for Reagan in 1980 .
Barrett racheted the alleged false statements into an 18 - count felony indictment .
The Whitewater investigation began in 1994 during a lapse in the special prosecutor law , so Reno named Republican Robert Fiske to investigate .
Fiske , however , offended Sentelle 's ally , Sen. Lauch Faircloth , R - N.C. , by concluding that White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster had committed suicide .
Faircloth suspected foul play .
After the special prosecutor law was reinstated in summer 1994 , Sentelle lunched with Faircloth and Helms .
Sentelle then fired Fiske and replaced him with Starr , considered a far more conservative Republican .
The three North Carolina Republicans denied that they discussed Whitewater over lunch .
Nevertheless , the Starr appointment raised eyebrows .
Besides political differences with Clinton , Starr had been working on a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of Paula Jones , a former Arkansas state employee who had filed a conservative - backed civil suit against Clinton for alleged sexual harassment .
At the time , however , Starr 's defenders argued that the Jones matter was separate from the questions about Clinton 's personal finances raised by the Whitewater controversy .
Only in January 1998 , after Starr pushed his way into the Monica Lewinsky case -- which arose from the Paula Jones suit -- were questions asked about Starr 's potential conflicts of interest .
Those questions sharpened in October with release of more Lewinsky evidence .
In mid-October , National Public Radio brought attention to Starr 's larger role in the Paula Jones case in 1994 .
NPR reported that Starr met the Jones lawyers half a dozen times .
But Starr did not disclose these contacts when he approached Reno in 1988 .
" It just did not occur that it was relevant , " said Starr spokesman Charles G. Bakaly III .
[ WP , Oct. 17 , 1998 ]
Starr also kept out of his impeachment report to Congress the fact that friendly conservative lawyers close to the Jones legal team tipped him off to the Lewinsky case in early January .
Starr said he first learned about Lewinsky when Tripp called on Jan. 12 , 1998 .
The New York Times reported that three conservative lawyers with close ties to Starr played " the role of go - between " connecting Tripp to Starr .
All three lawyers -- including Richard W. Porter , a partner of Starr's at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis -- were members of the Federalist Society , which is closely allied with both Starr and Sentelle .
[ NYT , Oct. 4 , 1998 ]
Porter 's role was particularly sensitive because of the law partnership with Starr and Porter 's involvement in prior investigations into Clinton 's private life .
The Times quoted Tripp 's conservative literary agent Lucianne Goldberg as saying that another conservative lawyer , Jerome M. Marcus , was used as " a cutout " to conceal Porter 's hand in the operation .
Goldberg , who was a dirty trickster for Richard Nixon 's 1972 campaign , said she relished the covert shenanigans .
" It was cloak and dagger , " she laughed , " just like the old Nixon years . "
Journalist Murray
Waas later explained that a reason for the secrecy around Porter was his " opposition research " on Clinton 's sex life for the 1992 Bush campaign .
That investigation was privately financed by Peter W. Smith , a Chicago financier and a major fund - raiser for Speaker Gingrich .
[ Salon , Oct. 6 , 1998 / www.salon1999.com/]
According to American Spectator writer David Brock , Smith pressed Brock into writing an article about Clinton 's personal life which appeared in December 1993 .
The story mentioned Clinton 's alleged liaison with a " Paula . "
Reacting to the article , Paula Jones came forward and filed suit against Clinton with advice from conservative lawyers .
Starrs partner , Porter , therefore , connects the Paula Jones case to the Monica Lewinsky case .
Also suggestive of a prosecutorial bias was Starr 's grant of immunity to Lewinsky and Tripp despite evidence that they had committed potentially more serious crimes than Clinton .
In her grand jury testimony , Lewinsky admitted writing the so - called " talking points " which coached Tripp how to dodge expected questions about the Clinton - Lewinsky relationship .
Lewinsky gave the three pages to Tripp on Jan. 14 , and they quickly became a centerpiece of Starr 's investigation .
Based on leaks , the media speculated that Clinton or his aide Bruce Lindsey had drafted the talking points .
Newsweek termed the papers a possible " smoking gun " proving Clinton 's complicity in an obstruction of justice .
But the speculation was wrong , according to Lewinsky 's testimony .
" Ms. Lewinsky testified that she wrote the document herself , although some of the ideas may have been inspired by conversations with Ms. Tripp , " Starr said in his impeachment report to Congress .
When the medias speculation bubble burst , the press barely mentioned the " talking points " again .
Possibly the most serious crime revealed by the evidence in Starrs report was the apparent Lewinsky - Tripp conspiracy to blackmail the president into granting Lewinsky a cushy job .
The clumsy plot -- sounding like " Fargo " in Valley Girl talk -- began with Lewinskys demand for another job at the White House in summer 1997 .
On July 3 , Lewinsky wrote Clinton a " dear sir " letter with a clear warning that she would start talking if he did not grant her wishes .
Unless a White House job was arranged , she would " need to explain to my parents exactly why that was n't happening . "
In her testimony , Lewinsky added that she wanted to remind Clinton that she had " left the White House like a good girl in April of ' 96 " while others might have used a disclosure threat then to avoid the transfer .
Clinton and Lewinsky both understood the suggestion of blackmail .
Clinton met with her on July 4 and , according to Lewinsky , he scolded her that " it 's illegal to threaten the President of the United States . "
By then , Clinton knew Lewinsky 's anger was a threat .
In his grand jury testimony , he stated that " she got angry when she did n't get in sometimes .
I knew that that might make her more likely to speak , and I still did it because I had to limit the contact . "
On Oct , 6 , 1997 , with a tape - recorder rolling , Tripp prodded Lewinsky with an Iago - like message : that the White House was full of negative rumors about Lewinsky and that she would never work there again .
Tripp mocked Lewinskys modest demands .
" Oh , Monica , Monica , Monica , " Tripp said .
" For people who are not even in any situation , they can do better . "
Lewinsky 's response indicated that Tripp has pushed her toward trading on her personal secrets before .
" Oh , Linda , please do n't start with me on that , " Lewinsky grumbled .
" He would want to do better , so do n't limit him is what I 'm saying , " Tripp continued .
Lewinsky rehearsed the job pitch she would give Clinton : " This is what I am making .
This is what I should be making .
This is what I 'd like to make . "
Tripp urged Lewinsky to push for a high salary .
" New York , " Tripp said , " the cost of living is even higher than here . "
Then , in a reference to the idea of pressuring Clinton , Tripp added , " What I 'm saying is this is done routinely . "
" But , " Lewinsky said , " the reason it 's done is not routine .
I think that 's going to scare the [ deleted ] out of him . "
" Well , no , " added Tripp , " because actually , he does n't have to establish the [ pay ] grade .
That 's , that 's out of his hands .
... I would just say let 's not limit yourself . "
Lewinsky announced that she wanted two things from Clinton .
First , he had to " acknowledge ... that he helped fuck up my life , " and secondly , he would have to deliver a job that she would not otherwise get .
" I do n't want to have to work for this position , " Lewinsky declared .
" I just want it to be given to me . "
Lewinsky said she would write to Clinton proposing a meeting to " work on some way that I can come out of this situation not feeling the way I do .
In the Oct. 7 letter , Lewinsky wrote , " I 'd like to ask you to help me secure a position in NY beginning 1 December .
I would be very grateful , and I am hoping this is a solution for both of us . "
On Oct. 10 , Clinton exploded .
In a phone call , he alluded again to her threatening behavior .
Lewinsky quoted him as saying , " If I had known what kind of person you really were , I would n't have gotten involved with you . "
Tripp urged Lewinsky to take other actions that would later be used to incriminate Clinton .
Tripp proposed enlisting Clintons friend , Vernon Jordan , to help in the job search .
Tripp urged Lewinsky , too , to save the semen - stained dress so it could be evidence against Clinton if he denied the affair .
" It could be your only insurance policy down the road , " Tripp said .
Normally , explicit statements of an extortion plot and a plan to save evidence to enforce the blackmail would make a prima facie case against Lewinsky and Tripp .
But Starr granted immunity to the plotters and went after Clinton for dissembling about a sexual affair in a civil lawsuit .
Clintons deceptive testimony before the Jones lawyers in January and his tortured testimony before Starrs grand jury in August were enough for Starr to conclude that an impeachable offense had been committed .
The findings handed the impeachment baton off to Gingrich and the congressional Republicans .
But if the GOP House performs as expected , another black - robed Republican then would step in for the final lap .
Chief Justice Rehnquist , who got the impeachment race started by appointing Sentelle , would preside over Clintons trial in the Senate .

Oh , I see .
The Republican National Committee maintains this server .
The Washington Post mentioned this in its Wednesday 's story on Gonzales ---
Jennings used an e-mail account registered to the Republican National Committee , where Griffin had worked as an opposition researcher .
Democratic congressional aides said they will investigate whether using the private address for government business violated laws against using taxpayer resources for political work or signaled that White House officials considered the firing of U.S. attorneys to be primarily a political issue .
Jennings did not return a call to his office seeking a comment .
" As a matter of course , the RNC provides server space and equipment to certain White House personnel in order to assist them with their political efforts , " RNC spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said .
DeepSouthdoug blogged yesterday , in Send " kr " Your Love on Karl Rove 's outside email account , kr@georgebush.com .
His blog was based on this WaPo article by Dan Fromklin .
Fromkin asked the WH a these questions , all of which were n't answered :
Does White House policy allow White House staffers to use non-White House e-mail addresses for official White House business ?
Does it prohibit it ?
What is the policy ?
Would these e-mails be treated any differently from official White House e-mails when it comes to archiving or subpoena purposes ?
Does it create either impropriety or the appearance of impropriety that gwb43.com is a domain owned by the Republican National Committee ?
Do other White House staffers regularly use non-White House e-mail accounts for White House business , and if so , why ?
Since then , several readers have e-mailed me with their own questions and comments .
So I 've added four more , passed those along as well , and still no response : Does non-White House e-mail fulfill security requirements for White House communications ?
If other non-White House e-mail accounts are used , who are the providers for all of the other accounts ?
( Any others besides the RNC ? )
Does White House policy allow White House staffers to use non-White House e-mail addresses from their computers , even for non-official business ?
I 'm told that during the Clinton administration , access to external e-mail , including Web mail , was shut off from White House ( eop.gov ) computers .
Was there a conscious change of policy by the Bush administration ?
Have there been any recent changes in policy relating to e-mail practices , or are changes in policy contemplated ?
He also wonders who maintains the domain that Karl used , georgebush.com .

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit Wednesday that accused a Boeing Co. subsidiary of helping the Central Intelligence Agency facilitate “ the forced disappearance , torture and inhumane treatment ” of three men the government suspected of terrorist involvement .
“ This is the first time we are accusing a blue - chip American company of profiting from torture , ” ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner said at a news conference in New York City .
Since at least 2001 , Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. of San Jose “ has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so - called ‘ extraordinary rendition ’ program , ” the suit , filed in San Jose federal court , alleges .
Extraordinary rendition is a highly secretive and extrajudicial practice of transferring terrorist suspects to third - party countries that routinely practice torture and other ill - treatment , according to Human Rights Watch .
After years of denial , the Bush administration now acknowledges the tactic but denies sanctioning torture .

The suit was filed on behalf of Binyam Mohammed , a 28 - year - old Ethiopian citizen and British resident ; Abou Elkassim Britel , a 40 - year - old of Moroccan descent naturalized in Italy ; and Ahmed Agiza , a 45 - year - old Egyptian .
But the suit said that Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services for more than 70 extraordinary renditions over a four - year period .
“ Corporations should expect to get sued where they are making blood money off the suffering of others , ” said Clive Stafford Smith , a British lawyer who has been representing Mohammed and is serving as co-counsel on the ACLU suit .
Mike Pound , a Jeppesen spokesman , said the company had not been served with the suit and consequently had no comment on its merits .
Tim Neale , a spokesman for Chicago - based Boeing , declined to confirm whether Jeppesen worked for the CIA .
“ The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers , ” he said .

ACLU attorney Steven Watt said his organization had obtained information about Jeppesen ’s role in the rendition program from a variety of sources , including investigations in Spain , Sweden and Italy ; other court cases ; and media reports , in particular a New Yorker magazine article by Jane Mayer , portions of which were quoted in the lawsuit .
Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that he had heard a senior company official say at a board meeting : “ We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights -- you know the torture flights .
Let ’s face it , some of these flights end up that way . ”
The suit describes the airplanes used to move the three men around , and states that Jeppesen played a critical role by providing flight planning services , including itinerary , route , weather and fuel planning , as well as customs clearance assistance , ground transportation , food , hotels and security , the suit states .
The suit goes into considerable detail on what allegedly happened to each of the men .
The accounts include :

* Mohammed was taken into custody in Pakistan in April 2002 , tortured by Pakistani agents and interrogated by U.S. and British intelligence agents about his alleged ties to Al Qaeda .
Subsequently , Mohammed was flown to Morocco , where he was detained , interrogated and tortured at a series of detention facilities .
“ He was routinely beaten , suffering broken bones and , on occasion , loss of consciousness due to the beatings .
His clothes were cut off with a scalpel and the same scalpel was then used to make incisions on his body , including his penis .
A hot stinging liquid was then poured into open wounds on his penis where he had been cut , ” the suit says .
Mohammed eventually was flown to Afghanistan , then to Guantanamo Bay Naval Station , where he remains .

* Britel , an Italian Arabic translator , traveled from his home in Italy to Pakistan in March 2002 on business .
He was arrested by Pakistani police on immigration charges , interrogated , beaten and subjected to sleep deprivation .
In April 2002 , he “ succumbed and confessed to what his interrogators had been insisting from the outset , that he was a terrorist , ” the suits says .
Subsequently , U.S. officials in Pakistan told Britel that the Pakistani interrogators would kill him if he did not cooperate .
In late May 2002 , Britel “ was handcuffed , blindfolded and taken by car ” to an airport on the outskirts of Lahore and flown to Rabat , Morocco .
In October 2003 , Britel was convicted and sentenced to 15 years for involvement in terrorist activities .
An observer from the Italian Embassy said “ the procedures followed failed to comport with universally accepted fair trial standards . ”
Britel remains imprisoned in Casablanca .
* The third plaintiff , Agiza , was first arrested in 1982 in connection with the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat .
He moved to Iran , and in 1999 was tried in absentia in Egypt for being a member of a banned organization and sentenced to 25 years in prison .

In 2000 , Agiza sought asylum in Sweden , where he was arrested by Swedish security police , handed over to CIA agents , shackled , drugged and flown from Stockholm to Cairo .
In Egypt , he was repeatedly subjected to torture , which included the use of electric shocks , the suit says .
In April 2004 , after a military trial , Agiza was sentenced again to 25 years imprisonment , later reduced to 15 years .
He remains in prison in Egypt .
The ACLU suit was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789 , which authorizes foreigners to sue in U.S. courts for human rights violations .
The CIA was not named as a defendant but may ask to have the case dismissed under the “ state secrets ” doctrine .
First recognized by the Supreme Court 54 years ago , the states secret privilege bars disclosure in court proceedings of information whose release threatens national security .

Last March , a federal appeals court in Richmond , Va. , citing the state secrets doctrine , dismissed a suit brought against the CIA by Khaled El Masri , a German citizen who said he was abducted , flown to Afghanistan and tortured .
ACLU lawyers said Wednesday that they had filed a petition that asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the El Masri decision .
Romero said the Bush administration had invoked the state secrets privilege in an attempt to “ avoid accountability and embarrassment ” for torture and other government misdeeds in its war on terrorism .
In response to a request for comment , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said , “ The CIA does not , as a matter of course , publicly discuss contractual relationships it may or may not have with firms or individuals . ”

The renditions , he said , “ are a key , lawful tool in the fight against terror ... subject to close review and have been employed far less frequently than some press accounts suggest . ”
Gimigliano also said the United States does not conduct or condone torture , or transport anyone to other countries to be tortured .

A house is the greatest asset most of us have .
As such , we should always try to take preventive measures to protect the house from any kind of damage .
However , sometimes the weather conditions get severe and the home ( particularly the roof ) gets damaged from strong winds , hail or other kinds of harsh weather .
This makes home insurance a necessity for your home to cover for damages in the unfortunate case the above disasters strike .
Wind , hail and storm damages are a loss on your homeowner ’s insurance policy .
The insurance company is required to pay the entire cost minus your deductible for repairing and replacing all the problems associated with the roof .
Also , an insurance company should not use such disasters to raise your rates as they are considered natural disasters which should not count against you personally .
In addition to being the best roof repair and installation contractors around , we are also well versed in residential and commercial insurance work .

Before filing any claims , it is important to understand your deductibles as agreed upon by the insurance company .
Deductibles vary from one insurance company to another .
You should understand your responsibility for the deductible before filing the claims .
The next logical step is to contact your insurance company to come and assess your damage .
This assessment is similar to the one we perform .
After the assessment , we will ask you to serve us with a copy of your insurance adjuster ’s summary report .
We then go through the report to review the adjuster ’s scope of work .
We check all measurements to ensure damages have been fairly evaluated and that they are accurately reported .
Shortly after the adjuster ’s assessment , the insurance company normally sends a check of the amount needed to rectify the damages .
We will analyze this paperwork and advise you whether it is accurate considering the damages .
Here , we give our clients reliable professional advice as well as help minimize overwhelming aspects of the claim process .
Once the insurance company approves the claim , a homeowner has a set time frame within which the repairs must be made .
Our roofing technicians will advise you on the materials needed for the roof repairs or replacement .
In case your house has a mortgage , the insurance check will require approval from your mortgage company .

Anyone who thinks that the super - rich , the rich , and the wanna - be rich who comprise Wall Street are defenders of prosperity in the name of the middle class is terminally naïve .
He is confusing Wall Street with the free market .
The free market is the great friend of all classes .
Through the division of labor engendered by private ownership , the free market supplies ever - increasing quantities of goods and services for all classes , but especially the middle class .
People in the lower classes can legitimately hope to enter the middle class .
A few will become rich .
There is a price for this upward access to greater wealth : the possibility of a fall into poverty .
This is a greater threat to the rich than to the middle class .
The rich are at the far right edge of the bell - shaped curve .
There are few of them .
Their position is insecure , for good reason .
The free market rewards those sellers who serve consumers efficiently , wasting few scarce resources .
Consumers are a fickle bunch .
They keep asking sellers , “ What have you done for us lately ? ”
There are always many competitors trying to get rich .
They are ready to replace today ’s rich people .
Today ’s rich people know this .
They are therefore ready and willing to pull up the ladder that enabled them to replace yesterday ’s rich .
The free market ’s ladder of mobility — upward and downward — is based on these legal principles : open entry of new buyers and new sellers , the predictable enforcement of contracts , and the absence of government favoritism of any special - interest group .
These principles should also govern the monetary system .
They have never done so perfectly , and ever since 1914 , hardly at all .
Because of the tremendous profitability of legalized counterfeiting , fractional reserve banking has always been based on two principles : ( 1 ) keeping out new counterfeiters , who would debase the currency through price competition — mass paper money inflation — and thereby end the game of wealth - redistribution from depositors to bankers ; ( 2 ) the creation of a central bank that protects today ’s commercial banks from bank runs by depositors .
The fractional reserve banking system is engaged in a war against depositors and also a war against people on fixed incomes , who are unable to hedge their assets against monetary depreciation .
The depositors get their pittance , based on the money they deposited .
The bankers then multiply these small deposits through fractional reserve banking and thereby enjoy income from many interest - paying borrowers .
The threat to bankers arises when depositors realize that a bank is insolvent — lent long and borrowed short — and start demanding their money back in currency .
This is the nightmare scenario for bankers .
They do not want depositors to catch on to the obvious : their money is being used to create multiple loans , meaning multiple new income streams for banks .
They do not want depositors to kill the goose that lays the fiat money eggs for bankers .
How ?
By pulling out their money in currency and not redepositing this currency in another bank .
Bankers know what happened to over 6,000 small , federally unprotected banks , 1929 — 32 , and they never want to see it again .
Enter the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , semi-private , profit - seeking protectors of the little guy !
And just how is the little guy protected ?
By the full faith and credit of the United States government .
When you think of “ full faith and credit , ” think of the scene in the first “ Superman ” movie .
Lois Lane has just fallen from the top of the Daily Planet ’s building .
Superman flies upward just in time and grabs her .
“ Do n’t worry , miss .
I ’ve got you . ”
To which she replies , “ Who ’s got you ? ”
As in the case of the cosmic elephant , which is standing on the cosmic turtle , what is the turtle standing on ?
It ’s turtles all the way down .
With the Federal government and the FDIC , their full faith and credit stand on two factors : taxation and the Federal Reserve System .
What holds up the Federal government when it can no longer collect enough taxes from the coalition of the unwilling to pay the bills ?
The Federal Reserve ’s fiat money .
It ’s digits all the way down .
FIAT MONEY AND STOCK MARKET BOOMS
If you follow the financial news media , you will notice how much attention is paid to the Federal Funds rate , which is the overnight bank rate .
This is the rate that the Federal Open Market Committee can control directly .
The media reports concentrate on this issue : the expectation of another rate cut .
Whenever the FED is raising this rate , the media never warn the public that this policy could send the U.S. stock markets into a bear market phase .
The words “ bear market ” are cited only in sentences that contain the words “ little possibility of . ”
But when there is even the slightest possibility that the FOMC might lower the FedFunds rate , market commentators get all twiterpated over the possibility of another upward move of stocks .
This is what I call the asymmetric nature of the financial press : “ upward rate move = no problem ; downward rate move = boom ahead . ”
Whenever there is news of slowing employment , the media start talking about the possibility of the FOMC ’s lowering the FedFunds rate : “ That ’s good news for the stock market ! ”
Whenever the employment rate rises , the media start talking about economic growth : “ That ’s good news for the stock market . ”
What is bad news for the stock market ?
Officially speaking , nothing .
Why is the financial press asymmetrical ?
First , the middle class reads the financial press and dreams of getting rich .
Second , Wall Street and its large corporations advertise in the financial press , and therefore shape the content .
Financial editors are careful to exercise self - censorship .
Unlike the non-financial press , which flourishes on bad news —
“ If it bleeds , it leads ” — the financial press is dependent on the flow of good news : “ Buy your piece of the American dream , ” not “ buy your piece of the American nightmare . ”
For evidence , watch the networks ’ evening news shows .
The lead stories are bad news for someone .
Local news shows love a fire .
National news shows love a political scandal .
The “ bad news leads ” format hooks you in the first seven minutes .
Then the ads start coming .
After the ads , you will get a financial report .
If it ’s anything significant ( Dow up or down over 150 points ) , NBC ’s Brian Williams will interview either the 40 - year - old visibly fading woman from CNBC or the 30 - year - old rising CNBC starlet with the premature bags under her eyes .
He never interviews some grizzled survivor of 40 years of popped bubbles and shattered dreams .
They assure the viewers that “ time will tell , ” which means “ tune in to CNBC tomorrow . ”
The FED dominates discussion these days .
Will it lower rates ?
Will it let rates sit ?
By “ rates , ” the media mean the FedFunds rate .
If the FED lowers “ rates ” by waving its magic wand — sorry , scratch that — if the FED debases the dollar more rapidly than today , the broad middle class will receive a lower rate of interest in its bank savings accounts .
This is great for banks , which can now borrow short at a lower rate , such as 3 % , while lending money at 10 % to 30 % to other members of the middle class and the poor , who are addicted to credit card debt .
The spread between borrowed funds and loaned funds widens .
This is the dream of the financial sector .
Why do n’t credit card rates fall ?
Because consumers who use credit card debt are not sophisticated .
They do not shop for better rates .
Even when they do , they do not read the fine print of the new contract , which allows the card company to double or triple the introductory rate if the borrower falls behind on a payment , even a payment to a company in no way connected to the credit card .
Conclusion : a free market society enforces contracts .
It does not protect those people who refuse to read their contracts or cannot understand them .
Lesson : if you do n’t understand the fine print , do n’t sign the contract , e.g. , the credit card application .
Lower rates produce an economic boom .
Businessmen borrow from banks to take advantage of the expected boom .
Banks make more money .
But if long - term rates are not higher than short - term rates , banks do n’t make much money .
Today , long rates are barely above short rates .
Meanwhile , large banks are still losing big money in the subprime mortgage market .
The Bank of America and J. P. Morgan
Chase are expected this month to declare a combined $ 3 billion write - down because of subprime mortgages .
This brings the total to $ 20 billion at the world ’s largest banks since this summer .
This has only just begun .
MarketWatch has just started a Subprime Today e-letter option .
They see a new trend coming , and they plan to take advantage of it !
Wall Street flourishes when the central bank creates fiat money to buy assets — any assets — that can legally be monetized .
This does not include furniture or new cars .
It does include the debts of furniture companies and auto companies .
It even includes their market - listed shares .
So , when you hear about the “ good news ” that the FED is about to lower rates , it is not good news if you have money in a bank account or a money market fund .
Wall Street does not care about the plight of the middle - class lender who deposits money at 3 % in his bank , only to suffer 2 % to 3 % price inflation , after paying 20 % or more to various governments on the interest received .
The middle - class saver is the loser when Wall Street screams its way into the thinking of the FOMC .
Jim Cramer threw a tantrum .
The FOMC responded .
The dependence of Wall Street on a continuing stream of new fiat money is very high .
If this flow of funds were to cease , Wall Street would go into withdrawal seizures .
The various stock markets would plummet .
This cannot be allowed , say Wall Street ’s many spokesmen .
This would “ harm America . ”
So , the FED is called on to continue the flow of counterfeit funds , multiplied through the fractional reserve process .
The losers are those people who trust the banking system and deposit their money .
The other losers are those who are on fixed incomes or close to fixity .
They pay higher prices for whatever they buy .
The resulting boom on Wall Street comes out of their lifestyles .
When Wall Street and its media mouthpieces call for another cut in the FedFunds rate to “ keep the American dream alive , ” they mean the dream of corporate insiders whose stock option plans are being threatened by the readjustment in capital values posed by stable money .
They do not mean the broad mass of Americans , whose savings , if any , pays 3 % , which barely equal their credit card debt , which charges 15 % .
MOST AMERICANS WEAR THREE HATS
Most Americans wear three hats : their thrift hats , their debt hats , and their wage hats .
Their thrift hats are today almost an afterthought .
Only 56 % of American households actually saved any money in 2004 .
They do n’t have large retirement funds .
The average American , as of 2004 , had a net worth of under $ 95,000 .
That was the median figure : half of Americans above , half below .
Of this value , well over 60 % was the value of their residences .
Retirement ?
Living on Social Security ?
Those in the 50 to 75 age range had a median net worth of $ 171,000 .
But most of this was the value of their homes .
They will have to pay for space somewhere .
In terms of liquid assets to invest and live off the earnings , they are in very bad shape .
For the data , see the report , “ Recent Changes in U.S. Family Finances : Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances , ” Federal Reserve Bulletin ( Feb. 2006 ) .
Their debt hats pressure them monthly .
They have to pay the bills .
They are hard - pressed to save .
They worry about meeting their monthly expenses .
This gets their attention .
If they were to lose their jobs for two months , they would be in trouble .
Rising interest rates threaten them .
So they are with Wall Street ’s call for the FED to lower rates .
They wear wage hats .
They are far more worried about losing their jobs than they are about price inflation under 3 % .
They do n’t understand that the means for lowering rates — monetary expansion — threatens to raise prices .
These hats are all present hats .
They take precedence over future hats .
Retirement is way off in the distance .
They ’ll think about it tomorrow .
Or the day after tomorrow .
So , when the Wall Street wizards perceive a looming decline in their stock portfolios , they call for the FED to intervene and save the various stock markets .
The voters like low interest rates , so they do n’t complain .
The wizards get support from the broad masses , who are threatened by the return of monetary expansion .
The wizards have their futures tied to the stock market and bond market .
They are not interested in the plight of the average American .
The fact that price inflation is a threat to the average American ’s way of life is of no concern to the wizards .
CONCLUSION
We see today a clash between the long - run interests of the middle class and the short - run interests of those who make their living in the financial markets .
Because the process of economic cause and effect is not understood by the media , and because it is not understood by the average American , the wizards of Wall Street get away with their endless pleas to the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates .
Nobody in the mainstream media ever asks : “ But how can the FED lower rates , year after year ? ”
The world really does believe in magic .
They believe that the FOMC committee merely has to issue a press release promising to lower the FedFunds rate and , wonder of wonders , the rate is lowered cost - free .
Nobody asks : “ Why not just reduce it to zero ? ”
My sense of the FED today is that it will not lower the FedFunds rate again at the end of October .
In late August , I was sure the FOMC would lower the rate by half a point on September 18 .
It did .
I do n’t think they are facing equal pressure from Wall Street today .
For the sake of the U.S. dollar , let us hope I am correct .

Joe A. recently had some troubles at work .
Joe works for a company that runs scrolling marquee signs using a markup language similar to HTML .
It 's a small company , run by two guys we 'll call Tom and Bill .
Tom is the technical lead and main owner .
The business was his idea to begin with .
Bill , on the other hand , came from an accounting background and does n't have much technical knowledge .
Joe , as a technical guy , always reported to Tom .
Things were going great .
Tom made Joe feel at ease , and due to Tom 's technical background , he was never surprised by the cost of servers and software licenses .
The company was growing , though , and Tom became harder and harder to get a hold of .
He 'd come in to work , close his office door , work secluded for eight or more hours , and leave .
If someone wanted to talk to him , they 'd have to go through his secretary .
One day , Joe got an email from Tom , saying that Joe would have to report to Bill now .
Because Bill had little to no technical knowledge , it was n't working great .
Bill did n't understand why hardware and software cost so much , and would always recommend cost cutting measures that did n't make sense for the business .
One morning , Joe came in to work , unlocked his office , and logged in as usual .
Within five minutes , Bill stormed into Joe 's office and demanded to know why their server was n't running .
Bill :
The phone 's been ringing off the hook today !
I 've gotten like 20 calls from angry customers and it's not even 9:00 yet !
What happened ?
Joe : I 'm not sure ...
I mean , I did n't change anything .
Just give me a second to look into this .
Their main server was housed locally , so Joe started diagnosing the issue right away .
The problem was immediately apparent once he logged in — there was no internet connection .
He reseated the cables and still did n't have any luck .
He returned to his desk and confirmed that his workstation had no internet access either .
Joe went back to Bill to report his findings .
Joe : I figured it out ; the internet connection is dead .
I 'll call the ISP and see if they have an ETA for a fix .
Bill : " ISP ? "
Joe : Internet Service Provider .
Bill : Oh ... uh , I think I know why the internet is down , but that should n't matter .
Joe : ( sigh ) Yeah ...?
Bill : I stopped paying the bill three months ago .
I mean , we only use email , anyway — I do n't see why we need the whole expensive internet !
Though Bill is still blissfully unaware of the reason it 's necessary , Joe managed to get him to start paying those irritating bills again .
In The Magic of Starting Small , I made the point that it is your days that define your life .
In this article , I want to challenge the common perception that it is only possible to enjoy your leisure time .
In particular , this article is targeted at the professional stuck in the 9 to 5 grind who longs for the weekend and , in the process , has given up on trying to find pleasure in the ordinary experiences we have every day .
1. Appreciate Beauty .
Each day we come across beauty in a number of shapes and forms .
It ’s a shame , then , that many people have become so accustomed to this beauty that it largely goes unappreciated .
I suggest looking again at the people , plants , gadgets , and buildings ( to name but a few examples ) around you and taking a moment to appreciate what makes them so special .
2. Connect With Nature .
Nature is an amazing healer for the stresses and strains of modern life .
Eating lunch in the park , attending to a vegetable garden in your backyard , or watching the sunset are just a few simple ideas for how you can enjoy the outdoors on a daily basis .
3. Laugh .
E. E. Cummings once said “ the most wasted of all days is one without laughter . ”
How very true .
Never be too busy to laugh , or too serious to smile .
Instead , surround yourself with fun people and do n’t get caught up in your own sense of importance .
4. Have Simple Pleasures .
A good cup of coffee when I first wake .
Time spent playing with my 8 month old son .
Cooking a nice meal in the evening .
These may not seem terribly exciting , but they are some of the simple pleasures I enjoy in life .
If you slow down for just a moment and take the time to appreciate these ordinary events , life becomes instantly more enjoyable .
5. Connect With People .
In so many ways , it is our relationships with people that give us the most happiness in life .
Perhaps , then , the best way to enjoy your work more is not to get a raise or a promotion , but rather to build rewarding relationships with your co-workers .
6. Learn .
There is a strong link between learning and happiness .
Given this , there is no excuse not to be stimulating your brain and learning something new each day .
My favorite way to find time for learning is to make the most of the commute to and from work .
Audiobooks and podcasts are great for this purpose .
7. Rethink Your Mornings and Evenings .
Are the mornings a mad rush for you to get out the door ?
Do you switch off the TV at night and go straight to bed ?
I have personally experienced the profound benefits of establishing a routine in the morning and evening .
For example , in the morning you may choose to wake an hour earlier and spend the time working on yourself , whether it be reading , writing or exercising .
In the evening , consider spending some time just before bed reviewing your day or in meditation .
8. Celebrate Your Successes .
During a normal day we are sure to have some minor successes .
Perhaps you have successfully dealt with a difficult customer , made a sale , or received a nice compliment for your work .
These are n’t events worth throwing a party for , but why not take a moment to celebrate your success ?
Share the experience with someone else , reward yourself with a nice lunch , or just give yourself a mental pat on the back .

Question behind the question :
All things being equal ( libraries , etc ) does it support a better mental framework for development than ruby , python , etc ?
A few miles west of Cincinnati , near the northern Kentucky town of Petersburg , there ’s a gleaming new monument to Christianist ideology called the Creation Museum .
It was built by an Australian Biblical literalist named Ken Ham , the founder of Answers in Genesis , at a cost of twenty - seven million dollars , raised mostly in small donations .
It opened over Memorial Day weekend with a blast of media attention ( Edward Rothstein wrote two pieces about it for the New York Times ) , and since then ten thousand people a week have been flocking to its exhibits .
Last Sunday , on a visit to my in - laws in Lexington , I joined them .
The sixty - thousand - square - foot museum mimics the language , layout , and technical effects of state - of - the - art science museums : mastodon fossils and mineral crystals , soaring dioramas of life - size animatronic dinosaurs , several movie theatres , conference rooms , cafés , even a planetarium , and an echoing soundtrack of bird calls .
But , as you pay your $ 19.95 and walk through the entry hall , there are clues that this is all a sophisticated sham .
( Thanks to Porter Jarrard for the photographs . )
The simulation serves a primitive ideology known as “ young - earth creationism , ” which promotes the idea that the earth is just over six thousand years old and that the fossil record appeared after the Flood , around 4300 B.C.
The first rooms ease you into this mental scenery with a soft sell : the Grand Canyon is discussed in pseudo - scientific terms as possible evidence of the Flood .
But as you get into the farther chambers of the museum — which , like the Holocaust Museum in Washington , forces you along a single channel , so that one overwhelming narrative is imposed on every visitor — the message is didactic and clear : Voltaire was “ an infidel philosopher . ”
The Scopes trial was the beginning of the end .
“ Scripture abandoned in the culture ” has led to porn addiction , out - of - wedlock pregnancy , divorce , religious relativism , child neglect , and genocide .
“ Human reason ” has replaced “ God ’s Word , ” with horrific consequences .
Just when the displays are depicting total despair in the modern world , you come out into the Garden of Eden and a soothing diorama of an attractive and prelapsarian Adam and Eve lounging in a waterfall pool surrounded by lilies .
The Creation Museum takes the usual trajectory of science education and turns it upside down : the Enlightenment initiated the dark ages , and only the discovery of Biblical truth can lead us out of it .
There ’s very little attempt to persuade visitors with even spurious scientific argument .
The truth is asserted within a hermetically closed system of belief .
For example , the explanation of the fossil record :
Views about fossils have come and gone .
But fossils themselves do not tell us where these creatures come from or how they died .
Fortunately we have another source of factual data — the first book of the Bible , Genesis .
This book makes it obvious that carnivory , disease , and death , as seen in the fossil record , came after sin .
So the fossil record had to be formed after sin entered the world .
It hardly matters that the Creation Museum is bound to appall secular visitors .
They are not its audience .
It exists to tell Christianist families that they are right and the future is theirs .
I spoke with a family from Columbus , Ohio , who had driven two and a half hours to the museum “ out of sheer curiosity . ”
The mother , a chemist , told me that she was disappointed in the museum ’s closed - mindedness , as when an introductory film spoke of “ atheistic evolution . ”
She believed in evolution , she said , but she also had “ a religious background , ” and wanted to hear “ other points of view . ”
Her teen - age son found the film ’s portrayal of an autocratic high - school science teacher ridiculous .
As far as I could tell , the family from Columbus was in the minority .
Most of the families — overwhelmingly white , mainly blond , and about the most pleasant , cheerful collection of tourists imaginable — seemed to accept what they heard and read as they were coaxed along the explanatory trail , with the children delighted by the cleverly designed animal displays .
This expensive frolic through a sinister fairy tale was made for the young .
Many of the quarter of a million people expected to visit the Creation Museum by the end of the year will be children .
They will be indoctrinated into an ideology that systematically warps their understanding of the physical world and fills them with hostility toward the facts and concepts of modernity .
As we have learned over the past few years , this does n’t mean that they ’ll be outcasts and failures .
A great political party has largely abased itself before their world view and offered them unprecedented access to government power .
The Creation Museum , a combination of a natural - history museum and a Communist Party propaganda center , will help to arm and arouse the next generation of Christianists in the ongoing war against secular and scientific America .
It ’s tempting to treat the museum as an interesting cultural diversion , rather like a guided tour through Colonial Williamsburg , which is how Rothstein , at the the Times , took it .
But the museum ’s creators are more serious than that , and in a sense they have it right : the family from Columbus came looking for a middle ground that does n’t exist .
Either you accept the claims of science , or you might as well believe that dinosaurs made it onto Noah ’s Ark .
This disagreement is the size of the Grand Canyon .
The mass of ordinary visitors were every bit as alien to me as the few Mennonite families in their nineteenth - century bonnets and long beards .
We might speak the same contemporary American dialect , wear the same T - shirts , and eat the same fatty foods , but our basic beliefs are so incompatible that it ’s hard to know what political arrangement could ever satisfy us both .
Rothstein ended one of his reviews by saying that a visitor “ leaves feeling a bit like Adam emerging from Eden , all the world before him , freshly amazed at its strangeness and extravagant peculiarities . ”
My experience was different : I had the sense of being a dissident surrounded by the lies of a totalitarian state , and I kept my reactions to myself .
As I was driving away , I realized what the barrage of falsehoods written on slick signboards reminded me of .
It was the telescreens in “ 1984 . ”
Photographers who shoot with Digital SLRs are accustomed to high quality images , short shutter lag speeds , excellent performance at high ISOs and low light situations , large viewfinders , responsive autofocus systems , the ability to manual focus , and so forth .
However , bringing the large and bulky cameras are not always practical .
Point & shoot cameras offer the benefits and convenience of being smaller , less of a burden to lug around on trips or hikes , are less eye - catching to thieves , are almost always available since they easily fit into your pocket or purse , plus they 're not as goofy to carry around during parties and social gatherings .
Given that many photographers have grown accustomed to the quality and responsiveness of their DSLRs , are there any P&S cameras which can complement , or even replace DSLRs ?
Let 's take a look .
Among the most popular compact cameras purchased by DSLR users are the Fuji F31fd , Canon SD800 IS , and Canon G7 .
We will also take a look at the Panasonic Lumix LX - 1 and the Sigma DP1 .
Each camera has its own specialty , distinct feature set , and particular price point .
Depending on what you plan on shooting most often , one may be more appropriate for you than another .
Fuji F31fd : The " Social " Camera
Fuji 's cameras are incredibly popular primarily due to their high ISO abilities .
Fuji has n't completely succumbed to the megapixel race and in turn , they 've created cameras with fewer megapixels than average , but outstanding low light abilities .
Compact cameras are typically limited to ISO 400 to 800 at best .
With their relatively slow lenses and lack of usable high ISOs , many indoor shots come out very blurry due to subject motion or camera shake .
Fuji remedies this situation thanks to their Super CCD sensor .
At anything over ISO 200 , the Fuji 's sensor blows away the competition .
The F31fd has the ability to shoot all the way up to ISO 3200 which is a rarity among P&S's .
Of course noise level is an issue at 3200 , but it 's less than you 'd expect , especially when compared to other cameras .
Most cameras fall apart at ISO 1600 , but the Fuji holds on enough to produce usable results .
The only way to get better ISO 1600 results is to pull out your DSLR .
Thanks to its remarkable high ISO abilities , the Fuji can better balance ambient light with fill - flash , producing more natural looking results than those from most cameras which try to fire the flash as the main light and underexpose the background .
Outdoors , however , the Fuji 's results are fairly average .
The images may look a little bit flat , but it 's nothing that a little Photoshop can't take care of .
Then again , one of the main appeals of P&S 's is that you do n't need to do lots of post - processing .
The F31 fd features a 3 x zoom ( 36 - 108 mm ) and an f2.8 lens .
The lens could be wider so this is one of the tradeoffs to consider .
The camera uses xD cards so chances are good that you 'll have to buy a new memory card to use just with this camera .
The F31fd is just a minor update to the previous model , the Fuji F30 .
If you do n't need the face detection abilities of the F31fd , the F30 is a nice way to save a few bucks , especially since the camera is now retired and you can pick up a used copy cheaply .
Alternatively , if you do n't need aperture priority or shutter priority shooting modes and fully auto is good enough , as well as if ISO 2000 is good enough for you , you can save a few more dollars by picking up the Fuji F20 .
If you 're looking for a pocketable camera to take with you to social outings , the Fuji F31 fd is your best bet .

Canon SD800 IS : Wide Angle and IS
Most P&S 's are relatively limited in the wide angle department .
For example , the previously mentioned F31 fd only zooms out to 36 mm .
The SD800 IS , on the other hand , zooms out to 28 mm , covering a nearly 4 x focal range of 28 - 105 mm .
Being able to zoom out so far is a tremendous help when walking outside in tight streets or indoors at a party with friends and you can only back up so far .
The camera does exhibit corner softness at 28 mm , but this is simply one of the optical compromises created by making a wide lens .
This camera features optical IS which gives you about an extra 2 stops of handholdability .
Of course IS wo n't stop subject motion , but it will help with camera shake and will help you in low light situations .
The camera has very little manual control , but its auto abilities are fast and accurate .
At high ISOs , the SD800 IS performs fairly .
Results are usable from ISO 80 -400 .
Things start looking bad at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 is all but useless .
The camera 's built in noise reduction creates a noticeable smearing effect , but if you only plan on using this for parties and do n't plan on pixel peeping or printing large prints , this problem wo n't be too big an issue for you .
The camera uses the very common SD card .
Most DSLRs use CF cards , but many newer cameras such as the Nikon D40x and Canon 1D Mark II N support SD cards .
If you own a DSLR with SD cards , you get the added bonus of being able to share cards across different cameras .
The people at the Gadget Show put together a head to head video comparison of the Fuji F31fd , a similar Canon P&S , and a Sony P&S .
They took all three cameras out and tested real world situations and compared the cameras with respect to responsiveness , handling , abilities in shooting people and sporting events , exposure control , red-eye , and ultimate print quality .
The Fuji was far and away the winner while the Canon significantly trailed behind the other two .

Canon G7 : The ( almost ) Do -It - All
Hearing the cries for a compact DSLR replacement , Canon created the G7 .
Then , realizing this camera might eat into the sales of their entry level DSLRs , they took away some key features that would have made this camera the nearly perfect DSLR replacement .
The G7 sports a 10 MP sensor allowing for large prints .
The 35 - 210 mm lens is a 6 x optical zoom with image stabilization .
The sensor sensitivity spans ISO 80 - 1600 and ISO 3200 at a reduced resolution .
The camera also has a viewfinder so you do n't have to hold the camera away from your chest ( a less stable position to shoot from ) .
It also allows for a hot - shoe flash to be mounted atop the camera , as well as screw - on telephoto and wide angle lens adapters .
For all you fellow Strobist readers out there , you can always bring an extra flash to do off - camera lighting with the G7 with an inexpensive wireless hot - shoe trigger .
The G7 uses the popular SD card which is fast , inexpensive , and compact .
At first , the G7 sounds like it's the top contender , but remember that Canon pulled some key features .
First of all , unlike the previous G - series cameras , the G7 does not support RAW .
Then again , neither do any of the other previously mentioned cameras .
If you are used to post - processing your images and are n't satisfied with results straight out of camera , your options will be more limited than if you had the original RAW to work with .
Also , changes from the G6 to the G7 include the departure of using BP - 511 batteries ( the same as in a 30D or 5D ) and a change from using CF cards to SD cards .
Given that many people use those batteries and CF cards , this means you 'll have to pick up a new set of batteries and cards .
On the upside , these changes make the G7 more compact and lightweight than previous models .
The handy swivel - type LCD screen from G6 was also dropped to the typical built - in version for the G7 .
Cramming in a 10 MP sensor into such a tiny area definitely gives you noise .
The laws of physics simply do n't allow otherwise .
Cramming more and more megapixels into a tiny sensor seems to be the trend being followed by most manufacturers .
( Fuji is an exception , sticking a 6 MP sensor into a larger than normal area , giving us the F30 and F31fd . )
The 10 MP sensor does provide very nice image quality however .
ISO 200-400 is useble .
ISO 800 is noisy .
ISO 1600 is unusable without heavy noise reduction .
If you read reviews online , you 'll find plenty of people complaining about the many steps backwards taken from the G6 such as a lack of RAW , no swivel LCD screen , change from CF to SD cards , and a slower lens .
This camera costs about 2x as much as the previously mentioned F31 and SD800 so you should expect some added perks for the respective price increase , not a removal of them .
Even though the G7 does support external flashes and lens adapters , lugging around all that extra gear kind of defeats the purpose of carrying around a compact camera in the first place .
If you 're going to be carrying all that extra weight and bulk around , you might as well bring your DSLR !
There 's also tiny annoyances such as the lack of a battery meter on the display and a lack of ISO information in the EXIF .
Why are these fundamental items missing ?
Who knows ...
If you 're willing to plonk down the cash for this camera , it will give you very nice performance , especially if you accept and understand the drawbacks .

Panasonic Lumix LX1 : Built for wiiiiide daytime landscapes
The Panasonic LX1 excels in a few key areas :
It offers a wide 16:9 aspect ratio coupled with a 28 - 112 mm lens in an excellently designed case , along with optical IS .
Its Leica lens is very sharp , rendering lots of fine detail .
The camera 's manual controls are excellent as well .
The RAW files are large and it takes a while for each image to write to the card , but the camera is very responsive and nimble otherwise .
Noise at high ISOs is absolutely terrible , even at ISO 400 .
Similarly , lower ISOs like 80 and 100 exhibit more noise than other cameras .
In fact , this one single issue is so bad that it alone drives people to other cameras and make them discount this one on the spot .
If you plan on shooting only at low ISOs , which most backpackers would typically do , the high ISO noise will be less of an issue and this camera may be just the one for you !

Sigma DP1 : The heart of a DSLR in a P&S 's body
Sigma stepped up to the plate with their DP1 .
They crammed a DSLR - sized sensor ( crop factor of 1.7x ) into the body of a point & shoot .
The sensor is a 14 MP ( or 4.6 MP , depending on how you define a megapixel ) Foveon X3 sensor , not CMOS or CCD like most other cameras .
Like the LX - 1 , the DP1 features support for RAW images .
Like the G7 , it also features an external flash hotshoe .
There 's also an accessory available to slide a viewfinder into the hotshoe since one is n't built into the camera .
One of the tradeoffs of stuffing such a large sensor into a tiny camera is that the lens does n't zoom .
It 's a fixed 28 mm f / 4 lens .
The DP1 is not yet available , but it 's expected to come out at a pretty lofty price point of $ 1,000 .
So which camera is best ?
* Drumroll please !*
... It depends on what you plan on shooting most .
If you intend on shooting lots of parties and social events with your friends , the Fuji F31 fd is your best bet .
Even if you do n't plan on doing so , its incredible high ISO performance and good all around performance makes it the most widely recommended P&S cameras for DSLR users .
In fact , some people even recommend picking the camera up alongside another camera , specifically for the situations where you intend on shooting in low light .
The camera is inexpensive enough to make this option quite feasible !
If you 're looking for an inexpensive camera that will let you shoot outside in tight situations and do n't plan on pixel peeping , the Canon SD800 IS might be a good solution .
If you are going to hike outdoors with your camera and , are looking for high quality , low ISO shots , and find the 16:9 aspect ratio appealing , the Lumix LX - 1 will fit the bill .
If you 're looking for an excellent all - around camera with good image quality and noise characteristics , and you do n't mind shooting JPEG instead of RAW , the Canon G7 will give you lots of quality for the money .
All of my stuff had reached the right office .
The office door was locked .
I did not have a key .
As most of you surely know ( or should know ) by now , I work for a corporate behemoth that used to be a " technology " and " internet " company , and now is really a " media " company owned by MultiMegaBiggaCorp , Inc ( MMBC ) .
I 'm one of the privileged several hundred fortunate enough to have been granted his own office near the cube farm , which saves me from having to " prairie dog " over the cube walls for a glimpse of the outside world ( instead , I just ca n't glimpse the outside world ) .
I suspect that I am grossly overpaid for what I do , which consists mostly of telling other people what to do and dodging phone calls so I can write blog entries .
Several months ago , our department was merged with another department .
This was a merger of equals in which the other department lost both their leadership and half their staff .
We lost our office space .
All 30 or so of us were moved from Building Five to Building Four , Third Floor .
" Restructuring " is a corporate word which means " $ 700 per employee paid to the moving company .
" My old office was configured for someone two salary bands above mine , which meant that the extra desk in the office for the person who did n't inhabit it was removed and replaced with a small round table .
MMBC must not realize that its executives do n't spend most of their time huddling with teams in their expensive prison cells ; they do business on the golf course .
But the company corrected its " error " when moving me to Building Four , Third Floor .
The new office had two desks , two sets of filing cabinets , two sets of overhead bins ( really : we have overhead bins ) , and ( I swear I 'm not making this up ) two sets of wastebaskets -- a black one for trash and a blue one for recycling .
I 've seen the cleaning crew empty both bins into the same large trash can .
A recent trick of corporate architecture is to use modular furniture .
Office cubicles , and even entire walls , can be " constructed " more or less overnight out of pre-manufactured panels and interlocking posts .
It 's sort of like Tinker Toys for MMBC executives .
A few days before the office move , I was assigned a new office number ( a borg - like designation , like Seven of Nine ) , and I decided to check out the new office , knowing it would be just like every other office in the MMBC cube farm .
It did n't exist .
There was a double row of cubes ( two rows of three cubes each ) where the office was supposed to be .
Facilities assured me they'd be tearing down the cubes and building offices .
Indeed , the following Monday my colleagues arrived in their new offices and began the process of discovering everything wrong with them .
I showed up at an office in Mumbai , India , where I spent the next two weeks on business .
When I finally returned to MMBC Building Four , Third Floor , I discovered : This was okay , because MMBC offices , although they lock securely , are made from modular panels and interlocking posts .
It is trivial to remove an outer panel , pop open an inner panel , reach through , and open the securely locked door .
Both panels can be replaced , leaving the illusion that you had the key all the time .
No tools of any kind are required : just pull , push , and open .
I love corporate security .
Once in the office , I discovered numerous problems .
There were no overhead lights .
That meant it was fairly dark , but not so dark that I could n't immediately see the next problem : one wall did not reach all the way to the ceiling .
I also saw the root cause of that problem ; the wall was situated directly below a sprinkler head , meaning that in the event of a fire , both my office and the one next to it would be exactly half as wet as it should be .
Despite the missing wall , it seemed unusually stuffy in the office ; this was because there was no ventilation .
Maybe it was a good thing the wall did n't reach the ceiling .
No light , no air , 3.9 out of 4 walls , and 50 % of the required fire protection .
Oh yeah : the bulletin board was a solid aluminum panel , completely impervious to both magnets and push pins .
As sort of a consolation prize , however , two of my file cabinets were completely filled , top to bottom , with someone else 's paperwork , mostly printed out e-mails directing a particular contractor to perform some task or other .
There was no way to determine whose papers they had been , but MMBC Facilities indicated they had no need of them , and I could dispose of them according to MMBC Document Retention policies .
They went in the shredder bin .
It took several weeks , but eventually the facilities crews worked out all of the remaining issues .
To their credit , every person who showed up to fix something in the office shook his head in disgust and said , " I can't believe they did it like this in the first place . "
To celebrate the correction of the very last problem in my office , I received a present from management .
It was an eviction notice .
Our department had been advised that we would be moving , in less than a week , to Building Four , Fifth Floor .
We had been moved to our present locations less than three months prior .
In case you thought this anecdote had reached some sort of crazy climax , let me assure you that all this is really just background for the truly bizarre portion of this story .
I swear , I am not making up what I found out next .
You see , we were being moved from the Third Floor to the Fifth Floor .
Each floor has two sides , " A " and " B " , and generally we abbreviate locations using building - floor - side codes such as 43A for Building Four , Third Floor , Side A .
We were moving from 43A to 45A .
As it happens , there were already people on 45A , and to make way for us they were being moved to 44A .
There were already people on 44A , and we understood that those people were moving to 44B .
There were already people on 44B , and they would have to move to make room for the new folks , so they were moved to 43A .
Yes : we were moved to make way for the people who were moved to make way for the people who were moving to make way for the people who were moving to make way for us .
Did I mention the rumor mill suggested these moves cost MMBC $ 700 apiece ?
Remembering all the problems that happened in the last move , I decided to check out my new office and make a punch list in advance .
I found that , a day before the scheduled move , the new office was still occupied .
A quick conversation with the current tenant revealed that a ) the office was in great shape , and had an ample light , air , water , and structure , and b ) my 45A coworker had n't been notified he'd be moving .
I suggested that he check with his management chain on the details .
He assured me that it would n't be a big deal , since he really just had his laptop to be moved .
Then I went back downstairs , packed up my things , and went home to hope for the best .
When I returned to the office the following Monday , all of my stuff was in the new office ( good ) , as was a bunch of stuff that was n't mine ( bad ) , including the other guy 's laptop docking station and his Hawaiian shirt .
The filing cabinets were filled with papers and office supplies .
Two overhead bins were locked , and no key was available .
One filing cabinet had a key broken off in the lock .
I called facilities , and they agreed to send someone to remove the computer .
The rest was this other guy 's problem .
The next day , I sent him e-mail asking him to retrieve his things ; he said he'd be back in the office the next day , and would take care of it then .
In the afternoon the following day ( Wednesday ) , I returned from a meeting to find the Hawaiian shirt missing .
The filing cabinets were still full .
I wrote him some more e-mail .
Perhaps I should have been more specific .
I wrote , " Did you get everything you needed ? " and then left the office .
I was out Thursday and Friday , and got his " Sure did " response the following Monday .
The filing cabinets were still full .
If you are reading this and getting that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach , good for you .
If not , it means I really have to work on my foreshadowing skills .
I let the rest of the week go by without unpacking my boxes : where would it all go ?
But I resolved that the following week I would go through all the papers , and handle them according to MultiMegaBiggaCorp , Inc. Document Retention policies .
Monday and Tuesday were busy , but Wednesday morning , I opened up the first filing cabinet and began to review the contents .
First , the office supplies : there were seven ( 7 !!! ) staplers ( but no staples ) and two tape dispensers ( but no tape ) .
Both went back to the common supply closet .
Then there were manuals from 1996 for software that had been defunct since 2003 .
In fact , this accounted for almost everything in the drawer aside from a few photos of a house I did n't recognize , a CD , two 3.5 " floppy disks , a half - eaten package of rice cakes , a coffee mug filled with change , and three different sets of hands - free " earbud " devices for cellular phones , along with other trinkets , chachkes , and assorted knick - knackery .
Much of it went in the trash .
The papers all went in the shredder bin .
I left the change , and a few other items , and resolved to splurge at the vending machines later in the day .
All that remained were the mysterious contents of two overhead bins , which had been locked for more than two weeks .
It was time to call facilities .
When I did , they said they 'd send someone right up to unlock them .
An hour later , a man arrived at my door .
He looked confused .
I asked him if he was here to unlock the overhead bins , and he stared at me for a moment .
Then he asked , " Where 's all my stuff ?
" That 's when it hit me : my new office had not one , but two former occupants ; one of which had only a laptop and a Hawaiian shirt , but the other had cabinets and bins full of papers , office supplies , and bric - a - brac .
The guy I had met had n't said anything about this , but clearly his office - mate had been on vacation ( and in the U.S. , 2 - week vacations are not common ) .
It would later occur to me to look up these people in the MMBC Enterprise Phone Book , where I would discover that they both worked for the same person , the manager who had n't told his people they were moving ( probably because he himself had not been told ) and who then did not ( or was not able to ) look after all the stuff belonging to the guy who worked for him , and was on vacation during the move , and had returned after more than two weeks away and was now standing in front of me , blinking , and asking , " Where 's all my stuff ?
" I swallowed and said , " You 're going to hate me .
I threw it out .
" Of course I had to inform my management that I had thrown out someone else 's stuff , and then I had to inform MMBC Facilities of what had happened .
I have not heard back from either of the former two occupants of my office , but two weeks later , I received an envelope from Facilities .
Inside was a ticket good for a free meal at the MMBC Cafeteria , with a yellow sticky - note thanking me for my " patience during the recent move . "
There was a cute smiley - face drawn on the lower right - hand corner of the note .
As a finishing touch , I discovered that the mail room had misspelled my first name .
I usually spell it S - C - O - T - T .
They spelled it G - E - O - R- G - E. Upper management is now talking about a re-organization plan .
I can't wait to see my new office !
PITY the Brits .
As well as putting up with notoriously bad weather , its workers get a raw deal on public holidays — or so says the Trades Union Congress , the union umbrella body .
In calling for extra national holidays , the TUC points to Britain 's stingy eight days a year .
Other big countries such as America , Japan and Germany are more generous .
Spain gives people most time off , with an annual 16 days of fiesta .

Because making Frank Rich , Paul Krugman , Gail Collins , Gretchen Morgenson and Nick Kristoff available to all is a god - damned public service .

This morning , the New York Times revealed that FCC Chairman Kevin Martin is rushing through a plan to rewrite media ownership rules , letting the biggest media companies control even more local outlets .
And he ’s doing it without giving the public a chance to respond .
The rules could take effect as early as December .
Tell Congress to stop the FCC before it ’s too late .
Visit FCC Oversight Campaign .
It ’s outrageous that Martin would try to pull a fast one on Americans .
Fortunately , some members of Congress are fighting back .
Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said , “ If the chairman intends to do something by the end of the year , then there will be a firestorm of protest and I ’m going to be carrying the wood . ”
It ’s time to help Senator Dorgan light the fire .
The FCC tried to do this in 2003 , and nearly 3 million people rose up to say no .
Our protest forced Congress and the courts reject the FCC ’s decision .
But despite overwhelming public opposition , Chairman Martin is trying to sneak through this massive giveaway before the Bush administration leaves office .
We can put a stop to Martin ’s secret plan by reminding your elected officials that they must hold the FCC accountable .
Do n’t let Martin get away with rewriting the rules : Demand that Congress hold the FCC accountable
Take action here .
We do n’t have much time – we need Congress to act now before it ’s too late .
Do n’t make Sen. Dorgan carry the wood all alone .
Onward ,

On the whole , print coverage of James Comey 's revelations this week has been relatively strong .
Newspapers were a little slower than the blogs at recognizing the significance of what Comey had to say , but as Dahlia Lithwick noted , “ It took a day , but the newspapers finally caught up to the bloggers . ”
Then , there ’s the broadcast media , parts of which still have n’t caught up .
ABC and CBS still have not reported — on either their evening news or morning news broadcasts — former deputy attorney general James B. Comey ’s account of what NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams May 15 called a “ rare glimpse of a high - level , late - night power struggle ” over the National Security Agency ’s warrantless domestic wiretapping program .
As NBC Nightly News justice correspondent Pete Williams reported May 15 , Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that then - White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales and then - White House chief of staff Andrew Card attempted to pressure then - Attorney General John Ashcroft “ at his [ hospital ] bedside … to approve an extension of the secret NSA warrantless eavesdropping program over strong Justice Department objections , ” as Media Matters for America has noted .
Media Matters noted this yesterday afternoon , so I checked to see if either ABC or CBS noted the story at all last night .
They did n’t .
The story has a little bit of everything —
White House scandal , dramatic confrontation , stunning testimony , DC buzz , front - page articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times … for what , exactly , are ABC and CBS waiting ?
Senator stumps Gonzales over authority granted to Cheney to intervene in Justice probes Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 24 , 2007 Print This Email This During Tuesday 's Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing , a freshman Democratic Senator stumped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on how Vice President Dick Cheney , his chief of staff , and counsel , had been granted authority parallel with the President on intervening in pending matters at the Justice Department .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) questioned the Attorney General about the independence of the Justice Department and communications with the White House on pending cases or investigations .
He then pointed to a May 4 , 2006 memorandum signed by Gonzales which showed that the Office of the Vice President had been granted parallel privileges with the Executive Office of the President on communicating directly with the Justice Department 's staff on criminal and civil matters .
" What - on earth - business does the Office of the Vice President have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations , civil investigations , and ongoing matters ? " the Senator asked .
Gonzales was stumped , " As a general matter , I would say that 's a good question . "
Whitehouse then pointed out that in the same memo , the Chief of Staff and Counsel of the Vice President were also explicitly granted the same authority .
" On its face - I must say - sitting here , I 'm troubled by this , " Gonzales added .
A spokesperson for the Office of the Vice President told RAW STORY it was not possible to comment without first seeing a transcript of the proceedings .
Senator Whitehouse 's office provided a copy of the Gonzales memo to RAW STORY .
Whitehouse discussed the Gonzales memo as it relates to the so - called ' Ashcroft memo , ' also provided by Senator Whitehouse 's office , which allowed various Executive Office of the President staff to communicate with the Justice Department .
He contrasted both memos to a 1994 letter written by Clinton Attorney General Janet Reno that limited communications on pending cases to conversations between the White House Counsel or Deputy Counsel , the President or Vice President , and Attorney General or Deputy or Associate Attorney General .
Whitehouse noted that there was a difference between seven senior administration members and ' hundreds ' of people being able to discuss Justice Department matters .
Memo granted Cheney clemency discussions authority
In addition to granting the staff of the Office of the Vice President the ability to communicate with the Justice Department on civil and criminal matters , Gonzales ' May 2006 memo gave Cheney 's staff the ability to raise another issue with the Justice Department : ' Presidential Clemency Matters . '
Whether or not Cheney 's office has intervened in discussions relating to presidential clemency has been of interest to Congress in recent weeks .
Before the White House commuted the sentence of former Cheney Chief of Staff I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Reps . John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) of the House Judiciary Committee asked Cheney to recuse himself from internal White House deliberations on the subject .
White House spokesman Tony Snow did not rule out Cheney 's engagement in the discussions on Libby when he discussed Bush 's decision earlier in the month .

Quicksort is a commonly used example of how succinct Haskell programming can be .
It usually looks something likes this :
The problem with this function is that it 's not really Quicksort .
Viewed through sufficently blurry glasses ( or high abstraction altitude ) it 's looks like the real Quicksort .
What they have in common is overall algorithm : pick a pivot ( always the first element ) , then recursively sort the ones that are smaller , the ones that are bigger , and then stick it all together .
But in my opinion the real Quicksort has to be imperative because it relies on destructive update ; and it uses a very elegant partitioning algorithm .
The partitioning works like this : scan from the left for an element bigger than the pivot , then scan from the right for an element smaller than the pivot , and then swap them .
Repeat this until the array has been partitioned .
Haskell has a variety of array types with destructive updates ( in different monads ) , so it 's perfectly possible to write the imperative Quicksort in Haskell .
To make the code look reasonably nice I 'm going to use my C - like DSEL to write the code .
Here it is : So the type is , i.e. , takes an array indexed withand elements of type .
It returns the sorted array , but the sorting takes places in some monad .
And then there are all kinds of constraints on the type variables .
Thesays that the monad has to have references so we can have some variables .
The array index has to be in the ; that 's part of the general array constraints .
It also have to be numeric so we can add and subtract indicies .
The array type has to fulfillwhich means thatis an array ofand updatable in monad .
Finally , the elements have to be ordered .
I 'm not using the normalclass , but instead an overloadedwhere the return type is overloaded too .
A few comments on the code .
Thefunction lifts a regular array into one that can be indexed with .
Theoperator swaps two variables .
Thefunction does nothing .
In traditional C style we do all the side effects while computing the condition .
There are some type signatures in the code that are annoying , but that I have not found a way around yet .
But otherwise , the code proceeds like most any imperative Quicksort .
Theandvariables scan the array from left and right to locate two elements that need swapping .
We then swap them , and continue scanning until the indicies cross .
After the partitioning we swap the pivot into place and sort the two parts recursively .
So , this function is polymorphic in the monad .
But there is one monad that I think is extra interesting , namely .
With this monad you can do references , updatable arrays , etc. , and finally you can seal it all of with .
The resulting type is pure and shows no signs of what happened inside .
This is a really amazing feat , in my opinion .
The type checker performs the proof that nothing about the " dirty " innards leaks out .
So instead of some informal reasoning that a function with an impure inside can be pure on the outside you have a machine checked proof .
Of course , there 's a meta proof that this is all correct , but John Launchbury and Simon Peyton Jones have already done that once , and now we just need the type checker .
Here 's the code :
We 're usinginstead of , because it provides an efficient way to turn a mutable array on the inside into an immutable array on the outside .
Thefunction turns an immutable array into a mutable one , but it has to make a copy to be safe , since we do n't want to mutate the original .
Finally , if we want to sort lists we can always convert back and forth .
The finalhas the normal type signature ( I switched to the normalagain ) .

Amid all the back - and - forth between the administration and its critics about how to measure “ progress ” in Iraq , what gets lost is the question asked by Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) at the Petraeus - Crocker hearings the other day :
“ I have to ask this question : where is this going ?
Are we going to continue to invest American blood and treasure at the same rate we are doing now .
For what ?
The president said let ’s buy time .
Buy time ?
For what ? ”
Petraeus is surely cooking the books , as the MoveOn.org folks aver in their great New York Times ad  nice to see they ’re ( finally ! ) growing a pair  but this avoids the larger question : what is the administration really up to in Iraq ?
They ’re hanging on , “ buying time , ” as the pundits ceaselessly report  but what do they hope to accomplish ?
If you go through the Petraeus report , the key passages are those that deal with Iran .
Petraeus continually points the finger at Tehran as an explanation for the lack of “ progress ” in Iraq .
He claims to have “ disrupted Shia militia extremists ”  you know , the ones that sit in the Iraqi parliament  and to have captured the leaders of “ Iranian - supported Special Groups , along with a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative supporting Iran ’s activities in Iraq . ”
Who is this operative , and what are these “ Special Groups ” ?
Apparently , they are too special to be named in testimony before Congress .
The “ ethno - sectarian competition , ” Petraeus avers , is being pushed toward violence , in part because of “ malign actions by Syria and , especially , by Iran . ”
What actions ?
No answer is given : not that anyone is asking , at least not in the Congress or among the presidential candidates of either party .
Prior accusations that IEDs found in Iraq were manufactured in Iran have proved sketchy , at best , and pure invention , at worst .
Yet Petraeus ’ words are simply taken as gospel , much as Colin Powell ’s peroration of Scooter Libby - produced lies performed in front of the UN was hailed as a home run .
Years from now , will we look back on the Petraeus - Crocker dog- and - pony show with the same bitter regret that nobody  or almost nobody  doubted them ?
You can bet the ranch on it .
More lies from the “ honorable ” Gen.
Petraeus :
“ In the past six months we have also targeted Shia militia extremists , capturing a number of senior leaders and fighters , as well as the deputy commander of Lebanese Hezbollah Department 2800 , the organization created to support the training , arming , funding , and , in some cases , direction of the militia extremists by the Iranian Republican Guard Corps ’ Qods Force .
These elements have assassinated and kidnapped Iraqi governmental leaders , killed and wounded our soldiers with advanced explosive devices provided by Iran , and indiscriminately rocketed civilians in the International Zone and elsewhere .
It is increasingly apparent to both Coalition and Iraqi leaders that Iran , through the use of the Qods Force , seeks to turn the Iraqi Special Groups into a Hezbollah - like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and coalition forces in Iraq . ”
What , in the name of Allah , is “ Department 2800 ” ?
There ai n’t no such creature on God ’s green earth .
I can find no reference to it anywhere : not in the standard studies of Hezbollah , not on the Internets , not anywhere .
The only other reference to this mysterious organization , aside from the testimony of Petraeus , is on the Web site of Veterans for Freedom , a pro-administration front group that exists as a prop for their leader , the square - jawed Pete Hegseth , to appear on television as a counterweight to VoteVets .
In other words , they just make stuff up .
Have n’t we learned this time and time again ?
It happened with Iraq ’s infamous “ weapons of mass destruction , ” and now it ’s happening again , this time with Iran ’s alleged activities in Iraq .
Refuting this farrago of half - baked fantasies does n’t require any special knowledge , only a basic understanding of the current situation in Iraq and a bit of common sense .
For example , why would Shi’ite militias go after the Shi’ite government in Baghdad  when , in reality , they are the armed wings of the parties that make up that government ?
Even more egregious is the contention that “ it is increasingly apparent to both Coalition and Iraqi leaders ” that “ Iran seeks to turn the Iraqi Special Groups into a Hezbollah - like force ” to “ fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state . ”
Is that why Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki traveled to Iran recently , where he walked hand in hand with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , then took off for Damascus , where he was warmly greeted by the last of the Mesopotamian Ba’athists ?
A proxy war is being fought in Iraq , but it is n’t one pitting the Iranians against the Iraqis : the U.S. is the proxy , fighting on behalf of Israel against Iran and Syria .
That ’s what all this malarkey detailing how the Iranians want to “ Hezbollah - ize ” the Iranian - run “ Special Groups ” is about .
So now we ’re fighting Hezbollah , a group that arose because of the Israeli occupation of Lebanon , and is concerned exclusively with ridding their country of Israeli troops and influence .
The “ surge , ” as the escalation of the war is being euphemized , is working , albeit not in the way the hapless Democrats and the American public understand it .
“ Progress ” in Iraq , insofar as this administration is concerned , means we ’re closer to war with Iran .
That has always been our target , and now that we ’ve got the Ba’athists out of the way , we do n’t mind allying with the “ dead- enders ” against the real enemy : the Shi’ite mullahs of Tehran .
In answer to questions from the senators , Petraeus gave away the show when he bluntly stated , “ We cannot win Iraq solely in Iraq . ”
Oh no , we have to conquer most of the rest of the Middle East , including Iran , Syria , and who - knows - where - else before we can even begin to talk about winning in Iraq .
I have emphasized , in this space , that nothing short of complete and immediate withdrawal from Iraq is going to avert a regional war in the Middle East , because that ’s exactly what ’s on the administration ’s agenda .
That ’s what Bush and Petraeus are buying time for  what Norman Podhoretz calls “ World War IV . ”
Every political leader who claims to be “ antiwar ” yet claims that we cannot just leave Iraq is complicit in this conspiracy to drag us into a conflict with Iran .
Hillary , Obama , and all the Democrats except , perhaps , Bill Richardson , Dennis Kucinich , and Mike Gravel , and surely each and every one of the Republicans , with the single exception of Ron Paul  all are guilty , no matter how much they protest , of enabling this administration in its plans to carry the war into Iran , Syria , and even beyond : Pakistan , perhaps , or the oil - rich regions of Central Asia .
We ’ve said this over and over  down through the years !
 until we ’re blue in the face , and as the reality of it is becoming too apparent for even the worst evaders to continue dodging , I see that Andrew Sullivan has finally caught on .
Well , bully for him  now that he , in his previous pro-war incarnation , helped bring us to this moment .
The same realization is also dawning over at National Review , where Petraeus ’ emphasis on blaming Iran for the mess we made in Iraq is being interpreted as good news ( which it is , if you ’re a warmongering , wholly - owned adjunct of the Israel Lobby ) .
The dynamic sweep of the neoconservatives ‘ grand plan to “ transform ” the Middle East and “ drain the swamp , ” as they put it , is something to behold .
First , take on the Ba’athist Sunnis , pulverize them , isolate them , and let the Shi’ites fill the power vacuum left behind by Saddam .
Then , change course abruptly , declare the Shi’ites  supported by Iran  to be the main enemy , ally with the Sunni remnants , and launch a final offensive against Tehran .
Strike , stall for time , and strike again .
Note , also , how the “ redirection ” in favor of the Sunnis allows the administration to claim substantial progress in Iraq : by allying with these former “ dead - enders ” and “ terrorists , ” we can say we ’re bringing Iraqis “ together ”  even as the insurgents continue their battle with the ostensibly pro-American government .
This is supposed to keep war critics at bay on the home front , but not everyone is falling for it .
The sharpest questions at the Petraeus - Crocker hearings were asked , tellingly , not by the Democrats , who remained cautious in their criticisms , but by two Republican senators , Hagel and John Warner , who , not coincidentally , are retiring this year .
The latter opined : “ I hope in the recesses of your heart that you know that strategy will continue the casualties , the stress on our forces , the stress on military families , the stress on all Americans , ” and then asked Petraeus if his recommendations  to continue the surge for another six months  would make the U.S. “ safer . ”
The general replied , somewhat sheepishly : “ Sir , I do n’t know , actually . ”
Yet is n’t that the mission of the U.S. military  to make us safer ?
To protect us from our enemies , here in the “ homeland ” ( as they now call America ) ?
It most certainly is not , at least not in the Bizarro World we fell into after the 9/11 attacks blasted a hole in the space - time continuum and rocketed us into an alternate universe  where up is down , right is wrong , and “ security ” means placing us all in imminent danger of yet another terrorist assault .
Our camarilla of would - be conquistadors could care less about the security and safety of the American people : all that matters to them is their vision of “ benevolent global hegemony ”  and , of course , the security of Israel .
That ’s why the Lobby is moving full - bore into propaganda mode and we ’re hearing the drumbeat of yet another council of war rising and drowning out the peoples ’ plea for peace .
Democracy ?
Forget it .
The two wings of the War Party , known as the Democrats and the Republicans , have a monopoly on the political process here in the cradle of liberty , and , what ’s more , they know it .
No need to pay attention to the polls when both parties are committed to war .

If you ’re displeased with the way a company treats you , you ’re free to air your feelings in public , right ?
Not necessarily if you receive high - speed Internet access from AT&T ; Inc. or Verizon Communications Inc .
Buried deep within both companies ’ voluminous service contracts is language that says your Net access can be terminated for any behavior that AT&T ; or Verizon believes might harm its “ name or reputation , ” or even the reputation of its business partners .
The language came to light the other day after AT&T ; sent notices to thousands of customers revising their service contracts as part of the company ’s merger last year with BellSouth .
It follows an incident last month in which Verizon Wireless blocked an abortion - rights group from sending text messages over the company ’s network , deeming the messages too controversial .
The company subsequently backtracked from the decision .
Advertisement
Before that , AT&T ; was caught in August censoring political comments made by Pearl Jam ’s Eddie Vedder during a concert webcast .
The company later said it had made a mistake .
AT&T ; and Verizon say they ’ve never enforced the can ’t - criticize - us contract terms , which have been in place for years .
But the provisions highlight yet again the danger to free expression when a relative handful of private companies serve as gatekeepers to information networks .
Whether it ’s a rock star ranting against President Bush or a disgruntled customer griping about shoddy service , how free is free speech in the digital era ?
“ Not being able to speak your mind about something is contrary to public policy , ” said Frank Tuerkheimer , a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on Internet - related issues .
Advertisement
But it ’s apparently not illegal .
The 1st Amendment , Tuerkheimer pointed out , does n’t apply to private entities .
You have to wade deep into AT&T ; 's 14,000 - word service contract to find the one - line disclaimer in which the company reserves the right to slam the door on any Internet customer who might bruise the company ’s feelings .
Along with specifying behavior that is “ defamatory , fraudulent , obscene or deceptive , ” the contract says service may be suspended or terminated for any behavior that “ tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T ; , Yahoo [ AT&T ; 's online partner ] or their respective parents , affiliates and subsidiaries . ”
In Verizon ’s case , you have to make it all the way through the company ’s 10,000 - word contract to an attached document laying out the “ acceptable use policy . ”
Advertisement
This is where customers are informed that , among other things , they are n’t allowed to post material online that ’s “ obscene , indecent , pornographic , sadistic , cruel or racist in content , or of a sexually explicit or graphic nature ; or which espouses , promotes or incites bigotry , hatred or racism . ”
It ’s also where the company says customers are similarly crossing the line if they “ damage the name or reputation of Verizon , its parent , affiliates and subsidiaries , or any third parties . ”
Jon Davies , a Verizon spokesman , said the language was there “ to stop people from setting up websites that look like Verizon ’s ” or engaging in other ploys frequently used by scammers to con people into revealing personal info , including Social Security and credit card numbers .
Verizon ’s contract , however , explicitly states elsewhere that such behavior can result in termination of service .
So it would appear that the “ name or reputation ” clause is asserting a broader prerogative on Verizon ’s part .
Advertisement
Davies said he understood that some people might view the language as Verizon claiming a right to censor customers ’ opinions , particularly when such opinions might trample on Verizon ’s good name .
“ But whether or not it ’s interpreted that way is irrelevant , ” he said , “ because we ’ve never used it that way .
Actions speak louder than words . ”
That was n’t a very persuasive argument for Kurt Opsahl , senior attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco advocacy group focusing on digital - rights issues .
“ If they ’re not going to use it , then why have it ? ”
John Britton , an AT&T ; spokesman , stressed that the company had no plans to censor customers .
“ We respect our customers ’ right to express themselves as they see fit , ” he said .
Advertisement
So why have the language in customers ’ contracts ?
“ The policy is what it is , ” Britton replied .
“ This is common brand language designed to protect the brand . ”
Actually , not all broadband providers claim such a right .
For example , a spokeswoman for Time Warner Cable said the company had no policy addressing termination of customers ’ accounts just because they might say mean things .
Late Tuesday , Britton called back to say AT&T ; 's contract language would be revised in the future to reflect a more free - speech - friendly mind - set .
Advertisement
“ We are going to clarify the policy to make clear that nobody is faced with losing service because they express an opinion about the company , ” he said .
To be safe , though , AT&T ;'s and Verizon ’s contracts also contain language specifying that customers can’t hold them accountable for service disruptions resulting from circumstances beyond their control .
In Verizon ’s case , the company says this includes “ acts of God , acts of third parties , fires , floods , strikes or other labor - related disputes . ”
AT&T ; has a much gloomier outlook .
It says customers are on their own in the event of “ acts of God , fire , explosion , vandalism , nuclear disaster , sun spots , solar flares , terrorism . . . insurrections , riots , wars . ”
Advertisement
“ We ’re just trying to be as clear as possible , ” Britton said .
So do n’t go crying to AT&T ; when your Internet access goes out amid an insurrection or nuclear disaster .
But try not to say anything unkind either .

THE kiss you share with the exquisite stranger is electric , deep and seemingly endless — that is until you open an eye and see drool on your pillow .
If only you could have slept long enough to consummate the seduction .
Then again , you had no idea you were dreaming .
Besides , you cannot control the nightly ride on the wings of your subconscious .
Or can you ?
Maybe , if you learn to practice “ lucid dreaming , ” a state in which a sleeping person becomes aware he or she is dreaming and may even be able to direct the action .
Those who regularly experience the phenomenon say that like the physics - defying characters in “ The Matrix , ” they are able to generate or manipulate the fantastical events that unfold .
They can fly without wings , play instruments they never learned , go bowling with T. S. Eliot — and , yes , indulge sexual fantasies .
It is likely some people have always had such dreams , said Jayne Gackenbach , a professor of psychology at Grant MacEwan College in Edmonton , Alberta , who conducts research into lucid dreaming .
But the esoteric practice , which has been acknowledged in the West since at least 1867 , seems on the verge of becoming much better known .

Bush is now demanding that Congress give retroactive immunity to telecom companies who helped Bush illegally spy on American citizens , and if they do n’t , he ’s going to veto the domestic spying bill .
AP :
President Bush said Wednesday that he will not sign a new eavesdropping bill if it does not grant retroactive immunity to U.S. telecommunications companies that helped conduct electronic surveillance without court orders .
Good .
Let him .
He ’s going to veto legislation he claims the nation desperately needs ?
Let. Him .
Bush has been telling us for years that all the domestic spying he was doing was legal .
AT&T ; told us that the spying was legal .
Then why do they need immunity now if everything they were doing was legal ?
This is absolutely outrageous .
The Democrats had better not give this to Bush .
He ’s at 28 % in the polls , folks .
Stop acting like he ’s in charge .
The games were aimed at German children as young as four
Enlarge Image
The rare trove of wartime board games also includes a version of Snakes and Ladders based on the exploits of U - boat captain Gunther Prien .
The games are thought to have come from a German collector .
They will be sold at Mullock 's Shropshire on Thursday .
Historian Richard Westwood - Brookes expects some to fetch up to £ 300 .
Sinking battleships
Mr Westwood - Brookes said the games were a rare find .
" It 's just like with children 's books , the same reason rare children 's books go for big prices - children are n't very good at taking care of things .
" And it would n't have done you much good after the war to have had these things lying around . "
The games include Bombers Over England , a form of bagatelle or primitive pinball where players score points for " bombing " British cities , shipping or lighthouses .
Another , based on Snakes and Ladders , sees players take their U - boats from a German port to the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow , sink British warships and try to make it back home .
Another is a game where players drop weighted paratroopers onto a representation of the English countryside .
The games are all in good but used condition , Mr Westwood - Brookes said .
" You can be confident kids in Germany in the early 1940s were playing these games . "
He added : " They say a lot about the Nazis , and about the German regime .
Our kids were still playing trains and Meccano and hopscotch and things like that .
I managed to knock out London , Glasgow and Liverpool - and a ship in the North Sea
Richard Westwood - Brookes
" These show how the Nazis were determined that children as young as four or five needed to get into the swing of things . "
Under German law , items from the Third Reich period are unable to be sold in the country .
The games also include one possibly made in liberated Belgium in late 1944 , where players throw crude darts at a board denoting German cities and representations of the Nazi regime .
The bullseye is Adolf Hitler .
Mr Westwood - Brookes admitted to playing the Bombers over England game .
" And I managed to knock out London , Glasgow and Liverpool - and a ship in the North Sea , " he said .
FOX News attempts to connect Osama bin Laden with American left and Democrats RAW STORY
Published : Saturday September 8 , 2007
Print This Email This Two YouTube videos feature segments of Fox News ' Hannity and Colmes , featuring a total of four guests appearing to offer comment on the recent video released by what appears to be Osama bin Laden .
The guests and co-host Sean Hannity work towards connecting bin Laden 's speech to the current tone among the Democrats .
In the first video , former Bush Chief of Staff Andrew Card finds it " outrageous " that the video has been released to coincide with the anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks of 9/11/2001 .
" He 's taunting America again , " says Card , " and he 's calling for us to take action that is obscene , and I can't believe that there are people in Congress that will actually follow the direction of a sworn enemy of this country rather than take the direction of the person sworn to defend the country , the President of the United States . "
" I do n't think that we should view all of his threats with great credibility , " continues Card , " ... but we should definitely take it seriously . "
" We 've had to battle fascism and Nazism and communism and totalitarianism , " says host Sean Hannity , " and I view this as modern - day Nazism ; and he really reveals the twisted ideology that he supports . " " [ bin Laden 's ] got a warped sense of responsibility for the people that he claims to love and lead , " responds Card .
" He wants to send young men and women in innocence into situations where they 're going to die .
He 's a sworn enemy of this country ; he 's a sworn enemy of democracy . "
Continues Card , " He basically says people do n't have the ability to govern themselves . "
" He seems to adopt the exact same language being used by the hard left in this country , " Hannity says , " as he describes what 's going on in Iraq as a civil war .
He actually used the term ' Neocons . '
He talks about global warming .
He demonizes capitalisms ( sic ) and corporations in this whole thing -- very , very specific language .
It seems to be coming from somebody who is keenly aware of the world situation and the battle and the conflict in America over this war , and even admonishing the Democratic Party for not ending the war . "
Card calls al Qaeda a " good organization , " saying it 's " very able . "
He says that bin Laden has lost the ability to control the War on Terror but is the one " championing " it , calling for attacks on the United States and American interests .
" He 's a desperate man , and a dangerous man . "
Co-host Alan Colmes interjects that the video also speaks against separation of church and state , and that " religion should be a very important part of what governments do , " noting that the video 's talking points do n't all align with the " hard left . "
Colmes , who goes on to ask how al Qaeda could have been allowed to regroup , and if it was a mistake for President Bush to make the famous comment in March of 2002 that he " was n't concerned " about bin Laden .
" The United States Government does think about bin Laden , " responds Card , " but we are also interested in winning the war on terror , so we 're not disproportionately focused on Osama bin Laden : one person . "
Card , after reiterating that the current offensive in Iraq is part of the War on Terror , says that the President is concerned about , but wo n't be " preoccupied with , " Osama bin Laden .
" He 's concerned about winning the War on Terror ; he 's concerned about protecting the United States and our interests , and that 's really what he 's doing . " al Qaeda and the reformed Taliban have regrouped , says Colmes , as he sees it as an indication that the efforts in the War on Terror have been lopsided , " misdirecting " efforts to Iraq while forces have been allowed to align elsewhere .
Says Card : " Segments of their organization are -- continue to be a threat , but we are definitely winning the War on Terror .
We are defeating them in places where they 're looking to be successful . "
" Counterterrorism experts say al Qaeda 's regrouped .
The Taliban 's regrouped .
Iraq :
We 're in the middle of a civil war , " says Colmes , as he bluntly asks what evidence Card has that the United States is winning the War on Terror .
The War on Terror may be a battle that goes on " for generations , " says Card , citing " lots of evidence , " but " we can not let our guard down .
They want to attack us . "
" Maybe if we had taken him when the Sudan offered him on a silver platter , " concludes Hannity , " we 'd be in better shape today . "
The second video features hosts Hannity and Colmes with Fox News Military Analyst Bill Cowan , Pajamas Media editor Evan Miniter , and author Jeff Scarborough .
" It 's fear , it 's propaganda , " says Cowan of the bin Laden video , seeking to make Americans fearful on the annniversary of 9/11 .
We 're going to be attacked again by " somebody , " he insists , with or without a video release .
Turning to Miniter , Colmes asks if we should be concerned , given Fred Thompson 's recent flip over whether the need to capture bin Laden is real or " symbolic . "
" I do n't speak for the Thompson campaign , " says Miniter , " but certainly , getting bin Laden , while this is a war , not a manhunt ; is enormously important , both for symbolic reasons and for actual military reasons . "
Miniter continues : " The United States has arrested and deported some 700 people connected to terrorism , al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations , and we 've disrupted a lot of plots . "
Cowan says that we 're right to continue focusing on al Qaeda because there is yet to be another attack on the United States , despite the fact that terrorists have been " working hard " to do so .
Cowan also says that the Iranians are " every bit as diligent " as al Qaeda about attacking the United States .
" An attack is going to occur at some point , " he repeats .
Co-host Sean Hannity and Mr. Miniter discuss the color of bin Laden 's beard in the video and debate whether or not the beard , and / or the whole person in the video , is authentic .
The voice has been authenticated , says Miniter , but not the " video image . "
Also , Hannity and Miniter allude to the video attempting to influence American opinion by using what they consider " hard left " rhetoric .
Quips co-host Colmes , " I did n't know we could look at bin Laden as a political pundit . "

There is something very wrong when a company 's net income increases 28 % in the quarter and revenues go up 58 % year to year and the babies in Wall Street play automatons and push the stock down as much as 7 % immediately .
It is important to remember that not very bright people are pushing markets and investors run in herds .
Would n't it be nice if some people gave companies credit for not meeting unrealistic " expectations " -- especially when you look past the numbers ?
People are asking -- on TV - " is it over for Google ? "
How ridiculous !
Paul Wolfowitz Yearns For Democracy
The New Yorker ran a 12,000 word profile of Paul Wolfowitz this week .
It begins and ends with discussions of Wolfowitz 's history with Turkey , and in between spends 2,000 words describing it and a recent Wolfowitz visit there for the World Bank .
Among other things , we learn that during this visit Wolfowitz was ferried around on a Turkish military helicopter , and is old friends with the prominent Turkish General Cevik Bir .
Given this , you might assume that somewhere in those 12,000 words the New Yorker could have found time to mention a famous May , 2003 interview with Wolfowitz and CNN Turk .
As you read this , keep in mind ( 1 ) the U.S. had just invaded Iraq , but the Turkish parliament had voted not to allow the U.S. to use its territory ; ( 2 ) Wolfowitz 's longtime friendship with Turkish military figures ; and ( 3 ) the Turkish military has overthrown the civilian government four times since 1960 , most recently in 1997 :
WOLFOWITZ : From a U.S. - Turkish point of view there is good news and bad news .
The good news is that a majority of the parliament did vote to support us in the things that we asked for .
The bad news is that because of the procedural issues that was n't a big enough majority to get it done and that many of the institutions in Turkey that we think of as the traditional strong support is the alliance were not as forceful in leading in that direction .
CNN TURK : Which traditional alliance are you talking about ?
WOLFOWITZ : Well I think you know which ones I mean but I think particularly the military .
I think for whatever reason they did not play the strong leadership role on that issue that we would have expected ...
I think it 's perfectly appropriate , especially in your system , for the military to say it was in Turkey 's interest to support the United States in that effort .
CNN TURK : Did n't they say that ?
WOLFOWITZ : I do n't know .
My impression is they did n't say it with the kind of strength that would have made a difference .
Coincidentally enough , a few weeks later the head of the Turkish military was threatening to overthrow the government again .
None of this made it into the New Yorker article .
But I suppose that 's for the best , since that space was needed for this kind of passage about Wolfowitz 's deep commitment to democracy :
Wolfowitz refused to talk about Iraq specifically , but he told me that he still believes in the vision of a moderate , democratic Middle East .
" I think , in the longer view of things , there is a very powerful pull in the direction of participatory government , " he said .
" People discover that it's the path to prosperity .
And , yes , there are some violent forces that do n't want to see it happen ... "
There is an old joke that campaign veterans toss around war rooms , bars and BS sessions .
We say there are people who have worked in campaigns who say that they have lost some – and we call those folks operatives , managers , strategists , consultants ; and then there are people who work in campaigns and say that they have never lost , and we call them liars .
The joke reflects an obsession with winning as the real benchmark of success in politics .
By that measure , Karl Rove ’s career has to be deemed a success .
He built the Republican party of Texas into one of the most powerful state parties in America .
Nationally he has pulled off some of the most unexpected and impressive victories of modern political history .
( I will not be debating the 2000 election for the purposes of this article , but I also will not be crediting him with it , so let us just move on to the next cycle . )
Mr Rove picked up seats in what was an almost historically impossible context in 2002 .
Then in 2004 , he engineered one of the most remarkable feats in American politics .
He got Americans to re-elect a president who they really did not want to re-elect .
Even the Republican defeat in 2006 was predictable and well within the range of historical norms so , by this sport ’s standard of winning and losing , there is still no black mark on Rove ’s record .
If we concluded our analysis in 2007 and confined our judgment merely to Mr Rove ’s immediate electoral record , we would have no choice but to judge him a spectacular success .
There is no doubt that Mr Rove won elections .
He has perhaps one of the most remarkable win-percentages in modern American politics .
If only things were so neat and simple .
The evidence is now pretty conclusive that Mr Rove may have lost more than just an election in 2006 .
He has lost an entire generation for the Republican party .
A late July poll for Democracy Corps , a non-profit polling company , shows that a generic Democratic presidential candidate now wins voters under 30 years old by 32 percentage points .
The Republican lead among younger white non-college - educated men , who supported President George W. Bush by a margin of 19 percentage points three years ago , has shrunk to 2 percentage points .
Ideological divisions between the Republican party and young voters are growing .
Young voters generally favour larger government providing more services , 68 per cent to 28 per cent .
On every issue , from the budget to national security , young voters responded overwhelmingly that Democrats would do a better job in government .
It is not just Democracy Corps that has found this .
A host of new polls and surveys over the course of the past few months has served as a harbinger of a rocky 2008 election for Republicans .
The March poll from the Pew Research Center showed that 50 per cent of Americans identify as Democrats while only 35 per cent say they are Republican .
The June NBC - Wall Street Journal poll showed 52 per cent of Americans would prefer a Democratic president while only 31 per cent would support a Republican , the largest gap in the 20 - year history of the survey .
Mr Rove ’s famous electoral strategy – focusing on the Republican base first – is also largely responsible for a shift in international public opinion against the US .
It would not be fair to blame Mr Rove for the Iraq war .
But it is clearly fair to blame his strategy for the Terry Schiavo fiasco and the Republicans ’ adherence to the policies and doctrines of Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson and James Dobson .
The world and now most of the US are contemptuous of the theocratic underpinnings of the policy Mr Rove ushered into government .
There is also a distinction to be made between Karl Rove the political strategist and Karl Rove the government official .
Mr Rove was not just an operative sitting at the Republican National Committee and scheming .
He had a West Wing office .
This distinguishes him from other political operatives , whose roles were outside the White House doing scheduling , advance work and presentation .
They were not firing and hiring or shaping national security policy .
Mr Rove was as powerful a government figure as he was a campaign figure .
The past six and a half years of Mr Rove ’s career were spent as a very , very senior and extraordinarily influential Bush administration official .
He has been assistant to the president , senior advisor and deputy chief of staff .
Mr Rove was the architect of social security reform , immigration , the hiring and firing of justice department officials and the placement of literally thousands of ideologically driven buffoons throughout the US government .
As deputy chief of staff he was also responsible for handling the White House post - Katrina reconstruction efforts .
On these actions , history has already rendered its judgment on Mr Rove .
And , as we say in Louisiana , “ it ai n’t pretty ” .
When it comes to judging Mr Rove ’s political career , I am reminded of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai ’s meeting with Henry Kissinger in the 1970s , when Mr Kissinger asked , “ What do you think of the French Revolution ? ”
Zhou replied : “ It ’s too soon to tell . ”
If the trends hold , the one thing that we can be sure of is that Mr Rove ’s political grave will receive no lack of irrigation from future Republicans .
The writer is an international political consultant , founder of Democracy Corps , and is working on a new book whose tentative title is The Lost Generation : How the Democrats can Capitalize on the Current Problems of the Republican Party .
He was chief strategist for Bill Clinton ’s 1992 presidential campaign
The actress who played Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years , Danica McKellar , is a self - proclaimed math advocate for girls who might otherwise shy away from a subject that Barbie once famously described as " hard . "
McKellar 's math book for junior high girls , called Math Does n't Suck : How to Survive Middle - School Math and not Break a Nail , will be at bookstores Thursday .
It has the look and feel of a teen magazine , but puts heavy emphasis on fractions and pre-algebra .
Graduating summa cum laude from UCLA with a degree in mathematics , McKellar is also co-author of a published proof .
She has testified before Congress on math education and served as a substitute teacher .
Each chapter includes clear explanations that make manipulating numbers sound easy .
" A reciprocal of a fraction is found by flipping it upside down .
If you want the reciprocal of a mixed number or a whole number , just convert it to an improper fraction , and then flip it ! " or " Going back and forth between percents and decimals is very easy .
All you need to do is take away the % sign , then move the decimal point two places – that 's it ! "
The book includes horoscopes , testimonials , cute doodles and quotes from girls .
Word problems are brought to life with descriptions of lipstick , beads , cookies and similarly girly examples that might make the feminist in some women cringe .
In the interview below , McKellar explains why being a math whiz and a girly girl are not mutually exclusive .
Wired News spoke to her by phone from her home in Los Angeles .
Wired News :
How did you decide to write a math book for young women ?
Danica McKellar :
There was an article written about me in the New York Times two years ago .
It was July 2005 .
It told the story about how in between The Wonder Years and The West Wing I wrote this math paper , and it got published .
After that article came out – I guess literary agents sit around reading the newspaper looking for ideas for books – all of these literary agents called my manager and said , " Danica is such a great role model for young girls , we think she should write a math book . "
So I talked to some of them on the phone , and I clicked with one named Laura Nolan .
She essentially said , " We want you to write a book about math , but what do you want it to be about ?
Who do you want it to be for ? "
I had done quite a bit of research about math education when I spoke before Congress in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics .
The session of Congress was all about raising more scholarships for girls ( in math ) in college .
I told them I felt that it 's too late by ( the time they get to ) college .
If you look the stats , girls start losing interest in math and grades start dropping in middle school .
That 's where you have to put the money .
So ( I told ) Laura Nolan I want to help middle - school girls stay interested in math and be good at it , and see it as friendly and accessible and not this scary thing .
Everyone else in society tells them it 's not for them .
It 's for nerdy white guys with pocket protectors .
This is how 75 percent of all science is depicted on television .
The message they 're getting instead is :
It 's really cool to be dumb .
Look at Jessica Simpson .
She 's famous for being dumb .
I guess it started with Marylyn Monroe , and she actually was n't that dumb , but that 's how she was perceived – and that 's what got popular .
WN : Would you say you 're on a mission ?
McKellar : Yes .
Absolutely .
WN : Did talk to any girls who have read the book about it ?
What kind of contact have you had with junior high school girls ?
McKellar : During the process of writing the book I sent 10 girls chapters .
In fact , my god - daughter – who is 12 years old , she was 11 at the time – would tell me when she thought a chapter needed a little spicing up .
She 'd say , " Oh , I never thought of that copycat fraction thing before . "
I would send a chapter or two to two other girls , friends of the family and get comments .
They really care about being involved and doing something important , like making an important contribution to the book .
WN : How much help did you get while you were writing the book ?
McKellar :
There was almost no help .
The publisher I used is not a textbook publisher – it's a young adults ' publisher .
They do novels .
I got comments from them sometimes , but not much .
WN : Did you look at math - education standards when you wrote this book ?
McKellar : Oh , sure .
( And ) I talked to a lot of teachers .
They all said the same thing – that things get bad in middle school .
The number one subject , by far , that kids have trouble with is fractions – being able to go between fractions and the other forms of the same value , whether it 's a percentage or a decimal .
Or working with fractions , like in ratios and proportions .
They need to be flexible with fractions and understand how to use them in word problems , or with proportions and things .
There is just this total lack of understanding .
All of those conversations helped me focus on the subjects I was going to teach .
I wanted my book to be very conversational and feel friendly .
WN : Whose idea was it to do it in the style of a teen magazine ?
McKellar :
That was my idea , and it only came about six months ago .
WN : What 's your favorite part of math to teach ?
McKellar :
The fun little proofs that you can do with algebra – they are sort of like crowd pleasers in a way .
Like , the .9 repeating equaling one .
It does n't take a lot of algebra to prove that , and it 's really fun .
It kind of wows people .
It 's like they 're watching magic happen right before their eyes .
WN : What 's your favorite part of math to learn ?
McKellar : I love infinite things .
I love infinite small things .
I love infinitely many small things .
The basis off calculus is really fun and exciting for me .
WN : Do you work computer programmer 's hours ?
Do you drink a lot of caffeine ?
McKellar : No . I drink a lot of water though .
I take yoga breaks .
Every three to four hours I take a 20 - minute yoga break .
WN : What helped you study in college ?
McKellar : I 'm the kind of person that responds strongly to a challenge .
So somebody told me that if I was n't a coffee drinker yet , by the end of college I 'd have to be , because a math major is so tough I would have to stay up very late .
I was going to need coffee to do that .
Well , merely because they said that , I never drank coffee in college , never got addicted to it , never needed it .
That 's the stubborn side of my personality – which I try to use for good .
WN : Do you have any geeky hobbies ?
McKellar : I do voices .
I 'm the voice in a few video games .
I do one right now called Alpha Protocol .
I play this character called " handler . "
She 's like this secret spy woman .
It 's really cool .
I was Jubilee in X - men legends .
I was also in one called EverQuest 2 .
WN : There are a lot of references to baking cookies , expensive clothing , cosmetics and accessories .
This could be viewed as fun – or reinforcing gender roles .
McKellar :
What do you think ?
If I 'm teaching girls that do love to make cookies and do love fashion – that they can use math as a part of that – you think that 's me saying , come on girls you belong in the kitchen , you belong shopping ?
Or , do you think it 's me showing them how math is part of all their life , even the part they thought it had nothing to do with ?
In the introduction and other places in the book , I reinforce the idea it 's OK to be girly .
It 's fun to be girly and being smart is part of who you want to be .
Picture yourself clicking down Wall Street in your heels with your designer bag , and you 're going to need a really great job to support that shopping habit of yours , are n't you ?
Well , yes .
And yeah , when you go home , might you make cookies ?
Sure .
Why not ?
You might be celebrating something .
Maybe you 'll have kids too and you might want to make some cookies for them .
Maybe you are going to cut the recipe by three quarters .
And guess what , you 're going to know how to do that – along with managing portfolios on Wall Street .
WN : You do n't think that there are so many mentions of expensive shoes and expensive purses that it 's encouraging them to be materialistic ?
McKellar :
You think my book is going to make them more materialistic than they are already being trained to be ?
You 're putting my book on quite a pedestal .
That 's like throwing a drop of rain into an entire ocean .
When they see these things reinforced in every part of society – and it does surround them – they 'll start to make a connection to math they never would have before .
By the way , it 's no accident that the cover of the book imitates a teen magazine .
There is a horoscope .
There are personality quizzes .
This is what girls have gravitated towards .
Who knows what the reasons are ?
Is it because of products out there ?
Equally important ( is that ) girls from that age start to ask the important question , " Who am I ? "
They will ask it for the rest of their lives .
C# Application Markup Language ( CSAML ) :
An Evolutionary Leap
by Charles Petzold
Several weeks ago , Microsoft Corporation began a limited circulation of a specification and beta compiler for the new C# Application Markup Language or CSAML ( sometimes pronounced “ scammel ” ) , and I ’m pleased to say I find it fascinating .
This merging of C# and XML is an important evolutionary leap for both standards , and represents a profound advance in the Xmlization of all textual data .
Basically , CSAML is an alternative syntax for C# based on XML and , more specifically , on XAML , the Extensible Application Markup Language that plays such an important role in the forthcoming WinFX and the Windows Presentation Foundation .
In particular , CSAML makes uses of the XAML “ property element ” syntax for denoting complex statements .
My new book Programming in the Key of CSAML is expected to be available early in 2007 .
For now , I want to show you just a few examples that will let you savor the flavor of this new syntax and be ready for the big transition when the old C# syntax is phased out in 2008 .
Consider the following “ old syntax ” C# hello - world program :
namespace MyNamespace { public class MyClass { public static void Main ( ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " Hello , C# " ) ; } } }
This freeform , unstructured format simply cannot be tolerated in modern computing environments .
Look at the string of words “ public static void Main . ”
What are those words ?
How do they relate to each other ?
There ’s no way to tell .
These problems may have been overlooked in the days of ALGOL , but they can be ignored no longer .
By contrast , check out the clarity that results when equivalent code is expressed with a syntax that emphasizes precision and accountability .
This is a complete CSAML file with the current namespace declarations :
< Csaml File xmlns= " http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/csaml " xmlns:x = " http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml " >
< NamespaceDeclaration Identifier= " MyNamespace " > < ClassDeclaration Identifier = " MyClass " Access = " Public " > < MethodDeclaration Identifier = " Main " Access = " Public " Modifier = " Static " ReturnType= " {x : Type void} " >
< InvocationExpression MemberAccess=" System.Console.WriteLine " > < InvocationExpression.ArgumentList > < Literal Type= " {x : Type string} " Value = " Hello , CSAML ! " >
</InvocationExpression.ArgumentList > </ InvocationExpression > </MethodDeclaration > </ ClassDeclaration > </NamespaceDeclaration > </ CsamlFile >
As you ’ll note , many of these element names are based on the grammar notations used in the C# Language Specification , so every C# programmer is intimately familiar with the names and can begin coding in CSAML immediately .
By relying upon the hierarchical structure that is built into XML , CSAML is able to forgo the reliance upon curly brackets , square brackets , and parentheses that so clutters old - syntax C# .
As you ’ll note in the file shown above , curly brackets are restricted to their use in XAML markup extensions , such as x : Type .
In fact , CSAML is able to rid itself of every symbol used in old - syntax C# .
For example , consider the following old - syntax C# assignment statement :
A = 5 * ( B + 27 * C ) ;
This statement translates without much fuss into the following chunk of CSAML :
< ExpressionStatement > < Assignment LValue= " A " > < Assignment .
Expression > < MultiplicationExpression > < Multiplication .Multiplier > < Literal Type= " {x : Type Int32} " Value= " 5 " /> </Multiplication .Multiplier > < Multiplication .Multiplicand > < AdditionExpression Augend= " B " > < AdditionExpression .
Addend > < Multiplication .Multiplier > < Literal Type= " {x : Type Int32} " Value = " 27 " /> </Multiplication .Multiplier > < MultiplicationExpression Multiplicand= " C " /> </AdditionExpression .
Addend > </AdditionExpression > </Multiplication.Multiplicand > </MultiplicationExpression > </ Assignment .Expression > </ Assignment > </ ExpressionStatement >
The advantages of this notation are obvious .
Because no parentheses are required ( or allowed ) , the programmer has composed the CSAML by carefully considering the problem .
Errors are much less likely .
The compiler can become more efficient as well because the statement has , in effect , been pre-parsed by the programmer .
Here ’s another example of perhaps the most notorious syntactical absurdity in all of traditional C# — the for loop :
for ( i=0 , j=0 ; i < 1000 ; i++) if ( Is Prime ( i ) ) j++;
In CSAML , that jumble of symbols and semicolons is abandoned for a structural beauty that can almost induce the modern programmer to weep with joy :
< ForLoop > < ForLoop.Initializer > < StatementExpressionList > < Assignment LValue= " i " > < Assignment .
Expression > < Literal Type= " {x : Type Int32} " Value= " 0 " /> </ Assignment .Expression > </ Assignment > </StatementExpressionList > </ForLoop.Initializer > < ForLoop.Condition > < BooleanExpression > < LessThanExpression LeftSide =" i " > < LessThanExpression.RightSide > < Literal Type= " {x : Type Int32} " Value= " 1000 " /> </LessThanExpression.RightSide > </LessThanExpression > </BooleanExpression > </ForLoop.Condition > < ForLoop.Iterator > < StatementExpressionList > < PreIncrementExpression Identifier= " i " /> </StatementExpressionList > </ForLoop.Iterator > < ForLoop.EmbeddedStatement > < IfStatement > < IfStatement .Condition > < BooleanExpression > < InvocationExpression MemberAccess= " Is Prime " > < InvocationExpression.ArgumentList > < Variable Identifier= " i " /> </InvocationExpression.ArgumentList > </ InvocationExpression > < BooleanExpression > </ IfStatement .Condition > < IfStatement.EmbeddedStatement > < StatementList > < PreIncrementExpression Identifier= " j " /> </StatementList > </ IfStatement.EmbeddedStatement > </ IfStatement > </ ForLoop .
EmbeddedStatement > </ ForLoop >
As I write my CSAML book in the months ahead , I ’ll be blogging , of course , and sharing with you some of the many features of this new C# syntax , and perhaps even a few shortcuts .
It ’s certainly an exciting time to be a programmer .

I ’ve mentioned before that the biggest search engine draw to MO has been the XM8 assault rifle .
Stryker searches bring in a lot , as well , but I ’ve got an entire category devoted to the new combat vehicle and only one post about the new rifle .
Folks must be desperate for info on this baby .
For a basic intro to the XM8 , go to my previous post .
The XM8 ( M8 if it ’s adopted ) assault rifle is a proposed replacement for the current M16 rifle and M4 carbine , the standard infantry weapons in today ’s US military .
The XM8 action is based upon the Hechler & Koch G36 , a tried and true infantry weapon with a reputation for toughness and reliability .
The XM29 OICW , which combined both an assault rifle and a smart grenade launcher , turned out to be too heavy , fragile , and expensive .
The rifle part of the XM29 was adapted to become the XM8 .
The smart grenade launcher part of the XM29 is being developed separately as the XM25 .
The XM8 is a modular weapon that can be adapted to different roles fairly easily .
It can use any of four barrel sizes : 9 ″ , 12.5 ″ , 20 ″ , and heavy 20 ″ .
The 9 ″ barrel makes the weapon a submachinegun - like personal defense weapon ( called the Compact Carbine ) that would be ideal for vehicle crews .
Also , I imagine that Special Forces types would find it useful for urban raiding missions and the like .
With the buttcap ( as pictured on the right , second from the top ) it is less than 21 ″ long overall .
The 12.5 ″ barrel is the standard set - up , and with the adjustable buttstock , makes the Baseline Carbine variant .
With the stock fully extended , it is 33 ″ long , the same as an M4 ( which has a 14.5 ″ barrel ) .
It weighs in at about 6.4 lbs , with a goal of being reduced to 5.7 lbs .
The M4 with comparable accessories weighs nearly 9 lbs .
The pic at right shows an XM320 side - loading detachable grenade launcher mounted .
There are two versions of the 20 ″ barrel .
There ’s a standard weight match - grade unit for sharpshooter work and a heavy - duty machinegun unit with a folding bipod for use as a sustained fire automatic rifle .
The XM8 seems to be an aberration in the military procurement sector .
It is a model that seems to improve upon its inspiration in terms of cost and weight , while sacrificing none of the qualities that made the original so good .
An XM8 Baseline Carbine , with its integrated sight , will cost around $ 1800 .
An M4 equipped similarly costs over $ 2500 .
That translates into a savings of $ 2.4 million to equip a 3,500 man brigade .
Cost notwithstanding , the biggest advantage of the XM8 over the M4/M16 is almost certainly the new weapon ’s durability and resistance to jamming .
The manufacturer claims that the XM8 can fire over 15,000 rounds without lubrication or cleaning , even in harsh conditions .
While I seriously doubt that those numbers would translate into the field , it is indicative of the weapon ’s reliability .
The BARREL LIFE of an M4 is rated at 8,000 rounds .
The XM8 achieves this phenomenal reliability in part due to a unique gas - operated pusher - rod operated bolt .
This system does not send carbon gasses into the receiver with every round like standard weapons , and therefore reduces greatly the amount of propellant that could potentially foul the action or attract material that could .
Additionally , the seal between the bolt and the ejection port is much tighter than in current weapons , which will limit the amount of crud that can get in that way .
Also , the weapon can be fired even if the action is flooded with water .
No draining required .
While I doubt any squad leader would ever allow anyone to go an extended period of time without cleaning their weapon , regardless of manufacturer ’s ratings , there is a fair amount of time savings still to be found .
First of all , the XM8 can be field cleaned in 4 minutes .
This compares to more than 10 or 12 minutes for an M4 , which translates into a an extra bit of rest , patrol , or other duties for the XM8 - equipped soldier .
Weapons are cleaned at least twice daily , if not more , so this 5 - 8 minute savings is not insignificant when multiplied by three thousand soldiers in a typical brigade .
Also , the integrated sight is zeroed - in at the factory and does not require continual re-zeroing in the field by the troops .
Dirty and jammed weapons seem to have contributed to the defeat of the maintenance group that included Jessica Lynch during the invasion of Iraq .
Part of the problem seems to be that the Army - supplied cleaning lubricant is n’t effective , especially against the fine Iraq sand .
But non -combat units probably do n’t devote enough time to cleaning and maintaining their weapons .
The XM8 could help alleviate that by reducing the time required to complete the task , which will increase the odds that the task is attempted , and by being more forgiving if / when the task is forgotten or ignored .
Another nifty feature is the ability to be quickly adapted to fire AK - 47 ammunition .
This would be especially useful in Iraq , since there ’s more AK - 47 ammo in Iraq than there is sand .

Keep in mind that it was published by the manufacturier of the XM8 .

HK - USA also has what amounts to a product brochure for the XM8 here .
It includes drawings of many of the interchangable components of the XM8 system .
The XM8 has recently finished heavy testing .
The next step is going to be to equip two full brgades with the weapons .
I ’ve been unable to learn which brigades get to be the lucky ones to try a new standard weapon out for the purposes of working out all the bugs .
Maybe they have n’t been determined yet .
I ’d suggest that , in addition to the the big tests , some individuals or small units deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan get them .
We must learn how these things really perform , and no amound of testing and simulation can teach as many lessons as a few minutes on a real live battlefield can .
For all the apparent good news surrounding the XM8 , one basic issue remains the caliber of round our troops need to be firing at the bad guys .
The XM8 will fire the NATO standard 5.56x45 mm round , the same as the M4 and M16 .
There is a lot of grumbling among the troops that this round is insufficient , especially when fired from an M4 ’s shorter barrel .
The standard XM8 ’s barrel is two inches shorter than the M4 , so this issue will be even more pronounced .
This is a very controverisal subject , with feverent believers on both sides .
Many who think that a larger round , like the 6.8 mm or the good ol ’ 7.62 mm , is needed admit that the 5.56 might be sufficient if the type of ammunition was altered instead of the size .
There have been many reports from Iraq , Afghanistan , and Somalia that the current round just does n’t cut it .
I do n’t know enough to have an opinion on the matter , but it certainly seems that something needs to be done .
Airborne Combat Engineer had a post back in November about the XM8 and the ammuntion debate .
He notes that we ’ve already got so much refinement and investment in the current M16 and M4 that it seems like a waste to start over with a new weapon .
He asks why the current weapons ca n’t just be up - gunned with the new 6.8 mm uppers that will soon be hitting the market .
That ’s a very good question , and one that I hope our military seriously considers .
Back in August I thought the same thing .
But , if the XM8 performs in the field like it ’s performed in the tests , we might be better off in the long run if we make the change .
The cost , reliability , and adaptability of the new weapon may outweigh our experience with the current one .
UPDATE : A Sliding stock for XM8 compact carbine PDW has been added to the mix .

The key to success is making yourself as useful as possible to others .
You should make yourself so useful that you are indispensable to them .
But how do you do that ?
How do you make yourself indispensable ?
First of all we need to define what is meant by useful , since only by being useful can we become indispensable .
Being useful means meeting people ’s needs and desires .
It is solving people ’s problems .
Consequently , there is actually just one rule to make yourself indispensable :
Find what people need and meet those needs .
The more you can do it , the more you will become indispensable .
The next question is : how do you find what people need ?
Of course , there are a lot of needs people can possibly have .
Fortunately , people ’s needs and desires can be grouped into eight categories based on Abraham Maslow ’s work .
Here they are ( quoted from Made to Stick ) :
Physical : hunger , thirst , bodily comfort
Security : protection , safety , stability
Belonging : love , family , friends , affection
Esteem : achieve , be competent , gain approval , independence , status
Learning : know , understand , mentally connect
Aesthetic : symmetry , order , beauty , balance
Self - actualization : realize our own potential , self - fulfillment , peak experiences
Transcendence : help others realize their potential
These categories allow you to see the full spectrum of human needs .
In order to make yourself indispensable , all you need to do is focusing on meeting the needs in these categories .
Of course , you should emphasize different categories in different circumstances .
In some circumstances , you may be most helpful in Belonging , while in some other circumstances you may be most helpful in Learning .
You should always be aware of where you can be most helpful .
In this post , I ’d like to share 30 practical tips on how to do that for all of the categories except Security and Physical .
These two categories comprise very basic needs which are usually well met in the modern world .
Here they are :
Belonging
Listen to your friends without interrupting nor being hurry .
Send them your warm greetings via e-cards .
Tell them how you miss them .
Send them special messages at their birthday Comfort them in times of trouble .
Introduce them to your other friends to expand their networks .
Buy them gifts when you are traveling .
Even small gifts matter .
Note :

Esteem
Ask them how they are doing .
Praise them for the good jobs they have done .
Talk with them about their achievements .
Talk about how good they are in front of your other friends .
Be the first person to tell them about good news involving them .
Learning
Send them your favorite quotes .
Take the time to do small research to answer their questions .
Lend them your favorite books .
Spark their curiosity by asking them smart questions .
Tell them your favorite web sites to learn from .
Send them the articles you find that might help them .
Passionately share your learning experiences ; it ’s contagious .
Aesthetic

Tell them where they can learn to play music .
Tell them where they can learn to draw ( Drawspace is a good start by the way ) .
Share your favorite wallpapers and pictures .
Let them know of interesting cultural events you hear about .
Self - actualization
Encourage them to find their life purpose .
Encourage them to follow their heart more than the expectations of others .
Share with them inspirational stories about men and women who are willing to pay the price to do what matters to them ( e.g. Nelson Mandela , Mother Teresa ) .
Note :

Transcendence
Tell them about how joyful it is to help others by sharing your experiences .
Let them know about your favorite charities and why you like them .
When you are involved in a social activity to help others , ask them to join you .

NEGRO COCAINE " FIENDS " NEW SOUTHERN MENACE New York Times , Sunday February 8 , 1914 Murder and Insanity Increasing Among Lower Class Because They Have Taken to " Sniffing " Since Being Deprived of Whisky by Prohibition Edward Huntington Williams , M.D.
For some years there have been rumors about the increase in drug taking in the South - vague , but always insistent rumors that the addiction to such drugs as morphine and cocaine was becoming a veritable curse to the colored race in certain regions .
Some of these reports read like the wildest flights of a sensational fiction writer .
Stories of cocaine orgies and " sniffing parties " followed by wholesale murders seem like lurid journalism of the yellowest variety .
But in point of fact there was nothing " yellow " about many of these reports .
Nine men killed in Mississippi on one occasion by crazed cocaine takers , five in North Carolina , three in Tennessee - these are the facts that need no imaginative coloring .
And since this gruesome evidence is supported by the printed records of the insane hospitals , courts , jails , and penitentiaries , there is no escaping the conviction drug taking has become a race menace in certain regions south of the line .
In the North drug addiction is prevalent enough , in all conscience .
The hospitals for the insane in New York State admitted one insane drug taker to every 380 other patients last year and New York 's record is about the same as that of her immediate neighbors .
But in Georgia the proportion was one to 42 , in North Carolina about 1 to 84 , in Tennessee 1 to 74 , and in one of the Mississippi hospitals 1 to 23 .
Stated otherwise , these Southern States had between them , from five to fifteen times as many insane drug takers as New York state .
But these comparisons , although sufficiently startling , fail to show the extent of drug addiction in the South .
For most of these insane drug users , both North and South , were the victims of morphine ; whereas the negro drug " fiend " uses cocaine almost exclusively .
This preference is not explained by the difference in the effects of two drugs , but rather in the manner that each may be taken .
Morphine , when taken into the stomach acts slowly and tends to upset digestion .
If taken hypodermically its effects are produced almost immediately , and gastric functions are less disturbed .
But hypodermic medication requires apparatus liquid solution of the drug , . and a somewhat complicated process of preparation .
Cocaine , on the other hand , can be taken in the dry form by the simple process of sniffing into the nose like an ordinary pinch of snuff .
And the effects are almost instantaneous when so taken .
It can indeed , be mixed with , a brown powder that resembles ordinary snuff , and taken without detection under the very eyes of watchful officers .
The drug produces an exhilaration which is usually simply a mild intoxication , although it may produce the wildest form of insane excitation , accompanied by the fantastic hallucinations and delusions that characterize acute mania .
But this condition is followed by a state of terrible depression a few hours later , or would be followed by such depression if the drug were not again taken to prevent it .
It is for the purpose of averting this depressed state , as well as to produce the exaltation , that the " fiend " continues to use the drug once he has experienced either condition .
Stated thus , the effects of cocaine do not seem very different from these of alcohol .
But in point of fact , cocaine exhilaration is much more marked and the depression far more profound and destructive to the nervous system .
The victim is much more likely to have peculiar delusions and develop hallucinations of an unpleasant character .
He imagines that he hears people taunting and abusing him , and this often incites homicidal attacks upon innocent and unsuspecting victims .
Proof against Bullets .
But the drug produces several other conditions which make the " fiend " a peculiarly dangerous criminal .
One of these conditions is a temporary immunity to shock - - a resistance to the knockdown effects of fatal wounds .
Bullets fired into vital parts , that would drop a sane man in his tracks , fail to check the " fiend " -- fail to stop his rush or weaken his attack .
A few weeks ago Dr. Crile 's method of preventing shock in anaesthetized patients by use of a cocaine preparation was described in these columns .
A similar fortification against this condition seems to be produced in the cocaine - sniffing negro .
A recent experience of Chief of Police Byerly of Asheville , N.C. , illustrates this particular phase of cocainism .
The Chief was informed that a hitherto inoffensive negro , with whom he was well acquainted , was " running amuck " in a cocaine frenzy , had attempted to stab a storekeeper , and was at the moment engaged in " beating up " various members of his own household .
Being fully aware of the respect that the negro has for brass buttons , ( and , incidentally , having a record for courage , ) the officer went single - handed to the negro's house for the purpose of arresting him .
But when he arrived there the negro had completed the beatings and left the place .
A few moments later , however , the man returned , and entered the room where the Chief was waiting for him , concealed behind a door .
When the unsuspecting negro reached the middle of the room , the chief closed the door to prevent his escape and informed him quietly that he was under arrest , and asked him to come to the station .
In reply the crazed negro drew a long knife , grappled with the officer , and slashed him viciously across the shoulder .
Knowing that he must kill this man or be killed himself , the Chief drew his revolver , placed the muzzle over the negro's heart , and fired - " Intending to kill him right quick , " as the officer tells it but the shot did not even stagger the man .
And a second shot that pierced the arm and entered the chest had as little effect in stopping his charge or checking his attack .
Meanwhile , the chief , out of the corner of his eye , saw infuriated negroes rushing toward the cabin from all directions .
He had only three cartridges remaining in his gun , and he might need these in a minute to stop the mob .
So he saved his ammunition and " finished the man with his club . "
The following day , the Chief exchanged his revolver for one of heavier calibre .
Yet , the one with which he shot the negro was a heavy , army model , using a cartridge that Lieutenant Townsend Whelen who is an authority on such matters , recently declared was large enough to " kill any game in America . "
And many other officers in the South ; who appreciate the increased vitality of the cocaine - crazed negroes , have made a similar exchange for guns of greater shocking power for the express purpose of combating the " fiend " when he runs amok .
The list of dangerous effects produced by cocaine just described - hallucinations and delusions , increased courage , homicidal tendencies , resistance to shock is certainly long ; enough .
But there is still another , and a most important one .
This is a temporary steadying of the nervous and muscular system , so as to increase , rather than interfere with , good marksmanship .
Makes Better Marksmen
Many of the wholesale killings in the South may be cited as indicating that accuracy in shooting is not interfered with -- is , indeed , probably improved - by cocaine .
For a large proportion of such shootings have been the result of drug taking .
But I believe the record of the " cocaine nigger " near Asheville who dropped five men dead in their tracks using only one cartridge for each , offers evidence that is sufficiently convincing .
I doubt if this shooting record has been equaled in recent years : certainly not by a man under the influence of any other form of intoxicant .
For the bad marksmanship of the drunken man is proverbial ; while the deadly accuracy of the cocaine user has become axiomatic in Southern police circles .
Since every one in authority in the south is alive to the dangers of the cocaine habit , and eager to suppress it , two questions arise .
How does the negro get his supply ?
And why do not the officers in authority prevent his getting it ?
The reply to the first question is simple ; the exact source of supply is unknown .
The question as to why those in authority do not stop the practice of drug taking may be answered even more tersely : they can't stop it .
Of course the immediate channels of local distribution are frequently , detected .
Newsboys and bootblacks act as local vendors , and frequently these culprits are caught and punished .
But this does not solve the mystery of the general clandestine traffic ; for these local vendors refuse to
" peach " on their associates .
One newsboy in a North Carolina city accumulated a small fortune by the sale of the drug .
His regular price was " 10 cents a sniff " or 25 cents for a day 's supply which he dispensed in small pill boxes .
This is a common method of distributing the drug - - a vile concoction of cocaine mixed with some inert powder to give it bulk .
The boy procured his supply in the pure ( more or less ) form , and prepared the mixture to meet trade demands .
He was " the honored guest " at frequent gatherings of the cocaine taking brotherhood , ( and sisterhood , ) supplying his patrons when they dropped in casually for their " dope , " to loll about , luxuriating in the delicious exhilaration .
Any cabin might serve as resort , safe from the prying eyes of police officers
Although these officers suspected the boy of peddling the drug they failed to catch him at it .
And even when he finally acquired the drug habit himself , as most of these peddlers do eventually , and was so thoroughly " doped " that he that he squandered his money , and gave away the drug , he would never reveal the source of his supply .
But there is every reason to believe that he obtained regular consignments through the underground channels that flourish in many localities , entirely out of reach of the police .
The Mississippi River is probably the greatest highway for " wholesale " distribution , but Gulf ports and seaports are also avenues of entrance .
It is perfectly easy for a man to drop over the side of a boat coming into Mobile harbor , or one of the numerous channels at the mouth of the Mississippi , and disappear into the interior carrying a few pounds of the deadly powder , every ounce of which represents one thousand average doses .
But in all probability the greatest wholesale traffic is carried on from fixed shipping points , from which packages are sent to local peddlers , disguised in one of a hundred ways that escape detection .
And when we consider that even a single ounce - - a quantity that does not fill an ordinary watch pocket - will keep fifty " fiends " well " doped " for a week or more , we can readily understand why every effort to suppress the traffic utterly fails .
Why Do They Do It ?
Many of the negroes , even those who have not yet become addicted , appreciate the frightful penalty of dabbling with the drug .
Why , then do so many of them " dabble " ?
There are various facts that suggest an answer to this question , and evidence in the form or the opinions of physicians , officers , and the cocaine users themselves , that supports these facts .
The " fiend " when questioned , frequently gives his reason in this brief sentence : '' Cause I could n't git nothin ' else , boss . "
That seems to be the crux of the whole matter .
A brief survey of conditions in the South and a bit of recent legislative history make it perfectly evident why the negro " could n't git nothin ' else . "
In many States , in the South the negro population constitutes from 30 to 60 per cent of the total population .
Most of the negroes are poor , illiterate , and shiftless .
If we include in this class the poor whites , who are on a par with the average negro in poverty , ignorance , and general lack of thrift , we may reckon the aggregate number as representing about one person in three in the entire population .
Governing , or even keeping in reasonable control , such a host is an onerous task , even when most of the individuals of the host are sober .
The inevitable number of alcoholics adds to that task enormously .
The simplest way to remove this added menace -- it seems simple , theoretically , at least -- would be to keep whisky out of the low - class negro's hands by legislating it out of existence as far as he is concerned .
And so Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Mississippi , Tennessee , and West Virginia passed laws intended to abolish the saloon and keep whisky and the negro separated .
These laws do not , and were not intended to prevent the white man or the well - to - do negro getting his accustomed beverages through legitimate channels .
They obliged him to forego the pleasure of leaning against a bar and " taking his drink perpendicularly , " to be sure ; but a large portion of the intelligent whites were ready to make this sacrifice if by doing so they could eliminate the drunken negro .
That their only sacrifice was in method of taking , not in the amount of ardent spirits consumed , is shown by the records of liquor shipments that go to individual consumers .
The Interstate Commerce Commission reported in 1911 , using the figures presented by the Southern Express Company as a basis , that " the total annual movement indicated ( for the South alone ) is 6,085,264 gallons , " almost exclusively into prohibition territory , of course .
In December 1913 , the officials in Asheville , N.C. reported that they were receiving 400 gallon packages daily , 12,000 gallons monthly , or about three gallons per month for each family .
And Asheville is quite as abstemious as the other well - governed cities of the South .
But none of these countless gallon parcels reached the lower class negro , the " one man in every three " in the South .
His own ignorance and poverty make this a certainty , as the governing white intended .
Of course it is nothing short of " class legislation , " this giving to the rich and depriving the poor .
But what of it , so long as the discrimination applies to whisky ?
Nothing , of course -- provided , always , that those discriminated against do not find some substitute worse than the original trouble maker .
But unfortunately for the negro , and for his community , such a substitute was found almost immediately - - a substitute that is inestimably worse even than the " moonshine whisky , " drug - store nostrums , or the deadly wood alcohol poison .
This substitute , as I have pointed out , is cocaine ; and a trail of blood and disaster has marked the progress of its
substitution .
Should anyone doubt that prohibition is directly responsible for the introduction , and increase , of cocaine - taking in the South , let him consider a few pertinent facts supported by the opinions of competent observers .
Hospital and police records show that during the prohibition period drug habits have increased with alarming rapidity .
Physicians , officers , and " fiends , " with very few dissenting opinions , attribute the rise of cocainism to the low - class negro's inability to get his accustomed beverages .
Of course " fiends " are usually liars , and even officers of the law or practitioners of medicine may be mistaken .
But it is entirely improbable that all these men , from such widely different walks of life , should reach the same conclusion without adequate grounds for doing so .
Moreover , in cities where prohibition is strictly enforced , ( relatively speaking , ) the drug habit is increasing with alarming rapidity ; whereas in cities in which little attempt is made to prevent liquor traffic , there is a comparatively slight increase in cocaine taking .
thus the officials of Raleigh , N.C. , and Knoxville , Tenn. , to mention but two places where the prohibitory statute is enforced , report that cocaine taking has doubled in four years .
the Knoxville police arrested seven cocaine - taking women in a single day recently .
In Memphis , on the other hand , where half the population is colored , but where no attempt is made to prevent the sale of liquors , the drug habit is increasing slowly , if at all .
From Bad to Worse
In short , the South in attempting to correct a bad condition has created one infinitely worse .
For the evils of alcoholism - - its effects upon the individual , or even upon the community -- are not to be compared with the horrors of cocainism .
What is the South going to do about it ?
As far as the thousands who have already formed the habit are concerned there is little choice of remedies .
Once the negro has formed the habit he is irreclaimable .
The only method to keep him away from taking the drug is by imprisoning him .
And this is merely palliative treatment , for he returns inevitably to the drug habit when released .
For the thousands of negroes who have not yet acquired the habit , but who will do so eventually if present conditions continue , the outlook is scarcely more hopeful .
The drug traffic puts an irresistible temptation in their way , and this traffic continues to flourish .
The failure to suppress it cannot be attributed to lack of interest or strenuous endeavor on the part of officials .
Every one of these is doing his utmost to stop it , not merely from a sense of duty , but because of the much more compelling motive , self - preservation .
It is literally a matter of life and death with them .
And yet they fail utterly .
The great stumbling block in the way of suppressing the traffic is the fact that the causes that produce it have become entangled with a political issue .
The question is not merely -- what is best for the negro , or the race ?
But it is :
What is best for the politician ?
Presently the issue will take some other fantastic political twist , and then they will " call in the surgeons to patch up the wounded . "
But meanwhile these politicians have forced a new and terrible form of slavery upon thousands of colored men-- a hideous bondage from which they cannot escape by mere proclamation or civil war .

My name is Kirk Biglione and I have a problem .
I ’m addicted to RSS .
Like most addictions my problem started as innocent experimentation .
I began dabbling in RSS years ago when it was still a relatively new technology .
I told myself that it was a better way to keep up with the news .
I rationalized that I ’d save hours every day by using RSS to take a more focused approach to online reading and research .
A few minutes with my feed reader was supposed to be like an hour or more of surfing the hundreds of the websites that I try to keep up with on a regular basis .
Well , that ’s the way it was supposed to be .
How was I to know that RSS would turn into the pervasive and addictive social menace that it ’s become today ?
In retrospect , I probably should have known better .
I have a history of information addiction .
Way back in the mid-80 ’s ( pre-web , of course ) I was program director at KFSR .
At some point we decided it would be a good idea to subscribe to a wire service .
One day some nice men came and installed a UPI wire machine in our office .
This magic box was a sort of souped up a dot - matrix printer connected to some kind of dish mounted on the roof .
The machine received current news updates from the sky and printed them out in real - time .
Suddenly I had access to an unlimited supply of current news with no intermediary .
It was n’t long before I started making excuses to go to the KFSR office after - hours and on the weekends .
I ’d linger over the wire machine waiting for updates .
What if something interesting came in ?
I ’d be the first person to know … unless the ink ran out or the paper jammed .
From this story you can probably tell that I ’m not the sort of person who should have access to a feed reader .
At least not if I hope to be a productive member of society .
Things really started going down hill around the time I discovered FeedDemon .
Damn that Nick Bradbury !
With FeedDemon
I was tracking nearly a thousand feeds a day .
I ’d focus on the topics I was most interested in by setting up watch lists .
At first I thought that FeedDemon was helping me to effectively manage my information addiction .
On the contrary , the problem was actually getting worse .
I eventually realized that the more blogs I read , the more blogs I subscribed to .
Each day I ’d add a dozen new feeds to FeedDemon .
It was a vicious circle .
My feed reading began taking up larger chunks of my day .
At some point I came to my senses and realized that I had a serious problem .
I had become overwhelmed by the sheer number of feeds that I ’d subscribed to .
That ’s when I stopped .
I went cold turkey .
This happened around the time I completed my switch from Windows to Mac .
My decision to quit was , in part , supported by the fact that I had a hard time finding a Mac - based feed reader that I liked .
I tried nearly every available aggregator and none of them lived up to FeedDemon .
I know many of you think highly of Net Newswire , but it just does n’t feel right to me .
Unfortunately my experiment with RSS abstinence did n’t last long .
It ’s almost impossible to be a functional RSS addict in our society .
RSS has become so pervasive there ’s simply no way to escape it .
Everywhere I look I see those damn orange icons .
My return to RSS indulgence started innocently enough .
At first I plugged a few of my favorite feeds into MyYahoo .
Eventually I found myself subscribing to feeds in Firefox .
“ These are live bookmarks ” I told myself .
“ Entirely different concept ” .
But deep down inside I knew that they were the same old thing and that my RSS addiction was resurfacing .
As my collection of live bookmarks grew , I began grouping them in folders , and then sub - folders .
At some point they became so deeply nested they were almost impossible to use , and I found myself out on the street again , desperately looking for a reliable feed reader to give me the full - featured RSS fix I ca n’t live without .
I finally turned to Shrook .
I ’d experimented with it briefly in the early days of my transition to OS X . I know some Shrook detractors , but for me it comes the closest to replicating what I loved about FeedDemon .
I like Shrook ’s Smart Groups , as well as the ability to synchronize my reading activity between multiple computers .
I can start reading feeds on my desktop , then switch to my laptop later in the day and Shrook will mark the feeds I ’ve already read .
Lately I ’ve been hearing good things about Google Reader .
As a Google beta application it ’s under active development and improving rapidly .
I try it out periodically to see if it meets my needs , and I have to admit it ’s getting pretty close .
At some point it may become my feed reader of choice .
Fortunately when that day comes I know that I can easily transfer all of my feeds from Shrook by exporting them to an OPML file and then importing them into Google Reader .
In the meantime I ’m trying my best to manage my problem while maintaining a relatively normal and active life .
Some days are harder than others ( especially when there ’s a Stevenote ) .
To be honest , I ’m not sure there ’s a chance I ’ll ever fully recover .
When all is said and done I sort of like being an RSS junkie .

The Final Days of Summer : Gentle breezes , warm nights , and the roar of helicopters over quiet mountain communities in Eastern Washington .
It ’s harvest time .
Local police departments team up with the DEA and National Guard in the sky to identify marijuana by its telltale hue , yielding tens of thousands of pot plants and hundreds of arrests .
It ’s like shooting fish in a barrel , really pot is Washingtons second - largest cash crop , after apples .
Despite seemingly enormous returns , the helicopter strafes are mostly an air show .
Nary a dent is made in the pot market , as Dan points out .
Pot is still readily available ; its still the same price ; and it still hands hefty fourth - quarter profits to the Zip - Loc Corporation .
A report earlier this year estimated Washington annually produces about $ 1 billion worth of marijuana ( it ’s the nation ’s top cash crop at just over $ 35 billion ) .
A huge bust outside Yakima yesterday yielded 6,500 marijuana plants , worth a purported $ 9,750,000 even if each plant fetched an unrealistic $ 1,500 , the impressive haul represents less than one percent of Washington ’s untaxed pot crop .
The Drug Czar contends the work is an essential component of national security .
Late last month he marched reporters through the woods of Northern California , attempting to reverse the nations blasé reefer blindness .
Marijuana growers are “ violent criminal terrorists ” who would n’t hesitate to help other terrorists get into the country with the aim of causing mass casualties , he told them .
Although mainstream media outlets are staffed with critical thinkers on virtually every other issue , most reporters cant resist the fervor when it comes to these heroic eradication efforts .
Drug busts are part of the crime beat , see , and these here pot growers are criminals , see .
That s the story .
No mention is made of the cost of conducting the busts or the collateral expenses , such as rescuing a bunch of officers trapped in the Columbia River Gorge earlier this month .
No mention of the poor saps who get sent up the river .
So , without a peep about the busts  futility , another annual cycle of articles crop up here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here .

Using optical radiance data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MERIS ) aboard Envisat , Dr Jim Gower and Stephanie King of the Canadian Institute of Ocean Sciences and Dr Chuamin Hu of the US University of South Florida were able to identify extensive lines of floating Sargassum in the western Gulf of Mexico in the summer of 2005 .
" This appears to be the first report of a satellite image of Sargassum , " Gower said .
" It is usually associated with the area of the North Atlantic known as the Sargasso Sea after the Sargassum encountered there by early explorers .
Our observations of Sargassum lines extending over large areas of the Gulf show that in this area and season it represents a significant fraction of marine primary productivity . "
Marine primary production is the process by which floating vegetation , such as phytoplankton and seaweed , absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and convert it into organic carbon .
By absorbing half of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere , the oceans have a profound influence on climate , making them major areas of interest for climate modellers .
The discovery was made using the MERIS maximum chlorophyll index ( MCI ) which provides an assessment of the amount of chlorophyll in vegetation to produce detailed images of chlorophyll per unit area .
MERIS is uniquely suited for this because it provides images of above - atmosphere spectral radiance in 15 bands , including three bands at wavelengths of 665 , 681 and 709 nanometres in order to measure the fluorescence emission from chlorophyll a .
Chlorophyll is the green photosynthetic compound in plants that captures energy from sunlight necessary for photosynthesis .
The amount of chlorophyll present in vegetation plays an important role in determining how healthy it is .
Accurately monitoring chlorophyll from space , therefore , provides a valuable tool for modelling primary productivity .

" The 709 band used by MERIS is not present on other ocean - colour sensors .
It was essential to our detecting Sargassum , " Gower said .
" The MCI index has allowed us to find so many interesting things , including Sargassum and Antarctic super blooms .
It really gives us a new and unique view of the Earth . "
Gower and King are now combining data from MERIS with a sophisticated processing algorithm and powerful Grid computing to broaden this new view .
The basic principle behind Grid computing is that anything one computer can do , a pool of computers can do faster and better , enabling the solution of massively complex tasks beyond the capabilities of a single machine or local network .
By using Grid technology , Gower and King intend to compute 5 - years worth of MERIS data to determine global estimates of Sargassum biomass and its contribution to ocean productivity .
" So far , we have found two things ( Sargassum and Antarctic superblooms ) that have never been seen from space before , " said King .
" It is really very exciting . "

New research is giving scientists fresh insights into how genetics are a prime factor in how we learn .
Michael Frank , an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Laboratory for Neural Computation and Cognition at The University of Arizona , headed a team whose results are reported in the Oct. 1 issue of Early Edition , a Web site hosted by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Frank and his colleagues found links to learning behaviors in three separate genes associated with dopamine .
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter , a chemical in the brain that is often associated with pleasure , learning and other behaviors .
Several neurological disorders , such as Parkinson 's disease , are also linked to abnormal levels of dopamine .
Frank 's study points to fundamental genetic differences between " positive " and " negative " learners .
" All three genes affect brain dopamine functioning , but in different ways , and in different parts of the brain , " Frank said .
" The genes predicted people 's ability to learn from both the positive and negative outcomes of their decisions . "
Two of the genes – DARPP - 32 and DRD2 – predicted learning about the average , long - term probability of rewards and punishments , not unlike your personal preference for why , for example , you might choose steak over salmon .
" When making these kinds of choices , you do not explicitly recall each individual positive and negative outcome of all of your previous such choices .
Instead , you often go with your gut , which may involve a more implicit representation of the probability of rewarding outcomes based on past experience , " Frank said .
The DARPP - 32 and DRD2 genes control dopamine function in a region of the brain called the striatum , thought to be necessary for this kind of implicit reward learning .
A third gene , COMT , did not predict long - term reward or punishment learning , but instead predicted a person 's tendencies to change choice strategies after a single instance of negative feedback .
Frank said this gene affects dopamine function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain , the area associated with conscious processing and working memory .
This would be akin to switching from steak to salmon upon remembering your last experience with overdone steak .
The overall research program was designed to test a computer model that simulates the key roles of dopamine in reinforcement learning in different parts of the brain , as motivated by a body of biological research .
" The reason we looked at these three individual genes in the first place , out of a huge number of possible genes , is that we have a computer model that examines how dopamine mediates these kinds of reinforcement processes in the striatum and prefrontal cortex , " Frank said .
" The model makes specific predictions on how subtle changes in different aspects of dopamine function can affect behavior , and one way to get at this question is to test individual genes . "
Among the evidence incorporated in the model and motivating the genetic study is research showing that bursts of dopamine production follow in the wake of unexpected rewards .
Conversely , dopamine production declines when rewards are expected but not received .
To test their hypothesis , the researchers collected DNA from 69 healthy people who were asked to perform a computerized learning program .
The volunteers were asked to pick one of two Japanese characters that appeared on a screen and were " rewarded " for a " correct " response , and " punished " for an " incorrect " one .
Frank said more research is needed to confirm that genetic effects are accompanied by brain - related changes in behavior .
But , he said , the research offers insights into the genetic basis for learning differences and insights into improving human cognition and learning , both normal and abnormal .
" Understanding how dopaminergic variations affects learning and decision - making processes may have substantial implications for patient populations , such as ( those with ) Parkinson 's disease , attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia , " Frank said .
" The genetics might also help us identify individuals who might gain from different types of learning environments in the classroom . "

Atheists in the US " have been downtrodden for a very long time .
So I think some sort of political organisation is what they need " , he said .
Maybe David and Goliath would be a better analogy .
Religion is palpable in US schools , places of work and public institutions .
God is invoked by soldiers and politicians in a way that would seem inappropriate in Britain .
George Bush used God as one of the reasons for invading Iraq .
In Congress , where godlessness can equate with being unelectable , only one representative , Pete Stark , is prepared to admit to being a non-believer .
According to a study published last year by the University of Minnesota , Americans distrust atheists more than any other minority group , including homosexuals , recent immigrants or Muslims .
Now the best - selling author of The God Delusion and chair of public understanding of science at Oxford has set up an organisation to help atheists round the world , including the US .
In an interview with the Guardian , he said : " When you think about how fantastically successful the Jewish lobby has been , though , in fact , they are less numerous I am told - religious Jews anyway - than atheists and [ yet they ] more or less monopolise American foreign policy as far as many people can see .
So if atheists could achieve a small fraction of that influence , the world would be a better place . "
His organisation , established two months ago , complete with T - shirts bearing a large red A , is the Out Campaign .
" It does not mean outing , definitely not ... we want to encourage people to come out because there is a big closet population of atheists who need to come out . "
His estimates , which square broadly with official data , show that atheists in the US account for about 10 % of the population .
" I have had many letters from people saying ' I do n't dare give my opinions .
I am afraid of my family .
I am afraid of my wife , I am afraid of my husband .
I am afraid of my work people .
I am afraid of being fired ' . "
Prof Dawkins appeared as one of the stars of the Atheist Alliance convention in Crystal City , Virginia , at the weekend .
He admitted he was " a little bit hesitant " about being an Englishman talking to Americans and he showed " a certain amount of deference " when asked about US politics .
" But I think that this country is so powerful and what goes on politically here is so enormously influential , the rest of the world is entitled to have a say .
We do n't get the vote here but I think people are entitled to express an opinion . "
Although religious groups denounce him on websites and radio talkshows , he has not received abuse at public meetings ; religious people tended not to turn up - " which in a way is a shame " , he said .
What did he hope an atheist bloc in the US might achieve ?
" I would free children from being indoctrinated with the religion of their parents or their community .
I would like to free everyone from the assumption you have to be religious in order to be a decent person or to be moral .
Obviously stem cell research and all the interference with scientific research that goes on [ should stop ] .
Obviously the whole creationist interference with education [ should stop ] but I think , more positively , I would like to see people encouraged to rejoice in the world in which they find themselves , the universe in which they have been born , to take full advantage of the tiny slice of eternity they have been granted . "
He had been encouraged by the apparent distancing of Republican candidates for the 2008 presidential race from the Christian right .
But he found " very depressing " the profession of faith from all the Democratic candidates .
" I guess the Democrats have to pretend to be more pious than the Republicans because they are under suspicion of not being . "
Darwin's Rottweiler
Richard Dawkins ' vocal insistence on the pre-eminence of science ( he is nicknamed Darwin 's Rottweiler ) and his rigorous attempts to dismantle notions of faith and belief have earned him many critics , from those who complain about his evangelising tone to those who confidently predict he will spend eternity in hellfire .
His latest work , The God Delusion , incensed believers with its insistence on the hypocrisy and unreliability of scripture and its lampooning of creationists .
It also annoyed some in the scientific community for suggesting that few top scientists believed in God and that separating the rational and the religious was intellectually impossible .
In particular , Dawkins is angry at the way children are indoctrinated into faiths and takes issue with the unimpeachable taboos that protect religions from rational scrutiny .

The Fisher Space Pen ( above ) was developed with private money , but soon became part of an urban legend involving an expensive NASA program .
( credit : Fisher Space Pen Co. )
The billion - dollar space pen Everybody has heard of the infamous Space Pen .
Space has its urban legends of course , and the Million Dollar Space Pen is one of the more enduring ones .
It is neither as outlandish nor as unbelievable as the story about faking the Moon landings , and even though it seems more credible than a massive government conspiracy , it is probable that fewer people have heard it .
The story goes like this : in the 1960s , NASA astronauts discovered that their pens did not work in zero gravity .
So like good engineers , they went to work and designed a wonder pen .
It worked upside down .
It worked in vacuum .
It worked in zero gravity .
It even worked underwater !
And it only cost a million dollars !
The crafty Russians used a pencil .
This story , like most modern urban legends , has proliferated on the Internet , but it has also been passed by word of mouth .
I ’ve even heard a well - known space historian tell the story while talking about his new book , getting the expected laugh from his audience when he held up a Number 2 pencil for the punchline .
And , of course , the story has also been embellished , with the cost of the writing device getting ever higher , from a million dollars to a hundred million dollars to a billion dollars in some variations .
Undoubtedly at some point the cost will equal the mythical trillion - dollar price of a mission to Mars .
The story of the space pen actually begins with a very expensive pencil .
Urban legends survive because they serve a social purpose .
The classic ones , like the guy with the hook who kills the couple in the woods , reinforce morality lessons like do n’t park in the woods to have sex .
The Million Dollar Space Pen myth reinforces several particular stereotypes , such as the NASA “ nerdgineers ” who like to redesign the wheel , and the government bureaucrats who waste money on stupid things .
Another common stereotype is the crude but practical Russians who lack flash , but still get the job done .
Those stereotypes and themes live on in many ways , such as claims that NASA is incessantly hidebound and bureaucratic , whereas the Russians are simplistic and cheap , but practical .
There is some truth to these stereotypes , but naturally the reality is much more complicated and nuanced .
As for the Million Dollar Space Pen , the story actually begins with a very expensive pencil .
Gemini and the space pencil On March 23 , 1965 the spaceship Molly Brown ( otherwise known as Gemini Titan 3 ) lifted off from Cape Canaveral on a mission that lasted shortly under five hours .
Gus Grissom and John Young were onboard .
The flight earned a bit of notoriety soon after it ended when the astronauts were at a press conference and were asked about a “ contraband ” baloney sandwich ( some sources claim it was a roast beef sandwich ) that Young had carried aboard the flight in lieu of the officially approved food that they had been provided .
Although the controversy might seem silly at first , it had more serious undertones because of the concern that the astronauts might have concocted it as a stunt .
At the time , the astronauts had an exclusive deal with Life magazine , and reporters and members of Congress speculated that the astronauts were prone to smuggle items or engage in media stunts that they would only reveal in their magazine stories .
Another issue was that the flight surgeon had not approved the sandwich and was concerned about it because of possible crumbs , and the fact that it was two days old .
This , however , was actually the second controversy about the flight .
Earlier in the month , several newspapers reported that the mission would carry two pencils that cost $ 128.84 apiece .
NASA had spent $ 4,382.50 to purchase 34 of the pencils .
Members of the public were outraged at NASA ’s profligate spending and naturally they demanded answers from their congressmen .
Exactly two years to the day before the flight , Congressman John Wydler , of the Fourth District in New York and a member of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics , wrote a letter to NASA Administrator James Webb ( PDF , 1.3 MB ) asking for a full investigation of the expensive pencils and an explanation why their high costs were justified .
NASA received other letters as well , such as one from the President of Elgin School Supply Company of San Francisco .
NASA officials then had to explain to Congress and people like the president of the Elgin School Supply Company that the pencils were made of lightweight , high strength materials that could be attached to the inside of the spacecraft .
The pencil housings had been expanded so that the astronauts could use them while wearing their bulky spacesuit gloves .
The writing mechanism inside the housing had been procured from a local office supply house and had cost $ 1.75 each .
But the most sensitive items carried aboard Molly Brown were … four Pentel pencils with a total cost of $ 0.49 .
Deke Slayton “ was instructed to take every precaution in preventing this item from becoming public , ” wrote an investigator after the fact .
The flap over the pencils , combined with the controversy over the sandwich , resulted in an investigation by NASA into what objects were carried aboard the spacecraft and why .
The investigation revealed that in addition to the sandwich , the astronauts carried an American flag ( flown with management approval ) , a diamond ring owned by Grissom , Florentine crosses of Saint Gemini that had been sent by someone in Italy to the astronauts — and a brassiere ( hopefully not worn by one of the astronauts ) .
The astronauts were cautioned by Deke Slayton about “ such antics in the future . ”
But the most sensitive items carried aboard Molly Brown were … four Pentel pencils with a total cost of $ 0.49 .
Deke Slayton “ was instructed to take every precaution in preventing this item from becoming public , ” wrote an investigator after the fact ( PDF , 0.2 MB ) .
It is easy to understand why : when Congress and the public were outraged about the expensive $ 129 mechanical pencils , they would be even madder to learn that regular ( and Japanese ! ) pencils were carried as well .
The public and congressional complaints about the high costs of something as simple as a pencil are not that unusual .
Every few years some mini-scandal breaks out when somebody reveals the high cost that the government pays for what seems like a simple object such as a hammer or a coffee machine for an airplane .
The reason is that the object is recognizable .
Few people understand what a spacecraft solar panel or a gyroscope should cost , and thus will have no idea if the taxpayer is being cheated by an unscrupulous contractor .
But what they also do not understand is that in many cases quite ordinary devices can be expensive when they have to be redesigned for special conditions , particularly when they are manufactured in small numbers .
Ordinary objects are cheap primarily when they are produced in massive numbers , but when a government agency needs only a few dozen of them designed to unique specifications , they then become specialty objects .
The Fisher Space Pen Several years after the Molly Brown flight , and after NASA instituted much stricter rules carrying personal items aboard spacecraft , the curse of the writing instruments arose once again .
In the mid-1960s Paul Fisher of the Fisher Pen Company developed the Space Pen .
He did this on his own , without prompting by NASA and without NASA money .
What he did want from NASA was publicity , and to this end he managed to get his congressman to insert a promotional history of his Space Pen into the Congressional Record in March 1966 .
Fisher then contacted NASA and sought their review of promotional literature about the Space Pen .
A NASA official evaluated the advertising copy for the Space Pen and noted that the company “ is not now and has never been under contract to NASA – [ Manned Spacecraft Center ] for the supply of any writing instrument to be used in a manned spacecraft . ”
However , a different Fisher pen , known as the AG - 7 pen , was under consideration for carrying aboard American spacecraft .
What various documents about the Space Pen demonstrate is that NASA did not develop the Space Pen and initially did not even purchase it .
Over two months after Fisher first contacted NASA , the space agency replied and disapproved his advertising , ( PDF , 0.6 MB ) which the agency called “ quite misleading . ”
NASA ’s procurement office was at the time purchasing Fisher ’s AG - 7 pens at a cost of $ 4 apiece ( still a significant amount of money in 1967 ) , and was not buying the Space Pen , which cost $ 1.98 .
What various documents about the Space Pen demonstrate is that NASA did not develop the Space Pen and initially did not even purchase it .
We do not know how much Fisher Pen spent to develop the Space Pen , but it was private money , not government money .
To Fisher ’s credit , his company produced a good pen .
Within a few years NASA was indeed buying the Space Pen , which NASA called the “ Data Recording Pen ” , ( PDF , 0.2 MB ) in several “ configurations ” designated - 204 , - 207 and - 208 .
The pen was carried aboard Apollo and Skylab missions .
At that point , Fisher could honestly claim that the Space Pen flew in space and was used by American astronauts .
Naturally , that became a key part of Fisher ’s advertising campaign .
The myth of the wasteful bureaucracy The Million Dollar Space Pen Myth is just that , a myth .
The pens never cost a lot of money and were not developed by wasteful bureaucrats or overactive NASA engineers .
The real story of the Space Pen is less interesting than the myth , but in many ways more inspiring .
It is not a story of NASA bureaucrats versus simplistic Russians , but a story of a clever capitalist who built a superior product and conducted some innovative marketing .
That story , however , is a little harder to sell to a public that believes what it wants to believe .
