In addition to " five or six rifles and a handgun , " one agent said , they also found documents relating to the Michigan Militia , a paramilitary group that said it ejected the brothers from a meeting this year for " hyperbolic language . "
Leaders of the group have said the brothers were not members .
Today the authorities appeared to be wrapping up their search of asmall house in Herington , Kan. , where Terry Nichols lived most recently .
Mr. Nichols turned himself in on Friday in Herington .
Cable television workers in Herington were quoted by The Associated Press as saying that Mr. Nichols went to their office on Thursday , the day after the bombing , trying to have CNN installed as soon possible .
" He said he did n't know anything about the bomb and he wanted to know where he could watch " the coverage , said a worker , Chad Albin .
James and Terry Nichols grew up with their parents on a farm in Lapeer , Mich. , and then moved 40 miles northeast , to Decker , a town that has fewer than 200 people and no traffic lights and where the main street consists of a post office and a turquoise - painted bar .
James and Terry Nichols , who were both divorced , made their anti-authority views clear before Judge Donald Teeple of Circuit Court in nearby Sandusky in cases involving loan foreclosures and child - support payments .
In July 1992 , according to documents obtained by The Sanilac County News , Terry Nichols petitioned the court to " revoke , cancel , annul , repeal " all signatures and powers of attorney " over a bank loan .
Judge Teeple said that when Mr. Nichols appeared for a hearing he refused to approach the bench .
" He said he did not recognize the authority of the court , " the judge recounted .
" He was hollering in a loud voice from the back of the courtroom .
I informed him that if he did n't keep quiet I 'd send him to jail .
Then he decided to come around the rail . "
The judge said James Nichols appeared before him in the last few years for failing to pay child support for his son , Chase , who lives with Mr. Nichols 's former wife just north of Decker .
" I asked him why he had n't paid , " Judge Teeple said .
" He said he did n't have to pay , that the court did n't have any jurisdiction , that he was n't a citizen . "
From Greg Sargent at TPM Election Central :
Rudy Giuliani , speaking about his sixth place finish in Iowa yesterday :
“ None of this worries me — Sept. 11 , there were times I was worried . ”
As a GOP operative I know loves to say , the man has “ 9/11 Tourettes . ”
Ca n’t help himself .
A Michigan Middle School student learned the hard way about bringing video games to school when his PSP battery overheated in his pocket during band practice , sending him to the hospital with leg burns .
Apparently students are allowed to bring the systems to school as long as they do n't play them during school hours -- a policy which we 're sure the children follow to the letter .
There 's no word from Sony on the incident yet , or whether the kid was using a shady third party battery inside the system .

SAN FRANCISCO –* LEGO Universe* , the upcoming LEGO - branded MMO , can best be described as " LEGO Star Wars multiplied by a million , " according to Mark Hansen , the Director of Business Development for the LEGO Group .
Tentatively set for release in 2009 , LEGO Universe seeks to provide gamers with " a virtual extension of the real - world LEGO " gameplay , by allowing MMO fans a chance to virtually live among each of the thousands of LEGO sets that have been created over the years .
Most impressive in this quest is LEGO 's plan to integrate fabrication of objects directly into the title .
Any structure or vehicle you may construct out of the MMOs virtual blocks , you can also export to LEGO who will allow you to purchase traditional LEGO sets that are exact replicas of what you 've created in - game .
The biggest hurdle to LEGO in creating LEGO Universe is the challenge of transitioning a toy designed to assist people in furthering their own creativity through multi-colored bricks .
To draw an analogue to the issue they face , it 's almost a plastic brick version of what Will Wright had to do to create every title since SimCity .
According to Hansen , though , the creation system is only half of the title 's design .
The game will also include a traditional MMO - style plot which reflects the barebones ideas presented in the firm 's real - world brick sets : LEGO Knights vs Dragons , LEGO Sailors vs Pirates , and so on .
The title 's release is roughly a year off , but Hansen did reveal the fact that the game 's key trailer should hit the ' net near the end of 2008 .
Certainly it is still too early to judge the game entirely , but as long as LEGO maintains their trademark attention to detail and appeases the rabid fanbase they 've created in the preceding 70 years , LEGO Universe could be the Wii of MMOs ;
It certainly bucks trends , but it does so with such confidence that players may very well adore a fresh take on the stale , overcrowded genre .

Joy , joy , the Fed has cut rates again .
Picture the Joker from the movie Batman throwing money from his float on the parade and you can see where this is going .
Or imagine the alchemist of medieval lore , attempting to conjure up wealth from chemical mixtures .
The sea of inflationary credit is the core problem behind the falling dollar , the subprime crisis , the housing meltdown , not to mention the rise in the national debt and a thousand other problems .
And how do they deal with it ?
More credit and more calls for controls .
No one in Washington seems to understand the reason for the crisis , much less how to fix it .
The markets go for this stuff for a while until it looks like Washington is in panic mode .
Even Wall Street is starting to sense that something is very wrong .
A good indication is President Bush 's freeze on subprime mortgage rates .
It is a classic case that provides serious lessons for all of us .
It shows the political penchant for intervening in the market , the market response , and the further interventions that are called forth when the first round does n't bring the utopia they imagine .
Here is the great mortal threat that intervention poses to the economy : not the first round , not even the second round , but the relentless dynamic of political rescues that drive us further into the pit of state planning .
Under Bush 's solution , rate freezes kick in next year and subsidize only part of those affected .
His plan is under fire , not for being an intervention but for not bailing out every living soul .
Why do subprime mortgages exist in the first place ?
They are a market response to a regime of easy money that was brought about through the Federal Reserve in cooperation with government - backed mortgage underwritings , which have undergone an explosive expansion in recent years .
Since the period after World War II , the American dream has been identified with owning one 's own home .
And when the government makes a dream come true , it is going to do it good and hard .
So there were no limits .
The housing market has boomed and ballooned beyond belief .
No amount of money has been too much .
Houses require loans , so the mechanism of choice here is the interest rate .
A high rate both discourages borrowing and tends to separate good lenders from bad ones .
This is what the politicians , who love nothing more than giving people something for nothing , do not like .
So from the perspective of the state , the interest rate can't be low enough .
The political establishment loves this method of subsidizing the public as much as it loves the welfare state or any other transfer program .
In fact , it loves it even more .
The transfers associated with easy money are harder to detect than taxes and spending , but they are no less a redistribution .
They redistribute money from dollar holders to dollar spenders .
The 30 - year mortgage has been on a 15 - year downtrend at the very time when savings has been falling .
People were screaming when rates peaked in 1984 at 14.6 % .
They bottomed out in the salad days of 2005 at 5.77 % .
Then there was the subprime market that has accounted for 20 % of these loans .
These are for people who , in a real market , would never get a mortgage because their credit score is too low .
These loans come with adjustable rates , which sank millions of borrowers once rates began to rise .
The incredible fact is that these loans are an expected result of 15 years of government propaganda about mortgage loan " discrimination . "
Some genius noticed that the loan markets tend to favor people with good credit histories and some savings built up over time .
And then some other genius noticed the demographic fact that these credit histories , in general , parallel racial demographics .
Hot button !
And so the pressure was on to lend as if the prospect for repayment did n't matter .
The portfolio of loans in this category were only viable if we presumed that housing equity would rise forever .
Then it works like magic .
It 's like an economic perpetual - motion machine .
You borrow and borrow and the loan pays itself off .
Crazy ?
Yes , it is , but such is the craziness of any inflationary environment .
It leads people who should know better to believe that the impossible is happening .
It was not just the subprime market but the entire housing market that had been wildly distorted through intervention .
The money lent has had no economic justification , and the low interest rates are unsustainable .
And by the way , it is myth that the market has bottomed out .
The data still show that housing prices are rising nationally , albeit at a much slower rate than in the past .
What the market needs to be thoroughly rebalanced is a massive downward correction , one that is permitted to take place without any intervention .
But will the political establishment allow it ?
No way .
The relative minor problems that have cropped up with subprime have elicited some of the most ridiculous regulation in memory .
Both parties agree that rates should be frozen low , so that existing borrowers do n't have to pay market rates .
This strategy only forces banks to hold low - quality loans and passes the risk up the chain of borrowers , penalizing people with good credit and rewarding people with bad credit — which is essentially the opposite of what credit markets are supposed to do .
But it gets worse .
Interest rates are dropping , not rising , both long term and short term .
This is precisely the opposite of what is best at this stage in the market .
The drunk is taking another snort just as he was sobering up a bit .
Where is the end of all of this ?
We can't know the specifics , but long - term disaster looms .
One can't create prosperity out of a printing press .
Michael Heilperin , one of the prophets of the current money mania , once described the attempt as the pathology of money .
It is a pathology because it amounts to an amazing denial of reality .
Here is the plan in Bernanke 's own words :
The U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation .
The question is , no cost to whom ?
Inflation , in case we 've forgotten , is robbery by another name .

Sex - change lizards settle a hot topic
An Australian research team has provided what they say is the " Holy Grail " of evolutionary biology - proof a 30 - year - old theory about reptile sex and survival is right .
The findings explain the evolutionary advantage of a reptile 's sex being determined by temperature .
The University of Sydney 's Professor Rick Shine and his former student Dr Daniel Warner , now of Iowa State University , report that the temperature at which a reptile egg is incubated not only determines sex but optimises the number of offspring in future generations .
Their findings , published online this week in the journal Nature , provide the first " unequivocal " demonstration that incubation temperatures affect the reproductive success of males and females .
In mammals and birds sex is determined by genotype at fertilisation resulting in roughly equal numbers of sons and daughters .
However in many reptiles and some fish , sex is determined after the egg is laid and is dependent on the environment , most commonly the temperature .
Shine , from the School of Biological Sciences , says in some species of reptiles only males or females will be born at certain temperatures .
He says about 30 years ago US biologists Professor Ric Charnov , now of the University of New Mexico , and Professor Jim Bull , of the University of Texas , suggested this " environmental sex determination " was not just a quirk of nature .
Rather they believed males or females incubated at certain temperatures had an evolutionary advantage - specifically , that they would have an optimised number of offspring .
But proving this theory was another matter and has since been the " Holy Grail " for evolutionary biologists , Shine says .
Experimental challenges
Shine says one challenge in proving the ideas of Charnov and Bull was finding a species with a short enough life span so it was practical to measure the entire number of off - spring it had over its life .
Most species with environmental sex determination have life spans of more than 60 years and reach sexual maturation late .
But Shine says the short - lived Jacky dragon ( Amphibolurus muricatus ) , a common species of lizard found on the east coast of Australia , helped overcome this challenge .
The Jacky dragon produces off - spring within one year of hatching and lives no longer than four years .
Wrong sex
The other experimental challenge was to artificially produce the " wrong " sex at a given temperature .
Shine says female Jacky dragons are produced from eggs incubated at low ( 23 °C - 26 °C ) and high ( 30 °C - 33 °C ) temperatures whereas males are produced at intermediate temperatures .
In their Australian Research Council - funded study the researchers hormonally manipulating eggs to produce males and females at temperatures they would not normally be produced at .
He says , the hormonal manipulation of the eggs had no effect on the health and survival of individual hatchling Jacky dragons .
But the natural males were five to 10 times better in terms of mating and producing offspring , while the natural females produced four to five times more offspring , says Shine .
" Thus reproductive success of each sex was optimised by the incubation temperature that produces that sex in nature as predicted by the [ Charnov - Bull ] model , " the researchers say .
Shine says he is " astounded " at how " beautifully " his team 's data matches the Charnov - Bull model .
He has received an email from a " delighted " Bull congratulating him on proving the theory .
The contraceptive pill substantially reduces women 's risk of ovarian cancer and continues to protect them for at least 30 years after they stop taking it , according to a big scientific analysis published today .
The research , by Oxford University epidemiologists , suggests that the risk of ovarian cancer is cut by 20 % for every five years that a woman has been on the pill .
Those who take it for 15 years cut their risk by half .
Ovarian cancer is hard to detect and kills two - thirds of those who get it .
The public health implications are great , say the scientists .
The pill has prevented about 200,000 cases of ovarian cancer and 100,000 deaths around the world - mostly in the developed countries - over the last 50 years , they say .
Because women get ovarian cancer later in life , often around 55 and onwards , those numbers will rise as the preventive effect kicks in for women who took the pill years ago .
Writing in the Lancet medical journal , Professor Valerie Beral and colleagues say they expect the number of cases prevented to rise to 30,000 a year .
The large review , which included data from 45 studies involving 100,000 women , will reopen the arguments over the pill .
Women deserted it in droves years ago because of fears that it might increase their breast and cervical cancer risks , but recent work has shown the increase in risk occurs as women get older , beyond the age of around 35 .
It also disappears almost as soon as they stop taking the pill .
The new findings on ovarian cancer suggest that it could be beneficial for young women to take the pill for 10 years or so .
An editorial in the Lancet , one of the world 's leading medical journals , calls for the pill to be made easily available .
" Women deserve the choice to obtain oral contraceptives over the counter , removing a huge and unnecessary barrier to a potentially powerful cancer - preventing agent , " it says .
Why the pill should prevent ovarian cancers is unknown .
Two Canadian scientists , writing a commentary for the Lancet , say the study shows " that this unequivocal protective effect stems from the cumulative suppression of ovulatory cycles " .
It appears that oral contraceptives in young women " could help to decrease the number of cells that are likely to become malignant over a lifetime , whereas HRT after menopause could have a carcinogenic effect , " write Eduardo Franco and Eliane Duarte - Franco from McGill University and the Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec .
The results of the Oxford study are " unequivocal good news " , they say , but add that women and their doctors will once more have to perform a balancing act between the risks and benefits of the pill .
The scientists gathered data from 23,257 women who had developed ovarian cancer and 87,303 who had not .
Some 31 % of the first group had used the pill and 37 % of the second .
They found that in high - income countries such as the UK , where 25 % of women aged 16 - 49 take the pill , 10 years of oral contraceptives reduced the numbers getting ovarian cancer from 12 per 1,000 to eight , and their chance of death from seven per 1,000 to five .
The Family Planning Association said it was great news for women .
" There is now substantial evidence showing that for most women the benefits of taking the contraceptive pill are far greater than any of the risks , " said the association 's chief executive , Julia Bentley .
Backstory
The pill is credited with kick - starting the sexual revolution and putting the swing into the 1960s .
But in the 50 years of its existence , the pill has provoked as much angst as free love .
It was developed in the US and first tested by women in Puerto Rico .
Early versions contained high doses of oestrogen and progestin , the hormones involved in women 's reproductive cycle .
By 1969 , one million women were on the pill .
Now there are 3.5 million on it in the UK , and 100 million worldwide .
Scares in the 80s over links to breast cancer , heart attacks , strokes and blood clots dented the pill 's popularity .
Low dosage formulations have since reduced many of the risks .
For more than three months , as turmoil in the credit market has swept wildly through Wall Street , one mighty investment bank after another has been brought to its knees , leveled by multibillion - dollar blows to their bottom lines .
And then there is Goldman Sachs .
Rarely on Wall Street , where money travels in herds , has one firm gotten it so right when nearly everyone else was getting it so wrong .
So far , three banking chief executives have been forced to resign after the debacle , and the pay for nearly all the survivors is expected to be cut deeply .
But for Goldman ’s chief executive , Lloyd C. Blankfein , this is turning out to be a very good year .
He will surely earn more than the $ 54.3 million he made last year .
If he gets a 20 percent raise — in line with the growth of Goldman ’s compensation pool — he will take home at least $ 65 million .
Some expect his pay , which is directly tied to the firm ’s performance , to climb as high as $ 75 million .
Goldman ’s good fortune cannot be explained by luck alone .
Late last year , as the markets roared along , David A. Viniar , Goldman ’s chief financial officer , called a “ mortgage risk ” meeting in his meticulous 30th - floor office in Lower Manhattan .
 from the Buffalo Beast
Something astonishing happened the other day in the House : The Democratic leadership found some courage .
After over a year of demoralizing , often inexplicable capitulation , they actually gathered the fortitude to push back slightly against Republicans on so - called national security issues .
The Republicans ’ response was swift :
They took their ball and went home , after a brief stop at a prearranged press conference on the Capitol steps .
Two issues caused the dispute : One , in a stunning display of rudimentary oversight , the House issued contempt citations for two former Bush staffers , Harriet Meiers and Josh Bolten , who ’ve been ducking House subpoenas for months now .
This was predictably dismissed by weepy Minority Whip John Boehner as a “ partisan fishing expedition , ” a boilerplate cliché if ever there was one .
The second issue , which the indignant Republicans preferred to discuss , for obvious reasons , was the House Democrats ’ refusal to cave on retroactive immunity for telecom companies , like AT&T and Sprint , for collaborating with the White House in spying on domestic internet and phone communications , which , to be clear , was tremendously illegal .
What ’s less encouraging , but interesting , is that the Democrats were ready to sign off on extending the repugnantly named Protect America Act , except for telecom immunity .
To Bush , this made the bill dead on arrival .
That ’s right ;
Bush promised to veto the bill if it reached his desk without a get out of jail free card for Comcast .
It ’s hard to line that up with the apocalyptic tenor of Bush ’s exhortations regarding the bill .
If the warrantless domestic spying provisions of the Act were not renewed , Bush warned , Osama bin Laden would rain fire upon us all .
But he was planning to veto them if they came to him without immunity .
Naturally , this makes no fucking sense .
Either Bush is willing to risk another 9/11 to embarrass the Democrats , or he ’s lying when it comes to the threat posed by having to get a FISA warrant — retroactively , after the fact — for domestic surveillance .
I think he ’s lying , but I suppose it could be both .
It ’s interesting that these issues are what it takes to really outrage Republicans — threaten huge corporate giants with lawsuits , or exercise congress ’s constitutional oversight powers .
Of course , it ’s only natural that the Republicans would shudder at the prospect of effective investigations being conducted in the House .
If the Democrats actually start following through on the legal options to compel testimony , it ’s only a matter of time before everyone ’s implicated .
But telecom immunity ?
Republicans are , of course , fundamentally pro-corporate , even moreso than modern Democrats .
But to go to bat this hard on behalf of an industry seems anomalous even for them .
All a congressman usually has to do for his biennial bribe is vote in a corporation ’s interests , not engage in tantrum theatrics .
There ’s more than pedestrian corruption at work here .
Of course , there is the terror issue , and in a most perilous election year , Republicans would like nothing more than to be able to run on the “ Dems are sissies ” platform .
If they can keep people frightened and badly misinformed , they may manage to make telecom amnesty into a winning issue for them come November .
But to do that , they have to lie .
A lot .
They have to feign outrage , and actual concern for the wellbeing of their fellow Americans .
They ’re doing their level best .
To hear Republicans tell it , requiring a rubber - stamp warrant , after the fact , to spy on Americans is like mailing plutonium to Iran .
Bush ’s spiel was grade A horseshit from start to finish :
“ Because Congress failed to act , it will be harder for our government to keep you safe from terrorist attack .
At midnight , the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence will be stripped of their power to authorize new surveillance against terrorist threats abroad .
This means that as terrorists change their tactics to avoid our surveillance , we may not have the tools we need to continue tracking them — and we may lose a vital lead that could prevent an attack on America ....
Instead , the House held partisan votes that do nothing to keep our country safer .
House leaders chose politics over protecting the country — and our country is at greater risk as a result . ”
Then sign the bill without the telecom amnesty provision , and work on that part later .
If it ’s nearly as vital as Bush says , he ’s providing aid and comfort to the enemy by not compromising , right ?
“ If the Protect America Act is allowed to expire , Americans will be at risk , ” echoed Boehner , despite having just voted against a three - week extension on the bill , like all his fellow Republicans in the House .
What the hell is going on here ?
When you compare the truths of this dispute with the rhetoric from the White House and its mouthpieces , there ’s really no other conclusion than that this country has gone fucking bonkers .
Reality and public perception do n’t even share a zip code anymore .
After years of constant , obvious lies , their ridiculousness compounded by countless revelations of their falsehood , Bush is still sticking with the same despicable , transparently manipulative bogeyman bullshit he started with .
And like - minded jackasses in the media , like Bill Kristol on Fox News Sunday , still have the inconceivable gall to say things like , “ I think it 's kind of unbelievable , frankly , that — it 's a judgment call , we do n't know — not to give the administration the benefit of the doubt . ”
The benefit of the doubt ?
A judgment call ?
Sorry Bill , but fuck you .
Your judgment 's been shit ; your President 's judgment 's been shit , and both of you are documented liars .
So forgive the hell out of the rest of us if there 's no doubt to benefit from when it comes to whether the president is a fucking fraud .
The entire administration is a fraud .
Every department is a fraud , staffed by fraudulent people , hostile to its stated mission and intent on it 's nullification , by death or paralysis .
There may never be proof , especially if Bush gets his way , but what thinking person can muster much doubt that the administration is listening not just for terrorist chatter , but to anyone they want — political enemies , reporters , chicks they ’re into — whoever .
In 2006 , after Andrea Mitchell asked New York Times reporter James Risen , who broke the domestic spying story , out of the blue , “ You do n't have any information , for instance , that a very prominent journalist , Christiane Amanpour , might have been eavesdropped upon ? ”
Risen did not , but NBC scrubbed the question from its transcripts of the interview , later explaining that the story had been “ released prematurely , ” that they had not “ completed ” their reporting .
But they did n’t call the allegation irresponsible , or speculative , or any other dismissive adjective they could have used .
They essentially confirmed that they had reason to believe that Bush was secretly wiretapping a prominent CNN reporter .
And why the hell would n’t he , after all ?
Without a reviewable record of warrants , it ’s not as if anyone can possibly find out — unless somebody sues the telecoms , and specific , decidedly non-terrorist surveillance targets are identified in the ensuing discovery process .
And that is why the Republicans are going apeshit over retroactive immunity , not just to protect the telecoms , but to cover their own asses .
If it ever comes out that their secret , illegal domestic wiretaps were not targeting al Qaeda , but Al Gore , the jig is finally up .
The entire “ trust us , we ’re hunting terrorists ” rationale , as thin as it always was , will lose any residual integrity , and the GOP may never recover .
And they know it .
And maybe , hopefully , the Democrats finally know it too .

I 'm a loser ?
So going to loud parties , dancing , getting drunk , getting laid , and puking your guts out afterwards makes you a winner ?
I 'm tired of it .
I run into this attitude all over the place .
Here it is , folks , the absolute truth : A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THINKS THAT IF YOU DO NOT REGULARLY ATTEND CERTAIN TYPES OF SOCIAL GATHERINGS , YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY A LOSER .
Pure and simple .
Maybe it 's just because I live in a college town , but it seems like I 'm getting judged constantly because of my disinterest in the party styles of the masses .
I get it all the time from guys : " Do n't you ' go out ' ? "
Sure I go out .
To poetry readings .
To anime meetings .
To friends ' houses .
To Putt - Putt to play video games , hell , I do n't know .
But when I tell people the places I frequent when I leave my house , I am met with something like this : " No , I mean GO OUT , like clubs ! " Strange . . . these people do n't consider my form of entertainment " real " entertainment .
I am judged by these people as " not having a life " because I do not like to go to clubs or large beer bash parties .
It seems as though these people think I 'm just not cool enough because I prefer poetry readings and one - on - one activities with friends to their raging keggers .
When they hear I do n't go to these , they immediately assume I 'm socially inept , nerdy , a computer geek , probably fat and ugly and a big bitch besides .
If someone is not into the club scene they are automatically a complete dork and are " missing real life . "
I have had people regard me with pity and incredulous stares when I answer truthfully that I 'd rather just hang out at home or go to a movie with a friend . . . when I am offered the chance to go to a club or party and I refuse , people are like , " WHAT ??
Why ??? "
Why would I rather be inside than " out " at a club ?
Why do I choose to engage in intellectual pursuits rather than get drunk every weekend ?
Why does my sorry ass choose building homepages as a hobby in favor of mate - swapping ?
I 'll tell you .
The reasons I do n't like clubs
They 're loud .
I have very sensitive ears and I do n't like music to be so loud that it literally vibrates the walls .
I like to be able to hear my friends talk to me without screaming .
I like waking up the next morning without my ears ringing .
They play music I do n't like .
On the whole , anyway .
I have rather obscure taste in music , and unless clubs have started playing Weird Al or Suzanne Vega when I was n't looking , I have little interest .
I am exposed to the " music of today " through friends and acquaintances and generally have little to no interest in it .
I do n't like to drink .
I am four feet eleven inches tall and weigh about a hundred and ten pounds ( 149 cm , 51 kg ) , and am female .
In case you do n't know what I 'm getting at , that makes me liable to get VERY drunk VERY quickly on VERY little .
( I 've been told that most women generally lack a certain enzyme in their stomachs that men have -- it helps to process alcohol . )
I also do not have a history of drinking and therefore have built up little tolerance - - nor do I want to .
I do n't enjoy the feeling of being drunk , and furthermore I do not need to be drunk in order to function socially .
Not to mention that I do n't very much enjoy being around drunk people . . . they 're ridiculous , though funny to watch - - from a distance .
I do n't like to dance , except to be goofy sometimes .
I 'm not a dancer , alone or with others .
Being asked to dance does n't float my boat , and I probably would n't know what to do if someone did ask .
This also ties into the fact that I do n't like the music ( mentioned above ) , so it does n't inspire me to move at all .
It 's just not my thing -- some people get annoyed with me over this , asking " how could you not want to dance when the music is playing ? "
I suppose it 's the same reason hearing a beautiful song does n't make some of THOSE people want to write poetry : WE'RE DIFFERENT .
I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A MAN AND FURTHERMORE REALLY DESPISE BEING HIT ON .
Many people go to clubs to " hook up . "
The people who go to clubs to " hook up " often assume that everyone else is there for the same thing , and use this ( and alcohol ) as their excuse to shamelessly hit on everyone that appeals to them .
I get hit on enough without going someplace that doubles as a meat market ; sad as it is , that would just be asking for it .
So , in a nutshell , I hate a lot of things about clubs , find them boring , and have better things to do with my time .
These reasons seem to make no difference to the people who can't understand why I do n't " go out . "
They insist that because I do n't like this stuff , I must not know how to have a " good time . "
Well , thank you very much , but a poetry reading IS a " good time " for me , as is chatting with a friend , going bowling , or playing tennis .
That does n't make me a loser .
That makes me different .
And believe it or not , * I* happen to think that a lot of people who go to clubs and parties are losers , so it goes both ways .
There is not a clear - cut definition of loserhood here , fellas . . . you may be thinking I 'm a loser for not " clubbing , " but I 'm sitting here thinking just as badly of you .
Here 's why .
Drinking is bad for you .
Yes , we all know that beer and its alcoholic cousins are not especially healthy beverages and that alcohol damages your liver and whatnot .
But it 's bad for you as a person , too .
It inhibits your perceptions and makes you a slobbering idiot when you drink too much .
Lots of people say they need to drink to " relax , " but I think that if you feel you * need * to drink in order to " be yourself , " then there IS no " yourself " and you probably need to do some soul - searching instead of beer - drinking .
And what do I get when I say I do n't drink ?
" What are you , some kind of prude ? " Um . . . no , I just like my reality the way it is , thanks . . .
It 's pathetic when you spend every weekend of your life searching for someone to bang .
Sure , some people who are looking for a mate are looking for " the real thing , " but some are just looking for sex , and even those who are looking for a long - term relationship and eventual marriage are * really * barking up the wrong tree when they 're looking for their future spouse in a damn bar .
It bugs me when people have an all - consuming need to find a significant other , but that is really another story -- all I 'll say now is that I think " looking for a mate " makes little sense .
What does " clubbing " accomplish , anyway ?
Okay , it 's fun .
I buy that !
That 's a perfectly good reason to do it , just like it 's a perfectly good reason for me to play ping - pong .
But you must admit that other than being fun , it does not accomplish anything except emptying your wallet , filling your stomach with beer if you 're so inclined , and possibly allowing you to score .
If those things are among your goals , okay . . . but when you laugh at me , saying , " Oh my God , what a loser you are . . . sitting home to write BOOKS while I 'm out there partying ! " . . . well , let 's just think for a second and figure out which one of us will have something to be proud of at the end of the night .
" It 's something to do . "
I think a lot of people go out to clubs because they 're bored and they want to have some fun .
Putting aside any judgments I have on whose fun is better , let me just say that I am almost NEVER bored because just my own brain is enough to entertain me for hours .
I think that if you do n't at least sometimes do something creative , or at least something * varied * , you 're not making the most of your life .
You do n't have to do what I do ( i.e. , write , create homepages , whatever ) to be creative , but I just do n't think you 're justified in calling me a big loser when every weekend your agenda includes getting drunk in a loud club and trying to get laid because " it 's something to do . "
Anyway , my apologies to anyone who ’s offended by this . . .
I honestly do n’t consider someone a loser just because they like clubs or kegger bashes , even if they like to go to them often .
But if they are smothered in the attitude that there is just no other way to have fun , no other acceptable entertainment than guzzling intoxicating liquid in a vibrating room with scantily - clad hormone receptacles , I just ca n’t respect them .
In other words , okay , have your fun , but leave me out of it , and keep your judgments to yourself .
I only consider you a loser if you ’re willing to assign me the role of " loser " because I do n’t do the same thing you do to get my jollies .
It ’s amazing to me that people see me staying home on a weekend and feel pity , assuming I ’m a sad , introvert ed little nerd because I ’m not “ going out ” when the truth is “ going out ” would n’t make me happy .
I am content with my life and going clubbing is not going to suddenly make my life more meaningful , I ’m sorry .
If you want to call me a loser , go for it , but you ’d better do it to my face , because I ’ll be standing there holding a mirror .
Wow !

You know , I think I really learned a lot from this propaganda documentary from Pravda Fox News .
I really do n't know how it is that I had n't noticed previously how much George Bush is just like Abraham Lincoln , the founder of the Republican Party , or that Bush is already known for giving " some of the most eloquent and visionary speeches ever delivered by an American President , " just like the Gettysburg Address !
So , which of Bush 's speeches do you think will be memorialized for generations to come ?
Will George W. Bush go down in history as being a great President , or the greatest President ?

Tendulkar 's decision to reject the captaincy opens the door for Dhoni
The legendary batsman , 34 , was skipper for two spells from 1996 - 2000 but stood down after only four wins in 25 Tests .
He was offered a third stint to succeed Rahul Dravid , who quit in September , but told TV channel CNN - IBN : " I do n't feel right about it at the moment . "
India 's selectors , who will name their choice on Thursday , are now likely to go for Mahendra Dhoni , 26 , who is captain of the one - day team .
606 : DEBATE
Dhoni led India during their World Twenty20 triumph in South Africa in September .
If appointed , his first Test series as skipper will be against Pakistan , which begins after the ongoing one - day series between the teams finishes .
The wicket - keeper / batsman is seen in some quarters as too inexperienced for the job in the longer format , having featured in only 20 Tests .
Former India coach Greg Chappell said : " He is doing his apprenticeship in the limited - overs forms of the game .
It wo n't be long before I think he is ready .
Probably another 12 months or more . "
But Niranjan
Shah , secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India , hinted that Dhoni would be handed the reins following advice from Tendulkar .
" He was of the view that the Indian team was doing extremely well and the board must think of appointing a younger person as the captain looking at the future of the team , " Shah said .

In the cerebral cortex , the brain 's powerful central processing unit responsible for higher functions , specialized subdivisions known as areas are laid out like a map , but little is known about the genetic forces that shape the geography of our brains .
In this week 's advance online edition of Nature Neuroscience , an international collaboration between researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine in Italy reports the discovery of a novel function for a factor that negotiates the borders between areas and balances their sizes and positions relative to each other .
The factor , COUP - TF1 , ensures that the frontal areas do n't claim too much cortical real estate .
Without COUP - TF1 keeping the frontal areas in check , they undergo massive expansion squeezing and pushing neighboring sensory areas literally to the back of the brain .
The findings show how the cortex is properly parceled into " frontal " areas that control higher functions related to emotions and the movements of our bodies versus areas that interpret our sensory environment and allow us to see , hear and feel .
Because primary areas in humans differ by two - fold or more in the normal population , these findings may explain these size differences , which appear to account , at least in part , for differences between individuals in behavior and skills .
" Until now , there has been only one other gene , Emx2 , that everybody agrees on directly controls area patterning , " explains co-senior author Dennis O'Leary , Ph.D. , professor in the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute .
" Our current understanding of this process is the proverbial tip of the iceberg .
We are only beginning to define the mechanisms that determine the area identity of neurons in the cortex . "
The back of the cortex is predominantly specialized to process vision , whereas the front of the cortex handles motor functions and controls voluntary movement , as well as having a central role in higher cognitive functions .
The area right above the ear trades in sounds and speech , while the somatosensory area located in the middle top of the head interprets information about touch and pain .

In previous studies , the O'Leary lab discovered that Emx2 , a gene common to mice and men as is COUP - TF1 , instructs progenitor cells to develop into visual neurons .
" Emx2 is the gold standard for genes that impart area identity to cortical neurons , " says O'Leary .
" When we increased the amount of Emx2 , the visual area expanded at the expense of the frontal and somatosensory areas and vice versa . "
Just like the Emx2 gene , COUP - TF1 is normally most active in the back of the cortex , with its activity gradually tapering off toward the front .
Both genes code for transcription factors -- which operate by controlling a cascade of other genes -- hinting at a possible role for COUP - TF1 in area patterning as well .
Completely eliminating the gene in lab mice through genetic engineering -- a mainstay of scientists trying to figure out the function of a particular gene -- did not clarify the roles of COUP - TF1 .
" Mice without COUP - TF1 have many defects and die a few days after birth before functional areas can be defined , " explains co-first author Shen - Ju Chou , a postdoctoral researcher in the O'Leary lab .
So O'Leary and his team collaborated with Italian researchers , led by Dr. Michele Studer , who is co-senior author with O'Leary of the study , to develop mice in which COUP - TF1 can be selectively removed from progenitor cells in the cortex just before they start generating cortical neurons .
The mice survive to be adults and appear quite normal .
Their cortical landscape , however , is a different matter .
" We were surprised by what we saw , " Chou says .
" The frontal areas took over most of the cortex , while the sensory areas were drastically reduced in size and relegated to a small domain at the back of the brain . "
The overall size of the cortex stayed the same .
" Our findings imply that Emx2 and COUP - TF1 work in opposing ways , " says O'Leary .
" While Emx2 works in a positive manner to specify the area identity of visual neurons , the presence of COUP - TF1 prevents progenitor cells from taking on a motor area identity . "
Although the mice lacking COUP - TF1 in their cortex do not have any obvious sensory or motor problems , the researchers believe that a closer look will reveal substantial deficits .
Their prediction is based on a study published by O'Leary and his colleagues earlier this year .
They found that individual areas must be the right size relative to each other or mice will underperform in tests of their skills at the relevant behaviors .
Researchers in Professor Michèle Studer 's group at the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine ( TIGEM ) in Naples , Italy , who also prominently contributed to the work include co-lead author Maria Armentano , Ph.D. , postdoctoral researcher Guilio Srubek Tomassy , Ph.D. , as did postdoctoral researcher Axel Leingärtner in the O'Leary lab .
Ive never tried these , so do n't blame me if you screw up and ruin your license .
If you want to use the fake barcode you just make on your license , there are many possible ways to transfer it .
The easiest is probably to erase the old barcode with some acetone and paper towels , and when your sure its completely erased , carefully print directly onto the license .
The only problem with this method is that you would need a high density printer ( thermal transfer or laser ) , and would have to be extremely careful that it printed in the right spot nice and cleanly .
Another method could be to clean off the old barcode with acetone , and then print out the new one on a transparency and affix it to your license .
The problem with this method are that it would be easy to tell its fake , unless done really carefully .
Remember if you are changing a piece of information that is on the front you have to change it on the license too .
It does n't matter if the id scans 21 , if it says 18 on the front they are not going to accept it .
( Note : Most licenses also have a 1d barcode on the back too .
It contains much less information then the 2d barcode .
To edit it you will need to find out what specific type of barcode it is , there are many sites online with pictures of different barcodes that can help you .
Then download a decoder for that type , and decipher the information they give you , see if it matches up with your license number , dob , etc .
Then change it and re encode it using a program for that type of barcode . )

Leak : Complex Environments : Battle of Fallujah I , April 2004
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld launched the failed April 2004 assault on the Iraqi town of Fallujah before marines were ready because it had become " a symbol of resistance that dominated international headlines " and similar considerations eventually destroyed the operation — both according to a highly classified U.S. intelligence report into the defeat .
" During the first week of April , insurgents invited a reporter from Al Jazeera , Ahmed Mansour , and his film crew into Fallujah where they filmed scenes of dead babies from the hospital , presumably killed by Coalition air strikes .
Comparisons were made to the Palestinian Intifada .
Children were shown bespattered with blood ; mothers were shown screaming and mourning day after day . "
Coalition air strikes were conducted during the three week cease - fire , which was a " bit of a misnomer " and the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal contributed to the politically driven final peace settlement .
The settlement left Coalition Provisional Authority chief Paul Bremer " furious " .
By the end of April , 600 - 700 Iraqis and 18 marines had been killed inside the town with 62 marines killed in the broader operational area and 565 wounded in action .
Fallujah 's defenders were diverse but united to oppose the U.S. offensive .
They included former regime soldiers , " nationalists , local Islamic extremists , foreign fighters and criminals " together comprising not so much a military organization , but " an evil Rotary club " .
The revelations come from a highly classified report on the attack released today by the open government group Wikileaks , which has in the past month released a number of sensitive U.S. documents including manuals for Guantanamo Bay , Camp Bucca prison and Department of Defense detainee operations .
The report was penned last year by the U.S Army National Ground Intelligence Center and is classified " SECRET / NOFORN " -- meaning the report was not to be shared with Coalition partners .
The Fallujah assault was initiated when on March 31 2004 four private military personnel from the U.S firm Blackwater were killed in the town and photos of their burnt bodies received international coverage .
The report said the coverage had prompted Rumsfeld , General Abizaid and the then Coalition Provisional Authority Chief Paul Bremer to order an " immediate military response " .
The report not only blames media driven political pressures for launching the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force before it was ready , but states similar political considerations led to a cease - fire five days later .
The three week official cease - fire was " a bit of a misnomer " , with Coalition air strikes continuing and snipers on both sides making movement hazardous .
On the town 's resistance , the report claims the number one " enemy strategy " was " to gain media attention and sympathy " in - order to push political pressure " to a boiling point . "
Contributing to the peace settlement at the end of the month was British opposition to the battle , an Iraqi Shia uprising over the forced closure of the newspaper " al - Hawza " and Abu Ghraib .
Paul Bremer was " furious when he found out about it , but he was in little position to overturn it since he had insisted on the cease - fire in the first place .
Complicating matters was the fact that the Abu Ghraib scandal broke on 29 April , consuming the attention of senior leaders in the U.S. government .
Bremer could not organize a consensus to overturn the Fallujah decision . "
During the battle U.S. psychological operations loud speakers " blasted rock music or taunted the insurgents into attacking with insults about their marksmanship . "
Marines used the M1A1 Abrams tank as bait , to lure defenders out into the open , however this ruse did n't work for long as " The enemy .. would initiate an ambush with small - arms fire on one side of a tank in order to get the tank crew to turn its armor in the direction of fire .
They would then fire a coordinated 5 or 6 RPG [ rocket propelled grenade ] salvo into the exposed rear of the tank " .
The report states " Approximately 150 air strikes destroyed 75 buildings , including two mosques " and that the operation " stirred up a hornets nest across the Al Anbar provence " .
Concluding , the report states " Information operations are increasingly important in a 21st Century world where cable television runs 24 hours a day .. the Iraqi government was nascent and weak and they offered no political cover for U.S. commanders to finish the operation in a reasonable time period ...
Abu Ghurayb .. and the Shia uprising further enflamed a politically precarious situation and could not have happened at a worse time for Coalition forces . "
U.S. forces retook Fallujah during November 2004 in what was to be the most bloody battle of the occupation .

If Israel can ignore the IAEA , why should anyone else listen ?
Media reports on Monday suggested that this weeks annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) will include a serious discussion of Israels presumed nuclear capabilities .
One can only hope that this takes place , that the long - running grievances of Arab and other countries are finally given their just due .
With accusations relating to weapons of mass destruction having been a large part of the US pretext for invading Iraq and Iran now facing heavy pressure over similar claims , the double standard involving the Jewish state ­ which has steadfastly refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) ­ has become too obvious to ignore any longer .
None of this has deterred the Israelis , though , from speaking out against the alleged ambitions of others .
In fact , Israel has been at the forefront of countries demanding that the IAEA get tough with Iran .
The Israelis are not at all embarrassed that Tehran is a signatory to the NPT and they are not ; nor does it bother them that no one thinks the Islamic Republic has nuclear weapons , while the Jewish state is estimated by experts to possess something in the order of 200-300 warheads , not to mention a variety of air - , land - and sea - based delivery systems .
The unbridled hypocrisy of Israeli policy and rhetoric on this issue constitutes a major test for the IAEA , and indeed for two cornerstones of modern diplomacy : arms control and collective security .
If the presumed violations of some countries are to be punished  pre-emptively while those of others go unchecked , there is little point in cooperating with the co-opted organization that enforces its own regulations according to Washingtons whim .
Israeli impunity relies on America for its sustenance , and the nuclear question is a case in point : US law is very clear in banning foreign aid to countries that either do not sign or fail to obey the NPT , but somehow more than $ 3 billion in illegal funds gets from Washington to Israel every year with nary a word of protest on Capitol Hill .
If America is unwilling to comply with its own laws when these do not suit Israels purposes , why should anyone trust it to undertake an accurate accounting of international security arrangements ?
And if the IAEA is unwilling to assert its independence in the face of pressure from Washington , why should any of its members bother to help maintain the pretense that signed agreements mean anything at all ?
Enlarge By Susan Walsh , AP Presidential candidate Ron Paul addresses Fed chief Ben Bernanke at a recent House hearing .
The Texas Republican wants to abolish the Fed. Ben Bernanke AP file HOW THE FED WORKS HOW THE FED WORKS The Federal Open Market Committee : Who votes on setting interest rates ?
CLOSE-UP : RON PAUL CLOSE-UP : RON PAUL In - depth : Paul news , photos , videos , timeline , more ...
Ron Paul on the 2008 campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights WASHINGTON  Texas Congressman Ron Paul is getting help from an improbable source in his long - shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination : Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Video clips of Paul — who supports the gold standard and has sponsored a bill to abolish the Fed — ripping into Bernanke at congressional hearings are getting hundreds of thousands of hits on the video - sharing website YouTube .
ROUND 1 ( VIDEO ) : Ron Paul lets loose on Bernanke ( YouTube ) ROUND 2 ( VIDEO ) : Ron Paul lets loose on Bernanke ( YouTube ) The Paul tongue lashings ( they can't really be termed question - and - answer sessions , as Bernanke barely gets a word in edgewise ) have also been posted to other websites by Paul backers .
In the footage Paul , a physician by training , warns Bernanke , a Ph.D. economist and former chairman of Princeton 's economics department , that he is shoveling too much money into the economy .
Paul 's charges may be serving to pump up the amount of cash flowing into his own campaign coffers .
Comments posted with the videos include requests that viewers donate to Paul .
The Texas lawmaker has raised more than $ 10.6 million in the fourth quarter , double the third quarter 's total of $ 5.28 million .
The maverick lawmaker just months ago was little known beyond supporters in such political groups as the Libertarian Party or the Constitution Party .
But Paul has developed a grass - roots following , with rising poll numbers .
" This monetary issue finally is starting to rise to the forefront , " says Jesse Benton , Paul campaign national press secretary .
" It is the most defining issue of the campaign . "
The Paul - Bernanke clips have headlines such as " Free Market Smackdown " " Ron Paul Speaks to Legalized Plunder by Moneyed Monster : FED " or " Ron Paul Ownz the Federal Reserve . "
There 's a music video juxtaposing photos of former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and Bernanke with quotes from Paul on the dangers of current policy .
Another clip attracting tens of thousands of viewers is a CNBC segment analyzing Bernanke 's November testimony to Congress , including a reporter noting financial traders cheered Paul 's remarks .
The videos do n't have the pull of other YouTube political favorites , such as Obama Girl : a musical love note to Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama of Illinois , sung by an alluring young woman , which has been viewed more than 4 million times .
Still , the Paul - Bernanke viewership is more than respectable , given the main characters are two guys in suits and the subject matter includes the MZM measure of the money supply , government wholesale and retail inflation gauges and the value of the dollar .
The Paul segments are among the most - viewed YouTube clips of Bernanke , whose careful , understated appearances purposely lack the bombast needed to become web classics .

“ Writing is easy :
All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead . ” – Gene Fowler
Perhaps this is a sentiment that all writers can share to some extent .
However , writing does n’t have to be a tortuous experience akin to banging your head against a wall .
Frustration rarely helps our writing ; good writing is perfectly compatible with efficient and reasonably quick writing .
If you would like to become a fast and efficient writer , the following are 10 suggestions that have the potential to dramatically increase your productivity .
Clear Mind
Writing is a creative exercise which benefits from having a clear mind .
If your mind is cluttered with distracting thoughts you will struggle to write effectively and fluently .
When writing you need to concentrate on nothing else other than the subject of your writing .
This requires a combination of one - pointedness and concentration ; only if we can absorb ourselves into writing will we be most productive .
How can we write anything meaningful if 50{ 54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of our thoughts are worrying about miscellaneous events in our lives ?
To cultivate a clear mind , it is helpful to set aside certain times just for writing – then , during this time , be disciplined about keeping your mind free of distracting thoughts .
Start Somewhere
Often when we write the first sentence can prove to be the most challenging .
It is also by far the most important because it will determine whether people keep reading or not .
For this reason it is common for a writer to become overly concerned about getting the ‘ perfect ’ start to an article .
The problem is that aiming for perfection becomes a block to writing anything .
If you are struggling to begin , start anywhere – even in the middle .
Once you have written several paragraphs it may become more obvious how you can best start the article .
Accumulate Ideas
As you go about your day , try to accumulate ideas for articles in your mind .
You can use this time to consider various titles for your articles and to recall relevant anecdotes .
Keep a notebook for ideas .
I find that an article becomes quite easy to write if I have :
A good title
7 key points / paragraphs .
I know the subject relatively well .
Write from Experience / Knowledge
Having written on many different topics , I know how difficult it can be to write on a topic you know little about .
Also , if you are writing on new topics , it can be hard to be original and offer something unique .
Stick to what you know and are able to write knowledgeably about .
If you need to research articles , wait until you have developed a good background in the subject before starting to write .
Practise the Art of Writing
There is no secret formula for writing effectively .
Like any activity , practise will enable you to get better .
It is important to be able to get into a flow of writing ; for example , many suggest it is advisable to write quickly but then be willing to throw out the bad .
Ernest Hemingway was a great believer in writing and then being willing to toss out 90{ 54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} of what he wrote .
This might not sound very productive , but it can help because you are free to write without worrying about perfection .
Write in Unlikely Situations
Travelling on a train or even at a airport can give us several spare hours .
These can often be very productive times for writing – because we have little else better to do .
Do n’t imagine that writing has to involve retreating to a Himalayan cave .
If you wait for the perfect environment you will wait in vain .
Positive Attitude
Related to a clear mind is the importance of maintaining a positive attitude .
Here , a positive attitude really involves avoiding negativity .
Sometimes as writers we can easily become discouraged and feel our writing is not good enough .
When we have a fear of failure or feeling of unworthiness , it is hard to do anything worthwhile .
Our worries act like a subconscious break on the flow of our writing .
We do n’t need to have an excessively positive attitude , it is sufficient just to abandon negative sentiments .
A Working Environment
It is important to find an environment suitable for writing .
Avoid noisy and cluttered places .
The less distractions you have the better chance you will have of being able to concentrate .
If you write from home , try to create a space where you will not be continually interrupted .
A simple “ Do Not Disturb ” sign can do wonders for your productivity .
Music / Silence
To gain fresh inspiration , it is good to write in different surroundings .
Finding a good cafe can make a welcome change ; the only drawback of writing in public places is the background noise which can be distracting .
Using an MP3 player can drown out the background sound ; however , you have to be careful you do n’t let the music distract you .
I went through a period of going to cafes with my laptop and listening to my favourite playlists ; I was really enjoying the music , but I hardly managed to write anything .
If you do listen to music , make sure you choose something fairly ‘ neutral ’ .
If music does n’t work you can always try noise cancelling headphones .
Be Committed
To write well you need to be fully committed to your writing .
It does n’t work to write tentatively , worrying about whether it will be good enough .
Be bold and committed .
When you write , concentrate on writing and do n’t do anything else .
By giving writing your 100{54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} attention you are guaranteed to boost your productivity .
For example , if you are a blogger , try writing away from the internet and the temptations of mindless surfing .

Unless you ’ve amassed great amounts of wealth and several high - value assets , you probably need some life insurance coverage to help protect your loved ones .
But how much life insurance do you really need ?
Determining your coverage amount is one of the first steps to getting properly insured .
While some people may opt to just take a shot in the dark and choose an amount that sounds good , this is n’t always the smartest choice .
It ’s important that you determine your insurable need which will help you know how much coverage is just enough .
Being over or under - insured is more common than you ’d realize .
If you ’re wondering how much life insurance you need , here are a few questions to ask yourself .
Do I Have Dependents ?
If you ’re single with no kids , you may not need as much life insurance coverage as someone who ’s married with two kids .
Having dependents makes a huge difference .
It means that someone else is depending on your ( often times financially ) for their care .
If you were no longer around , that support would not be available to that person or those people .
This is where a sizable life insurance benefit can come in handy .
Even if you have a spouse and no kids , realize that your partner may be depending on you as well .
If you are both working together to pay bills and fund your lifestyle , this is something to consider when determining how much life insurance coverage you need .

How Much Debt Do You Have ?
I do n’t know anyone who likes having debt .
That said , I know many people do n’t want to leave their debt as a burden on their family .
Life insurance can help prevent this from happening .
If you have a ton of student loan debt or other loans , make sure your life insurance coverage amount is enough to cover these debts .
For example , if you have are single with no kids but own a home with a $ 200,000 mortgage and have $ 50,000 in student loan debt , this should be considered when determining your life insurance coverage amount .

What Is Your Income ?
The larger your income is , the more life insurance you may need .
Odds are , your family is accustomed to a certain lifestyle that your income provides .
One basic rule of thumb is that your life insurance coverage should be equal to 7 to 10 times your annual salary .
This is a good starting point , but be sure to include these other factors as well when determining the right amount for you .
If you 're wondering how much life insurance you need , here are a few questions to ask yourself .

What Are Your Monthly Expenses ?
Everyone should have a budget .
If you ’re trying to get life insurance , you ’ll want to review your budget and see what expenses you have that life insurance can help your family maintain .
Consider non-negotiable costs like your rent or mortgage payment and other bills .
Do your kids have extra-curricular activities ?
How much are your other insurance premiums like for medical and dental care ?
Also , look at future goals and what those expenses could look like .
Do you plan to help your kids with college expenses ?
What will your childcare costs add up to over the years ?
How much will home repairs and maintenance cost over time ?

Are You a Stay at Home Parent ?
One of the biggest myths out there is that stay - at - home parents do n’t need life insurance .
Since you ’re not earning an income , there ’s not much to insure right ?
This is not entirely true .
Being a stay - at - home parent is a high - value job even if it does n’t result in direct compensation .
When you think about it , some families have one parent stay home to support the other parent who is working and growing their career .
It both parents just work all the time , the household and family unit would fall apart .
I find it interesting to see that the median annual estimated value for the work of a stay - at - home spouse or mother in 2019 was $ 178,201 .
If you ’re a stay - at - home parent who ’s uninsured or under insured , you could be leaving your family financially vulnerable .
Think of your partner having to pay for childcare , housekeeping , meals , laundry services and other expenses .
It all adds up but having life insurance coverage could help .

So How Much Life Insurance Do You Really Need ?
After answering some of those questions , you should have a much better idea of how much life insurance you need .
Start by adding up all your expenses , liabilities and future anticipated costs .
Try to come up with an annual sum .
Compare this to your annual income to see if you may need to get more or less coverage .
The next step is to simply decide how long you want coverage for .
Term life insurance is a great option because it ’s affordable and easy to obtain .
Companies like Bestow allow you to get coverage up to $ 1 million and pay affordable rates .
You can get a quote for free on their site so you ’ll have more information about locking in a coverage amount you feel comfortable with .
As someone who ’s in their late 20s , Bestow gave me a quote of just $ 22 per month for $ 500,000 of coverage over the next 10 years .
At the end of the day , realize that some life insurance coverage is better than nothing .
Term life insurance is flexible where you can always choose a shorter - term then add more coverage once your term is up .

Paul Torrens , at the Arizona State University School of Geographical Sciences , has a computer simulation that models urban panic :
“ The goal of this project is to develop a reusable and behaviorally founded computer model of pedestrian movement and crowd behavior amid dense urban environments , to serve as a test - bed for experimentation , ” says Torrens .
“ The idea is to use the model to test hypotheses , real - world plans and strategies that are not very easy , or are impossible to test in practice . ”
Such as the following : 1 ) simulate how a crowd flees from a burning car toward a single evacuation point ; 2 ) test out how a pathogen might be transmitted through a mobile pedestrian over a short period of time ; 3 ) see how the existing urban grid facilitate or does not facilitate mass evacuation prior to a hurricane landfall or in the event of dirty bomb detonation ; 4 ) design a mall which can compel customers to shop to the point of bankruptcy , to walk obliviously for miles and miles and miles , endlessly to the point of physical exhaustion and even death ; 5 ) identify , if possible , the tell - tale signs of a peaceful crowd about to metamorphosize into a hellish mob ; 6 ) determine how various urban typologies , such as plazas , parks , major arterial streets and banlieues , can be reconfigured in situ into a neutralizing force when crowds do become riotous ; and 7 ) conversely , figure out how one could , through spatial manipulation , inflame a crowd , even a very small one , to set in motion a series of events that culminates into a full scale Revolution or just your average everyday Southeast Asian coup d’état — regime change through landscape architecture .
When I spoke to analysts and investors , they had all kinds of reasons for Amazon ’s performance last year .
“ They finally reached a point where their R&D spending was not expanding as fast as their revenues , ” said Citigroup ’s Mark S. Mahaney .
He and others also talked about Amazon ’s success in international markets , its fast - growing ( and high margin ) merchant market , which allows merchants to sell goods alongside Amazon , and its rapidly expanding Web services business .
Mostly , though , the investing community pointed to those healthier margins as the main reason for the stock ’s run-up .
Legg Mason ’s legendary fund manager , Bill Miller , who has made a small fortune for his investors by betting big on Amazon , told me that “ Wall Street is almost fanatically focused on margin expansion and contraction . ”
But I could n’t help wondering if maybe there was n’t something else at play here , something Wall Street never seems to take very seriously .
Maybe , just maybe , taking care of customers is something worth doing when you are trying to create a lasting company .
Maybe , in fact , it ’s the best way to build a real business  even if it comes at the expense of short - term results .
It is almost impossible to read or see an interview with Mr. Bezos in which he does n’t , at some point , begin to wax on about what he likes to call “ the customer experience . ”
Just a few months ago , for instance , he appeared on Charlie Rose ’s talk show to tout Amazon ’s new e-book device , the Kindle .
Toward the end of the program , Mr. Rose asked the chief executive an open - ended question about how he spent his time , and Mr. Bezos responded with a soliloquy about his “ obsession ” with customers .
“ They care about having the lowest prices , having vast selection , so they have choice , and getting the products to customers fast , ” he said .
“ And the reason I ’m so obsessed with these drivers of the customer experience is that I believe that the success we have had over the past 12 years has been driven exclusively by that customer experience .
We are not great advertisers .
So we start with customers , figure out what they want , and figure out how to get it to them . ”
Anybody who has spent any time around Mr. Bezos knows that this is not just some line he throws out for public consumption .
It has been the guiding principle behind Amazon since it began .
“ Jeff has been focused on the customer since Day 1 , ” said Suresh Kotha , a management professor at the University of Washington business school who has written several case studies about Amazon .
Mr. Miller noted that Amazon has really had only one stated goal since it began : to be the most customer - centric company in the world .
In this , it has largely succeeded .
Millions of people instinctively go to Amazon when they want to buy something online because they have come to trust the company in a way they trust few other online entities .
Amazon ’s technology , its interface , its one - click buying service  they are all incredibly easy to use .
Its algorithms offer “ suggestions ” for further buying that actually appeal to its customers .
Its Amazon Prime program  for a $ 79 annual fee you get two - day free shipping  is enormously popular .
Unlike what happens at certain other technology companies , when you have a problem , the customer service telephone number is n’t hard to find .
It is even willing to correct mistakes that it did n’t make , as I discovered over Christmas .
All of this , however , comes at a price .
Indeed , as I ’ve written before , customer service is n’t cheap .
Certainly , a fair amount of the hundreds of millions of dollars Amazon has spent on R&D has gone toward developing , say , the Kindle , but a good deal of it has also gone toward improving the customer experience .
Amazon is willing to lose money on some of its most popular items , like the latest Harry Potter novel .
And even with Amazon Prime , it must surely swallow millions of dollars in shipping costs .
Indeed , in a presentation to analysts in late November , the company ’s chief financial officer , Thomas J. Szkutak , showed one slide that read , “ Over $ 600 Million in Forgone Shipping Revenue . ”
And that was just for one year .
SAN FRANCISCO --
A fan attending the Minnesota Vikings - San Francisco 49ers game at Monster Park died when he fell at least 20 feet from an upper concourse to the mezzanine level , team and local police said .
Torrey Kretschman , 31 , of Roseville , Calif . went to a concession area near halftime .
He fell over a wall that is 4 feet high and 6 inches wide with a 4 - inch sloping ledge .
Kretschman likely misjudged the size of the wall and toppled over the edge , police
said .
" This person tried to jump up on one of the walls to sit , and he misjudged and he fell , " said San Francisco police spokesman Sgt. Neville Gittens said , according to the Chronicle .
According to 49ers vice president Lisa Lang , paramedics worked on the man for about 30 minutes .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
" The police did their investigation , they interviewed witnesses and security , and they are treating it as an accident , " Lang said .
Congressman and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul warns of ' soft fascism ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Sunday December 23 , 2007

Print This Email This " It reminds me of what Sinclair Lewis once said , he says : ' When fascism comes to this country , it will be wrapped in the flag , carrying a cross . ' "
Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) argues to Meet the Press ' Tim Russert that in the statement above , he is not calling presidential contender and Republican competitor Mike Huckabee a fascist , but what could be the image of a cross planted in a recently released Huckabee campaign ad brought the quote to his mind .
Paul does , however , believe that the United States has adopted fascist leanings .
Changes in the country 's tone , says the Congressman , such as the PATRIOT Act , questioning dissenters ' patriotism during the war , and civil liberties abuses indicate corporatism , or " soft fascism , " namely a stronghold by the military - industrial complex on society .
" So , " Russert follows up , " you think we 're close to fascism ? "
Mentioning a documentary entitled " Freedom to Fascism , " Paul responds , " We 're not moving toward Hitler - type fascism , but we 're moving toward a softer fascism :
Loss of civil liberties , corporations running the show , big government in bed with big business .
So you have the military - industrial complex , you have the medical - industrial complex , you have the financial industry , you have the communications industry .
They go to Washington and spend hundreds of millions of dollars . "
" That 's where the control is , " says the Congressman .
" I call that a soft form of fascism -- something that 's very dangerous . "
This portion of NBC's Meet the Press , broadcast on December 23 , 2007 , is available for viewing below .
The 16 - year old Atlason had somehow found the confidential personal number of the President of the United States George W. Bush in the White House and called him .
His call was not answered and Atlason decided to joke with the U.S. president and left a playful record on the personal answering machine of the White House 's head , having presented himself as the President of Iceland and having said that he simply wished to talk to the head of the other state .
Thus , in the record which Аtlason left on the answering machine , he invited Bush to make a private visit to Iceland .
The broadcasting company informs , that Atlason waited for a reciprocal call from Bush on the last Monday when police appeared at the doors of his house and demanded explanations how he had obtained the confidential personal telephone number of the president of the USA .
The schoolboy said , that he got Bush 's number several years ago , and he no longer remembered how this had happened .
No counteraction has yet followed on the part of the White House .
A coalition of 17 organizations , including the National Academy of Sciences , the American Institute of Physics , and the National Science Teachers Association , is calling on the scientific community to become more involved in the promotion of science education , including evolution .
According to an article appearing in the January 2008 issue of The FASEB Journal , the introduction of “ non-science , ” such as creationism and intelligent design , into science education will undermine the fundamentals of science education .
Some of these fundamentals include using the scientific method , understanding how to reach scientific consensus , and distinguishing between scientific and nonscientific explanations of natural phenomena .
“ In an age when people have benefited so greatly from science and reason , it is ironic that some still reject the tools that have afforded them the privilege to reject them , ” says Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
The article is based on a national survey of 1,000 likely U.S. voters .
Survey respondents were queried on their attitudes toward science and scientists , their views on evolutionary science in the context of education , and their opinions regarding the means through which the scientific community can effectively bolster support for teaching evolution and related subjects .
The survey revealed that respondents favored teaching evolution over creationism or intelligent design .
The survey also revealed that respondents were more interested in hearing about evolution from scientists , science teachers , and clergy than Supreme Court Justices , celebrities , or school board members .
The survey also found that there is a relationship between people ’s understanding of science and their support for teaching evolution .
Respondents were asked three questions : one related to plate tectonics , one related to the proper use of antibiotics , and one related to prehistory .
Those who accurately answered questions on these subjects were far more likely to support the teaching of evolution in schools .
“ The bottom line is that the world is round , humans evolved from an extinct species , and Elvis is dead , ” Weissmann added .
“ This survey is a wake - up call for anyone who supports teaching information based on evidence rather than speculation or hope ; people want to hear the truth , and they want to hear it from scientists . ”

All this is textbook international economics : contrary to what people sometimes assert , economic theory says that free trade normally makes a country richer , but it does n’t say that it ’s normally good for everyone .
Still , when the effects of third - world exports on U.S. wages first became an issue in the 1990s , a number of economists  myself included  looked at the data and concluded that any negative effects on U.S. wages were modest .
The trouble now is that these effects may no longer be as modest as they were , because imports of manufactured goods from the third world have grown dramatically  from just 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1990 to 6 percent in 2006 .
And the biggest growth in imports has come from countries with very low wages .
The original “ newly industrializing economies ” exporting manufactured goods  South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore  paid wages that were about 25 percent of U.S. levels in 1990 .
Since then , however , the sources of our imports have shifted to Mexico , where wages are only 11 percent of the U.S. level , and China , where they ’re only about 3 percent or 4 percent .
There are some qualifying aspects to this story .
For example , many of those made - in - China goods contain components made in Japan and other high - wage economies .
Still , there ’s little doubt that the pressure of globalization on American wages has increased .
So am I arguing for protectionism ?
No .
Those who think that globalization is always and everywhere a bad thing are wrong .
On the contrary , keeping world markets relatively open is crucial to the hopes of billions of people .
But I am arguing for an end to the finger - wagging , the accusation either of not understanding economics or of kowtowing to special interests that tends to be the editorial response to politicians who express skepticism about the benefits of free - trade agreements .
It ’s often claimed that limits on trade benefit only a small number of Americans , while hurting the vast majority .
That ’s still true of things like the import quota on sugar .
But when it comes to manufactured goods , it ’s at least arguable that the reverse is true .
The highly educated workers who clearly benefit from growing trade with third - world economies are a minority , greatly outnumbered by those who probably lose .
As I said , I ’m not a protectionist .
For the sake of the world as a whole , I hope that we respond to the trouble with trade not by shutting trade down , but by doing things like strengthening the social safety net .
But those who are worried about trade have a point , and deserve some respect .
This is the personal blog of Daniel Broadway .
Occasionally , I will post personal blogs , but for the most part , this will be dedicated to my explorations in computer graphics and visual effects .
We see a lot of rumors around here on a fairly regular basis .
There are those that we wish would come true , but rarely do .
Some you can just laugh off as obviously being fake .
Others , you merely hope to be untrue .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever wished for a rumor to be fake as much as I hope this one is , because if this one is true , there is almost no hope for thefranchise ever again .
In fact , this one could screw up the franchise so badly , you may never want to go back and watch the originals again .
Because this is tied to such a prominent movie , I ’m putting out a mild spoiler warning – do n’t read any further unless you want to potentially be spoiled on .
Again , hopefully this has no promise whatsoever .
One would hope Spielberg would have more sense , but George Lucas is involved as well , and we know what that could mean .
Movieweb is running a bizarre story about a cameo for the fourthflick .
According to the rumor , Spielberg has dusted off the alien costumes fromfor use in .
Yes , that ’s right .
Indy is about to have an alien encounter .
The timing for such a thing makes sense – after all , it is the 30th anniversary for , and theflicks have been known for referencing other Spielberg and Lucas pictures , from “ Club Obi- Wan ” to R2 - D2 and C - 3PO among the hieroglyphics in Indy ’s adventures .
The bad news is that the story indicates that this would n’t just be a reference tobut a full - fledged part of the plot .
If this is true , the Crystal Skulls are tied to aliens and Indy ’s going to have a run in with those aliens .
I hate that idea .
Hate with a capitol “ H ” . Indiana Jones may be many things , but an alien hunter is n’t one of those .
Although I have very little doubt that Lucas probably built that into the famed timeline of Indiana Jones .
This is the man who thought Jar - Jar was a good idea , after all .
No , I do n’t like this idea at all .
Background references to Spielberg and Lucas ’s sci- fi pictures is one thing , but this simply is n’t acceptable .
This is n’t just jumping the shark , but jumping entire franchises with something that helped define high - action for the modern viewer .
Do n’t get me wrong – I wo n’t write the movie off until I see it .
After all , this is rumor and could be completely mistaken .
Maybe Spielberg is using the alien costumes as something else within the world of Indiana Jones – that would be okay .
After all , Frank Darabont is still claiming a large part of the script could be the one he wrote .
I ca n’t imagine Darabont would make such a massively huge mistake such as this , so that makes me pause and reconsider .
Untilactually comes out , I ’ll reserve judgment .
For now , I ’ll just pretend I never heard this rumor in order to stay hopeful .
Browse column FRESNO , CA -- Today I 'm going to talk about war games .
Which reminds me : my computer 's messed up so I 'm writing this column from what has got to be the darkest , smelliest internet cafe in Fresno , not like there are a lot to choose from .
I seem to be the only roundeye in the place , and I 'm definitely the only one here who did n't come to play combat games .
All around me are these huge explosions and the screams of the wounded , all fuzzy from the cheap speakers beside every machine .
I do n't even know what games these guys are playing -- I do n't do fantasy games -- but they sure are serious about it .
What 's really weirding me out though is the way this Asian guy to my left always ends his game .
Every time , there 's a huge explosion and then a serious voice saying , " The terrorists win . "
Every time !
Does Homeland Security know about this treasonous game , poisoning the minds of America 's yout ' with defeatism ?
And how come the terrorists keep winning ?
Which brings me ( nice segue , huh ?
) to the big - boys ' war games I wanted to talk about , the ones the US Navy just conducted near the Iranian coast in the Persian Gulf .
And I 'd like to thank all the readers like Aaron Champion who wrote in to link me to the story and remind me that I 've been proven right again .
Damn , I 'm tired of always being right , because it 's always about the bad news .
In this case , Aaron wrote to give me the heads - up that six long years after I predicted Iranian irregular naval forces in small civilian craft would make an American fleet in the Persian Gulf look foolish , the glorious NY Times itself lowered itself to repeat today what I 'd said way back in 2002 .
Here 's Aaron 's message : Dear Mr. Nerd , I 'm a longtime reader of your column and it would n't surprise me if you 've already seen this :
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/ washington/12navy.html?ref=todayspaper
But if you had n't , allow me to stroke your ego ( and ego alone ) by making pointing out that you 're the only motherfucker in the world that seems to have picked up on this .
It only took the press five years .
Adding insult to ineptitude , it was the New York Times .
Hope this brightens an otherwise bleary in Fuckno for ya .
Aaron Well , Aaron , it did , kind of .
Nothing makes me happier than when the people who get the respect and money I do n't get , wind up looking stupid .
I just wish the NY Times would pay me some kind of settlement instead of ripping me off six years late .
If you 're going to steal , fellas , at least do it right .
I do n't break into your Manhattan HQ to pilfer your back issues for toilet paper , so do n't steal my 2002 columns just because your military correspondents are brain - dead from decades of believing DoD briefings .
( Editor 's Note :
This is n't the first time that the NY Times has lifted from the War Nerd .
Last May , the popular Fishbowl / NY blog suggested that Times columnist / editor Nicholas Kristoff plagiarized from Brecher 's idea that Cheney must be an Iranian mole because he 's doing their business so well . )

I 've been making public releases of Unworkable , a simple and efficient from - scratch BitTorrent implementation written in C for a couple of months now .
Prior to that , I had been working on it for about 18 months on and off .
While I would n't claim it to be highly successful at this early point , I make an effort to try to manage the project well , and I intend to write about some of my ideas and the things I have learned along the way .
Here are some of my thoughts so far : Release early , release often .
This advice was , to my knowledge , first phrased in this way by Eric S. Raymond , but its a pretty straight - forward observation .
I attempt to put out two releases per month - roughly one every fourteen days .
A reliable release cycle sends a great message to users .
It shows them that you care about your project , that it is actively and reliably developed and it pushes you toward an evolutionary , as opposed to revolutionary , approach to development .
Focus on incremental improvements .
This is closely related to the above point , and is something I greatly admire the OpenBSD project for adhering to so strictly .
Reliability and stability are far more important in the long term than having the latest whiz - bang feature .
There is no shortage of low quality software in the world - concentrate first on doing a small set of things very well , gradually adding new features as existing ones stabilise .
Strive to make your project as portable as possible .
This is sadly often overlooked .
A depressingly large amount of open source software today is written with the assumption that it will only ever run on Linux on the i386 platform .
First of all , your goal should be to attract as many users and contributers to your project as possible .
The more platforms you can support , the larger your potential pool of feedback and support .
Secondly , supporting multiple platforms forces you to write code capable of dealing with both little and big endian architectures , different pointer sizes ( 32 bit vs 64 bit ) , and differing alignment requirements ( for example sparc64 is rather strict about this ) .
All of these differences can expose nasty bugs in your software , and its great to squash them early on !
Thirdly , it pushes you in the direction of increased modularity and almost certainly necessitates a well - maintained build system - both of which are important in the long term .
Embrace criticism .
One of the most terrifying things about releasing your code as open source is that other people are able to look at it , pick it apart , criticize it .
Many people are very afraid of this sort of negative criticism - they feel that it is a personal attack .
Instead of dreading criticism , learn to embrace it .
Realise that negative feedback is completely disconnected from you - it says nothing about you as a person .
See it as extremely valuable input , use it to drive yourself to make improvements .
Commercial software developers pay top dollar for QA departments , third party audits and analyses , user surveys and so on - you are getting this stuff for free !
Furthermore , the ability to constructively accept criticism of your work is a great asset that will make you highly attractive to potential employers .
Encourage feedback and contributions .
I like nothing more than a detailed bug report , or a bunch of suggestions about features to implement - or even if someone submits my software to a compendium on my behalf , thats great !
Some people are sadly completely incapable of dealing with users of their software .
They are unable to see that just because someone emails you asking for support on an old version in a rude way , you are free to ignore them .
If someone submits a diff that you do n't like , you do n't have to accept it .
If someone emails you a list of features you " must implement " , you are not compelled to do what they ask .
Sometimes user contributions are imperfect - I 've received diffs that I have n't committed , and I 've received feature requests which I have no intention of implementing .
However , I 've gotten some great ideas , some nice diffs , and just generally gotten a feel for what people are interested in - and I did n't even have to pay to conduct a market survey !
Thats it for now .
Next time I will write a bit more about my thoughts on documentation , promotion and distribution for a highly successful open source project .
Niall O'Higgins is an author and software developer .
He wrote the O'Reilly book MongoDB and Python .
He also develops Strider Open Source Continuous Deployment and offers full - stack consulting services at FrozenRidge.co .
Katie Geminder , Facebook ’s director for user experience and design , said internal adjustments to the tool used to delete accounts had created a technical snag that affected “ a small percent ” of Facebook users .
“ None of their information was exposed , but the empty account continued to exist even though all of its data had been removed , ” she said by e-mail .
The bug was fixed within 24 hours , she said .
One such partially deleted user was Matt Dauphin , a 22 - year - old office manager for an interior design firm in Tempe , Ariz. , who tried to delete his account after reading about the new form last week .
He received confirmation by e-mail of the deletion from Facebook ’s technical support team .
But even after he received that confirmation , a working link to his empty Facebook profile was the first result in a Google search for his name .
While his name , photo and profile information had been deleted from the Facebook page , his friends who still used the service could see his lists of friends and the external applications he had added to his profile .
“ It ’s a little disturbing that you can see people that I used to talk to  that ’s not right , ” Mr. Dauphin said Friday .
He said he was annoyed at Facebook ’s refusal to create a one - step “ delete account ” button instead of the form .
By Saturday , Facebook had removed the remaining traces of his account from the site .

Although he did n't personally witness it , a former CIA field officer says that 35 seconds of waterboarding was all it took for interrogators to " break " a suspected terrorist held at a secret agency prison .
In an interview with ABC's Brian Ross , retired CIA officer John Kiriakou described how severe methods he now believes to be torture were used to extract information from Abu Zabaydah , an alleged al - Qaeda operative said to have helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks .
But Kiriakou , who was a team leader for the joint CIA / FBI squad who apprehended Zabaydah in Pakistan in 2002 , says he believes the techniques were necessary .
" At the time , I was so angry and I wanted so much to help disrupt future attacks on the United States , that I felt it was the only thing we could do , " Kiriakou said .
When Zabaydah refused to give up " actionable intelligence " about terrorist activities following his capture , the former agent says his team received a greenlight from CIA officials in Washington to initiate waterboarding .
Kiriakou , who says he did not himself participate in or witness the extreme technique being applied , said fellow agents informed him that Zabaydah " was able to withstand the waterboarding for quite some time -- and by that I mean probably 30 , 35 seconds . "
Shortly thereafter , the detainee " told his interrogator that Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to cooperate because his cooperation would make it easier on the other brothers who had been captured , " according to Kiriakou .
" And from that day on , he answered every question ... "
The agent told Ross that waterboarding effectively " broke " Zabaydah , and " disrupted a number of attacks , maybe dozens of attacks . "
Asked if he believed waterboading was torture , Kiriakou said that he did n't so at the time , but his opinion on the subject had shifted .
" I think I 've changed my mind , " he said .
" And I think that waterboarding is probably something that we should n't be in the business of doing . "
Added Kiriakou , " We 're Americans and we 're better than this .
And we should n't be doing this kind of thing .
But at the same time , what happens if we do n't waterboard a person and we do n't get that nugget of information .
I would have trouble forgiving myself . "

PRINCETON , NJ -- Most Americans think Barack Obama and John McCain would unite rather than divide the country as president , but view Hillary Clinton as a potentially more divisive chief executive .
These results are based on a Feb .
8-10 USA Today / Gallup poll , which asked Americans if they think the four leading presidential candidates " would do more to unite or more to divide the country as president . "
The public is most likely to view Obama as a unifying force , with 66 % believing he would do more to unite the country and 30 % saying he would do more to divide it if he were elected .
McCain is a close second , with Americans viewing him as a more of a " uniter " rather than a " divider " by a 59 % to 36 % margin .
On the other hand , Americans believe Clinton and Mike Huckabee are more likely to divide Americans than bring them together .
Forty percent say Clinton would unite Americans as president , but the majority , 57 % , say she would do more to divide them .
One of the reasons Clinton may be seen as more of a divider is her long history as a partisan politician in the public eye .
Huckabee 's attempts to rise above negative campaigning have not necessarily enhanced his image as a unifying candidate -- 38 % believe he would do more to unite Americans , but 47 % believe he would do more to divide them .
Generally speaking , party identifiers are more likely to rate their party 's candidates as uniters rather than dividers .
But a closer examination of the results by party affiliation suggests that these ratings are more than just knee - jerk partisan reactions .
For example ,
Democrats are significantly more likely to view Obama ( 79 % ) than Clinton ( 65 % ) as a unifying candidate .
Likewise , more Republicans think McCain ( 79 % ) would unite the country than think Huckabee ( 57 % ) would .
By better than 2 - to - 1 margins , independents think both Obama and McCain would tend to bring Americans together .
But independents think Clinton would maintain or create divisions by nearly the same 2 - to - 1 margin , 62 % to 35 % .
Republicans are far more critical of Clinton than Obama on this measure .
In fact , those who identify with the GOP are more than six times as likely to believe Clinton would tend to divide the country ( 85 % ) as to unite it ( 13 % ) .
Meanwhile , Republicans are just as likely to say Obama would bring the country together as to say he would keep it apart .
Implications
In 2000 , many Americans were looking to heal the partisan divisions of the prior eight years .
George W. Bush promised to be more of a uniter than a divider , but even if he did have the best intentions , his policies and governing style may in the end leave the country more divided than it was when he took office .
A public yearning to move past party divisions may help explain the success of Obama and McCain in their respective parties ' nomination campaigns to date , and may set up a general election between what the public perceives to be two unifying candidates .
However , the realities of the general election phase of the presidential campaign may work against the candidates ' desires to unite the country .
Obama 's and McCain's " unifying " images could be put to a strong test if they wind up on the giving or receiving end of the partisan attacks so common in a tightly contested campaign .
Thus , the challenge for both would be to maintain the perception that they would bring the country together for the duration of the campaign .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 510 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb.
8 - 10 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±5 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Bill Kristol : Enemy of the People
Was it wrong for the New York Times to install William Kristol as an op - ed columnist ?
The move to put an outspoken neoconservative in such a visible position is roiling the newspaper , inside and out .
First , a hailstorm of hate mail arrived at the paper for hiring a " war criminal " -- one of the milder epithets hurled in Kristol 's direction by some 700 letter - writers , all of whom but one were venting against the appointment .
Then , taking note of this groundswell of reader opinion under the headline , " He May Be Unwelcome , But We 'll Survive , " the newspaper 's own ombudsman , Clark Hoyt , called the decision a serious mistake : not because Kristol is an " aggressive unapologetic champion " of the war in Iraq - - but for something else .
That something else is remarks uttered by Kristol on Fox News Sunday in June 2006 .
" I think the attorney general has an absolute obligation to consider prosecution " of the New York Times is what Kristol told a television audience shortly after the newspaper splashed details of the highly classified Terrorist Finance Tracking Program on its front page .
This " leap to prosecution , " wrote Hoyt on Sunday in his weekly column , " smacked of intimidation . "
It also revealed " disregard for both the First Amendment and the role of a free press in monitoring a government that has a long history of throwing the cloak of national security and classification over its activities . "
Someone of such ill repute is not one to be " rewarded with a regular spot in front of arguably the most elite audience in the nation . "
Is Hoyt right or wrong about Kristol ?
For the light it sheds on how the most elite journalists in the nation regard themselves , this little contretemps is rich in a variety of ways .
A key recommendation of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission was that " efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center , " because " information about terrorist money helps us to understand their networks , search them out , and disrupt their operations . "
The classified intelligence program that the Times disclosed was run jointly by the Treasury and CIA to accomplish exactly that ; it relied on analyses of a database maintained by the European banking consortium SWIFT to figure out where , when , and how al Qaeda was moving money around the globe .
On the eve of publication , Bill Keller , the top editor at the Times , was personally told by John Snow , Secretary of the Treasury , that the story would undermine " a highly successful counterterrorism program " and alert " terrorists to the methods and sources used to track their money trails . "
The co-chairmen of the 9/11 commission , former Gov. Thomas H. Kean and former Representative Lee H. Hamilton , one a Democrat , the other a Republican , also weighed in with the highest Times officials , imploring them to spike a story that would harm U.S. counterterrorism efforts .
To no avail .
In light of the Times 's cavalier attitude toward the publication of classified information , does Kristol 's suggestion that the Attorney General " consider " prosecution really smack of intimidation , as Hoyt suggests ?
That is certainly one way of looking at Kristol 's remarks .
But another way would be that they smack only of a desire to uphold the rule of law .
In this instance a newspaper had compromised a classified program aimed at tracing terrorists who had already killed thousands of Americans .
Under such circumstances , the Attorney General would be remiss if he did not scrutinize the statutes to see if such behavior was enjoined by law .
Hoyt calls this perspective " disregard " for the First Amendment .
But is there any plausible theory of the Constitution under which that make any sense ?
" Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press " is what the First Amendment flatly says .
But the courts have long held , and the press itself has long readily accepted , that these seemingly unequivocal words are fully compatible with legal restrictions on what journalists can and cannot say in print .
Statutes forbidding certain kinds of commercial speech and punishing libel , to which virtually no one inside the media ever objects , have long been held to be fully constitutional abridgements of freedom of the press .
Can it really be that Congress can make it crime , as it has , to publish false advertising -- the unfounded claim , say , that Crest shines teeth brighter than Colgate -- while it cannot make it a crime to publish material that causes grave danger to national security ?
Hoyt 's view is nothing but unadulterated applesauce , and so , in the few cases that have come before it , the courts have held .
In his column , like other journalists have in the past at the Times , Hoyt waxes indignant at the fact that the U.S. government " has a long history of throwing the cloak of national security and classification over its activities . "
But the cloak of national security and classification is a protective garment donned according to laws enacted by Congress -- the elected representatives of the American people -- and enforced by officials of the executive branch -- also responsible to an elected representative of the American people whose title is President -- to protect our democracy from mortal enemies .
What is truly significant about this episode is that the Times ombudsman , like a good many other reporters and editors at the paper , have come to regard themselves as above and beyond the reach of these democratically enacted laws .
And having placed themselves in that exalted position , they want criticism of their superior status to be silenced as well .
The obligation of the media not to aid the enemy in wartime is a subject that some liberals these days are unwilling to discuss .
They do not want conservatives to discuss it either .
If anything , it is Hoyt 's column that smacks of intimidation .

The current stimulus plan will help , somewhat , in the short term , and we may have no other choice , but it is a long - term poison .
We are in this mess precisely _because_ the Fed has kept rates low , and pumped more and more fiat currency backed by nothing but debt into the economy for so many years , that we have a negative savings rate .

Now that the bill is coming due , all the assets , homes , stocks , etc , are heading for a serious bit of deflation .
The current rebate will prop things up for a little while , and may be necessary , but in the end it just makes the root problem worse .
It is like drinking more alcohol when you start to feel a hangover coming on .
It helps for now , but just makes everything more painful later .
There are really only two ( painful and unpleasant ) ways out of this at a systemic , root - cause , level .
The first is to let the economy crash and burn , and suffer through a long , hard depression .
10 %+ unemployment , trillions of dollars of paper wealth wiped out , etc.. etc..
Basically , pay the piper , deal with the consequences of our actions , and let the full force of the consequences of so much debt - financed spending work their way through the system .
After a while , we will be more poor , and the rest of the world will get a chance to buy a good chunk of American assets at bargain - basement prices .
- or -
We tread water for a while with stimulus packages and further fed rate cuts , extending the long term problem to buy us time , while we address the systemic root causes to start mitigating the eventual crash .
That means we stop running a deficit in the year - to - year government budget and start running a surplus , and start paying down the debt at a rate _at least_ more than the interest we currently owe .
We have to make a dent , however small , in the principal .
One way or an other , that means increasing taxes and cutting spending and government services and programs .
Politically , this is infeasible , but is the right thing to do structurally .
When you find yourself in a hole , the first step is to stop digging .
This approach also will spike unemployment , and slow the economy down , but with higher interest rates , outsiders will be more likely to invest in the US if they see the surplus being used to pay back debt .
It 's a sign of an improving situation , and investment is all about buying future growth now for cheap , before the benefits arrive later .
Just like personal finance , the cardinal rule to getting out of debt is to not debt one day at a time .
It is politically infeasible to do what must be done , but any other course of action is merely sticking our children and grand children with an ever - increasing , pre-mortgaged lifestyle of debt .

The world 's first wooden supercar has been unveiled - and it's faster than a Porsche or a Lamborghini .
The ' Splinter ' car can turn out a whopping 700 bhp from its twin supercharged , 4.6 litre V8 engine - almost 300 bhp more than a Porsche 911 .
And with a top speed of a staggering 240 mph , it will leave the Porsche or even the brand new Lamborghini Revanton trailing in its wake .
Scroll down for more ...
Wooden supercar :
The vehicle is faster than a Porsche
The entire car , which is made from a combination of maple , plywood and MDF , weighs just 1,134kg - some 240kg less than the super lightweight Porsche .
The eco-friendly two seater , which is fitted with a six - speed , manual gearbox , can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just over three seconds .
But despite its awesome power , designers say the stylish petrol driven car will still be able to do up to 20 mpg .
Designer Joe Harmon , who is head of the project , said : " Wood is a truly amazing material to work with .
" It has a higher strength - to - weight ratio than aluminium or steel , and it possesses a versatility that makes many different types of construction techniques possible .
" The look , feel , and smell of a natural material like wood is not seen elsewhere and cannot be faked , and the satisfaction involved in making something from a piece of wood is awesome .
" This is a supercar designed to push boundaries and prove the potential of wood as a material . "
Scroll down for more ...
Carefully carved :
The car is made completely out of wood
The 15 ft - long car has a laminated wood veneer chassis and wooden wheel rims inside giant 20 inch diameter tyres .
Suspension is provided through laminated wooden arms and springs made from orange wood .
Joe , from North Carolina , US , added : " The light weight is achieved through careful design and composite construction .
" The Splinter is not made from any carved - out , solid chunks of wood , but rather moulded laminates . "

Under the bonnet :
The wooden car can reach a top speed of 240mph
The car is due to hit the road later this year .
The design company , Joe Harmon Design , has not yet decided on a price for the supercar .
And according to 27 - year - old Joe , it might not be long before Formula One star Lewis Hamilton is behind the wheel of a wooden car .
He said : " An F1 car could definitely be made from wood .
" Some extremely creative engineering would have to go into it to overcome the strength - to - weight and mouldability benefits of carbon fibre , but it 's definitely possible .
" Getting permission to race it would probably be a bigger challenge than engineering it .
But it would be fun to try . "
Drivers are kept safe by a roll cage which also stiffens the chassis and defines the rear profile of the car .
Kessler is one of only six centers in the country certified by federal officials as models for both spinal - and brain - injury research and rehabilitation .
It is also rated the second best rehab facility in the nation by a U.S. News & World Report survey .
But at least so far , there have been no miracles for these soldier - sons .
ROADSIDE and suicide bombs are the enemy weapons of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq , and for the 31,000 American troops wounded in these wars , traumatic brain injury has come to be known as the “ signature wound . ”
According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center , a research and treatment agency run by the Pentagon and the veterans department , 31 percent of the soldiers who required medical evacuation for battle - related wounds had traumatic brain injuries .
This covers a broad spectrum , from concussions to the kind of devastating injuries suffered by the soldiers treated at Kessler .
Military officials have acknowledged it took awhile to detect this pattern and respond , and news accounts over the last few years have questioned the quality of rehabilitative care for veterans , including reports by Bob Woodruff of ABC , who himself suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq .
But Dr. Barbara Sigford , the veterans department ’s national director for rehabilitation , says that in 2005 , the department added resources , staff and equipment to its four “ polytrauma ” rehabilitation centers and they are now “ state of the art . ”
The centers are in Palo Alto , Richmond , Minneapolis and Tampa , Fla .
At the Senate Veterans ’ Affairs Committee hearing last March , Ms. Mettie testified that while the department was working to improve , there were still shortcomings .
“ The V.A. is building their program , and I understand that it continues to make progress , ” she said .
“ Still , there are many private hospitals treating and rehabilitating patients like my son .
It is unfair to deny us access to the same level of care you would choose for your children .
At the same time , the V.A. must use these facilities as the resources they are , so one day , hopefully soon , the V.A. will be the facility of choice . ”
Testifying at the same hearing was Dr. Bruce M. Gans , chief medical officer of Kessler , which has been in the rehab business since 1948 and opened a new brain injury center here a year ago .
He invited Ms. Mettie to Kessler , and the V.A. agreed to pay  at a cost “ upward of $ 300,000 for six months , ” according to Gail Solomon , a Kessler spokeswoman .
( Ms. Mettie calls this a first .
Dr. Sigford of the veterans department says that she ca n’t be sure of that , but that virtually all seriously wounded troops use the veterans rehabilitation centers . )
The difference in care , Ms. Mettie said , has been “ night and day . ”
In Palo Alto , she said , her son got twice - weekly 20 - minute sessions of physical therapy and occupational therapy combined , and sessions were often canceled because therapists had to go to staff meetings or were seeing other patients .
At Kessler , she said , five days a week her son received 90 minutes of physical therapy , 90 minutes of occupational therapy and 30 minutes of speech , and sessions did not get canceled .

The “ Big Fat Phony ” guy , whose name is Holden Caulfield , from the animated TV show Family Guy is one of the funniest characters ever !
Just looking at him makes me chuckle ; with his curly brown hair , chubby cheeks , wireframe glasses , and simple baby blue crew neck t- shirt .
He also has a voice only a mother would love .
See the video .
But , it ’s the strength of his conviction and his determination that have to be admired .
These are the attributes that make this character worthy of being today ’s “ offer ” .
The character appeared in Family Guy Season 3 - “ The Kiss Seen Around The World “
At a toy store shopping for a tricycle with his son Stewie , Peter Griffin pretended that he was playing a keyboard while a bystander , Holden Caulfield , watched and enjoyed the music .
At one point , Holden admiringly states to Peter :
My God , that ’s amazing !
You are so talented .
However , after discovering that the keyboard was actually just playing itself , Holden dramatically proclaims :
Wait a second !
Something ’s not right here .
You were just making it look like you were playing .
You ’re a phony .
Hey , this guy ’s a great big phony !
Hey , you ’re a great big phony you know that ?
After the Griffin family finished their shopping , they headed to their car .
Holden , showing some ingenuity , actually figures out where the Griffin family had parked and spray paints “ Phony ” on their car .
As he sees the Griffin family approach their car , he yells out :
That ’s right .
You ’re a big fat phony !
He then runs away .
Later on , Holden finds where Peter lives ( now that ’s dedication ) and exclaims the following statements to the entire neighborhood while pointing at Peter as he watches through the window ( see top pic ) :
Hey , you know who lives in this house !?
A GREAT BIG PHONY !
That ’s right , a phony lives here .
A BIG FAT PHONY !
So , what did we learn from this ?
Well first of all , do n’t pretend to do something that you ca n’t in front of someone who is mentally unstable .
Secondly , if you are not sure that your point was made … try over and over again .
To the writers of Family Guy …
Bring back Holden Caufield !
Bring him back in every episode to really piss off your viewers .
Why not ?
You guys brought back that annoying , fighting chicken so many times .
And you made that creepy old guy Herbert , a real shining star .

That ’s right .
You ’re a big fat phony ! “ .
Remember to point at him too .
And whenever you ’re in a hand with this guy or if he even looks in your direction , keep reminding him that he ’s a “ phony ” by saying : “ You ’re a phony , you know that ?
You ’re a BIG FAT PHONY ! “ .

If you 're afraid of being in a bank during a bank robbery , do n't go to the bank on Friday mornings between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m .
Banks used to have more money on a Friday because it was historically a payday .
Also , bank robbers believed that there 's more money in the bank at the beginning of the day rather than the end .
Interestingly , banks in the supermarkets are actually safer than a regular bank branch .

Two more bank robbery facts :
The Largest Bank Heist in History
The largest bank heist in history occurred in 2003 , when nearly $ 1 billion was stolen from the Central Bank of Iraq just hours after US bombed Baghdad in the Iraq War .
The culprit was Saddam Hussein and his family .
Only about half of the money was recovered ( source ) .
The First U.S. Bank Robbery
The first bank to be robbed in the United States was the Bank of Pennsylvania .
The vault was robbed of $ 162,821 ( $ 1.8 million in 2006 dollar ) in 1798 .
Because there was no sign of forced entry , the authorities believed that it was an inside job ( locks on the vault 's door was just changed ) .
The blacksmith that changed the lock was Pat Lyon , who left Pennsylvania to escape a raging yellow fever epidemic that swept Philadelphia .
Lyon suspected that a carpenter was responsible , and went back to Philly to clear his name .
The authorities did n't believe him and threw him in the Walnut Prison .
The culprit turned out to be someone who earlier had visited Lyon 's shop , named Isaac Davis .
He and a partner ( an inside man , the bank porter who later died in the epidemic ) pulled off the heist but did something monumentally stupid : he started to deposit his stolen money back in the bank !
Confronted by the authorities , Davis confessed and gave back all the money .
As part of a plea deal , he never served a day in prison .
Even after that confession , the authorities refused to release Lyon .
Later , charges against him were dismissed and Lyon sued the bank and law officials .
He got $ 12,000 ( a large amount at the time ) for false imprisonment .
Pat Lyon at the Forge by John Neagle ( 1892 )
Pat Lyon , who became a hero after his trial , was immortalized by a painting by John Neagle titled Pat Lyon at the Forge .
If you look closely , there 's a cupola of the Walnut Prison in the background .
These happy characters are Peruvian anti-riot police , who are seen here parading in celebration of Peru 's independence day yesterday .
Yes , they are terrifying .
This makes
Peru the latest entry in a long list of countries I will try to avoid rioting in .
I 'm still all about rioting in Canada and Sweden , however .

CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential front - runner John McCain on Monday retracted his earlier statement he would lose the November election if he did not convince Americans they were winning the war in Iraq .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ I do n’t mean that I ’ll , quote , lose , ” McCain told reporters on his campaign bus .
“ I mean that it ’s an important issue in the judgment of the American voters . ”
“ It ’s not often I retract a comment , ” said the likely Republican nominee .
McCain , a staunch supporter of the Iraq war , said earlier in the day he would lose the election if he did not convince the American public the U.S. military was succeeding in Iraq .
Most Americans now say the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a bad idea and disapprove of the way President George W. Bush has waged it .
Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama both advocate withdrawing U.S. troops if they are elected president .
McCain , a former Navy aviator who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam , often says on the campaign trail that withdrawing from Iraq prematurely would amount to surrender and give Islamic extremists a propaganda victory .
The Arizona senator has criticized how the war was waged under former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who was replaced in late 2006 .
McCain says the country has made important strides in security and political stability since the United States increased its troop presence last year .
McCain has said U.S. troops may have to maintain a presence in Iraq for up to 100 years , a statement that has drawn criticism from Democrats .
McCain has added he expects casualties to decline as Iraqi troops take on more security duties .
On his campaign bus on Monday , McCain pointed out U.S. troops were still stationed in Japan , Germany , South Korea and Bosnia although those wars have ended .
“ We will succeed in Iraq and the Iraqis will take over their responsibilities .
Americans will withdraw .
But Americans may have , as they have in so many other countries , a security arrangement far into the future , ” he said .

So far , they have been successful ; thanks , in most cases , to lazy or partisan judges who have given little or no scrutiny of the validity of their claims which , according to Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley on Tuesday 's Countdown , are nothing more than unconstitutional attempts to cover up their own federal crimes .
Olbermann : " With or without this new law , suppose one of the anti-wiretapping civil lawsuits succeeds , what does that legal victory actually mean then in terms of stopping the government or punishing Alberto Gonzales or any other top officials who were responsible for this ? "
Turley : " Well , it can mean a lot and that 's one of the reasons there 's a lot of people , both Democrats and Republicans , who do n't want to see it happen .
They do n't want a court to say that the president did something that is a federal crime .
That 's why they 're trying to get all these cases thrown out of court because it is rather clear that what the president ordered was a federal crime , clearly defined in federal law .
But that causes a problem because many of the Democratic leaders and Republican leaders have promised each other that they would not start impeachment proceedings , but when a federal judge says the president committed a crime , it 's pretty darn hard to ignore that . "
Grand Teton moose have learned a lot since then .
Most of us think of moose as these dim lumbering Bullwinkles , but they figure things out .
Today , if I were to play wolf calls over a loudspeaker to a herd in the park , they ’d become vigilant  and they ’d move away .

Q. Is n’t this just moose instinct at work ?
A. No .
They did n’t do it 15 years ago .
Q . Why did you once dress up as a moose ?
A. Legitimate scientific inquiry .
We wanted to see how the Grand Teton moose reacted to the smell of bear scat .
In Alaska , where the moose are very bear - savvy , if they smell it , they ’ll manifest fear .
But what about “ naïve ” moose ?
Well , you ca n’t just go up to moose and put odiferous bear poop patties before them .
The outfit  and a tactic of acting like a moose  was a way of getting in close .
We only did this perhaps four times , but I ’ll never live it down .
The media made a big deal of it .
Letterman wanted me on his show .
We did n’t go .
Q. How did your guys react to the bear patties ?
A . At that time , bears had n’t been that much of a danger to them .
And so they mostly ignored it .
But within one moose generation , really only a few years , they started to wise up .
Q . We found a book by you , “ Bison : Mating and Conservation in Small Populations . ”
Are you the Alfred Kinsey of the bison world ?
A . This was serious work , again .
Our team spent over 9,000 hours over a five - year period watching bison copulations that lasted for less than 10 seconds each .
Bison in the Badlands park in South Dakota , where we were working at that time , are genetically as if on an island .
They are surrounded by a sea of human domination , and no new ones are going to migrate in .
Thus , the potential for inbreeding is high .
We wanted to observe mating patterns to see if it would work to bring in outside males to diversify the gene pool .
The question was , Would these introduced males be allowed to mate with the females .
CHICAGO 
For decades , wheat was a commodity no American needed to think much about , except the farmers who grew it .
The grain was usually plentiful and prices were low .
All of a sudden , those assumptions have been turned upside down .
With demand soaring abroad and droughts crimping supply , the world ’s wheat stockpiles have fallen to their lowest level in 30 years , and stocks in the United States have dropped to levels unseen since 1948 .
Prices have been gyrating in recent days as traders tried to figure out what to make of the situation .
On Tuesday , prices for a sought - after variety , spring wheat , jumped to $ 16.73 a bushel on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange , the latest of several records .
Prices for common wheat are up nearly 50 percent since August , and they are up even more for the most sought - after varieties , leaving buyers , growers and longtime commodity traders shaking their heads .
Thanks to everyone who used and enthusiastically supported OmniGraphSketcher .
It attracted a passionate following and we enjoyed our work on it very much .
We are sad to report that despite that mutual passion , OmniGraphSketcher was unable to attract enough customers to make it a viable commercial product .
As of July 2013 , we have no further updates to OmniGraphSketcher planned and have removed the app from sale .
We ’ll continue to provide support to those customers who purchased OmniGraphSketcher previously - please see below for more information - and downloads will remain available via our website and the Purchases section of the App Stores .
OmniGraphSketcher for iPad should run indefinitely on the versions of iOS it was designed , coded , and tested against , which are iOS 3 through 7 .
We released free updates throughout that time , and we wrote the code carefully and with an eye towards future compatibility .
That is why devices running iOS 8 should also be able to run the app with a few compatibility issues .
It does not run on the latest versions of iOS 9 and iOS 10 .
( Nothing about OmniGraphSketcher has changed to cause it to stop working - the environment that code was running in no longer supports it . )
In January 2014 , we released OmniGraphSketcher source code as the open source project GraphSketcher .
You can download a build of the new Mac app from GitHub .
We hope that the iPad app will make it back to the iTunes store soon .

Great .
Now , when things hit the fan during the Primary , the County already has someone set up to take all the blame .
I hope the poll watchers are on the precints there with magnifying glasses .
I 've often wondered about that specific region - it 's sort of the Bermuda Triangle of whack job Congressmen .

Ancient # 5 Yep , and he is a good cop too :
On the front page of Tuesday 's Washington Post was an article detailing how in late January U.S. forces , acting with autonomy inside Pakistan , were able to target and kill Abu Laith al - Libi , a senior al - Qaeda commander .
The strike , which came without the Pakistani government 's knowledge and helped eliminate an individual who had long eluded the spy - agency 's capture , was an obvious boon in the War on Terror .
But the political implications of the operation were just as fascinating .
In August , Sen. Barack Obama had made the argument that , as president , he would target Al Qaeda officials in Pakistan even without the country 's acquiescence --- the type of attack that , six months later , proved to be successful .
...
And just one week ago , President Bush himself lambasted Obama 's approach to foreign affairs .
" I certainly do n't know what he believes in , " Bush said on February 10 , about Obama .
" The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he 's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad . " ( Huffpo ) .
I liked Obama 's comment recently that " every vote must count " , and he would be distressed at the wrongful treatment of Mr. Perez .
If preznit blush is criticizing you , chances are you are doing something properly with competence .

It is so sad that Obama has practically 100 % of African Americans , and African American superdelegates are running to Obama , making the excuse that he won their districts .
The truth is that Jesse Jackson called some on it , and told them that their careers could be over if they were the reason a black man did not win the Presidency .
What did they do , change pledge !
This is a race about race , and Obama even mentioned civil rights as a platform last night .
Did n't that come and go in the sixties ?
Come on !
I find it sad that white men are supporting Obama because they feel a woman would not be a great commander in chief .
Truth is , Obama wants all troops withdrawn by the end of 2009 .
What does that leave us ?
With an empty Iraq where the Jihad movement will simmer until it explodes back at us ?
Also , Imagine Barrack Obama on the steps of the Capital , being sworn in with his “ un - proud ” wife by his side , " I Barrack HUSSEIN Obama do solemnly swear ... "
We ousted one Hussein , why put one in our White House ?
Men who vote for Obama because they do n't want a female President are liars to the one 's who nurture them the most .
Those of you who say to your daughters that they can be anything they put their minds to are liars because you are voting on the basis of gender , and preventing a woman from proving she can make a true change .
Black or white , give a woman a chance .
Texas , Ohio and Pennsylvania : VOTE SMART , do n't follow a movement , we all know movements disband .
Follow experience .
Not even Obama ’s own supporter ( another Senator to say the least ) could tell the media about one of his legislative accomplishments , that ’s sad .
Obama even piggy - backed in his victory speech off of Hillary Clinton when he said he would provide the same health care that the Senators have ( 02/19/2008 ) .
Obviously this man has no original ideas .
Texas , Pennsylvania and Ohio , it ’s your turn to tell America enough is enough with this movement of false hope .
I am a man and I support Hillary Clinton , the real candidate .

Oh , crap , Jesse .

Has it occurred to you that it might just be that woman voters are running from ?
Has it occurred to you that we should not be picking a president based on what we can say to our daughters about it ?
How in the hell do you know blacks , or whites , are switching to Obama for racism or sexism ?
Balderdash !
Mobs are out cheering for Obama because they do not under any circumstances want more of the same , and he is their best chance of not getting it .
Maybe not the greatest of best chances , but you just can't take that away from him ... even though you sure seem to be trying to .

First of all , before all of you Obama fanatics start attacking me , we have to realize that none of what I wrote above was made up or " balderdash . "
I watch the news and the interviews alone explain where a large majority of voters who are typically within the range of demographics that Clinton has a tight hold on are siding with Obama .
Many men do feel that a woman in the time of war is not equipped to handle the military of the most powerful nation in the world .
In respect to my respondents , I do understand that yes , many people want a clean slate , but a fresh face doesnt make one void of scandal or better qualified to lead the nation .
And so you can have an image of who I am , I am a quarter Spaniard , a quarter filipino , quarter black and a quarter Puerto Rican by ethnicity .
I am an even blend of the demographics of the United States , and a male .
Truth be told , Hillary won the IMPORTANT states of the general election ( Texas is one of them yet to vote . )
The states she won are extremely diverse in race , religion and creed .
The states Obama is winning generally consists of states with relatively low non black minority populations .
Explain why Clinton has the Latino Vote , the Asian vote , ( originally the black vote ) , the Native American vote , the Catholic vote ?
etc .
Its is because she appeals more to the true defnition of the United States .
She appeals to the melting pot that makes our nation unique .
Obama is gaining momentum because he sounds like a preacher , and when a preacher can give a good talk , we listen , and believe what they say even though they are having affairs with other women in the congregation .
No one is without fault , but if you are sold on Obama cause you
lust " his words , ask him about his ACCOMPLISHMENTS .
As senator he certaintly should be able to provide an outline of his changes for the betterment of his constituents .
Ask Sentor Clinton , the list will be so long it will outrun in airtime the 44 minutes of Obama ;s 02/19/08 victory speech .
Sadly enough however , Clinton fought for the rights of all , and her entire life practically was dedicated to those who are now turning their backs on her .
You say no more Clinton Dynasty , you were quick to throw your Governor ( the Bush Dynasty ) back into the fold .
Clinton is n't being given a chance to prove that she is NOT Bill , and her administration through hell or high water will drown Bill out of the equation because she believes in HER Presidency and believes in accountability .
If you like beautiful words with no dept to them and no history of change that Obama is rallying for , you go and vote for him , and hope he does what he says he does .

For your information I 'm not an Obama fanatic .
I am disgusted with the Democratic Party .
I will not be happy no matter who is elected , only marginally less disheartened if the Republicans lose the White House .
I can , however , see that many , many of my fellow Americans are excited about Obama , and the kids are crazy for him .
That does make me hope for them .
Whining about Clinton not being given a chance is just pathetic .
There are very few on the face of the earth who have had , and will continue to have , more chances than Hillary Clinton .
And she 's had a full year in the spotlight to prove she is n't Bill .
What she 's proven is that she 's every bit as willing to play dirty as Bill or any of the Republicans .
And , face it , a vote for ANY of them is but the hope , assuming you can find any trace of consistency in their promises , that they will do what they say they will do ... a hope , I might add , that is almost always proven futile .

People are n't not voting for HRC because she 's a woman - they are n't voting because they do n't like her stances on issues and past record .
I can't think of any intelligent woman who would vote for another woman simply because they were of the same sex .
We 've had enough of that kind of discrimination and it does n't make it any more palatable just because it 's coming from a different direction .
A lot of us are not elated about the choices this time around .
Hillary 's big problems , these are just some of them , are her ties to Walmart in the past , some questionable characters funneling money her way in the past , voting for the Iraq war , and showing a top - down style of management that is getting whipped by grass roots organization , a grass roots involving people at the basic level of democracy .
HRC is showcasing her experience in this campaign and that experience is n't working .
I do n't know who I 'm going to vote for but it wo n't be for cluster - bomb mama Hillary .
I can't think of anything more anti-feminist and anti-humanitarian than supporting the use of cluster bombs .
Those are just some of the reasons that she 's losing , it 's not because of a gender issue - well , maybe it is , since Hillary seemed to be trying to stay in step with the big boy warmongers .

Jesse M ... 99 has the spirit
In a REJECTION election you find what is least like what it is you are rejecting .
Those who think you are for ... miss the boat ...
Hillary has too much of the image of what we are rejecting .
Obama has far less of what we are rejecting .
And so it is not that we are wildly embracing him , it is that we are wildly rejecting fascism .
We will take a closer look at him in 4 years , if necessary .
Same thing with congress ... vote out republicans and democrats who look like bushies ... especially republicans .

I appreciate all of your comments and do n't ever wish to offend .
I love Hillary , and support her , and I understand your arguments .
Sometimes with the excitement of the Obama movement and the nostalgia I have for a good economy as the one we saw during the Clinton years , makes us all excited .
At the end of the day fellow Democrats , lets band together .
I dont know about you , but to have a united party , I really feel that we need both of our Candidates on the same ticket .
We need unity , and I appreciate that all of you who responded are just as enthusiastic as I am .
God Bless America , God Bless Hillary , and may the best PERSON for America win !

Taking advantage of the presence of light echoes , a team of astronomers have used an ESO telescope to measure , at the 1 % precision level , the distance of a Cepheid - a class of variable stars that constitutes one of the first steps in the cosmic distance ladder .
" Our measurements with ESO 's New Technology Telescope at La Silla allow us to obtain the most accurate distance to a Cepheid , " says Pierre Kervella , lead - author of the paper reporting the result .
Cepheids [ 1 ] are pulsating stars that have been used as distance indicators since almost a hundred years .
The new accurate measurement is important as , contrary to many others , it is purely geometrical and does not rely on hypotheses about the physics at play in the stars themselves .
The team of astronomers studied RS Pup , a bright Cepheid star located towards the constellation of Puppis ( ' the Stern ' ) and easily visible with binoculars .
RS
Pup varies in brightness by almost a factor of five every 41.4 days .
It is 10 times more massive than the Sun , 200 times larger , and on average 15 000 times more luminous .
RS Pup is the only Cepheid to be embedded in a large nebula [ 2 ] , which is made of very fine dust that reflects some of the light emitted by the star .
Because the luminosity of the star changes in a very distinctive pattern , the presence of the nebula allows the astronomers to see light echoes and use them to measure the distance of the star .
" The light that travelled from the star to a dust grain and then to the telescope arrives a bit later than the light that comes directly from the star to the telescope , " explains Kervella .
" As a consequence , if we measure the brightness of a particular , isolated dust blob in the nebula , we will obtain a brightness curve that has the same shape as the variation of the Cepheid , but shifted in time . "
This delay is called a ' light echo ' , by analogy with the more traditional echo , the reflection of sound by , for example , the bottom of a well .
By monitoring the evolution of the brightness of the blobs in the nebula , the astronomers can derive their distance from the star : it is simply the measured delay in time , multiplied by the velocity of light ( 300 000 km / s ) .
Knowing this distance and the apparent separation on the sky between the star and the blob , one can compute the distance of RS Pup .
From the observations of the echoes on several nebular features , the distance of RS Pup was found to be 6500 light years , plus or minus 90 light years .
" Knowing the distance to a Cepheid star with such an accuracy proves crucial to the calibration of the period - luminosity relation of this class of stars , " says Kervella .
" This relation is indeed at the basis of the distance determination of galaxies using Cepheids . "
RS Pup is thus distant by about a quarter of the distance between the Sun and the Centre of the Milky Way .
RS Pup is located within the Galactic plane , in a very populated region of our Galaxy .
###
More Information
" The long - period Galactic Cepheid RS Puppis - I. A geometric distance from its light echoes " , P. Kervella et al. is in press in Astronomy and Astrophysics .
The team is composed of Pierre Kervella and Guy Perrin ( LESIA , Observatoire de Paris , France ) , Antoine Mérand ( Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy , Atlanta , Georgia , USA ) , László Szabados ( Konkoly Observatory , Budapest , Hungary ) , Pascal Fouqué ( Observatoire Midi- Pyrénées , Toulouse , France ) , David Bersier ( Liverpool John Moores University , UK ) , and Emanuela Pompei ( ESO ) .
Notes
[ 1 ] : Cepheids are rare and very luminous pulsating stars whose luminosity varies in a very regular way .
They are named after the star Delta Cephei in the constellation of Cepheus , the first known variable star of this particular type and bright enough to be easily seen with the unaided eye .
Almost a century ago , in 1912 , American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt published a relation between the intrinsic brightness and the pulsation period of Cepheids , the longer periods corresponding to the brighter stars .
This relation still plays today a central role in the extragalactic distance scale .
[ 2 ] :
The nebula around RS Pup was discovered in 1961 by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund , who later became ESO Director in Chile ( 1970 - 74 ) .
Shortly after , in 1972 , the American astronomer Robert Havlen , then visiting ESO Chile , published the first study of the nebula in the then rather young European journal Astronomy & Astrophysics .
The color green
For years and years , computing was all about performance .
Faster CPUs , better video cards , more RAM — all to make sure you had the biggest and baddest box on the block .
Recently , we 've seen a new trend , focused mainly on lower - energy , more efficient computing .
The marketing buzz says that a green PC will result in reduced power bills , smaller servers , and lower carbon footprint for the environment .
Couple this lean approach with reductions on hazardous substances ( a la RoHS ) that have been made over the past two years , and computing is clearly becoming less wasteful .
For corporations , a 10 percent or even 5 percent reduction in power consumption is huge .
Add in additional overhead costs to keep those server rooms air conditioned , fed with clean power , secure from the outside and the inside , and the effects of a greener computer are multiplied .
Smaller , more energy efficient servers may allow more servers to be packed into less rack space — this may actually increase overall power consumption , but it might also allow one less data center to be built , which means one less building to staff and all of the other associated costs .
For the home user , the benefits are more direct : a lower electric bill , both from reduced consumption and , for those in hot climates , less money spent on cooling your home office .
The primary trade - off for individuals is the direct cost of upgrading or replacing an existing system to a less power - hungry one : you may never recoup the upgrade cost , even if the computer is run continuously .
At $ 0.14 / kWh , going from a computer that consumes 100W to one that consumes 60 W would save $ 50 a year — which is many times less than what it would cost to upgrade the computer .
If your existing system is a power - hungry Netburst - era Pentium 4 , the savings may be more dramatic than the example above , but even if you save $ 100 a year , upgrading a perfectly adequate computer for the sake of lower power probably does n't make financial sense .
At $ 300 for a minimal box , that 's still three years to pay it off , which is a long time for a computer .
Hence , the real reason to go green is because you want to .
Be it bragging rights over the neighbors , maybe your existing system is ready to be retired , or because removing 20 or 30 or 50 or 100 watts of power consumption in your study means you do n't have to run the air conditioner , we 're happy to see what 's available for when you want to go green .
Low - power components
Certain components are major power hogs in a modern computer and can be made more efficient , while others consume relatively little power .
It 's difficult to achieve practical gains with other components .
Processors and power supplies get most of the attention for good reason , but video cards should not be overlooked .
Hard drives are another good place for saving power with more efficient units , especially if you can afford to go to flash - based ( solid state disk , also known as SSD ) drives .
Once you get past the obvious , shaving watts becomes more difficult — but we 're hear to help .
You can get by with fewer fans since your system runs cooler , and a smaller case means fewer materials and resources used in manufacture — many of which are recyclable .
Integrating everything into the motherboard means fewer add - in cards on PCBs , but again , that may only go so far .
Not everyone can turn to integrated video , particularly gamers and multimonitor power users , and " ridiculous " comes to mind when one is obsess over the number of fans in a system , as a low - flow / low - noise fan is typically less than 2 watts .
If you can get by without a desktop , a $ 499 laptop today typically has power consumption in line with a low - power PC .
Even more economical alternatives such as Asus 's Eee PC are also worth considering , but such choices call for significant compromises in screen size and performance .
The truly obsessed will find little ways to save power , far beyond what we discuss here .
The Intellplug is one of the more practical examples .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm really getting tired of having elected officials who appear to have either no knowledge of or respect for the Constitution of this country .

With that knowledge came an unprecedented feeling for longtime Washington fans : entitlement .
The Capitals have only reached the Stanley Cup finals once , in 1998 , and they were swept by the Detroit Red Wings .
After 36 years of futility , the fans ' expectations are always tempered , their optimism always cautious .
But not this year .
Not with Ovi and the gang scoring a league - leading 3.8 goals a game and pulling off one miracle comeback after another .
Not with a bottom - heavy Eastern Conference and a spate of Western Conference foes ready to tear each other to pieces in the early rounds of the playoffs .
This year , the Stanley Cup was more than expected .
It was destiny .
Until it was n't .
The Caps ' first - round series with the Canadiens -- who squeaked into the postseason by a single point -- was supposed to be the long - awaited juxtaposition of David and Goliath .
The long - suffering Capitals had become the unstoppable force , and the Canadiens , who have an NHL - record 24 Stanley Cup titles , were going to be swept away .
When Washington took a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the series , they seemed all but assured of advancing ; the success rate for teams up three games to one was 91.3 percent .
But the Canadiens were n't interested in percentages or the entitlement of the Washington faithful .
The scrappy team had nothing to lose and nearly 100 years of playoff success for inspiration .
They also have a 24 - year - old goalie from Bratislava by the name of Jaroslav Halak , a second - year starter who singlehandedly changed the series .
After the Habs surprised the Capitals with a 2 - 1 victory in Game 5 , Halak delivered an unfathomable performance in Game 6 , stopping 52 of 53 Washington shots to spearhead a 4 - 1 rout that evened the series 3 - 3 .
Just like that , the series came down to a Game 7 in Washington , where complacency had given way to a burgeoning panic .
The fans ' dread even found its way onto the front page of the Washington Post 's sports section , where columnist Thomas Boswell fumed : " Frankly , I 'm sick and damn tired of the same Caps choke story .
It 's beyond old , beyond sad , beyond undeserved . "
So the nervous crowd filed into the stadium , and the fans at Bar Louie looked like a group bracing for the gallows despite their best efforts at optimism .
A single Washington goal or great save would bring the cheers back and revitalize the red- shirted masses that wanted any excuse to believe again .
But the Caps could n't get the puck past Halak , and when Montreal scored first the bar filled with scattered expletives and stunned silence .
When the Canadiens struck again to take a 2 - 0 lead , barely three and a half minutes remained .
" Unbelievable , " murmured one waiter , turning away from the bank of televisions in disgust .
Just when it seemed like midnight for the Caps , Laich scored , there was pandemonium in the bar .
Allowing themselves to hope one more time , the fans roared as Washington prepared to skate the last 1:44 with a 6 - on - 4 advantage .

A commission on judicial conduct said Judge Restaino had acted " without any semblance of a lawful basis " and behaved like a " petty tyrant " .
The judge has said he was under stress in his personal life at the time .
He has 30 days to appeal against the commission 's decision .
' Inexplicable madness '
In its ruling on Tuesday , the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct recommended the removal of Judge Restaino for what its chairman called " two hours of inexplicable madness " on the morning of 11 March 2005 .
It said the 48 - year - old judge had been presiding over a series of domestic violence cases when he heard a mobile phone ring and " snapped " .
Ultimately , when you go back there to be booked , you 've got to surrender what you got on you - one way or another , we 're going to get our hands on something
Judge Robert Restaino
" Every single person is going to jail in this courtroom unless I get that instrument now , " he told the courtroom 's audience , according to the commission .
" If anybody believes I 'm kidding , ask some of the folks that have been here for a while .
You are all going . "
Security officers then attempted to find the phone but failed .
After a brief recess , Judge Restaino returned to the bench and again asked who had been responsible for the ringing phone .
When no - one came forward , the judge ordered that the entire courtroom audience of 46 people be taken into custody and set bail at $ 1,500 .
" This troubles me more than any of you people can understand , " the judge explained .
" This person , whoever he or she may be , does n't have a whole lot of concern .
Let 's see how much concern they have when they are sitting in the back there with all the rest of you , " he added .
" Ultimately , when you go back there to be booked , you 've got to surrender what you got on you .
One way or another , we 're going to get our hands on something . "
One defendant , according to the report , told the judge : " This is not fair to the rest of us . "
" I know it is n't , " Judge Restaino replied .
Rights ' deliberately violated '
The defendants were then taken to Niagara City jail , where they were searched and packed into crowded cells .
Fourteen people who could not post bail were later shackled and transported to another prison .
He explained that he simply focused on attempting to locate the phone 's owner and was frustrated by his inability to do so
Commission on Judicial Conduct
It was only later in the afternoon , when reporters began to ask questions about the ruling , that Judge Restaino ordered their release .
The judge told the commission he had known that he had no legal basis for his actions and that they had been " improper and inexcusable " .
" He explained that he simply focused on attempting to locate the phone 's owner and was frustrated by his inability to do so , " the commission said .
The judge told the panel he had been under stress in his personal life at the time of the incident , it added .
Nevertheless , the commission 's administrator , Robert Tembekjian , said the fundamental rights of 46 people had been " deliberately and methodically violated " and insisted there could be no excuse .
The judge 's lawyer , Terrence Connors , told the Associated Press that he would exercise his right to appeal the decision within 30 days .
He will remain in office during that time .
After the U.S.S.R. dissolved , Americans believed their country was the sole , remaining superpower , but the strength of any nation is its economy .
Without a robust and thriving economy , the U.S. never could have built the vast military machine that projects American power to all corners of the globe .
But the U.S. has weakened .
Since 2006 , Bush admits he ’s increased the deficit by three trillion dollars since taking office , but creative book keeping conceals the real number .
Add the as yet unfunded future payments to Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid , Veterans Benefits , plus individual , corporate and the fifty state ’s collective debt , and the deficit skyrockets to 44 trillion dollars .
This figure was determined by economists and budget analysts at the US Treasury , the Federal Reserve , the Office of Management and Budget , and the Congressional Budget Office .
The Bush Administration ’s tax cuts , the corporate scandals that occur with rapid fire frequency , the huge expenditures on prosecuting the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , and now the threats against Iran send the message to foreign lenders that the U.S. has no intention of reining in its spending .
" The budget should be balanced ; the treasury should be refilled ; public debt should be reduced ; and the arrogance of public officials should be controlled . "

The occupation of Iraq was going to greatly reduce U.S. dependence on oil imports .
The plan was that after seizing Iraq ’s oil fields , U.S. oil producers would move in and get the wells pumping again , and before you could say , “ Iraqi Oil ” the U.S. would be shipping high grade crude to American refineries .
Rebuilding Iraq ?
Do n’t worry about it .
As soon as the dust settles , the money will flow .
But like everything else about the occupation , it did n’t work out that way .
The Iraqi oil ministry is carefully weighing the options of how best to help the war ravaged land and its people .
Russia is rebuilding Iraq ’s power plants and are waiting to help Iraq develop its unexplored oil fields .
Iraq has claimed their vast oil wealth a natural resource that belongs to the Iraqi people .
The U.S. watched from the sidelines as Iraq discussed honoring pre-war contracts with Russia , China , France , and India .
No major drilling concessions have been awarded yet , but it ’s expected that a multinational conglomerate of oil producers will eventually share in developing Iraq ’s unexplored oil reserves .
The Bush Administration ’s hawkish elements had once dreamed of ccupying the entire Middle East .
If the U.S. controlled a significant percentage of the world ’s oil wealth they reasoned , it could maintain its faltering superpower status .
The plan had been to occupy Iraq , take Iran ’s oil fields , go after Syria - then Egypt .
But the neocons have been forced to see the impossibility of their pipe dreams , and now Russia and China have warned the U.S against an Iranian attack .
On October 25th , during a press conference , Russian President Vladimir Putin said , “ To run around like a madman waving a knife is not the best way forward , ” He added , “ Why drive the situation into a dead end ? ''
This , from a man whose soul Bush looked into , and found good .
Russia is not a friend to the U.S , and contrary to popular belief , it is n’t a weak , bygone power either .
Russia is still very much a communist state , and as such , remains an enemy of free market capitalism .
The Financial Times reported in August of 2006 , that Russia ’s proven oil reserves had surpassed Saudi Arabia as the world ’s largest .
This puts Russia in a position to dominate the world ’s oil markets , and with Bush weakening U.S. influence around the globe , Russian oil exports to European Nations may soon be paid for in rubles , replacing the dollar as the world ’s fiat currency .
This plays directly into Russia ’s plans to isolate the U.S. from its traditional allies , and Bush seems to be doing everything he can to assure the Russian plan succeeds .
The world ’s contempt for U.S. foreign policy , if a permanent war footing can be called that , has been greatly exacerbated by Bush ’s abandonment of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , the Biological Weapons Convention , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and the Global Arms Trade Treaty .
Russia , in response , has rearmed its ballistic missiles with MIRV’s , Multiple Independently guided Re-entry Vehicles .
It has also resumed long range bomber flights , that are presumably nuclear capable .
In November , 2005 The Washington Times reported that Russia had developed a new ballistic missile that was capable of changing course in mid-flight , negating any technology the U.S. possesses to intercept incoming missiles .
In January of 2006 , during a news conference , Russia ’s president said , “ These missile systems do n’t represent a response to a missile defense system , but they are immune to that .
They are hypersonic and capable of changing their flight path . ”
Alexei Bayer , a frequent contributor to Geopolitical , Global Analysis writes , “ The Pentagon Budget may be larger than the sum total of what the rest of the world spends on defense , but Russia can still incinerate all of the U.S. in about 15 minutes — hardly a condition for world domination by Washington . ”
The Bush Administrations strategy , if one is charitable enough to call it that , is to hand the democrats the enormous debt Bush and his neocons have incurred .
They ’ll also hand the democrats the unenviable task of finding an exit strategy out of Iraq .
This assumes the democrats will win the White House in 2008 , and Bush does n’t attack Iran .
If he does , the entire Middle East will erupt in anti-American hatred , with Muslims the world over vowing revenge against U.S. interests , including American citizens abroad .
Russia will not sit idly by while the U.S. establishes military bases on the Russian border .
Reagan began the U.S. decline with his deregulation of American corporations .
The American public bought into the scheme with promises of lower costs for everything through healthy competition .
The opposite has proven true .
As Paul Krugman recently wrote in the New York Times , “ Unfortunately , assertions that unregulated financial markets would take care of themselves have proved as wrong as claims that deregulation would reduce electricity prices . ”
Corporate failures , from the S&L ’s to California ’s utilities , have destroyed overseas confidence in U.S. markets , and have cost taxpayers trillions of dollars that should have been spent on infrastructure , educating a globally competitive workforce , and a serious investment in alternative energy , freeing the U.S. from oil blackmail .
Bush and his neocons thought that occupying Iraq and taking control of its oil would make them all fantastically wealthy .
Instead , their misguided and disastrous invasion has seriously threatened the U.S. economy , and has cast a long shadow on America ’s once , good name .
A group of American Douglas Adams fans are seeking to have a street named after him in Portland , Oregon .
The chosen street - naturally - is currently called 42nd Avenue .
" On May 11 , 2001 a very talented writer and activist was taken from this world far before his time , " say the activists of rename42nd.org .
" Not yet 50 years of age , Douglas Adams passed on and left a legacy for all that would come after him . "
According to the campaigners , the renaming would demonstrate Portland residents ' commitment to the arts , their respect for the environment , a desire to provide " technological access for all " and even " education to all people " .
Best of all , the Adams fans say , " it will remind all Portlanders [ of ] the most important lesson in times of uncertainty and fear ...
" ... DON ’T PANIC " .
The organisers believe that 42nd Avenue should become Douglas Adams Boulevard .
The movement to accomplish this is sponsored by Geek in the City , " a worldwide phenomenon of pop culture rambling and rants ... the premiere destination site for lesser known , but wholly worthy subjects of entertainment " .
Apparently the city of Portland allows only one street name change per year , and 2007 is already taken .
( It seems that 4th Avenue is being renamed after César Chávez , a noted Hispanic labour organiser . )
However , the Adams backers are hoping to get the 2008 spot . ®
Bootnote
It 's always possible that some Reg readers do n't know who Douglas Adams was .
In answer , he was a British writer probably most famous for the Hitch Hikers ' Guide to the Galaxy series of books , which were seminal works for teenage Brit geeks of the 1980s .
They were based around radio scripts on which Adams had worked , and there was a TV series ( and eventually a movie ) .
In the books , the number 42 has deep significance .
The eponymous , fictional e-book style travel guide / encyclopaedia spawned a fairly successful wikipedia - esque community database , run by Adams ' old employers at the BBC .
After his huge success as a writer of comic novels , Adams was also a conservation advocate .
He died of heart failure during a workout .

Actors ' support for the protest will be solid , the union says
Union president Alan Rosenberg said there was " unanimous agreement " not to cross picket lines set up by writers who are on strike over royalties .
The Golden Globes , awarded to actors in television and film , are second in prestige only to the Oscars .
Without top actors present , TV networks may not bother to screen the event .
It is difficult to imagine a ceremony honouring excellence in film - making , without actors there to accept the awards , says the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles .
' Solidarity and support '
" After considerable outreach to Golden Globe actor nominees and their representatives over the past several weeks , there appears to be unanimous agreement that these actors will not cross WGA ( Writers ' Guild of America ) picket lines , " Mr Rosenberg said .
Late - night host David Letterman was off the air for two months
However , the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , which organises the Golden Globes , said it was continuing talks to find a compromise which would allow the event to take place " with the creative community present " .
For its part , the WGA thanked the actors ' union for its " solidarity and support " .
The Writers ' Guild of America has been on strike since early November .
Its members are in dispute over so - called " residuals " - royalties for work distributed online or released on DVD .
The WGA says it is engaged in a " crucial struggle that will protect our income and intellectual property rights for generations to come " .
The dispute has virtually halted the production of TV comedy and drama shows .
However , talk shows resumed this week , with David Letterman 's show reaching an " interim agreement " with WGA members .
Rival host Jay Leno is still subject to pickets , however .
If it was n’t so serious , it might just be funny how many times Dick Cheney has been wrong .
What will he use as an excuse for being so wrong , this time ?
The hard truth is that high oil prices have negatively impacted the US economy .
December sales with US retailers took a beating because of the a combination of the housing bubble crash and high gas prices .
I know neither issue impacts Bush or Cheney , but for everyone , it matters .
A new gene therapy approach that attracts and “ trains ” immune system cells to destroy deadly brain cancer cells also provides long - term immunity , produces no significant adverse effects and — in the process of destroying the tumor — promotes the return of normal brain function and behavioral skills , according to a study conducted by researchers at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center ’s Board of Governors Gene Therapeutics Research Institute .
The study was conducted in a recently developed laboratory rat model of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) that closely simulates outcomes in humans and supports the translation of this procedure to human clinical trials later this year .
Results of the study are described in the Feb. 19 issue of Molecular Therapy , the journal of the American Society for Gene Therapy .
“ These findings appear to be a significant milestone in creating an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme , ” said Maria Castro , Ph.D. , co-director of the Board of Governors Gene Therapeutic Research Institute and principal investigator of the study .
“ This therapy significantly improved survival rate , induced long - lasting systemic anti-tumor immunity , and resolved the neuropathological abnormalities caused by the tumors , which has been a stumbling block to many promising treatments . ”
The article documents the gene therapy ’s effectiveness in killing GBM cells and launching an effective and sustained systemic immune response .
It also focuses on the safety of the therapy as well as its ability to restore normal brain function and reverse behavioral deficits caused by large tumors .
Humans with GBM often suffer behavioral abnormalities that affect concentration , memory and balance .
In the animal studies , rats exhibited abnormal rotational movements .
The research team found that as the tumors grew , they displaced and compressed nerve terminals and impulse - conducting axons .
But long - term survivors who had received the gene therapy did not have long - term injury or behavioral impairment resulting from the tumor or the treatment .
“ Tumor growth causes behavioral deficits , but even treatments , such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy , can cause learning disabilities and other cognitive problems .
In our animal study , this therapy eliminated the tumor mass and reversed the deficits that were caused by the tumor , ” said Pedro Lowenstein , M.D. , Ph.D. , co-principal investigator on the study and director of the Board of Governors Gene Therapeutics Research Institute .
Glioblastoma multiforme , the most common and deadly type of brain cancer , usually claims the lives of victims within six to 12 months of diagnosis .
It is extremely difficult to treat for a variety of reasons .
GBM tumors grow rapidly , often becoming large before a diagnosis is made .
Also , cells readily infiltrate neighboring tissue and migrate to other areas , hampering complete surgical removal .
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are unable to eliminate all residual GBM cells , which frequently become resistant to the treatments .
The blood - brain barrier also prevents chemotherapy from effectively reaching tumor cells , and key cells needed to launch and sustain a systemic anti-tumor immune response – dendritic cells , or antigen - presenting cells – do not naturally occur within the brain .
The gene therapy approach developed at Cedars - Sinai sidesteps all of these challenges .
The researchers used a virus stripped of its disease - causing genes as a vehicle to deliver two therapeutic proteins directly into the tumor cells .
One protein , FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand ( Flt3L ) , drew dendritic cells into the brain .
Another protein , herpes simplex virus type 1 thimidine kinase ( HSV1 - TK ) , combined with the antiviral gancyclovir ( GCV ) , killed tumor cells .
Dendritic cells clean up debris from dying cells and in the process alert immune system cells of the existence of foreign entities , or antigens – in this case , GBM cells .
Newly “ educated ” immune system cells then swarm to the tumor cells to destroy them .
In an earlier study , the Cedars - Sinai researchers used HSV1 - TK and GCV alone to treat GBM and found that about 20 percent of the animals survived , compared to controls .
By adding the dendritic - cell inducing Flt3L , the survival rate jumped to about 70 percent .
Systemic immune activity was sustained , even fending off a “ re-challenge ” with additional tumor cells .
In this study , the researchers at the BOG - GTRI reported that this therapy could also revert behavioral abnormalities caused by the growing tumor in the brain .
“ In the fairly near future , this combined gene therapy may work synergistically with current therapies , including chemotherapy and radiation therapy , allowing doctors to reduce dosages and avoid side effects , ” Dr. Castro said .
“ But with the safety , effectiveness and curative potential seen in these studies , we are hopeful that gene therapy for GBM could become the new standard of care . ”
Scientists now think these dinosaurs were more muscular than previously thought
Enlarge Image
Skin , muscle , tendons and other tissue that rarely survive fossilisation have all been preserved in the specimen unearthed in North Dakota , US .
The 67 million - year - old dinosaur is one of the duck - billed hadrosaur group .
The preservation allowed scientists to estimate that it was more muscular than thought , perhaps giving it the ability to outrun predators like T. rex .
The researchers propose that the dinosaur 's rump was 25 % larger than had previously been thought .
This probably meant more muscle mass and therefore greater acceleration , giving it a greater chance of evading meat - eating dinosaurs in hot pursuit .
Depth and structure
While it has been dubbed a dinosaur " mummy " , the dinosaur is actually fossilised into stone .
But unlike the collections of bones found in many museums , this hadrosaur came complete with fossilised skin , ligaments , tendons and possibly some internal organs , according to researchers .
" It 's unbelievable when you look at it for the first time , " said palaeontologist Phillip Manning from the University of Manchester , UK .
The scales are still visible on the fossilised skin
Dr Manning said there was a pattern of banding to the larger and smaller scales on the skin .
Because it has been fossilised researchers do not know the colour of the skin .
But looking at it in monochrome shows a striped pattern .
He noted that in modern reptiles , such a pattern is often associated with transitions between different skin colours .
The fossil was found in 1999 and is now nicknamed Dakota .
It is being analysed in the world 's largest CT scanner , operated by the Boeing corporation .
The machine usually is used for space shuttle engines and other large objects .
Researchers hope the technology will help them learn more about the fossilised insides of the creature .
The reptile had no chest cavity , suggesting it had been partially eaten by predators before being " mummified " in unusual conditions : acidic , waterlogged sediments collected around the dinosaur , triggering the rapid deposit of minerals and trapping organic molecules before they decayed .
In his biography of Barack Obama , David Mendell writes about Obama ’s life as a “ secret smoker ” and how he “ went to great lengths to conceal the habit . ”
But what about Obama ’s secret political life ?
It turns out that Obama ’s childhood mentor , Frank Marshall Davis , was a communist .
In his books , Obama admits attending “ socialist conferences ” and coming into contact with Marxist literature .
But he ridicules the charge of being a “ hard - core academic Marxist , ” which was made by his colorful and outspoken 2004 U.S. Senate opponent , Republican Alan Keyes .
However , through Frank Marshall Davis , Obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the Communist Party USA CPUSA ) .
The record shows that Obama was in Hawaii from 1971 - 1979 , where , at some point in time , he developed a close relationship , almost like a son , with Davis , listening to his “ poetry ” and getting advice on his career path .
But Obama , in his book , Dreams From My Father , refers to him repeatedly as just “ Frank . ”
The reason is apparent : Davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the Soviet Union .
In fact , the 1951 report of the Commission on Subversive Activities to the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaii identified him as a CPUSA member .
What ’s more , anti-communist congressional committees , including the House Un- American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , accused Davis of involvement in several communist - front organizations .
Trevor Loudon , a New Zealand - based libertarian activist , researcher and blogger , noted evidence that “ Frank ” was Frank Marshall Davis in a posting in March of 2007 .
Obama ’s communist connection adds to mounting public concern about a candidate who has come out of virtually nowhere , with a brief U.S. Senate legislative record , to become the Democratic Party frontrunner for the U.S. presidency .
In the latest Real Clear Politics poll average , Obama beats Republican John McCain by almost four percentage points .
AIM recently disclosed that Obama has well - documented socialist connections , which help explain why he sponsored a “ Global Poverty Act ” designed to send hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. foreign aid to the rest of the world , in order to meet U.N. demands .
The bill has passed the House and a Senate committee , and awaits full Senate action .
But the Communist Party connection through Davis is even more ominous .
Decades ago , the CPUSA had tens of thousands of members , some of them covert agents who had penetrated the U.S. Government .
It received secret subsidies from the old Soviet Union .
You wo n’t find any of this discussed in the David Mendell book , Obama : From Promise to Power .
It is typical of the superficial biographies of Obama now on the market .
Secret smoking seems to be Obama ’s most controversial activity .
At best , Mendell and the liberal media describe Obama as “ left - leaning . ”
But you will find it briefly discussed , sort of , in Obama ’s own book , Dreams From My Father .
He writes about “ a poet named Frank , ” who visited them in Hawaii , read poetry , and was full of “ hard - earned knowledge ” and advice .
Who was Frank ?
Obama only says that he had “ some modest notoriety once , ” was “ a contemporary of Richard Wright and
Langston Hughes during his years in Chicago … ” but was now “ pushing eighty . ”
He writes about “ Frank and his old Black Power dashiki self ” giving him advice before he left for Occidental College in 1979 at the age of 18 .
This “ Frank ” is none other than Frank Marshall Davis , the black communist writer now considered by some to be in the same category of prominence as Maya Angelou and Alice Walker .
In the summer / fall 2003 issue of African American Review , James A. Miller of George Washington University reviews a book by John Edgar Tidwell , a professor at the University of Kansas , about Davis ’s career , and notes , “ In Davis ’s case , his political commitments led him to join the American Communist Party during the middle of World War II - even though he never publicly admitted his Party membership . ”
Tidwell is an expert on the life and writings of Davis .
Is it possible that Obama did not know who Davis was when he wrote his book , Dreams From My Father , first published in 1995 ?
That ’s not plausible since Obama refers to him as a contemporary of Richard Wright and Langston Hughes and says he saw a book of his black poetry .
The communists knew who “ Frank ” was , and they know who Obama is .
In fact , one academic who travels in communist circles understands the significance of the Davis - Obama relationship .
Professor Gerald Horne , a contributing editor of the Communist Party journal Political Affairs , talked about it during a speech last March at the reception of the Communist Party USA archives at the Tamiment Library at New York University .
The remarks are posted online under the headline , “ Rethinking the History and Future of the Communist Party . ”
Horne , a history professor at the University of Houston , noted that Davis , who moved to Honolulu from Kansas in 1948 “ at the suggestion of his good friend Paul Robeson , ” came into contact with Barack Obama and his family and became the young man ’s mentor , influencing Obama ’s sense of identity and career moves .
Robeson , of course , was the well - known black actor and singer who served as a member of the CPUSA and apologist for the old Soviet Union .
Davis had known Robeson from his time in Chicago .
As Horne describes it , Davis “ befriended ” a “ Euro - American family ” that had “ migrated to Honolulu from Kansas and a young woman from this family eventually had a child with a young student from Kenya East Africa who goes by the name of Barack Obama , who retracing the steps of Davis eventually decamped to Chicago . ”
It was in Chicago that Obama became a “ community organizer ” and came into contact with more far - left political forces , including the Democratic Socialists of America , which maintains close ties to European socialist groups and parties through the Socialist International ( SI ) , and two former members of the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) , William Ayers and Carl Davidson .
The SDS laid siege to college campuses across America in the 1960s , mostly in order to protest the Vietnam War , and spawned the terrorist Weather Underground organization .
Ayers was a member of the terrorist group and turned himself in to authorities in 1981 .
He is now a college professor and served with Obama on the board of the Woods Fund of Chicago .
Davidson is now a figure in the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism , an offshoot of the old Moscow - controlled CPUSA , and helped organize the 2002 rally where Obama came out against the Iraq War .
Both communism and socialism trace their roots to Karl Marx , co-author of the Communist Manifesto , who endorsed the first meeting of the Socialist International , then called the “ First International . ”
According to Pierre Mauroy , president of the SI from 1992 - 1996 , “ It was he [ Marx ] who formally launched it , gave the inaugural address and devised its structure … ”
Apparently unaware that Davis had been publicly named as a CPUSA member , Horne said only that Davis “ was certainly in the orbit of the CP [ Communist Party ] - if not a member … ”
In addition to Tidwell ’s book , Black Moods : Collected Poems of Frank Marshall Davis , confirming Davis ’s Communist Party membership , another book , The New Red Negro : The Literary Left and African American Poetry , 1930 - 1946 , names Davis as one of several black poets who continued to publish in CPUSA - supported publications after the 1939 Hitler - Stalin non-aggression pact .
The author , James Edward Smethurst , associate professor of Afro-American studies at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst , says that Davis , however , would later claim that he was “ deeply troubled ” by the pact .
While blacks such as Richard Wright left the CPUSA , it is not clear if or when Davis ever left the party .
However , Obama writes in Dreams From My Father that he saw “ Frank ” only a few days before he left Hawaii for college , and that Davis seemed just as radical as ever .
Davis called college “ An advanced degree in compromise ” and warned Obama not to forget his “ people ” and not to “ start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the American way and all that # # # # . ”
Davis also complained about foot problems , the result of “ trying to force African feet into European shoes , ” Obama wrote .
For his part , Horne says that Obama ’s giving of credit to Davis will be important in history .
“ At some point in the future , a teacher will add to her syllabus Barack ’s memoir and instruct her students to read it alongside Frank Marshall Davis ’ equally affecting memoir , Living the Blues and when that day comes , I ’m sure a future student will not only examine critically the Frankenstein monsters that US imperialism created in order to subdue Communist parties but will also be moved to come to this historic and wonderful archive in order to gain insight on what has befallen this complex and intriguing planet on which we reside , ” he said .
Dr. Kathryn Takara , a professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who also confirms that Davis is the “ Frank ” in Obama ’s book , did her dissertation on Davis and spent much time with him between 1972 until he passed away in 1987 .
In an analysis posted online , she notes that Davis , who was a columnist for the Honolulu Record , brought “ an acute sense of race relations and class struggle throughout America and the world ” and that he openly discussed subjects such as American imperialism , colonialism and exploitation .
She described him as a “ socialist realist ” who attacked the work of the House Un- American Activities Committee .
Davis , in his own writings , had said that Robeson and Harry Bridges , the head of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union ( ILWU ) and a secret member of the CPUSA , had suggested that he take a job as a columnist with the Honolulu Record “ and see if I could do something for them . ”
The ILWU was organizing workers there and Robeson ’s contacts were “ passed on ” to Davis , Takara writes .
Takara says that Davis “ espoused freedom , radicalism , solidarity , labor unions , due process , peace , affirmative action , civil rights , Negro History week , and true Democracy to fight imperialism , colonialism , and white supremacy .
He urged coalition politics . ”
Is “ coalition politics ” at work in Obama ’s rise to power ?
Trevor Loudon , the New Zealand - based blogger who has been analyzing the political forces behind Obama and specializes in studying the impact of Marxist and leftist political organizations , notes that Frank Chapman , a CPUSA supporter , has written a letter to the party newspaper hailing the Illinois senator ’s victory in the Iowa caucuses .
“ Obama ’s victory was more than a progressive move ; it was a dialectical leap ushering in a qualitatively new era of struggle , ” Chapman wrote .
“ Marx once compared revolutionary struggle with the work of the mole , who sometimes burrows so far beneath the ground that he leaves no trace of his movement on the surface .
This is the old revolutionary ‘ mole , ’ not only showing his traces on the surface but also breaking through . ”
Let ’s challenge the liberal media to report on this .
Will they have the honesty and integrity to do so ?

STORYLINE : All Good Things Are Possible , Right Where You Are , and Now* .
Conwell ’s famous lecture , " Acres of Diamonds , " made him America 's foremost platform orator .
By the end of his life , in 1925 , he had delivered the lecture more than 6,000 times in town after town throughout America ( Constancy of Purpose ) .
It was heard by millions from pulpits and public platforms , and by radio , and today others are still reading his practical , optimistic essay and hearing it on cassettes .
He founded Temple University , a worthy cause , from over $ 8 million dollars ( in 1920s ) that he earned from telling Acres of Diamonds Stories .
In 1870 when making a circuit of the earth as the correspondent of the New York Tribune , Conwell visited Baghdad ( under different circumstances than now ) and hired a guide to show him down the Euphrates and the Tigris Rivers .
On the first day down the river , the guide told him their tradition concerning acres of diamonds , which Russell Conwell used in his lectures six thousand times .
There once lived , in , near the river Indus an ancient farmer ( business man ) who owned a large farm ( corporation ) , that he had orchards ( for technology , products ) and grain fields ( Mfg facilities ) and gardens ( systems and tools ) — money at interest ( cash ) — and was counted as a wealthy ( Leading Corporation ) and a happy man ( well balanced ) .
One day there visited him one of the ancient Buddhist priests ( exteranl consultants ) — a wise man of the East who told him about the discovery of diamonds ( new systems / tools / programs ) in Europe ( other corporations ) .
He said that the diamonds are so very valuable that if the farmer had a handful he could purchase the whole country ( own the entire market share ) , and with a mine of diamonds , he could place his children upon thrones , through the influence of their great wealth .
The farmer heard all about diamonds , and was determined to find them .
He sold his farm the next day , and with the money departed - traveling up and down the whole of Europe .
He sought them in every place where he had heard of any indication of such gems ... but finding none , he spent all his money and became very poor , in rags , in poverty , and in hunger .
And at last , in despair , he flung himself into the sea — on the shore of the Thames — and sank from sight , never to rise in this life again .
Now the man who bought his farm started exploring his newly acquired land .
He noticed a curious flash of light from the white sands of the stream , and reaching in , he pulled out a black stone having an eye of light which reflected all the hues of the rainbow .
“ And , thus , ” said the guide to Conwell , “ was discovered the great diamond mines of Galconda , the most magnificent diamond mine in all the history of the world .
The Kohinoor of England , and the Orlov of Russia , the greatest crown jewels on earth came from Galconda ’s diamond mines . ”
" Had the farmer , at least , explored the possibilities in his own land ( understood his own capabilities and strengths ) , dug in his own cellar ( taken deep dive into his own operations ) , or underneath his own wheat fields ( listened to his people ) , or in his own garden ( and acted upon more of his core strengths ) , instead of wretchedness , starvation , poverty , and suicide in a strange land ( adopting other 's programs w/o success indicators ) , he would have had acres of diamonds ! "
Reflection :
The answer to your ( organization , person 's ) problems lie within you .
All that you have to do is look , listen and learn .
Russell Conwell , inspired by this farmer ’s story , found many similar stories in America and shared them in his lectures .
I am sure we all have our Acres of Diamonds .

Artist 's concept : A gamma -ray burst destroys a star .
Credit : NASA / SkyWorks Digital
From mother Earth , the night sky can look peaceful and unchanging , but the universe as seen in gamma-rays is a place of sudden and chaotic violence .
Using gamma-ray telescopes , astronomers witness short but tremendously intense explosions called gamma-ray bursts , and there is nothing more powerful .
No one is sure what causes gamma-ray bursts .
Favored possibilities include the collision of two neutron stars or a sort of super - supernova that occurs when extremely massive stars explode .
One thing is certain : gamma-ray bursts happen in galaxies far , far away -- so far away that the distances are called " cosmological , " beyond ordinary comprehension .
Think about this :
When you look up at the night sky , you are looking at the ultimate history book – one that goes back to the very beginning of what we call time .
And each star is a chapter in the book .
You are not really seeing the stars as they are now .
You are looking at stars as they used to be when their light left them long ago .
And the deeper we peer into space , the farther back in time we are looking .
In fact , light from the galaxies farthest away is billions of years old .
" Gamma - ray bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light years away , which means they occurred billions of years ago , and we see them as they looked then , " says Charles Meegan of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center .
" They can help us look back in time and teach us something about the conditions in the early universe .
In gamma-ray bursts , we may be seeing the first generation of stars , from the earliest galaxies created after the Big Bang . "
Not only do gamma-ray bursts help scientists learn about our universe 's history ; they also help explain its physics .
But the tricky part in studying a gamma-ray burst is catching it before it disappears .
Each burst happens and fades so fast that it 's hard to detect them all .
It 's like trying to capture every single firefly 's flash on a summer night with an ordinary camera .
NASA 's Gamma - Ray Large Area Space Telescope , GLAST for short , will soon help in the chase .
More on that in a minute , but first , let us set the stage with a little history .
Scientists have been hot on the gamma-ray trail for years , but the bursts were actually discovered by accident .
During the Cold War in the 1960s , US satellites keeping an eye out for Soviet nuclear testing in violation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty detected intense bursts of gamma radiation .
But the bursts were n't coming from the Soviet Union .
Scientists realized that the bursts were coming from space !
Quickly , gamma-rays bursts became one of the most compelling mysteries of astronomy , and NASA decided to build a Great Observatory to map the gamma - ray sky .
In the 1990s , the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory discovered more than 400 new gamma-ray sources and recorded 2704 gamma-ray bursts , detailing the gamma - ray universe early satellites had merely glimpsed .
Most importantly , Compton uncovered evidence that gamma-ray bursts issued not from the Milky Way , but from staggeringly distant galaxies .
To be seen at such distances , the explosions had to be almost impossibly violent , astronomers realized .
In a way , this was no surprise .
Gamma rays are by their very nature a herald of great energy and violence .
Consider the following : gamma rays are a super - energetic form of light .
Ordinary visible photons , the kind we see with the human eye , have energies of about 2 to 3 electron - volts .
Gamma -ray photons have energies greater than 10 giga - electron - volts ( GeV ) , billions of times that of ordinary light .
Ground - based observatories have detected gamma-rays of even higher energy – thousands of GeV .
In May 2008 , NASA will launch GLAST to welcome these high - energy messengers .
GLAST 's main instrument , the Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) , will make pioneering observations of gamma-ray bursts at higher energies than ever before from space .
It is expected to accurately locate 50 or so bursts per year .
Meanwhile , another instrument onboard GLAST , the GLAST Burst Monitor ( GBM ) , will monitor gamma-ray bursts at lower energies .
By working together , these two instruments will capture the whole energy range of these cosmic fireflies – from 10 thousand eV to 100 giga - electron - volts .
" Capturing the events in more than one wavelength will help scientists understand more about them , kind of like seeing in color instead of black and white , " says Meegan .
" We can't reproduce in any laboratory the extreme physical conditions that occur in gamma- ray bursts , so we do n't understand how they work .
By studying them with these instruments , we may learn some new physics about matter . "
" I think it is likely that LAT and GBM will see something new and unpredicted from gamma-ray bursts .
They will likely answer some old questions and raise new ones . "
That 's what science always seems to do .
Stand by for launch in May 2008 !

It was expected 2.5 million households would take up the free porn- blocking filters within 12 months but only 144,088 filter products have been downloaded or ordered on CD - ROM since August last year .
The Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy has estimated about 29,000 of these accessed filter products were still being used - less than 2 per cent of the set target .
" The program has clearly failed , despite over $ 15 million being spent in advertising to support it , " Mr Conroy said .
" Labor has always said that PC filtering is not a stand - alone solution to protecting children from online dangers .
The Government has a comprehensive cyber-safety plan that includes the implementation of mandatory ISP - based filtering to deliver a filtered feed to all homes , schools and public internet points .
" Education for parents and teachers as well as children is a priority . "
Mr Conroy said the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) would examine all aspects of ISP - level filtering , with a laboratory trial completed by the end of June 2008 , followed by a pilot test in a real world environment .
Sixteen - year - old Tom Wood , aka " The Porn Cracker " , who shot to national prominence when he showed the new NetAlert filters could be bypassed by any savvy teenager in a matter of minutes , said the scheme had been a waste of time and money .
" Although these are amongst the best PC - based filters available , it did n't take long for teens to work out how to bypass them , " said the schoolboy with a passion for cyber -safety .
Opposition communications spokesman Bruce Billson said the Rudd Government was rushing to criticise the NetAlert program to set the scene for a " harebrained , half - baked policy dreamt up in the lead - up to an election " .
" NetAlert is a program which is relatively new , as is the minister in his role , and I 'm sure he would like a little more than six months or so before the public decide if he has been a failure or not , " he said .
" Proper supervision should be front and centre of any efforts to protect children from inappropriate material on the internet ; supported by additional tools such as content filters , not some mandatory and ill - conceived ' clean feed ' measure by a government that believes only it has the authority to decide what 's appropriate or inappropriate content for computer users .

Is there honor in forgiveness ?
Lawsuit stirs debate over program that some say leads to ' academic bankruptcy '
Depending on your point of view , Michael Walters of Park Ridge has either invented a new definition for chutzpah , or DePaul University did n't keep its promise .
Walters , a former DePaul student , is suing the university to force it to designate him an honors student even though some of his grades were not high enough for honors .
Walters ' suit centers around a widely adopted but little - known policy at universities called " grade forgiveness , " where a student can sometimes have poor grades removed from the pool of grades used to calculate grade point average .
Walters received grade forgiveness in some classes and his transcript 's cumulative GPA came to 3.588 after the offending grades were removed , his suit claims .
The " with honors " designation normally kicks in at a 3.5 GPA .
But , the suit claims DePaul declined to give him the designation .
Walters contends his recalculated GPA should come with all the bells and whistles .
He wants the designation to help him in his search for a job , his lawyer James Koch said .
Some students do n't see it the same way .
" That 's so audacious to go and demand honors , " said an aghast Stefanie Nano , a 19 - year - old DePaul sophomore from Bloomingdale .
" He should be grateful . "
Yet Koch says DePaul offered Walters a program that promised not to hold against him grades from a time when he was having trouble .
Nowhere did it make clear that the reconstituted GPA would n't have the same benefits as a normal GPA , Koch said .
" If that 's the case , then tell people that ( up front ) , " Koch said .
Koch said he did n't know exactly how many of Walters ' classes DePaul forgave , but said it was just " one or two . "
Walters ran into some problems while " he was addressing some personal matters " and decided to go the grade - forgiveness route , Koch said .
DePaul would n't address the specifics of Walters ' case directly , but it said it believes the suit is without merit .
Although Walters ' situation is probably unique , grade forgiveness is n't .
DePaul , the University of Illinois at Chicago and Harper College employ grade forgiveness .
Loyola , Northwestern , Roosevelt and University of Chicago do not .
The policy varies from institution to institution .
In some places , a maximum of two grades can be forgiven .
Other schools do n't allow you to forgive courses in your major .
At DePaul , students can get forgiveness for roughly a year 's worth of classes , but it comes at a heavy price , said Caryn Chaden , associate vice - president for academic affairs at DePaul .
The student must attend school at a junior college for one year and earn a GPA of 3.0 , or a B average .
Only then , after showing they 're serious about school , can students return and get forgiveness , she said .
" That 's an important piece of it .
It 's not that you go home and sit … and think , " she said .
" You 're restarting it ( the GPA ) based on evidence that the student has heard you and has demonstrated that they 're ready to come back . "
" If I was a university administrator and someone proposed this idea , I 'd laugh , " said Stuart Rojstaczer , a former science professor at Duke University .
Rojstaczer wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post in 2003 bemoaning the trend of grade inflation , where more and more students are receiving A's and B's , essentially making it harder to distinguish the good students from the mediocre .
He said grade forgiveness just continues this dubious trend .
" It 's a New Age thing and it does reflect the trend toward consumerism that 's present in universities and colleges , " Rojstaczer said .
" You try to keep your customers happy -- even when they screw up . "
Chaden , the DePaul administrator , said those who object to the program often do n't take into account the type of nontraditional student that DePaul is committed to serving as part of its educational mission .
Believing the program is a way around performing well the first time , or that grades are grades and you should n't get second chances , " assumes a culture of people used to going to college , " Chaden said .
" If you are the first person in your family to go to school , there is a whole culture of experience and expectation that no one 's shown you . "
Koch , Walters ' attorney , also defends the idea of grade forgiveness .
He just thinks in this instance it should have come with a better explanation of what the program did and did not provide .
Koch notes that a form of grade forgiveness is now in effect at almost every school : late withdrawal .
In that instance , students can withdraw from a class , sometimes very late into the semester , without having a bad grade assigned .
While grade forgiveness and late withdrawals used to largely be a matter of debate only among faculty members , it 's more and more becoming a public policy issue , said Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers .
" These matters are becoming a little more broadly debated , " he said .
" Institutions are all over the map with it . …
It has emerged as something of a problem . "
Its most extreme form , where a student is allowed to start over completely , is sometimes referred to as " academic bankruptcy , " a reference to the way adults are often allowed to restart their financial lives , he said .
" What you 're describing is much more typically labeled ' academic forgiveness , ' " Nassirian said .
But legislatures are starting to get involved -- at least at the public school level -- because of financial issues , Nassirian said .
The more times a student can withdraw from a class or get grades forgiven , it " may induce existing students to sort of hang around " as perpetual students , he said .
That means the state is paying more for a frequent - repeater student 's education than someone who goes straight through .
Meanwhile , eligible students trying to enroll can't get in because the seats are full .
" So it becomes a kind of subsidy issue , " Nassirian said .
In Texas , the legislature recently voted to limit students to six withdrawals during a student 's career , Nassirian said .
If grades are forgiven for the purpose of the cumulative GPA , the group recommends still posting the forgiven grade , even if it 's not counted toward the GPA , he said .
That 's what DePaul does .
So does Harper College in Palatine , said Phil Burdick , spokesman for Harper .
Rojstaczer , the former Duke professor , is still unconvinced .
" Everybody 's awesome , " he scoffed . "… we 're moving in that direction . "
Koch , Walters ' lawyer , said the idea of grade forgiveness is designed for students who have overwhelming problems that can be rectified .
It beats just unceremoniously booting them from college .
" It 's a mulligan , " said Koch , referring to the golfing term for a do - over .
" You deserve a mulligan . "
This is taken from John Taylor Gatto's book , Dumbing Us Down : The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling
This speech was given by the author on 31 January 1990 in accepting an award from the New York State Senate naming him New York City Teacher of the Year .
THE PSYCHOPATHIC SCHOOL I accept this award on behalf of all the fine teachers I 've known over the years who 've struggled to make their transactions with children honorable ones , men and women who were never complacent , always questioning , always wrestling to define and redefine what the word " education " should mean .
A Teacher of the Year is not the best teacher around ( those people are too quiet to be easily uncovered ) , but she or he is a standard - bearer , representative of these private people who spend their lives gladly in the service of children .
This is their award as well as mine .
1 .
We live in a time of great school crisis linked to an even greater social crisis .
Our nation ranks at the bottom of nineteen industrial nations in reading , writing , and arithmetic .
At the very bottom .
The world 's narcotic economy is based upon our consumption of this commodity ; if we did n't buy so many powdered dreams the business would collapse - and schools are an important sales outlet .
Our teenage suicide rate is the highest in the world , and suicidal kids are rich kids for the most part , not the poor .
In Manhattan , seventy percent of all new marriages last less than five years .
So something is wrong for sure .
This great crisis which we witness in our schools is interlinked with a greater social crisis in the community .
We seem to have lost our identity .
Children and old people are penned up and locked away from the business of the world to a degree without precedent ; nobody talks to them anymore , and without children and old people mixing in daily life ; a community has no future and no past , only a continuous present .
In fact the name " community " hardly applies to the way we interact with each other .
We live in networks , not communities , and everyone I know is lonely because of that .
School is a major actor in this tragedy , as it is a major actor in the widening gulf among social classes .
Using school as a sorting mechanism , we appear to be on the way to creating a caste system , complete with untouchables who wander through subway trains begging and who sleep upon the streets .
I 've noticed a fascinating phenomenon in my twenty - five years of teaching : that schools and schooling are increasingly irrelevant to the great enterprises of the planet .
No one believes anymore that scientists are trained in science classes or politicians in civics classes or poets in English classes .
The truth is that schools do n't really teach anything except how to obey orders .
This is a great mystery to me because thousands of humane , caring people work in schools , as teachers and aides and administrators , but the abstract logic of the institution overwhelms their individual contributions .
Although teachers do care and do work very , very hard , the institution is psychopathic ; it has no conscience .
It rings a bell and the young man in the middle of writing a poem must close his notebook and move to a different cell where he must memorize that humans and monkeys derive from a common ancestor .
2 . Our form of compulsory schooling is an invention of the State of Massachusetts around 1850 .
It was resisted - sometimes with guns - by an estimated eighty percent of the Massachusetts population , the last outpost in Barnstable on Cape Cod not surrendering its children until the 1880s , when the area was seized by militia and children marched to school under guard .
Now here is a curious idea to ponder .
Senator Ted Kennedy 's office released a paper not too long ago that prior to compulsory education the state literacy rate was ninety - eight percent , and after it the figure never exceeded ninety - one percent , where it stands in 1990 .
Here is another curiosity to think about .
The home - schooling movement has quietly grown to a size where one and half million young people are being educated entirely by their own parents ; last month the education press reported the amazing news that children schooled at home seem to be five or even ten years ahead of their formally trained peers in their ability to think .
3 . 1 do n't think we 'll get rid of schools any time soon , certainly not in my lifetime , but if we 're going to change what 's rapidly becoming a disaster of ignorance , we need to realize that the school institution " schools " very well , though it does not " educate ; " that 's inherent in the design of the thing .
It 's not the fault of bad teachers or too little money spent .
It 's just impossible for education and schooling ever to be the same thing .
Schools were designed by Horace Mann and by Sears and Harper of the University of Chicago and by Thorndyke of Columbia Teachers College and by some other men to be instruments of the scientific management of a mass population .
Schools are intended to produce , through the application of formulas , formulaic human beings whose behavior can be predicted and controlled .
To a very great extent schools succeed in doing this , but in a national order increasingly disintegrated , in a national order in which the only " successful " people are independent , self - reliant , confident , and individualistic ( because community life which protects the dependent and the weak is dead and only networks remain ) , the products of schooling are , as I 've said , irrelevant .
Well - schooled people are irrelevant .
They can sell film and razor blades , push paper and talk on telephones , or sit mindlessly before a flickering computer terminal , but as human beings they are useless .
Useless to others and useless to themselves .
The daily misery around us is , I think , in large measure caused by the fact that , as Paul Goodman put it thirty years ago , we force children to grow up absurd .
Any reform in schooling has to deal with its absurdities .
It is absurd and anti-life to be part of a system that compels you to sit in confinement with people of exactly the same age and social class .
That system effectively cuts you off from the immense diversity of life and the synergy of variety ; indeed it cuts you off from your own past and future , sealing you in a continuous present much the same way television does .
It is absurd and anti-life to move from cell to cell at the sound of a gong for every day of your natural youth in an institution that allows you no privacy and even follows you into the sanctuary of your home demanding that you do its " homework . "
" How will they learn to read ? " you ask , and my answer is " Remember the lessons of Massachusetts . "
When children are given whole lives instead of age - graded ones in cellblocks they learn to read , write , and do arithmetic with ease , if those things make sense in the kind of life that unfolds around them .
But keep in mind that in the United States almost nobody who reads , writes , or does arithmetic gets much respect .
We are a land of talkers ; we pay talkers the most and admire talkers the most and so our children talk constantly , following the public models of television and schoolteachers .
It is very difficult to teach the " basics " anymore because they really are n't basic to the society we 've made .
4 . Two institutions at present control our children 's lives : television and schooling , in that order .
Both of these reduce the real world of wisdom , fortitude , temperance , and justice to a never - ending , nonstop abstraction .
In centuries past , the time of childhood and adolescence would have been occupied in real work , real charity , real adventures , and the realistic search for mentors who might teach what you really wanted to learn .
A great deal of time was spent in community pursuits , practicing affection , meeting and studying every level of the community , learning how to make a home , and dozens of other tasks necessary to becoming a whole man or woman .
But here is the calculus of time the children I teach must deal with :
Out of the 168 hours in each week my children sleep 56 .
That leaves them 112 hours a week out of which to fashion a self .
According to recent reports children watch 55 hours of television a week .
That then leaves them 57 hours a week in which to grow up .
My children attend school 30 hours a week , use about 8 hours getting ready for and traveling to and from school , and spend an average of 7 hours a week in homework - a total of 45 hours .
During that time they are under constant surveillance .
They have no private time or private space and are disciplined if they try to assert individuality in the use of time or space .
That leaves them 12 hours a week out of which to create a unique consciousness .
Of course my kids eat , too , and that takes some time - not much because they 've lost the tradition of family dining - but if we allot 3 hours a week to evening meals we arrive at a net amount of private time for each child of 9 hours per week .
It 's not enough , is it ?
The richer the kid , of course , the less television he or she watches , but the rich kid 's time is just as narrowly prescribed by a somewhat broader catalogue of commercial entertainments and the inevitable assignment to a series of private lessons in areas seldom of his or her own choice .
But these activities are just a more cosmetic way to create dependent human beings , unable to fill their own hours , unable to initiate lines of meaning to give substance and pleasure to their existence .
It 's a national disease , this dependency and aimlessness , and I think schooling and television and lessons have a lot to do with it .
Think of the phenomena which are killing us as a nation - narcotic drugs , brainless competition , recreational sex , the pornography of violence , gambling , and alcohol , and the worst pornography of all : lives devoted to buying things , accumulation as a philosophy - all of these are addictions of dependent personalities , and this is what our brand of schooling must inevitably produce .
5 . I want to tell you what the effect on our children is of taking all their time from them - time they need to grow up - and forcing them to spend it on abstractions .
You need to hear this because any reform that does n't attack these specific pathologies will be nothing more than a facade .
1 . The children I teach are indifferent to the adult world .
This defies the experience of thousands of years .
A close study of what big people were up to was always the most exciting occupation of youth , but nobody wants children to grow up these days , least of all the children : and who can blame them ?
Toys are us .
2 . The children I teach have almost no curiosity , and what little they do have is transitory .
They cannot concentrate for very long , even on things they choose to do .
Can you see a connection between the bells ringing again and again to change classes and this phenomenon of evanescent attention ?
3 . The children I teach have a poor sense of the future , of how tomorrow is inextricably linked to today .
As I said before , they live in a continuous present , the exact moment they are in is the boundary of their consciousness .
4 . The children I teach are ahistorical ; they have no sense of how the past has predestinated their own present , limiting their choices , shaping their values and lives .
5 . The children I teach are cruel to each other ; they lack compassion for misfortune ; they laugh at weakness : they have contempt for people whose need for help shows too plainly .
6 . The children I teach are uneasy with intimacy or candor .
They cannot deal with genuine intimacy because of a lifelong habit of preserving a secret inner self inside a larger outer personality made up of artificial bits and pieces of behavior borrowed from television or acquired to manipulate teachers .
Because they are not who they represent themselves to be , the disguise wears thin in the presence of intimacy ; so intimate relationships have to be avoided .
7 . The children I teach are materialistic , following the lead of schoolteachers who materialistically " grade everything " and television mentors who offer everything in the world for sale .
8 . The children I teach are dependent , passive , and timid in the presence of new challenges .
This timidity is frequently masked by surface bravado , or by anger or aggressiveness , but underneath is a vacuum without fortitude .
I could name a few other conditions that school reform will have to tackle if our national decline is to be arrested , but by now you will have grasped my thesis , whether you agree with it or not .
Either schools have caused these pathologies , or television has , or both .
It 's a simple matter of arithmetic - between schooling and television , all the time the children have is eaten up .
There simply is n't enough other time in the experience of our kids for there to be other significant causes .
6 . What can be done ?
First , we need a ferocious national debate that does n't quit , day after day , year after year , the kind of continuous debate that journalism finds boring .
We need to scream and argue about this school thing until it is fixed or broken beyond repair , one or the other .
If we can fix it , fine ; if we cannot , then the success of home - schooling shows a different road that has great promise .
Pouring the money we now pour into schooling back into family education might cure two ailments with one medicine , repairing families as it repairs children .
Genuine reform is possible but it should n't cost anything .
More money and more people pumped into this sick institution will only make it sicker .
We need to rethink the fundamental premises of schooling and decide what it is we want all children to learn and why .
For 140 years this nation has tried to impose objectives downward from a lofty command center made up of " experts , " a central elite of social engineers .
It has n't worked .
It wo n't work .
And it is a gross betrayal of the democratic promise that once made this nation a noble experiment .
The Russian attempt to create Plato 's republic in Eastern Europe has exploded before our eyes ; our own attempt to impose the same sort of central orthodoxy using the schools as an instrument is also coming apart at the seams , albeit more slowly and painfully .
It does n't work because its fundamental premises are mechanical , antihuman , and hostile to family life .
Lives can be controlled by machine education but they will always fight back with weapons of social pathology : drugs , violence , self - destruction , indifference , and the symptoms I see in the children I teach .
7 . It 's high time we looked backwards to regain an educational philosophy that works .
One I like particularly well has been a favorite of the ruling classes of Europe for thousands of years .
I use as much of it as I can manage in my own teaching , as much , that is , as I can get away with , given the present institution of compulsory schooling .
I think it works just as well for poor children as for rich ones .
At the core of this elite system of education is the belief that self - knowledge is the only basis of true knowledge .
Everywhere in this system , at every age , you will find arrangements that work to place the child alone in an unguided setting with a problem to solve .
Sometimes the problem is fraught with great risks , such as the problem of galloping a horse or making it jump , but that , of course , is a problem successfully solved by thousands of elite children before the age of ten .
Can you imagine anyone who had mastered such a challenge ever lacking confidence in his ability to do anything ?
Sometimes the problem is the problem of mastering solitude , as Thoreau did at Walden Pond , or Einstein did in the Swiss customs house .
Right now we are taking from our children all the time that they need to develop self - knowledge .
That has to stop .
We have to invent school experiences that give a lot of that time back .
We need to trust children from a very early age with independent study , perhaps arranged in school , but which takes place away from the institutional setting .
We need to invent curricula where each kid has a chance to develop private uniqueness and self - reliance .
A short time ago I took $ 70 and sent a twelve - year - old girl from my class , with her non-English - speaking mother , on a bus down the New Jersey coast to take the police chief of Seabright to lunch and apologize for polluting his beach with a discarded Gatorade bottle .
In exchange for this public apology I had arranged with the police chief for the girl to have a one - day apprenticeship in small town police procedures .
A few days later two more of my twelve - year - old kids traveled alone from Harlem to West Thirty - first street where they began an apprenticeship with a newspaper editor ; later three of my kids found themselves in the middle of the Jersey swamps at six in the morning , studying the mind of a trucking company president as he dispatched eighteen - wheelers to Dallas , Chicago , and Los Angeles .
Are these " special " children in a " special " program ?
Well , in one sense yes , but nobody knows about this program but myself and the kids .
They 're just nice kids from central Harlem , bright and alert , but so badly schooled when they came to me that most of them could n't add or subtract with any fluency .
And not a single one knew the population of New York City or how far New York is from California .
Does that worry me ?
Of course ; but I am confident that as they gain self - knowledge they 'll also become self - teachers - and only self - teaching has any lasting value .
We 've got to give kids independent time right away because that is the key to self - knowledge , and we must reinvolve them with the real world as fast as possible so that the independent time can be spent on something other than abstraction .
This is an emergency ; it requires drastic action to correct .
8 . What else does a restructured school system need ?
It needs to stop being a parasite on the working community .
Of all the pages in the human ledger , only our tortured country has warehoused children and asked nothing of them in service of the general good .
For a while I think we need to make community service a required part of schooling .
Besides the experience in acting unselfishly that it will teach , it is the quickest way to give young children real responsibility in the mainstream of life .
For five years I ran a guerrilla school program where I had every kid , rich and poor , smart and dipsy , give 320 hours a year of hard community service .
Dozens of those kids came back to me years later , grown up , and told me that the experience of helping someone else had changed their lives .
It had taught them to see in new ways , to rethink goals and values .
It happened when they were thirteen , in my Lab School program , and was only possible because my rich school district was in chaos .
When " stability " returned , the Lab closed .
It was too successful with a widely mixed group of kids , at too small a cost , to be allowed to continue .
Independent study , community service , adventures and experience , large doses of privacy and solitude , a thousand different apprenticeships , the one - day variety or longer - these are all powerful , cheap , and effective ways to start a real reform of schooling .
But no large - scale reform is ever going to work to repair our damaged children and our damaged society until we force open the idea of school to include family as the main engine of education .
If we use schooling to break children away from parents - and make no mistake , that has been the central function of schools since John Cotton announced it as the purpose of the Bay Colony schools in 1650 and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts schools in 1850 - we 're going to continue to have the horror show we have right now .
The " Curriculum of Family " is at the heart of any good life .
We 've gotten away from that curriculum ; it 's time to return to it .
The way to sanity in education is for our schools to take the lead in releasing the stranglehold of institutions on family life , to promote during schooltime confluences of parent and child that will strengthen family bonds .
That was my real purpose in sending the girl and her mother down the Jersey coast to meet the police chief .
I have many ideas for formulating a family curriculum and my guess is that a lot of you have many ideas , too .
Our greatest problem in getting the kind of grassroots thinking going that could reform schooling is that we have large , vested interests preempting all the air time and profiting from schooling as it is , despite rhetoric to the contrary .
We have to demand that new voices and new ideas get a hearing , my ideas and yours .
We 've all had a bellyful of authorized voices mediated by television and the press ; a decade - long free - for - all debate is what is called for now , not any more " expert " opinions .
Experts in education have never been right ; their " solutions " are expensive , self - serving , and always involve further centralization .
We 've seen the results .
If s time for a return to democracy , individuality , and family .

The " modest success " of Ron Paul prompts Michael Kinsley to examine the practicality of libertarian ideas and the value of the questions they ask .
Here 's part of his longer essay :
Libertarians deserve a listen , by Michael Kinsley , Commentary , LA Times : ... The libertarian perspective is useful and undervalued .
Why does the government pay farmers not to grow food ?
Why are medications for fatal diseases sometimes held off the market in case they are n't safe ?
( Compared to death ? )
Legislators and regulators should ask themselves far more often than they do whether their activities expand freedom or contract it .
Furthermore , democracy and majority rule are no answers .
Tyranny of the majority is a constant danger .
How would you like a law requiring people with odd Social Security numbers to give $ 1,000 to people with even Social Security numbers ?
To libertarians , much of what government does is essentially just that .
So what is wrong with the libertarian case for extremely limited government ?
Economics 101 teaches some of the basic justifications for government interference in the economy .
Some things , such as the cost of national defense , are " public goods . " ...
Then there are " externalities " ...
Pollution is the classic example .
Without government involvement ... we will produce more pollution than most of us want .
There are " market - oriented " solutions to this problem , but there is a difference -- often forgotten , especially by Republicans -- between using market forces and leaving something to the market .
The point of principle is whether the government should intervene at all .
How it intervenes is purely pragmatic .
Libertarians have a fondness for complex arrangements to make markets work in situations where the textbooks say they can't .
Hey , let 's issue stamps , y'see , and use the revenue to form a corporation that sells stock to buy military equipment , then the government leases the equipment and the stockholders vote on whether to use it ... and so on .
The point becomes proving a point , not economic or government efficiency .
...
Sometimes libertarians end up reinventing the wheel .
My favorite example is an article I read years ago advocating privatization of highways .
This is a classic libertarian fantasy : government auctions off the land , private enterprise pays for construction and maintenance , tolls cover the cost , competing routes keep it all efficient .
And what about , uh , intersections ?
Well , markets would recognize that it is more efficient for one company to own the intersections , but it would have an incentive to strike the right balance between customers on each highway .
And stoplights ?
Ultimately , the author had worked his way up to a giant monopoly that would build , own and maintain all the roads and charge an annual fee to people who wanted to use them .
None dare call it government .
...
Extreme libertarians believe [ government - mandated income redistribution ] is immoral or even unconstitutional , and even moderate libertarians disapprove of social welfare programs as an infringement on the freedom of taxpayers .
But freedom is only one of the two core values our nation was built on .
The other is equality .
Defining equality , libertarians tend to take a narrow view , believing that it means only political equality with no financial aspects .
Defining freedom , by contrast , they take a broad view , and see a violation in every nickel a citizen is forced to spend .
Libertarians ask :
By what justification does the government concern itself with inequality , financial or otherwise ?
They are nearly alone in asking this question .
Even conservatives claim a great concern for equality of opportunity , while opposing equality of result .
...
But nothing ... is obvious to libertarians .
They force us to think it all through from scratch .
Good for them .

( CNN ) --
If you 're searching for a villain in America 's obesity epidemic , most nutritionists tell you to put one picture on the wanted poster : a cold , bubbly glass of soda pop .
Full of sugar , soda adds calories without making a person feel full , nutritionists say .
" Liquid candy " to detractors , sweetened soft drinks are so ubiquitous that they contribute about 10 percent of the calories in the American diet , according to government data .
In fact , said Dr. David Ludwig , a Harvard endocrinologist whose 2001 paper in the Lancet is widely cited by obesity researchers , sweetened drinks are the only specific food that clinical research has directly linked to weight gain .
" Highly concentrated starches and sugars promote overeating , and the granddaddy of them all is sugar - sweetened beverages , " said Ludwig , who runs the Optimal Weight for Life Program at Children 's Hospital in Boston .
' Fed Up : America 's Killer Diet ' Dr. Sanjay Gupta investigates our obsession with foods that make us fat .
3 p.m. Saturday , 2 p.m. Sunday ET see full schedule »
The rise in soft drink consumption mirrors the national march toward obesity .
At the midpoint of the 20th century , Americans drank four times as much milk as soda pop .
Today , the ratio is almost completely reversed , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Meanwhile , in the past 30 years the national obesity rate has more than doubled , and among teenagers , more than tripled , reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" Soda pop is a quintessential junk food , " said Michael Jacobson , who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest , which lobbies for government restrictions on foods it considers unhealthy .
" It 's just pure calories , and no nutrients .
It 's like a bomb in our diet . "
Jacobson said the CSPI is pushing to require obesity warning labels on the sides of soda cans , like the surgeon general 's warning on cigarettes .
While nutritionists are united in their dislike for nondiet soda , the " why " is controversial .
Some point a finger at high - fructose corn syrup , or HFCS , the sweetener used in most nondiet drinks .
Last month , researchers at Rutgers University said they 'd identified compounds in HFCS which may start a chemical chain reaction , leading to diabetes .
Most scientists , though , say there 's little difference between HFCS and simple sugar , either in chemistry or the way they 're handled by the body .
A bigger problem , doctors say , is simply the sheer number of calories .
You 'll find about 400 calories in a 32 - ounce " extra- large " Coke , a fast - food staple .
That 's nearly a quarter of what the average adult woman needs in a whole day .
Scientists also say the body does n't respond to liquid calories in the same way it would if those calories came in the form of French fries or chocolate cake .
Appetite is controlled by a complex mix of hormones .
Some signal the brain that your stomach is getting full .
Others , including a hormone known as ghrelin , signal it 's time to eat again .
If you eat a big burger , the level of ghrelin drops for a few hours .
That drop does n't happen if you drink a Big Gulp soda , even if it has more calories than the burger , according to Wayne Campbell , a professor in the Department of Foods and Nutrition at Purdue University .
" We 're finding your hunger does not go down as far when you consume a beverage , as when you consume a solid , " Campbell said .
The result : Even with 400 liquid calories in your stomach , you polish off the burger too .
Campbell cautioned that the ghrelin theory is n't proven and that other factors -- such as a food 's smell , or the sensation of chewing -- may affect appetite just as much , or even more .
Our expectations also play a role .
" Soup is the anomaly to the liquid calorie research , " he said .
" People perceive soup as a meal , unlike drinking a Coke .
So when we 've done these types of studies , but used soup as the liquid , we do n't see the same differences in [ appetite ] response . "
The sugar in soda pop not only provides a massive dose of calories , but triggers a vicious appetite cycle , said Ludwig , who wrote " Ending the Food Fight , " about healthy eating for children .
" It 's rapidly absorbed , which raises blood sugar and in effect causes the body to panic . "
The body releases insulin to break down the sugar , " but the body overcompensates , and blood sugar drops below the fasting level , " lower than it was in the first place .
Recognizing low blood sugar , the body releases ghrelin and other hormones , inducing hunger , inducing us to eat even more , Ludwig said .
The public is catching on , he said .
" In our obesity clinic , we used to routinely see patients coming in who were drinking four or five soft drinks a day .
Now it 's rare .
That seems to be the first factor that comes to mind , when people are trying to lose weight . "
Soft drink companies , under fire , are taking steps including a pledge last year to phase out nondiet soft drinks from America 's schools .
A progress report issued Monday by the American Beverage Association said that shipments to schools of sweetened soda are down 45 percent since 2004 , while shipments of bottled water are up 23 percent .
" There 's no question the changes that are happening in schools are a mirror of what 's happening in the larger marketplace , " said Susan Neely , the ABA 's president & CEO .
" Adults , like kids , are reaching for lower - calorie beverages .
...
As a consumer product company , we want to give consumers what they want . "
While fighting obesity is complicated , Ludwig said , the first step is clear .
" Giving up sugary soda for diet drinks , or water , will cause you to lose weight . "

And when is it that you moved to the L.A. area ?
I moved here when I was 16 years old .
Were you already thinking of a career at the age of 7 ?
Definitely .
Since I was about 7 or 8 I considered it as something I ’d want to do for the rest of my life .
It was something I got into it and I just knew it was where I was supposed to be .
When is it that you decided that you wanted to become an actress ?
I was about 7 years old , walking around in the mall and I was about to get pictures done for a pageant .
The photographer asked me , “ Have you ever considered being a model ? ” and I said , " No , but I would love it ! "
I loved taking pictures and it was later suggested that I try acting because I was very small and very outgoing , so then I started modeling , acting , and taking classes .
LAist.com spoke with Dani Miura , who played the role of the bait in several episodes , to get her opinion on the program and to discuss the extent of her involvement .
To Catch A Predator is one of the more intriguing shows to come around in past years , and certainly one that 's sparked its fair share of debates .
A group known as Perverted Justice goes into Internet chat rooms posing as young teens and engages in conversation with potential pedophiles .
After a while , the offer is made for the targets to come over and a meeting time is set .
Unbeknownst to the subjects , the person that they 're really meeting is an actor or actress , known as the bait , who brings them into the home where they are interviewed by NBC's Chris Hansen before being arrested .
The program has proven to be quite successful , both in the amount of arrests and in terms of ratings .
Was that a hard move for you and your family to make ?
Actually , I moved on my own with a guardian because my family works as emergency dispatchers and my father 's a police office , so their jobs could n't transfer .
And how is it that you got involved with " To Catch A Predator ? "
My manager knew that my family worked for 911 .
All of my dad 's brothers and sisters are police officers .
She knew that I 'm a pretty brave kid .
I love doing anything action packed that 's hands on .
Plus , I 'm active in charity .
She thought , " You love acting and helping people , so do you think you 'd like to audition for this ? " , and I was all for it .
She asked if I was scared , and I was n't , so after about an hour - long interview , where they learned all about my background , I was in .
What sort of audition was it ?
All I had to do was go in there and basically interview with them and they basically were trying to see how comfortable I was with the idea of being around actual pedophiles and actually working with the police .
They wanted to be sure that it was n't going to scare me and that I knew I 'd be protected .
And how old were you at the time ?
18 .
Did you go through any psychological preparations for the role ?
To a certain extent I did .
There were a lot of people in there I guess and you do n't really get to see all the people that will protect you if anything happens because they 're in a backroom or if you 're in the park and you do n't see where the police are waiting so it was kind of ... I get a little nervous but I pretty much knew I was protected the whole time so I pretty much went into in thinking , " Ok , this is a job .
This is acting .
Just improv it , do it well , and do n't let these guys get away . "
I wanted to do the best I could to get Chris Hansen an interview every time so I got closer than any other decoy ever has .
I think I got four hugs and you 're not really supposed to get that close , but they just happened to end up getting that close and I could n't walk away fast enough .
So all your lines were improvised when you met with the pedophiles ?
Yes .
Is that what you just called them , pedophiles or did you have a different term ?
Yeah , we pretty much just called them pedophiles .
Did you get to know the pedophiles ?
I got to talk to them a lot and got to know them pretty well by the time it was over .
They were talking about drugs and condoms and stuff while I 'm playing 11 year old .
All I could think was , " Wow , these guys are insane . "
Did you ever feel like you were in danger ?
Never .
Every single time a guy got close , the police were ready to pop out and strangle them , even if they just touched me .
I felt pretty fully protected and Chris Hansen was right there and I think he would have gone a little crazy had anything happened .
And when you were talking to the pedophiles , did you get to just learn more about the sort of people they were ?
About say their families or their jobs ?
Yea .
We caught a nickelodeon producer and a couple other really crazy guys with really good careers .
And what sort of things would you think about as this was going on or was it just very in the moment ?
It was just pretty in the moment .
I was trying not to think too much because if I did , I knew I 'd get freaked out .
What was your first day of work like ?
It was pretty much just sitting around and listening to conversations and basically getting to know the guys that would be coming the next day .
And were there any phrases they told you to avoid while you were talking to them ?
Not too much .
They did n't want me to use " Would you like a drink ? " too much since it was used so much in the other episodes .
Was there a lot of footage that was cut that audiences did n't get to see ?
Yea there was .
A lot of it's online , actually , at MSNB.com , but there was some pretty funny stuff where I 'd be talking on the phone to them and they'd have me trying to get him to come over .
There were a couple guys that said some pretty graphic things but were too scared to come over .
So Perverted Justice , the group that did all the arrangements , they 'd give the pedophiles a number to reach you at ?
They were the ones typing and they did everything .
I just pretty much sat there when it came to being on a webcam .
I just sat there and had to react and pretend like I was typing , but I never actually had to do typing or anything like that but I did have to talk on the phone .
And the pedophiles were on cam as well ?
Oh yea .
I saw plenty of gross stuff and I had to sit there and taking a bunch of pictures and stuff like that .
Is that something you eventually got used to ?
After a while , yea , you kind of get used to it , but they still had me reacting like I was completely grossed out .
Some of it was really , really disgusting , but eventually you just get used to it because you see it so often .
Before you got involved with this project , how did what you expect you would be doing compare to what you actually ended up doing ?
I did not realize that I would be 1 on 1 with these pedophiles .
I had never ever seen the show before and I also did n't realize how far away I was supposed to stay .
I thought I had to get closer and so I ended up being closer and having my face in more of the episodes than most of the decoys .
I 'm not sure if you still are studying to be a registered nurse , but did you feel like by being involved with this project , that you are performing a service for society ?
Definitely .
Yeah I definitely did .
The fact that it was a really good thing and I had a lot of people saying it was a really good thing was something I kept in my mind to keep me from freaking out .
Was there ever a time when you felt bad for the pedophiles ?
There were maybe one or two guys where I felt really bad because they seemed really sweet , but I had to remember that their conversations were pretty bad .
How do you feel like some people have criticized the show regarding entrapment ?
It makes me really mad because I know that perverted justice does a really , really good job of making sure they 're not trying to seduce anybody .
We just sit in a chat room , we say 11 , female , Long Beach , California and then see who pops up so when people accuse them of seducing these guys , it annoys me because I know it 's not true .
So you were in the room as they were talking with people in the actual chat rooms ?
Oh yeah .
It sounds like a lot more work than I first thought .
How many hours would you say you spent in total for this ?
I 'd say we spent 3 days and they were about 13 or 14 hour days .
After the pedophiles show up , you leave the room and then Chris Hansen comes in .
Where do you go when you leave the room ?
I just go back to the spot where all the computers are and where they 're typing with all these other guys or if there was another guy that shows up , they 'd send me around to get him to the front .
Did you ever make any mistakes ?
Yeah , there were some mix-ups .
I answered the door when they did n't realize that the guy , Dan , was supposed to answer the door , so it got really confusing .
" Oh , that person 's not here right now . "
We ended up still arresting the guy , but it was pretty funny .
What would be some of your blooper highlights ?
Well , the first guy I had , the earpiece came out of my ear .
It just dropped and I ended up just standing there while they kept telling me to go to position 2 , but I was still in position 1 .
Basically , I ended up getting a lot closer than I should have and I did n't know what I was doing since it was my first guy , but it ended up going well .
Were there times when it seemed like the pedophile was going to just leave and then it was you that kept them there ?
Yea .
There was one guy in particular I had to stand outside with for 40 minutes and talk him into walking into the house .
Talking to someone for 40 minutes is a long time .
What are some things that you would talk about ?
I would just basically say " You can walk around the house . " , " You can check it out . " , " There 's nothing going on and I can get any other guy to come in here . "
" If you do n't want to come in that 's fine . "
I 'd just be really like a bratty little kid pretty much .
After 40 minutes , did you just start talking about say television or sports ?
Well , we talked about some normal stuff but they were really just into just talking about sexual stuff and they asked me a couple times the way I wanted to do it and stuff like that so it was kind of awkward conversation .
When you go out in public do you ever start to suspect random people of being pedophiles ?
I get a little paranoid sometimes , especially when some of the guys walking around outside look like some of the guys we caught .
What did all of the pedophiles have in common ?
Pretty much every single one said that they were going to bring condoms and pretty much they all did .
There were a couple with weapons ; they brought guns or knives , which was kinda scary .
They all knew they had a problem and they all came in there knowing that .
A lot of them had even seen the show before and they still came .
Did they ever mention the show while talking to you ?
Oh yeah .
In half of the conversations , they would say " This is n't one of those To Catch A Predator shows is it ? " or " You 're not a police officer are you ? "
Did you watch the arrests as they were being made as well ?
Yes .
Over the monitors in the other room .
Did you ever see the officers use unnecessary force ?
I read about an incident where someone had a rubber chicken shoved in their face .
Did that actually happen ?
Not on my episode .
One guy got tazered , but that was it .
Was there any comedy on the set in general or did the set have a quiet , somber sort of tone ?
Oh no .
It was comedy the whole time .
We had a guy that was talking about anal sex with me so the whole entire time , they'd be joking and they 're like " Ooh Dani do you want some anal ? "
" Why do n't you go for that guy ? " and it was just joking around the whole time .
Did anyone say pull any pranks on the set ?
We tried to pull a prank for somebody 's birthday and it did n't work out very well but it was a try .
What 'd you do ?
We made it look like we had all left and were going to surprise them , but they saw us .
So what is Chris Hansen really like ?
He 's such a nice guy .
He 's really protective and he was just really all around nice and he just wants to help people pretty much .
You 're the only one of the bait with a website .
Is there a reason for that ?
Not really .
I already had website before it but I did n't need to take it down .
I know some people are nervous and they really try to hide their identities , but I did n't really feel unsafe so I just kept it up .
Do you ever get recognized on the street for your work on the show ?
Oh yeah .
I 've gotten a couple , which is pretty funny .
They 're like " Oh , you 're the pedophile girl . "
I read that you 're currently working on an album ?
Yes .
I 'm focusing a little more on the singing right now .
It 's also going to be a reality show ?
Yes , we filmed the first episode already and right now , we 're just waiting for more funding and publicity and stuff like that to go on before we keep filming .
And what company are you working for with this ?
J.J.P.Z .
What 's the reality show going to be like ?
It 's basically a bunch of teenagers and a couple 20 year olds .
We all have back stories and things that we have been through and fought really hard through and recovered from
It 's basically supposed to show teenagers that they can get through anything .
What are the things that you had to overcome ?
My main story is anorexia , but I also have lupus .
Lupus is an autoimmune disease .
It 's not really something people know a lot about .
It 's pretty hard to diagnose .
For the first couple years when I was undiagnosed it was difficult , but now it 's not quite so bad and I 'm not taking any steroids or anything like that .
Is there anything else you 're involved in ?
As of right now , not too much .
It 's mainly just been the singing .

A new bill proposed at the legislature would allow for police to withhold misconduct reports from the public .
Supporters of the bill believe that police misconduct should be kept secret from the public so to not discredit police testimony .
Others say that a forthright police unit is essential to the community .
In September , Jared Massey was zapped with a taser by Trooper John Gardner .
A video of the incident was recorded from Gardner ’s patrol car .
Gardner can be seen shocking Massey until he hits the ground while Massey ’s wife screams from the side of their SUV .
More than a million people watched the video on “ YouTube . ”
Massey was shocked to see his new found fame .
The footage may have never been seen had Massey not made a records request to obtain the tape .

昨年の５月以来、実に10ヵ月ぶりの更新となりました。Computer
Architecture Series 第三・第四巻の下準備を行っている間に、「鉱石ラジオ山」へ彷徨いこみ、ようやく下山してきたところなのです。
第三・第四巻は、かねてから私が書きたかったソフトウェアからハードウェアへの導入部を構成する作品ですが、教材として様々なデバイス(digital IC )が登場します。当然のことながら、これらのICを駆動するためには、電源をはじめとして、抵抗やコンデンサ(受動素子)が必要になる訳ですが、恥ずかしながら電気音痴の私には、デバイスの制御はできても、回路中に現れる受動素子の意味が掴めません。
これまで、ありとあらゆる電気工学書を買い揃えて来ましたが、どの書を読んでも私の疑問が晴れることはありませんでした。
きっと自分には、電気のセンスが欠落しているのだ
シミュレーティングで学ぶアナログ＆ディジタルフィルタ入門
このような自虐の念に捕われ続けていたある日、小野浩司氏による「シミュレーティングで学ぶアナログ＆ディジタルフィルタ入門」という本に出会います。本書は、マイクロネット社のサーキットビューア
( 体験版電子回路シミュレータ)を用いながら、フィルタ理論の基本を丁寧に解説し、応用編として
TI 社 DSP スターターキットのプログラミングを取り上げています。
内容は独創的であり、かつ構成に工夫が凝らされており、フィルタ理論入門書の最高傑作だと私は思いますが、残念なことに既に絶版となっています(初版は1999年 ) 。
この書籍をきっかけとして、それまで私の頭の中で点在していた知識が、線となり、面をなし、結びつき始めます。やがて、交流回路理論学習のために最も優れた教材は、鉱石ラジオではないかと考えるようになりました。
ぼくらの鉱石ラジ オ
鉱石ラジオ。この言葉には、21世紀の現代においても、どこかしら懐かしさと少年の心を思い出させてくれる響きがあります。その昔、ゲルマニウムラジオのキットを組み立てた子供達は、年を重ね大人となり、今再び電子ブロックや鉱石ラジオ、真空管ラジオのキットを手にしていることでしょう。
実は私もその一人なのですが、完成したゲルマニウムラジオにセラミックイヤフォンを接続し、" カサカサした " ラジオの声を耳にしても不思議と感動がありません。「オジサンと化した今、感動する心まで失ってしまったのか・・」と、随分落ち込んだものです。
そんな折り、本屋の工学書コーナーで不思議な装丁の本に出会います。小林健二氏による「ぼくらの鉱石ラジオ」と題する筑摩書房発刊の書籍です。「こころのなかの少年少女たちへ」というメッセージが付された黄色い帯には、「空中にただようメッセージを、自作のごく簡単な回路によってキャッチする。かって少年たちを科学の不思議と夢に誘った、鉱石ラジオの魅力とその全貌」と書かれています。
カバーを外すと、黄色の台紙にライトブルーで
" THOSE CRYSTAL SETS OF OUR YOUTH " と刻まれ、中心には美しく幻想的な結晶の写真が配されています。このような、上質かつ暖かい雰囲気を持った装丁は、技術書には縁遠いものですし、「なぜ鉱石ラジオの専門書が筑摩書房から出版されたのか？」、私は内容よりも先にこの点が気になりました。
あとがきに書かれていますが、実は本書の企画は筑摩書房の磯部知子氏が小林氏に提案し、４年の歳月をかけて完成しているのです。初版は1997年であり、私が購入したものは既に12刷を数えていますので、この手の書籍としてはベストセラーと言えるでしょう(もちろん現在も販売中)。逆に言えば、もしも本書が従来の工学系出版社から出版されていれば、遥か以前に絶版となっていたはずです。幸せな本だと思います。
「 ぼくらの鉱石ラジオ」の内容については、ここで私が解説するよりは、実際に自分の手に取ってご覧になるほうが良いでしょう。美しい写真や図譜が全体に散りばめられ、さながら大人のオモチャ箱のようです。その昔、電子キットを組み立てた経験をお持ちの方であれば、「この本は、一生自分の手元に置いておきたい」と思われるに違いありません。
実際、本書が持つ普遍的内容は、50年後・100年後の世代にも通用し、また感謝されることでしょう。
ちなみに、本書の企画編集に携わった磯部知子氏は、その後「金持ち父さん貧乏父さん」の編集にも立ち会われています。磯部氏、ただ者ではありません。同氏による金持ち父さん貧乏父さんへの編集者コメントは、こちら。
ところで、私は現在、企画 , 執筆 , 校正から装丁に至るまですべて自前でこなしているのですが、磯部氏のような方に編集して頂くと、Computer
Architecture Series は果たしてどのような作品になるのでしょうか。
IN TUNE WITH THE INFINITE
ぼくらの鉱石ラジオで、私が最も心を引かれた箇所は、「はじめに」で引用されている一枚の絵でした。" IN TUNE WITH THE INFINITE " と題する絵には、月光を浴びながら鉱石ラジオに聞き入る少年の姿が描かれています。若々しく伸びた背筋と遥か彼方を見据える視線、遠来する電波と月の光を迎え入れるかのように、そっと広げられた両手が印象的です。
184ページには、この絵に関する出自が記載されています。オリジナルは、1922年に発行された
Judge という雑誌に掲載されたものであり、日本では1925年に発刊された「無線電話之研究
( 安藤博 ) 」中において「無線研究家の面影」と改題して紹介されたそうです。
私も、情緒豊かなこの絵が一目で気に入り、原典を求めてネット上を探し回りました。しばらくして、運良く「無線電話之研究」の古書出品に出会うことができたのですが、確かにその冒頭でこの絵が引用されています。絵の下には、安藤博士の次のような言葉が添えられていました。

こうなると、 「調べ物屋」の血が騒ぎ、原典を見ずにはおれません。調べてみると
Judge は、アメリカで出版されていたイラストを中心とした雑誌であり、当時のアメリカ文化が美しい絵で綴られているために、現在でもファンが多いようです。eBay にも Judge は多数出品されていますが、目的の雑誌が出品されるのは望み薄。そこで、雑誌専門の古本屋を google で検索し、問い合わせたところ、幸いにも在庫あり。もちろん、即注文。
丁寧かつ厳重な梱包で届けられた雑誌には、PUBLIC

のエンボスが押印してあり、80年以上の歳月を全く感じさせないほど状態の良いものでした。
4月22日号は、タイトルにある通り、ラジオ特集。ラジオにまつわる様々なイラストや、小話が収められています。ほぼA4サイズで30ページ余りの薄い冊子ですが、この中央ページに
IN TUNE WITH THE INFINITE はホッチキスで綴じ込まれていました 。
ぼくらの鉱石ラジオでは、絵は全て白黒で印刷されていますが、Judge 上では小屋の窓と少年の足もとに落ちる部屋の明かりに、赤インクが添えられています(クリックにて拡大)。絵の右下には、WALTER DE MARIS という作家のサイン 。
それにしても、なんて素敵な絵・・。何度見ても飽きることがありません。夜のとばり、近くに迫る山肌、足下の草むら、小屋の質感、暖かみを帯びた屋内光と月光の対比。ペン先一本で、よくぞここまで表現できるものだと、素人ながら感心することしきりなのですが、よく考えてみると少年が装着しているヘッドフォンは不思議です。
鉱石ラジオの微弱な出力では、私達が現在使っているヘッドフォンを直接駆動することはできません。実は、少年が身につけている両耳式のヘッドフォンは、ハイインピーダンス・ヘッドフォンと呼ばれる特殊なものなのです。
後ほど訪れる、半世紀以上昔のハイインピーダンス・ヘッドフォンとの出会いが、素晴らしい旅のはじまりとなります。

Arcからの挑戦
Arc をリリースしてから2、3日経ったので、もうみなさんとも、それを耳にして何かしらの意見を持ってくれたように思う。
今のところは、評判がどうというほどでもなく、なんかウェブにでてきたみたいだねといった程度だ。
なにしろまだ日が浅いので 、 Arc でプログラムした経験談といった高級なものは望むべくもないのだが、私はそれを楽しみに待っている。
それでも、的を射た反応もあった。意義をいくらかでも理解してくれている人たちからの、ファースト・インプレッションだ。
どうやら、これらには特徴的なパターンがあることに気づいた。
Arc についての主たる批判は、書くのに苦労していたわりには大したことないじゃんということだった。
Ron Garret 曰く :
そして Arc について主な不満 : 作るのにずいぶんかかったうえ、あんなに高い目標を立てていたわりには、
まるで、言語デザインの難問に向かってパントしたようにしか見えない.
いつもなら、批判主義にまともに反駁しようとは思わない。反駁は、書くのは楽しいが、読んでもつまらないものだ。
ただ今回の場合はあえてそうしよう、というのも、Ron やその賛同者たちは 啓発的な間違いをしてくれているからだ。
説明しよう。それとともに、言語デザインについて重要なことがいくつか明らかになるはずだ。
Ron は正しい。私は、どの機能を作るかを選ぶときに、それにどのくらい苦労するか、では選ばなかった。
かわりに、私が使うのは、もっとこう、俗っぽいテストだ:それでプログラムを短くできるか。
どうしてそうするかって ?
なぜなら、プログラムを短くするために高級言語はあるからだ。
プログラミング言語のパワーは、それで書かれるプログラムの長さに反比例する。
100%確実にそうだとまでは言わないが、マジでそんな感じだ。
もし誰かがこういったとしよう。馬鹿げたことだと思わないかな。
「そのプログラム、君の言語だとコードは10行で、俺の言語だと50行だけど、俺の言語はパワフルだぜ」
こう思わざるをえない : じゃあ、あんたの言うパワーってなんなのよ?
私も、プログラミング言語を測るのに基準となるのはパワーだけなどというつもりはない。
他にも正当な目標はある。例えば、言語をデザインするにあたって、子どもにも学びやすいようにするとか、
効率的なコンパイルをするとか(これは昔ほどには大切でなくなってきているが ) 、
グループのダメプログラマが何かやらかしても滅多なことにはならないようにするとか。
そういった特別な目的のためにデザインされた言語は別としても、パワーは言語のテストである。
実装が難しいことよりも、プログラムが短くなることを選ぶということは、こうも言える:
仕事は、自分にとってのコストではなく、ユーザにとっての価値に基づいて決める。
これこそはまさに、デザインの正しい優先順位である。これはプログラミング言語に限らず、誰かに使ってもらうために作るものなら何でもそうだ。
といって、私がやったことはひとつも難しくなかったというのではない。いくつかは私には難しく思えた。
それでも言語デザインにおいて、問題を解くというのは、難しいにせよ易しいにせよ、終着点ではない。よい言語を作ることこそだ。
Arc にとっての本当のテスト -- そしてあらゆる汎用目的の高級言語にとってのテスト -- は、
機能 x があるとか 問題 y を解けるとかではなく、それでプログラムの長さがどうなるかなのだ。
プログラムを短くするといっても、ユーザが実際に書く必要があるものを短くしなくては。
私が Arc を作るときの手口は、それでアプリケーションを書いて、プログラムを一行一行たどることで、
プログラムを短くできるような言語の機能をひねりだすことだった。そして機能を実装しては、それを使ってプログラムを書き直す、その繰り返し。
これは Hacker Newsのソースにあるコメントだ。たまに記録をつけるようにしているのだ。
; results of ( codetree " news.arc " ) : ; 8787 , 8760 , 8738 , 8726 , 8823 , 8755 , 8703 , 8628 , 8587 , 8565 ; 8633 , 8573 , 8552 , 8520 , 8510 , 8498 , 8549 , 8515 , 8684 , 9025 ; 9573 , 12196 , 12469 , 12648 , 12373
( 数字がときどき増えるのは、私 が News に機能を追加したためだ。 )
これが 、Arc自身のソースコードがこんなに短いことの理由のひとつだ。自然とそうなった。さっきのと同じことをやったのだ。
ただ、一番優先していたのは、アプリケーションを短くすることで、言語を短くすることではない。
よさそうな機能として、最も顕著だったのは
Prolog スタイルのパターンマッチングだ。
相当短くなるので有望に思えたが、結局、便利なのは
2、3の基本的な順列操作( append , remove など ) を書くときだけだった 。
Prolog は append を書くには素晴らしい言語だ ; あとは落ちる一方だ 。
Arcを書くうえでのもうひとつの目標は、 McCarthy がはじめた流儀を可能なかぎり継承することだった。
彼は 1960 年の原著論文で 、Lisp を作るのに、 " 公理 " ( carやcdrやcons ) からはじめて、 " 定理 " ( assoc や mapcar ) へと積み上げるようにし た 。 [ 1 ]
どこかに、完全な言語に通ずる、最適な道があるに違いない。それはなんだ?
McCarthy の論文は大成功とまではいえないだろう。 その後、言語は彼の院生の手に託されたが、その院生は
IBM 704 上で走るインタプリタを作ることに囚われて、
McCarthy の公理的アプローチを続けなかった。
それからというもの、我々は彼らのその場しのぎにつきあわされている。
Steele と Sussman は、 Scheme の研究当初は初心に戻ろうとしていたので、実質的にそれが唯一の試みだったといえる。
そして彼らは、少なくと も 簡潔さ/パワーの観点からは深刻な過ちをいくつか、早いうちに犯してしまった。
これは、開拓する価値がある領域に思える。
それで、私は、公理で下から攻め、実世界のアプリケーションが求める簡潔さで上から攻めることで、最適なオペレータのコアを作り出すことができるだろうと考えたのだ。
いまだ道半ばだが、ゴールははっきりしている。 : ごく少ない公理からはじめて、日常で使う完全な言語につながるような、最適な道を見出すことだ。
私は効率性のために妥協をして、チャーチ数を使わないことにした。[ 2 ]
私は 1960 年の原著論文の精神をできるかぎり崩さぬように努めた。
公理から言語へ積み上げていくこと自体が目的なのではない。それが最大限の表現力を得る方法だと考えているから、そうしているだけだ。
いまのとこ ろ Arc は上手くいっているだろうか ?
プログラムは、他の言語でやるよりも短くなるだろうか?
測ってみよう。
単純な問題を、挑戦として示すことにしよう。そして、ポピュラーな言語での解答を集めて、その長さを比べてみるつもりだ。
次のようなプログラムを書け。 URL said ( 例え ば http://localhost:port/said )は、入力フィールドひとつと、送信ボタンひとつのページを生成する。
送信ボタンが押されたら、2番めのページとして、" click here . "
と書かれたリンクひとつのページを生成する。
それがクリックされたら、3番めのページとして、" you said : ... " と書かれたページにいく。 ここで ...
は、さっきの入力フィールドにユーザがタイプしたものだ。
ただし、3番めのページは、ユーザが実際にタイプしたものだけを表示すること。
つまり、入力フィールドの値を URL
で渡してはいけない。そうしないと、最後のページの動作をURLで変えるようなことができてしまう。
単純だし、このようなテストに求められるように、これは例として不自然ではない。
Webアプリは、このようなことをいつもやっているのだ。あるいは、何か難解なライブラリ( Arcにあって他の言語にはないような)に頼るわけでもない。Webアプリを書くのに使われる言語なら当然もっているものだけでいい。
これが Arc の答えだ :
( defop said req ( aform [ w / link ( pr " you said : " ( arg _ " foo " ) ) ( pr " click here " ) ] ( input " foo " ) ( submit ) ) )
もし Arc になじみがなければ、私のいうことを信じてもらうほかないが、これはコード上のトリックで圧縮したわけではない。
これが Arc で書くには標準的な書きかたなのだ 。
プログラムの長さについて、もっとも意味のあるテストは、行数や文字数ではなく、コードツリー(ソースを表現するのに必要になる木)のサイズだ。
Arcの例のコードツリーは、23ノード：15の葉/字句 + 8内部ノードだ。あなたのお気に入りの言語だとどのくらいの長さになる?
( 標準ライブラリをインポートするコードは数えない、もちろん。それらはすでに読み込まれているものとしてよい)
この問題 を Arc フォーラム に投稿し た
。http://arclanguage.org/item?id=722
もしまだ出ていない言語での解や、あるいは出ている言語でも、より短いとか、より正しい解があれば、追加してほしい。言語を、Arcとだけでなくお互いに比べあうと面白いだろう。

It was the most traumatic experience the Smoak family of North Carolina has ever had , and it happened yesterday afternoon as they traveled through Cookeville on their way home from a vacation in Nashville .
Before their ordeal was over , three members of the family had been yanked out of their car and handcuffed on the side of Interstate 40 in downtown Cookeville , and their beloved dog , Patton , had been shot to death by a police officer as they watched .
What was their crime ?
There was no crime .
But a passerby with a cell phone apparently assumed a crime had occurred when a wallet flew from a car on Interstate 40 near Nashville .
That citizen called police and inadvertently set in motion what would make it the most horrible vacation the James Smoak family of Saluda , North Carolina , has ever had .
Today , the Smoak children and their parents were still weeping over what happened to them in Cookeville .
By today , they had also filed complaints with two police agencies , prompting internal investigations , they had met with Tennessee Highway Patrol Capt .
Randy Hoover , and they were on their way to talk to Cookeville Mayor Charles Womack .
Because official internal investigations are underway at the Tennessee Highway Patrol and at the Cookeville Police Dept. , the Herald - Citizen was unable to get details of those two agencies ' accounts of the incident .
But the Smoak family willingly told their story to anyone who would listen ; they hope by doing so that something might be done to prevent it from happening to another family .
James Smoak , 38 , who was traveling in the family station wagon with his wife , Pamela , their 17 - year - old son , Brandon , and the family 's two pet bulldogs , Patton and Cassie , had lost his wallet after stopping for gas as they left Davidson County on Wednesday afternoon .
But he did n't know he lost it .
Apparently , he had placed it on top of the car while pumping gas , and it flew off somewhere on the highway a short time later .
Not knowing his wallet was lost , he and his family traveled on , heading east on their way home to North Carolina .
A few cars behind James and Pamela 's station wagon , his parents and the two younger Smoak children were traveling in the elder Smoak 's car .
Just a few miles east of Cookeville , James Smoak began to notice that a THP squad car was following him , though the officer was not pulling him over , just staying behind him , changing lanes any time Smoak did , moving in and out of traffic each time Smoak did .
" It was obvious he was looking at me , not at other vehicles , and I 'm thinking I must have done something ( in my driving ) , but I do n't know what , " Smoak said today .
When Smoak reached the 287 exit area in Cookeville , three other police cars suddenly appeared , and the trooper then turned on blue lights and pulled the Smoak car over .
" I immediately pulled to the side , and expecting him to come to the window , I started reaching for my wallet to get my license and it was not there , " Smoak said .
About that time , he heard the officer broadcast orders over a bullhorn , telling him to toss the keys out the car window and get out with his hands up and walk backwards to the rear of the car .
Still not knowing what he was being stopped for , Smoak obeyed , and when he reached the back of the car , with a gun pointed at Smoak , the trooper ordered him to get on his knees , face the back of the car and put his head down .
When he did that , the officer handcuffed him and placed him in the patrol car .
Then the same orders were blared over the bullhorn to " passenger " and Pamela Smoak got out with her hands up , was ordered to the ground , held at gunpoint , and handcuffed .
Next , Brandon was ordered out and handcuffed in the same way .
Terrified at what was happening to them for no reason they knew , the family was also immediately concerned about their two pet dogs being left in the car there on the highway with the car doors open .
" We kept asking the officers -- there were several officers by now -- to close the car doors because of our dogs , but they did n't do it , " said Pamela Smoak .
And as the officers worked in the late evening darkness , their weapons drawn as the Smoaks were being handcuffed , the dog Patton came out of the car and headed toward one of the Cookeville Police officers who was assisting the THP .
" That officer had a flashlight on his shotgun , and the dog was going toward that light and the officer shot him , just blew his head off , " said Pamela Smoak .
" We had begged them to shut the car doors so our dogs would n't get out , and they did n't do that . "
As the dog was heading out of the car toward the officer , " we had yelled , begging them to let us get him , but the officer shot him , " she said .
Grieving for their dog and in shock over their apparent arrest for some unknown crime , the family could only wait .
At one point , one state trooper did tell them they " matched the description " in a robbery that had occurred in Davidson County , Pamela Smoak said .
The ordeal went on for a time after that , the family terrified and in grief over the dog .
Finally , after a time , someone in authority figured out that the officers here had stopped and were holding the very family that someone in Davidson County had assumed had been robbed , though how that assumption grew to the authorization for a felony stop , James Smoak cannot understand , he said today .
" Finally , they asked me my name and I told them my name , date of birth , and other information , and they talked by radio to someone in Davidson County and finally realized that a mistake had been made , " he said .
" A lady in Davidson County had seen that wallet fly off our car and had seen money coming out of it and going all over the road , and somehow that became a felony and they made a felony stop , but no robbery or felony had happened , " Pamela Smoak said .
" Apparently , they had listened to some citizen with a cell phone and let her play detective down there , " said James Smoak .
" Here we are just a family on vacation , and we had to suffer this . "
When the officers did discover the mistake , " they said , ' Okay , we 're releasing you and we 're sorry , ' " Smoak said .
As soon as Brandon was released from the handcuffs , he rushed over to the dead dog and began to cry , Smoak said .
And that 's when one of the most infuriating parts of the ordeal happened , according to James Smoak .
" I saw one of the THP officers walk over to the city officer who had shot the dog and grin , " he said .
He reported that to the supervising officer , THP Lt. Jerry Andrews , and Andrews " was very nice , very professional , " Smoak said .
" He told me the officer was not laughing , but I know he was , " said Smoak .
Smoak 's parents had come along behind the other car and had seen all the commotion and stopped too , and now all three children were crying over their pet dog , as they were still doing today .
The Smoaks gathered the body of their pet and went to a motel here to spend the night .
But they did n't get much rest , and at one point , James Smoak became so upset he had to go to the hospital for medical treatment .
They also worked throughout last night to contact all the authorities they could in order to lodge their complaints about what had happened .
Today , Beth Womack , a THP spokesperson in Nashville , told the H- C that an Internal Affairs investigation is underway and that every effort will be made to " find out exactly what happened and why . "
" As I understand it , a report was made in Davidson County to our officers that this car had been seen leaving at a high rate of speed and that a significant amount of money had come out of the car and someone became suspicious , " she said .
An internal investigation is also underway at the Cookeville Police Dept. , Capt .
Nathan Honeycutt told the H -C today .
James Smoak wonders about the logic of " a robber who would be tossing the money out of the car . "
He also wonders about police procedure that would " take this insinuation from a citizen " and " turn it into what happened to us . "
" Out there after they handcuffed us at gunpoint and put us in the police cars , they did not ask for ID , and later on , they actually released us just on my word about my identity , with only the confirmation by radio from an officer in Davidson County who was looking at my lost wallet and the ID in it down there , " he said .
" What if I actually had been a robber and not just a family man on vacation ? "
His children hope they never come to Tennessee for another vacation .
" Poor Patton , " said 13 - year - old Jeb Smoak .
" When he was killed out there , it was the first time I ever saw my brother , Brandon , cry .
Brandon is the toughest person I 've ever met , and he cried . "
The other dog , a puppy named Cassie , was " trembling all over " after the ordeal , Jeb Smoak said .
" She 's being real quiet today .
She knows we 're all grieving . "
James Smoak , though still deeply upset today , said he understands that " the officer will say the dog was coming after him . "
But it could all have been prevented , did n't have to happen , he is convinced .
In addition to telling his family 's story to Capt .
Randy Hoover , who " was very nice and very professional , " and to a Cookeville Police official last night and to Mayor Womack today , Smoak also plans to tell his lawyer , he said .
" And I also want to tell it to the Tennessee Department of Tourism , " he said .

This is awesome .
At a recent Ohio rally , John McCain was introduced by right - wing radio nutjob Bill Cunningham .
Cunningham spent his introduction slamming Obama , repeatedly referring to him “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and calling him a “ hack , Chicago - style , Daley politician . ”
He made reference to “ CBS the Clinton Broadcasting System , NBC the Nobody But Clinton network , the All Bill Clinton channel ABC , and the Clinton News Network . ”
The nutjobbery was bad enough that McCain immediately approached reporters after the event and denounced Cunningham ’s comments .
His statement :
“ I have repeatedly stated my respect for Sen. Obama and Sen. Clinton , that I will treat them with respect …
I want to disassociate myself with any disparaging remarks that may have been said about them …
I did not set up the program but I take full responsibility . ”
Guess who did n’t like that ?
Bill Cunningham .
On his radio show , he went after the man he just introduced :
“ He just threw me under the bus for the national media .
I have had it …
I ’m going to endorse Hillary Clinton .
I want Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States .
I am going to throw my support behind Hillary Clinton . ”
Ha !
Hahaha .
Now Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , and others are piling on McCain because of the incident .
Let ’s make it a movement , folks !
You know how McCain was supposed to use this period — the couple months after he sewed up the nomination while the Democrats were still slugging it out — to solidify his support among the conservative base and the conservative elites who hate him ?
Not. Happening .

Sharpton :
We 're not going to let the clock be turned back in America in Jena , Louisiana David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Wednesday September 19 , 2007
Print This Email This Rev. Al Sharpton appeared on CNN's Newsroom to discuss the racial tension that has burst to the surface in Jena , Louisiana surrounding the conviction of Mychal Bell , one of the group of black high school students now known as the Jena Six , whom were arrested after the beating of a white student .
Racial tensions had been plaguing the high school campus after nooses were found hung from a tree months before the incident .
" The tree had been a gathering spot for white students , " the Associated Press reports .
" The nooses were found after a black student asked school officials if blacks could sit there too . "
While the school suspended three white students over the nooses , there were no charges filed .
" Bell and four others originally faced trial as adults on attempted second - degree murder charges in connection with a December attack that left white classmate Justin Barker bloodied and unconscious , " the AP report continues .
" Another teen was booked as a juvenile and charges have not been make public . "
Sharpton and other activists have planned a series of rallies in Jena to raise awareness about what they view to be unfair prosecutorial standards .
" This march and rally tomorrow is very neccesary , " Sharpton said , " because despite the outpouring , despite presidential candidates weighing in , this local prosecutor is almost like out of the history books , and we really need to show the nation and the world that we 're not going to let the clock be turned back in America in Jena , Louisiana . "
Shapton also weighed in on the Confederate flag recently hung outside a Jena home .
" It sends more of a message of racism and hate than anything we 're coming with , " said Sharpton .
" We 're asking for equal protection under the law ... we 're asking the prosecutor to be even handed ... they 're saying more to the nation about Jena than we can ever say . "
Video from CNN 's Newsroom , broadcast on September 19 :
In the following video , Jesse Jackson arrives in Jena , LA , and prepares to march on behalf of the " Jena 6 . "

From 1964 , what might well be the very first example of computer - generated pr0n .
“ James Pyle and his Assistant Nonna Wells , ” says the cutline .
Here 's the dope :
“ A computer fed information by engineers at Los Angeles took only 1.2 second this week ( sic ) to come up with what was described as Miss Formula , the girl with everything .
Her dimensions : height , 5 feet , 6 inches ; weight , 115 - 118 pounds and measurements , 36 - 24-36 . ”
And a caesarian scar that suggests she gave birth to an alien face - hugger , apparently .
By “ fed information ” one suspects they mean “ manually operated the graphing pen . ”
Mr. Pyle appears to be contemplating the possibilities the future holds ; he certainly has an expression commensurate with the gravity of the event .
The date - July 30 , 1964 - should possibly be set aside as a Computer Nerd Holiday .
I 'll bring the cake .
The Sacramento area has a fast - growing Russian / Slavic immigrant community , the vast majority of which is Christian fundamentalist , and often aggressively so .
In the past two years , conflicts have erupted at local high schools where designated days of silence to support gay people have been met with homophobic protest from this fundamentalist Christian immigrant community .
Given this recent history , what happened Sunday was just a matter of time :
On Tuesday , Sacramento County sheriff 's homicide detectives assumed control of an investigation into the assault , which apparently stemmed from a daylong verbal dispute between two groups ... ... " If , through the course of the investigation , it is determined that the motivation was race or sexual preference , obviously hate crime charges will be added , " [ Sheriff 's spokesman ] Curran said .
He confirmed , however , that state parks investigators reported to sheriff 's officials that racial and homophobic slurs had been used against Singh and his friends .
Singh had been with six people -- all of Indian or Fijian descent -- at the picnic area near Lake Natoma on Sunday afternoon when trouble began brewing with another group partying nearby , said two friends who were there that day .
The Bee is not identifying the friends because they fear retribution .
The two friends said the other group -- identified by the witnesses and sheriff 's officials as being of Russian descent -- called Singh and his friends racial and homophobic names .
Friends said Singh is not gay , but they believe he was singled out because he did not have a date that afternoon ... ... Though initially knocked unconscious by the impact , Singh regained consciousness at the park but had difficulty breathing .
His condition worsened , and he again lost consciousness that night .
By Tuesday , he was not expected to survive .
I will update if I hear confirmation that Singh has been taken off life support .
Happy Fourth of July .
UPDATE : Some non-Sacramentan readers might understandably need the context for my implied assertion that these Russian assailants are likely linked to Sacramento 's fundamentalist Russian immigrant community .
With help from ChapiNation386 , here 's some context :
Militant Slavic Christians threaten progress on gay rights in California
LA Times : For Gays , a Loud New Foe
The Political Coming - Out of Sacramento's Slavic Community
No one has yet been arrested or charged , so a note of caution should prevail until more facts are in .
UPDATE II : According to a local TV news story , Singh was openly gay .
He was also standing up for his friends when he was attacked .
Attention Republicans :
An entire division of the party is faltering .
Has anybody noticed ?
You probably heard the news about Rush Limbaugh ’s “ pledge ” to raise funds for Hillary ( apparently some of the best and brightest missed both the radio show , AND the banner at his website that read “ Keep Her In It So We Can Win It ” ) .
And maybe you saw Ann Coulter explaining on the Fox Newschannel last week how Mrs. Clinton is “ more conservative ” than John McCain .
But did you hear the news about the influential conservative who wo n’t be voting at all in this year ’s presidential election ?
His choice to “ not vote ” could potentially signal hundreds of thousands of Americans to do likewise - - and this could be great news for the Democratic Party .
Dr. James Dobson , the most influential Evangelical Christian in America when it comes to politics and public policy matters , last week declared that if John McCain is the Republican Party ’s nominee for President , then he simply wo n’t vote at all in the presidential race .
This is a striking announcement from a man who has spent over a quarter of a century getting people to engage in the political process , and encouraging them to let their voices be heard .
Back in 1977 when Dr. Dobson first began his non-profit “ Focus On The Family ” organization , the American political landscape was radically different than it is today , especially as it regarded conservative Christian Americans .
Those who would now be quickly identified as “ social conservatives ” by both pundits and candidates alike , were often ignored back in the day .
This was in no small part because the religious social conservatives of previous generations often chose themselves to ignore politics , and to simply not participate in such “ secular ” endeavors .
In fact , for much of the last century , voting in elections was simply not a priority for many Conservative Christian Americans , and thus , they had very little influence over the direction of American politics .
But the 1970 ’s saw an awakening of this segment of the population .
In the aftermath of the 60’s youth rebellion that challenged America ’s cultural foundations , a handful of thoughtful Americans ( many of them clergymen ) began to wake - up .
Their collective realization ?
If Conservative Christians abandon the main power structures of the culture , the culture quickly becomes something less that hospitable to Conservative Christians - - and thus , they should get informed , and vote .
Pat Robertson was a part of this team .
So was Jerry Falwell .
And so was Dr. Dobson .
While this movement began to take hold among the American population generally , the American Presidents began to take notice .
Without making an overt connection to religious communities , President Nixon recognized that there was a “ silent majority ” in America that rejected the rebellion of the 60’s , and wanted their government to affirm the nation ’s historic , “ traditional values . ”
President Gerald Ford was perhaps even more observant of this “ new ” movement .
While no social conservative himself ( this did n’t much matter , given that he never had a chance to drive a legislative agenda during his brief time in office anyway ) , Ford nonetheless met with Conservative Christian leaders at the White House , and attended events like the National Religious Broadcasters ’ Convention .
President Jimmy Carter harnessed the momentum of the “ new voters ” being produced by the “ new movement , ” and got many of them to vote for him in 1976 .
And he tried to keep these “ new voters ” in the Democratic fold during his re-election campaign of 1980 .
But then there was Ronald Reagan .
A former California Governor who was tutored in the philosophies of Barry Goldwater , Reagan rightly surmised that the social concerns among America ’s Conservative Christians entailed plenty of common ground with the interests of “ other ” conservatives - - those primarily concerned about limited government and the nation ’s economy , and those concerned about national defense issues .
Reagan brought these three categories of voters together to form a “ coalition , ” and the Republican Party has existed with this arrangement ever since .
Now in the year 2008 , after nearly thirty years of the “ Reagan Coalition , “ the most influential leader among Conservative Christians wo n’t be casting a vote for President .
I say this with such certainty , because McCain will most certainly be the Republican nominee , and Dobson is most certainly a man of his word .
And to be clear , Dobson is n’t recommending that anybody else should abstain from voting .
But there will be plenty of Americans who follow in his footsteps , whether he recommends it or not .
After decades of great accomplishments ( and advocating for public policy is only a part of what the Focus On The Family organization does ) , it ’s sad to think that Dr. Dobson could , however inadvertently , lead Conservative Christians back to “ not voting ” - - a pattern of behavior from which he rescued them in the 1970’s .
This could lead to an Obama presidency , or another four years of the Clintons in the White House .
And what if McCain wins the presidency without the Conservative Christian Vote ?
Surely the social conservative movement would lose influence in such a scenario .
Let ’s stay engaged .
Let ’s vote .
Let ’s not go back to the 1970’s .

Clutching the bars at his prison , Sayed Pervez Kambaksh recalls how his life unravelled .
" There was no question of me getting a lawyer to represent me in the case ; in fact I was not even able to speak on my own defence . "
The 23 - year - old student , whose death sentence for downloading a report on women 's rights from the internet has become an international cause célèbre , was speaking to The Independent at his jail in Mazar - i- Sharif – the first time the outside world has heard his own account of his shattering experience .
In a voice soft , somewhat hesitant , he said : " The judges had made up their mind about the case without me .
The way they talked to me , looked at me , was the way they look at a condemned man .
I wanted to say ' this is wrong , please listen to me ' , but I was given no chance to explain . "
For Mr Kambaksh the four - minute hearing has led to four months of incarceration , sharing a 10 by 12 metre cell with 34 others -- murderers , robbers and terrorists – and having the threat of execution constantly hanging over him .
His fate appeared sealed when the Afghan senate passed a motion , proposed by Sibghatullkah Mojeddeid , a key ally of the President Hamid Karzai , confirming the death sentence , although this was later withdrawn after domestic and international protests .

I spoke to Mr Kambaksh at Balkh prison , under the watchful eyes of the warders in their olive green Russian - era uniforms .
Here 360 prisoners are packed into a facility for 200 , in conditions even the Afghan prison authorities acknowledge are " unacceptable " .
The inmates , who include 22 women , many convicted of deserting their husbands and adultery , sit around with the forlorn demeanour of those caught up in a vast bureaucratic system with little chance of an early exit .
Since
The Independent exposed the case of Mr Kambaksh , eminent public figures such as the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice . and Britain 's Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , have lobbied Mr Karzai to reprieve him .
A petition launched by this newspaper calling for justice for Mr Kambaksh has gathered nearly 90,000 signatures .
Standing outside his cell , Mr Kambaksh looked pale and tired , hunched into his brown leather jacket over a dusty white shalwar kameez against the cold , cutting wind of the northern mountains .
He had , in the past , been attacked by fundamentalist prisoners at the instigation of a guard who had said he was a heretic , but the intimidation has tailed off in recent weeks .
" I am very thankful for what The Independent has done and the publicity in this case .
Most of my fellow prisoners know now that I had not done anything so terrible to deserve this , and they have supported me .
Some of the guards have also been kind .
" There are still some extremists who insult me , but I am afraid they are the kind who will not change their minds . "
Mr Kambaksh's ordeal began in mid- October after the downloading of the document about Islam and women 's rights from an Iranian website .
He was questioned first by some teachers of religion from the university where he is a student of journalism .
" They said that some other students had said that I had written the article myself .
Of course I denied this , I also asked them who these other students were , but they would not give me the names .
They have since repeated these accusations , but they have never told me who these students are .
I do not know if they exist ... "
His voice trailed off as a guard came and stood listening to him .
Not all believe in Mr Kambaksh 's innocence .
On 27 October he was arrested at the offices of Jahan - e - Naw , a newspaper for which he had carried out reporting assignments .
" It was about 10 in the morning .
They told me that one of the directors of the NDS [ the Afghan national intelligence service ] wanted to see me .
I was taken to a police station and sat around until 3 o'clock when they said they were arresting me over the website entry .
When I protested they said they were doing this for my own safety , otherwise I may be killed . "

Mr Kambaksh received visits from his family in the weeks which followed but says that he was not allowed any access to a lawyer .
" My family were upset , my father is so worried , I have seen him age in the last few months .
I keep telling them to be strong . "
On 6 December he was brought before a court in Mazar where the charges against him , accusing him of blasphemy and breaching other tenets of Islamic law , were read out .
But then the proceedings concluded without any evidence being presented before the court .
The next hearing , on 12 January , was cancelled after Mr Kambaksh became ill .
He arrived at the court at the next session , on 22 January expecting a date to be set for the trial , only to hear numbing news .
" They normally sit for just a few hours in the afternoon .
I was taken into the court just before it shut at 4 o'clock .
There were three judges and a prosecutor and some details of the case were repeated .
One of the judges then said to me that I have been found guilty and the sentence was death .
I tried to argue , but , as I said , they talked to me like a criminal , they just said I would be taken back to the prison .
" I was totally shocked .
Afterwards I sat and tried to calculate just how long they had taken to judge my case .
I thought at first it was three minutes , but then I worked out it was four .
That was it , I have been in prison ever since .
All I can hope now is that something can be done at the appeal .
I would really like the appeal to be heard in Kabul , I think I will get a better hearing there . "
Following the international outcry over the case , and the campaign by Mr Kambaksh 's supporters , Afghanistan 's Supreme Court has said that the appeal may take place at Kabul , away from local justice in Mazar , and that the hearing this time would be in the open .
Justice Bahahuddin Baha also stated that the student would have the right to legal representation .
" I think if I get to put over my point of view then the judges will see I have done nothing wrong .
But then I was entitled under the constitution to have a lawyer and put my defence the last time and that did not happen .
I have heard that President Karzai has taken an interest in my case .
He can reprieve me , but I do not know what kind of pressure he is under . "

The incident occurred at the Shri Durga Malleswara temple in Vijayawada city , 170 miles ( 270 km ) from the state capital , Hyderabad , an official said .
The five were killed when thousands of devotees pressed forward to garland the statue of goddess Durga .
Five of the injured were in serious condition , officials said .
One gate
More than 100,000 devotees had gathered at the hill - top temple the Associated Press quoted Andhra Pradesh Endowment Minister , Ratnakar Rao , as saying .
Mr Rao said the dead included four women .
The rituals had continued after the stampede , he said .
The city 's police chief , CV Anand , blamed the temple management for the tragedy .
He said police had alerted the temple authorities that a huge crowd was expected for the ceremony and had asked them to ensure adequate crowd control .
The temple has only one gate which is used for both entry and exit .
In November 2006 , four people were killed and 18 others injured in a stampede at the Jagannath temple in the eastern Indian state of Orissa .
In January 2005 , 265 pilgrims were killed in a stampede near a temple in the western Maharashtra state .

Google has always been known for its clean , lightweight , ad - free search page , but Canada ’s largest provider of broadband internet is under fire today for messing with it .
Toronto - based Rogers has begun testing a controversial technique that allows the media empire to insert its own content into another entity ’s web page , angering net neutrality proponents .
According to a tip passed to L.A. - based technology expert Lauren Weinstein , the system being employed is manufactured by the “ in - browser marketing ” firm PerfTech .
So far , Rogers is experimenting with the deep packet inspection process only to insert account status messages at the top of web pages like Google.ca , but it is easy to see how such a technique could be revamped to provide additional advertising to customers .
The tactic may be too much of a temptation for the media giant to pass up — with additional cable and wireless services to promote , as well as a lucrative existing online partnership with Yahoo ! , the pushed ad idea has likely already been floated in Rogers ’ boardrooms .
The problem is that the technology highjacks another company ’s web pages without permission .
Rogers says that a customer is already able to opt - out of receiving automatic status messages , and they ’re testing customer response to this latest approach .
The status message that has been appearing at the top of some customers ’ pages warns when they are reaching their monthly bandwidth allotment and that they might encounter overage charges ( Rogers , like Bell , admits that they employ “ traffic shaping ” to throttle bandwidth used by file sharing applications , and the company charges $ 1.50 per gigabyte overage , to a monthly maximum of $ 50 ) .
“ Will Web service providers such as Google and many others , who have spent vast resources in both talent and treasure creating and maintaining their services ’ appearances and quality , be willing to stand still while any ISP intercepts and modifies their traffic in such a manner ? ” asks Weinstein .
The tech pundit is the co-founder of People for Internet Responsibility , which aims to reveal discriminatory activity implemented by legislators and ISPs .
With no official policy on in - browser marketing , Rogers is treading a fine line by inserting what they deem as a friendly account reminder on top of someone else ’s carefully cultivated property .
Equipped with the kind of personal customer data that is extremely valuable to advertisers and the ability to theoretically target each one directly , one might worry where this is going .

Weed would rather not be talking to a reporter or having her photo taken .
The single mother would rather be focusing on her family , which she supports by working for a Phoenix construction company , surviving paycheck to paycheck .
Weed says she 'd prefer to enjoy time with her daughter and granddaughter .
Instead , much of her time is dedicated to a legal fight with the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .
In 2005 , Weed and about 30,000 other Americans became part of what the RIAA calls its " tough - love " campaign , targeting music lovers who have allegedly shared or downloaded music illegally using the Internet .
The RIAA claims music piracy takes dollars away from the hardworking recording artists and record companies the association represents .
Critics say the money generated from the RIAA tough - love lawsuits does n't make it to the artists , but goes back into a litigation machine that randomly targets people -- some guilty , others innocent .
In 2005 , Weed received a letter from Cox Cable saying that her IP address had been identified through RIAA investigators who pose on peer to peer ( P2P ) file - sharing sites .
MediaSentry , owned by SafeNet , is RIAA 's investigation company of choice : MediaSentry searches America 's hard drives for music files being shared via the Internet .
The first letter from an Internet company directs defendants to p2 plawsuit.com , a site developed by the RIAA to provide a method to instantly settle -- ostensibly anonymously .
Usually , the early settlement offer begins at $ 4,000 - - even if a defendant is accused of illegally downloading just one song .
However , critics point out that $ 4,000 sounds cheap when faced with the possibility of hiring an attorney and going in front of a judge in federal court .
Those settlement fees rise drastically if a defendant decides not to pay -- often increasing to tens of thousands of dollars as the complaint heads to legal negotiations or trial .
It 's believed that only one of the approximately 30,000 suits has so far proceeded to trial :
Last year , a Minnesota jury awarded the RIAA $ 222,000 to be paid by Jamie Thomas , another single mom , for 24 songs allegedly shared over the Kazaa file - sharing network .
It troubles Weed that her privacy has been violated .
Her name is listed on what seems like endless court documents , and her case is being discussed on anti-RIAA Web sites , such as recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com , run by two New York City attorneys advocating for victims of RIAA lawsuits .
" Its lunacy , " Weed says over the phone , her voice trailing off as she begins to cry .
Despite her tears ,
Weed continues talking , fueled by a desire to get her life back .
She says she 's considered settling her case , but she 's kept wondering :
Why should she pay for something that , she says , she did n't do ?
Kathleen Williamson , Weed 's attorney and a popular Tucson songwriter ( with multiple Tucson Area Music Awards , TAMMIES , to her credit ) , says her client is a good example of the injustice propagated by the RIAA .
That injustice began in 2003 , when the association announced it was going after anyone it could identify as illegally sharing music on popular peer to peer ( P2P ) sites , such as LimeWire and BitTorrent .
The RIAA represents the U.S. recording - industry labels that make and distribute about 90 percent of all music produced and sold .
When you look through RIAA lawsuits , member names such as Capital , Atlantic , BMG , Geffen , A&M , Sony and hundreds of others are listed as the plaintiffs .
While the litigation is presented as a way to curb piracy , Williamson and others say the RIAA is going about things in a way that is immoral , impractical and unconstitutional , leading to draconian effects on the lives of many innocent students and working - class people .
People like Weed .
" I was shocked by the whole thing , truthfully , and quite at a loss , " Weed says .
" This whole thing threw me for a loop .
It was kind of a shock when I told them they did n't have the right person , yet they continued to pursue me . "
The RIAA filed a lawsuit against Weed in 2006 , and she was forced to put her life on hold .
She delayed a major operation , since she did n't know how she would be able to afford taking care of herself and paying off the RIAA .
Weed breathed a sigh of relief in September 2006 , when the case was dismissed because it had taken too long for the RIAA attorneys to prosecute .
" But the RIAA filed a motion to have the case reinstated , which the judge did in July 2007 , " Williamson says .
" It was like Dracula coming back out of the coffin . "
That July , the RIAA filed motions for a default judgment ( a judgment on behalf of the plaintiff after a defendant does n't respond in time ) .
At that point , Weed was representing herself .
" I did n't have a choice .
It was either me , or letting them get a judgment against me .
I could n't afford it .
I kept saying , ' This is ridiculous .
Why am I expected to pay all of this money for something I did n't do ? ' "
Weed says .
As Weed 's sleepless nights increased , she discovered a Tucson copyright attorney listed on the recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com
Web site .
Williamson took over the case , pro bono , where Weed left off .
Weed says she began to sleep a little better .
And while she calls Williamson a blessing , Williamson heaps credit on Weed for the motions she filed with her own layman 's research .
" This woman is the matriarch of her family .
She is the main provider , " Williamson says .
" Deb is amazing .
I 'd hire her to work with me if she decided to go to paralegal school .
She is smart and understood a lot of complicated issues she started studying after the RIAA refiled their case against her . "
In Weed 's case , the RIAA alleges seven songs were downloaded illegally .
Williamson says the complaint is not as factually detailed as it should be under federal rules and civil procedures .
The duo expects the case to head to trial this year .
Cara Duckworth , a spokesperson for the RIAA , says the P2P anti-piracy campaign has been successful , from the industry 's perspective .
While organizations like the San Francisco - based Electronics Frontier Foundation ( a public - rights group focusing on technology issues ) contend that file sharing and P2P use among young people have increased , Duckworth says that 's not the case .
" No , we are seeing a decrease .
It is working , " Duckworth says , from her Washington , D.C. office .
" We 've seen in our research that it 's flattened out . "
Targeting colleges -- part of the RIAA campaign since February 2007 - - has helped .
Duckworth says more than 5,000 letters were sent to 150 university information - technology offices .
Although the attorney generals in Oregon and Utah have challenged the college campaigns , Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard has not .
Paul Alvin , vice president of communications at the UA , says he 's aware of the letters going out to colleges , but so far , the UA has n't been on the RIAA target list ( though Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University have ) .
Williamson says she hopes UA officials are prepared for the inevitable , and she hopes they fight .
No worries , Duckworth says , claiming that the RIAA always maintains open lines of communication for students and university personnel to address the issue of campus piracy .
The letters delivered to IT departments at universities need to be forwarded to students once the IP addresses are matched to students .
In a recent settlement Williamson handled for an ASU student , she says , it was discovered that the 35 early - settlement letters sent to ASU were never received by the students .
Duckworth says it 's important that universities do not sit on the letters , as was done at ASU .
As a result , the next settlement offer to the students was $ 1,000 higher .
Williamson says she asked that the RIAA attorneys bend their rules in this instance , since the students were never given the $ 3,000 settlement opportunity designed for college students .
The RIAA , however , ignored her request , she says .
Duckworth says she 's well aware of criticism from defendant attorneys and organizations such the EFF , but says the public needs to understand that the litigation campaign is part of a three - legged stool that also educates parents and children about copyright laws and publicizes existing digital sites that are legal , such as Amazon.com and iTunes :
It is n't all about litigation .
Williamson says she suggests people take a look at kazaa.com or mp3rocket.com to decide whether common folks -- much less teenagers -- can figure out from what is legal , and what is not .
Sources such as Motley Fool have criticized the RIAA for asserting that they would rather litigate than innovate -- and that litigation can often take a toll on people in trying situations , such as single parents like Weed .
Duckworth says they are not targeted on purpose .
" We have no way of knowing who is behind an IP address , " Duckworth says .
" There 's no way of doing a socio - economic screening .
We target theft .
We do try to be fair and reasonable with all of our cases . "
Piracy has caused a $ 3 billion deficit in the marketplace , Duckworth says , adding that money is being lost not just by recording artists , but many middle - class people who also work in the recording industry - - a whole community of people who work behind the scenes .
" These are people who also need to be compensated , " Duckworth says .
The success rates do n't bode well for Weed and Williamson .
So far , the RIAA is 1 - for - 1 in winning at trial ( though the defendant has appealed ) , and the few District Court rulings that have n't favored the RIAA have n't deterred the industry Goliath .
" You know , the success rates are n't on our side , and the harassment ( by RIAA ) is endless .
So far , judges seem to be ruling in their favor .
It 's basically impossible for most people to fight back , " Williamson says .
Weed adds : " It 's extremely intimidating to have these huge record companies with millions and millions of dollars in their hands coming at you .
Until everyone is educated , it is going to be hard for people not to be intimidated . "
However , Web sites , such as recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com and eff.org , have helped .
The lawsuits have created a community of attorneys fighting these cases , and through these Internet sites , they share case information with each other , and get the word out quickly on changes in the industry and best practices on how to fight back .
It 's how Weed found Williamson , and it's how Williamson came to collaborate with Edwin Aguilar , a Tucson attorney with Karp Heurlin Weiss , who also serves as co-counsel for Weed , along with Bruce Heurlin .
Aguilar is also representing 57 - year - old Roberto Sanchez in another RIAA case .
Sanchez owns a small produce company and lives in Rio Rico near Nogales .
On Nov. 17 , 2005 , Sanchez came to Aguilar 's office with the letter from his Internet provider .
" He had no clue what this was about .
This case has gone on for almost three years , " Aguilar says , leaning against three thick files that represent Sanchez 's case -- and about $ 50,000 worth of litigation .
Sanchez told Aguilar he did not download music or share files on a P2P site .
Aguilar says his client hardly knows how to use his computer , which was primarily bought for Sanchez 's children to use for school .
" I felt it was a screw job back then , and now more and more , I 'm convinced that it still is , " Aguilar says .
" They 've never had proof that my client did anything wrong .
Anyone could have shared those files , but it was n't my client . "
Recently , the RIAA filed to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice .
It 's a win of sorts for Aguilar and Sanchez , one that comes after an odd three - year battle .
Sanchez was initially accused of using the screen name npink to illegally share dozens of gangster - rap songs ; later , the plaintiff filed a default - judgment claim against Sanchez 's teenage daughter , yet continued its lawsuit against him .
( The default judgment against Sanchez 's daughter is in litigation with a different attorney . )
Aguilar says he hopes the judge will not dismiss the Sanchez lawsuit without prejudice :
That would allow the RIAA to continue on and perhaps even re-file the suit , without even a formal slap on the wrist , leaving Sanchez stuck with $ 50,000 in legal fees for " something the recording company did , " Aguilar says .
" The company is n't stupid .
They are avoiding going to trial .
This case is a loser .
We would love to take it to trial , because they can't win it , " Aguilar says .
From Williamson 's perspective , the unfair and even extortion - like challenges these lawsuits have brought to individuals are a concern , but she is also concerned about an even bigger issue : the ethics of surveillance during a digital revolution .
As more and more people use P2P networks to conduct business and online meetings , more people could be targeted through MediaSentry and other companies hired by organizations like the RIAA .
Even the Motion Picture Association of America is joining the fray .
Williamson says she and other attorneys are concerned about the RIAA 's use of MediaSentry as its investigator in these cases .
In states , such as Arizona , investigators must be licensed -- and MediaSentry is not licensed .
" If someone gets into my computer , the reality is that it 's just like searching your home , or worse .
You 're going to get more private information from my computer than you are from my closet , metaphor intended .
...
If someone gets in our computers without a search warrant or any legitimate justification , one would expect them to be operating legally and legitimately .
And in this case , they 're not , " Williamson says .
In Arizona , it 's a criminal misdemeanor to be an investigator or to conduct an investigation without a professional license .
" The only thing ( RIAA investigators ) can see about the identity of the person is their IP address , which changes all the time , " Williamson says .
" They sit there , whatever they 're getting paid , probably in their own homes , sleuthing around on people 's computers , finding IP addresses and seeing what they 're sharing and not sharing , and for a certain amount of money , reporting IP addresses back to the RIAA , " Williamson says .
" We do n't know who these people are .
We do n't know how ethical they are ; we do n't know anything about them .
They give this list to the RIAA , and now the RIAA has this list with times , dates and file information .
They do screen shots of what they saw , which is n't the best evidence .
...
How do we know they are n't doctoring the information based on what they are getting paid ?
How do we know ? "
The investigators also watch sites like MP3rocket.com , which include a mixture of music , both copyrighted and in the public domain .
One client Williamson worked with thought he was getting music legally from this site .
Like most people , he did n't read the site agreement , and even if he had , Williamson says , he would have needed to be an expert on copyright law to understand it .
MediaSentry representatives did not return several calls from the Weekly .
Williamson says she counsels people to avoid P2P networks and skip downloading free music unless it 's part of the public domain .
She also thinks people need to start looking at music differently :
For a start , support local music , and buy locally produced CDs by local songwriters .
She also says music lovers should consider boycotting the RIAA , either by not buying music from its labels ( see riaaradar.com for more information ) or by purchasing used CDs .
Meanwhile , the music industry is trying to change how it operates .
The Internet community has challenged the RIAA litigation with the notion " innovate do n't litigate , " and the industry may finally be listening .
According to Fred von Lohmann , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , rumors abound that the industry is looking to create an alternative system to music sharing and downloading .
However , the system would n't be available for a few more years .
The solution : a blanket license offered by Internet service providers or other companies , for something like $ 5 extra a month , that allows listeners access to all music .
" They 've been pushing a much more effective model , but it comes late .
What are we going to say to the 30,000 to 40,000 people they 've sued ?
They 're not going to give refunds .
They 'll just say , ' Sorry .
It just took us a couple of years to figure it all out . ' "
Any apology , however , would n't correct the damage the RIAA has inflicted upon its reputation .
" Five to 10 years from now , people will remember how shameful the industry treated the public for so long .
If you look at the big picture of who is behaving badly , is unfair or immoral , history is n't going to point to the music fans , but the industry and its lawyers , " von Lohmann says .
However , von Lohmann does n't think many people will want to give up music just to send the RIAA a message .
" Most kids nowadays are sophisticated enough to know how not to get caught , " von Lohmann says .
" So far , if you 're not sharing files , you 're not going to get sued .
No one has been sued for simply downloading .
It 's the sharing . "
For now , the litigation continues .
On March 5 , von Lohmann plans to be in Phoenix on behalf of Phoenix resident Jeffrey Howell , who is representing himself in an unusual RIAA lawsuit that further challenges how the courts look at file sharing and copyright laws .
( Williamson assisted as local counsel to help von Lohmann file amicus briefs in the Howell case . )
" It 's an important issue from our perspective .
It 's special in several ways .
It 's one of the first times the recording industry is ( claiming ) that simply putting files on shared folders is illegal , just by simply making them available , " von Lohmann says .
" ...
It 's never been considered illegal .
So we think it 's an important issue . "
Williamson says she is grateful the EFF is helping Howell with that issue , since he has not been able to secure an attorney and is fighting his case alone .
" The RIAA would like to steamroll over him and the judge , " Williamson says .
" But we need a clear ruling on this issue , and the Howell case is very important for this reason . "
Williamson has heard all of the RIAA 's reasoning for its " tough - love " campaign , but all she sees are the lives of working people affected by the litigation and the expensive fight against the music industry .
She refers to an RIAA analogy that compared music piracy to shoplifting :
When people are arrested for shoplifting , they only pay a fine of several hundred dollars and face probation .
Therefore , Williamson says , it makes more practical sense for a music lover currently using online file - sharing services to " stop , get a shoplifting bag , and fill it up ( with CDs ) at the nearest supermart .
" Even if you get caught , it 's cheaper . "

Ms Beluga is now on its way to Guanta in Venezuela
Kite in action
Ten thousand tonnes of metal heaving through the water , the ship 's giant masts glistening in the winter sun .
But there is something even more magical about being aboard MS Beluga SkySails .
On the face of it , this vessel - which is carrying parts of a timber production line to Venezuela - looks like any other cargo ship .
In recent months , commercial shipping has been criticised for not doing enough to tackle global warming .
Of all the CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere today , 4 % comes from ships .
That 's more than the aviation industry , primarily because 90 % of global trade is done by sea .
MS Beluga SkySails believes it has a solution .
It has set sail on a mission to turn the oceans green .
Once the ship has reached the open sea , it reveals its brand new weapon in the fight against global warming : a kite .
Twisted spaghetti
The 160sq m ( 1,722sq ft ) blue - and - white kite is winched up a mast , strings dangling like twisted spaghetti .
We can demonstrate that you can combine economy and ecology
Verena Frank , Beluga Shipping
For half - an - hour or so , it sits there at the top of the mast , not doing a great deal .
Wind power is a wonderful thing , but you do actually need some wind to make it all work - and there is not very much at this particular moment .
Half - an - hour later , though , the wind has picked up and the kite is flying hundreds of metres in the air - and helping to tug the ship along .
Kite power means the ship 's engines down below can work on reduced power : and that means fewer carbon emissions .
It also means smaller fuel bills .
With the price of shipping fuel having doubled in the past two years , kite power is promising big savings .
MS Beluga SkySails believes its fuel bill will be cut by £ 800 ( $ 1,560 ) a day .
" We can demonstrate that you can combine economy and ecology , " Verena Frank of Beluga Shipping explains .
" Economy , because you can reduce fuel consumption and fuel costs , and on the ecological side of things , we reduce emissions . "
Magic wears off
The kite is controlled by computers .
One computer helps it to fly in figures of eight in the sky - maximising the power it produces .
Another computer adjusts the kite 's direction .
If the project is successful , expect to see even bigger kites soon - some up to 5,000sq m ( 53,820sq ft ) in size pulling ships across the seas and oceans .
After several hours on board the ship , the magic starts to wear off .
The sun has gone down , it is freezing cold .
To warm myself up I start thinking of the ship 's final destination - Venezuela .
But I will not be seeing the South American sun .
By the evening , the ship has returned to chilly Bremerhaven to drop off the journalists , before setting sail - again - on its transatlantic journey .
Ms Ali says the threats to her life have not subsided but increased
She told the European Parliament in Brussels her life was in greater danger because the Dutch government had stopped paying for her security .
" I do n't want to die , I want to live and I love life , " she said .
Ms Ali added that the cost of her bodyguards was beyond anything a private person could raise .
The Somali - born former MP has been living under police protection since the murder of Dutch film - maker Theo Van Gogh by an Islamic extremist in 2004 .
Europe needs to defend her because she has defended Europe
French philosopher Bernard - Henri Levy
She was threatened in a note left on his body for writing the script for Van Gogh 's Submission - a highly controversial film alleging that women were being abused under Islam .
But she left the Netherlands for the United States in 2006 after a political row in which she admitted lying in her Dutch asylum request .
She now works for a conservative think - tank in the US and the Dutch government has said it can no longer justify paying for her security .
Full - time job
Ms Ali said she had been working full - time on raising funds .
Dozens of MEPs have signed a declaration backing the creation of a fund .
But for the initiative to become official , half of the parliament 's 785 will have to back the petition .
Earlier this week she announced she was seeking French citizenship .
She said the campaign for her to receive honorary French citizenship was being spearheaded by a group of French intellectuals and was supported by the country 's political leaders .
" Europe needs to defend her because she has defended Europe , " French philosopher Bernard - Henri Levy told MEPs .
MySQL AB ’s recent changes to the Community / Enterprise split have made people go as far as calling the split a failure .
I do n’t think it ’s working well either , but it could be fixed .
Here ’s what I think would make Enterprise a compelling offer .
I ’d recommend Enterprise if I could
If the MySQL Enterprise Server were a good thing , I ’d recommend it to my consulting clients .
I ’d suggest we start using it at my employer , too .
I believe in supporting people and companies whose work benefits me .
Here ’s the thing , though : I think it would be detrimental , even dangerous .
Why on earth would I think that ?
Because nobody ’s testing the Enterprise source code before it ’s released .
It ’s getting bug fixes that have n’t been stress - tested in the real world .
Some of them are even being rolled back , many months later , because they were broken .
Reasons I ’d buy MySQL Enterprise
The reasons I ’d buy a MySQL Enterprise subscription would be as follows , in order of importance :
A stable , tested version of the server with well - known , documented limitations and bugs .
Technical support .
The knowledge base , etc , etc .
But … that ’s what Enterprise is , right ?
The official list of benefits in an Enterprise subscription looks like it matches my list , does n’t it ?
MySQL Enterprise subscriptions include the following benefits : MySQL Enterprise Server : The MySQL Enterprise Server is the most reliable , secure and up - to - date version of MySQL in source and binary format .
Extensive Reliability Testing … … etc …
The thing is , those first two bullets are blatantly untrue .
Want proof ?
Look at the change list for MySQL 5.0.48 , which will be the next Monthly Rapid Update .
Here are just a few of the changes near the top of the list , with my comments :
Coercion of ASCII values to character sets that are a superset of ASCII sometimes was not done , resulting in illegal mix of collations errors .
These cases now are resolved using repertoire , a new string expression attribute …
My comment : A new , complex string expression attribute , designed to fix an edge case , is going straight into the “ reliable ” Enterprise branch ?
No way I want that untested change on my production servers .
FEDERATED tables had an artificially low maximum of key length .
A fix to FEDERATED ?
FEDERATED is riddled with basic bugs and should not even be distributed with Enterprise , and even so , who cares if I ca n’t make as long an index as I should be able to ?
I can work around it while the community tests it .
In some cases , INSERT INTO … SELECT … GROUP BY could insert rows even if the SELECT by itself produced an empty result .
Another edge case , probably easy to avoid , that probably affects core parts of the server .
In a stored function or trigger , when InnoDB detected deadlock , it attempted rollback and displayed an incorrect error message ( Explicit or implicit commit is not allowed in stored function or trigger ) .
Now InnoDB returns an error under these conditions and does not attempt rollback .
Changes to InnoDB ’s deadlock and rollback behavior should not be included in a hot - fix , especially since it only affects stored functions and triggers , which are also not ready for Enterprise .
These bug fixes address minor problems , but seem to have the potential to cause major damage if there ’s a problem with the fix itself .
None of these should be included in a hot - fix release .
In fact , after looking through the whole list , I do n’t see anything I would want to go to my production servers before six months of community testing .
There ’s simply too much at stake .
The upside of including these changes is so small , and the potential downside so large , that it does n’t make sense to include them .
What would I not want in Enterprise ?
Here are some things that would not attract me to Enterprise :
Patches and hot fixes .
New features .
Take a look at bullet points number three and four in the list of Enterprise benefits :
Updates and Upgrades with New Features :
You receive the newest versions of MySQL Enterprise Server released during your active subscription term .
Predictable Releases with Bug Fixes and Updates : Predictable and scheduled service packs ensure that a new , fully up - to - date version of the MySQL Enterprise Server is always available with the latest updates and bug fixes .
Customers of MySQL Enterprise receive Monthly Rapid Updates & Quarterly Service Packs
These are exactly the things I do n’t want in my Enterprise source code .
These two “ benefits ” directly conflict with the first two benefits .
They cannot coexist , period .
MySQL ’s marketing information says new experimental features are unstable , but hot bug fixes are stable and reliable .
In reality , there ’s no difference between new features and new bug fixes ; they are both unstable and untested and do n’t belong in a conservative , reliable product .
Until this changes , the Enterprise source code will continue to be less trustworthy than the Community source code , in my opinion .
Even if the Community source does n’t get the bug fixes , at least you know what you ’re dealing with .
How would I change the current release policy ?
I think this is easiest to explain with diagrams .
Here ’s the current release policy , as I understand it ( I know this is over - simplified , but I ’m trying to simplify this enough to show how I ’d change it ) :
As I understand it now , the Community source gets ( or is intended to get — it ’s not really working , but that ’s off - topic ) frequent contributions from the community , and occasional bug fixes that are applied to the Enterprise source .
The Community source is built and released infrequently .
On the other hand , the Enterprise source gets frequent hot fixes and releases , and infrequently gets features merged from the Community source after they ’re deemed stable .
I ’m not sure who designed this scheme , but I think a lot of people tried to say it was a bad idea and they went ahead anyway .
Perhaps the symmetry in the diagram appealed to someone .
Here ’s how that would have to change before I ’d buy Enterprise :
In this model , the Community gets all source code changes first , and after they are stable , they ’re merged into the Enterprise source .
The Community code is built and released frequently , and Enterprise is extremely conservative .
This I ’d pay for .
This is a compelling offer that gives Enterprise customers substantial return for their money .
In this model , I ’d be paying MySQL to do the painstaking work of looking at all the changes that happened in the Community source tree during the last release cycle , carefully selecting the good stuff , merging that into the Enterprise source tree , and testing the result .
This is a proven model for creating high - quality software from a rapidly changing codebase .
I do n’t know why MySQL invented their own method instead , but it was a mistake .
Notice something else about this : unless the MySQL developers know something about revision control and merging I do n’t ( entirely possible , since I ’ve never used the product they use ) , this is a lot simpler to manage .
There are no cross-currents between the two source trees .
It ’s not just the aesthetics of having all the arrows going the same direction ; I ’d be a lot more confident that the merges went smoothly in this model .
I think there ’s a much lower chance of a mistake .
I also think the engineers would have a lot less work to do , and could concentrate more on making software and less on maintaining two complicated source trees .
In fact , I believe the Community branch has actually been getting bug fixes too , contrary to my first diagram .
This is n’t what MySQL initially announced they ’d do , but if I had to guess , I ’d say the engineering team said it would be too much work to keep the bug fixes out of the Enterprise branch .
Notice what I ’m not saying about Community
I am explicitly avoiding saying something in particular about the Community source .
I want quick release cycles and all patches applied there first , for one and only one reason : so the Enterprise source is trustworthy and stable .
I ’m not saying I want it so I can get the most bleeding - edge new fun stuff for free in Community .
That is not a factor for me in the mindset I ’m using to write this article — I am imagining myself as a customer who is very risk - averse ( which is true ) .
This model would probably make some Community users happy too , though .
What if I needed an immediate fix ?
What if I found a serious bug in the software and needed it fixed right away for my business ?
Should n’t MySQL release a hot - fix into the Enterprise tree for that ?
No .
I found a bug , who cares ?
If I found it , it means the community did n’t find it first .
If the community did n’t find it , it probably only affects me .
Therefore , the bug fix should go into the Community server .
If I could n’t work around the problem ( unlikely ) , I should be able to pay MySQL ’s support engineers to make me a custom patch and build just to fix this problem .
I ’d assume all the risk of that , of course .
This unstable , experimental patch should not go into the Enterprise source , but other customers should hear about it .
Right now you might be considering the similarity to Red Hat Enterprise Linux , and thinking “ but RHEL does get hot fixes , so why should n’t MySQL Enterprise ? ”
The reason is MySQL Enterprise is n’t an entire operating system distribution of software , with third parties fixing defects in upstream source .
The Community process I ’m advocating should take care of the vast majority of such bugs .
Someone might find a critical security flaw that would warrant a hot - fix to the Enterprise product without waiting six months .
But seriously , look at the bugs people find in MySQL — look at that changelog I linked to .
There are no critical security flaws or kernel buffer overflows — and those are the kinds of things RHEL gets hot fixes for .
Some people might be drawn to MySQL ’s current monthly hot - fix policy because they come from a Microsoft background , where Microsoft releasing service packs and hot - fixes is seen as a good thing .
All I can say to those people is , you ’ve become like a frog in a pot of boiling water .
Microsoft ’s fixes and service packs are a broken way of fixing their broken software , and are not a good way to manage quality software , so you should n’t measure the value of a release policy by whether it looks like Microsoft’s .
What would my ideal Enterprise version look like ?
I ’d really like to see MySQL AB stop adding new features and make the existing ones work better .
The bugs I keep finding are usually quite simple , and I think that ’s a sign of a low - quality codebase .
For example , try creating a view that already exists .
It breaks replication .
How did this bug go unnoticed for so long ?
In my opinion , it ’s because the server has n’t been stable since 5.0 was released , and nobody ’s using the bleeding - edge features as much as the core of the server , which is where I ’d like MySQL AB to concentrate for the Enterprise version .
The Enterprise version I ’d like to see does n’t have views .
That ’s right , it does n’t have views , because nobody ’s used and tested them thoroughly yet ( if they had , there would n’t be so many bugs in them ) .
It does n’t have triggers , stored procedures , the FEDERATED storage engine , stored functions — in terms of features , it ’s somewhere in version 4.1 .
That ’s what I ’d call MySQL Enterprise .
I do n’t want these features because I do n’t use them right now anyway , because they have the potential to cause such massive pain .
I want them to go back to the community incubator so the bugs can get worked out .
I ’m managing just fine without using them , but I ’m not managing fine with the pain they ’re causing just by being there even though I do n’t use them .
But at the same time the existing features , especially those needed for scaling and high availability , would be given a lot more attention .
Replication would have much stronger assurances of accuracy and reliability .
InnoDB would scale to more processors .
The query optimizer would get a lot of love .
In terms of improvements to existing features , my ideal Enterprise version is somewhere around 5.0.32 .
I chose that version because it was released about six or eight months ago , which means the big changes in that version would have been out in the Community for six or eight months and I ’d be satisfied having them in the Enterprise version .
Right now , if you want to upgrade because of a bug that ’s fixed in a newer version , you upgrade into some other bugs .
I ’m seriously tired of upgrading into the newest , latest , greatest bugs , like infinite loops in relay logs that fill hard drives with gigabytes of duplicate logs in a matter of minutes .
These bugs have cost a significant amount of money , time , and frustration .
I would definitely recommend people buy and use Enterprise if it fixed bugs without introducing new ones , but I see no signs of that happening .
MySQL ’s sales pitch does n’t convince me
There ’s one more thing I think MySQL would have to do to get me to buy Enterprise , and that ’s develop a better sales pitch .
I ’ll explain that — keep reading .
I think the way the Community / Enterprise split is designed smacks of marketing people making decisions .
I do n’t think this is ultimately going to be as successful a strategy for MySQL as it could be , because they wo n’t be able to sell it as well .
Why not ?
Because unlike many other products , the people who make decisions about their company ’s MySQL installations are engineers , by and large .
The current marketing message sounds pretty condescending to an engineer .
I ’ve even joined a MySQL webinar just to see .
It was supposedly about scaling with MySQL , but in fact there was very little content .
They spent a lot of time trying to say you should buy Enterprise .
This was very strange , since the webinar was only open to current Enterprise customers .
But the reasons they gave for choosing one or the other had me shaking my head in disbelief .
It went something like this :
You should choose MySQL Enterprise if you ’re making money with MySQL , because Enterprise is the version for making money .
If you plan to use MySQL to make money , you should use Enterprise .
On the other hand , you should use Community if you ’re just experimenting with MySQL .
It ’s free and has lots of hot new features , like SHOW PROFILE and um , uh , that ’s it .
Anyway , you should use it if you ’re just experimenting , because it ’s the version for experimenting .
Oh , and you should use it for your testing if you ’re an Enterprise customer , because it ’s for experimenting with , and tests are experiments .
These are n’t direct quotes , but they probably are n’t far off — they certainly capture the spirit , if not the letter , of the webinar .
Their strongest reason for using Enterprise was “ because you should use Enterprise , ” and they said it several times .
And when they said Enterprise users should run Community on their test systems , I thought “ you ’re kidding .
I ’m going to test with a different version of the product than I run in production ?
Enough already . ”
I signed off with about five minutes left in the webinar .
The bottom line is , I do n’t trust a company that assumes I wo n’t have a problem with such nonsense .
I know there are smart engineers working on the MySQL server , but the marketing message is the face the world sees .
In my experience , that ends up giving the marketing people the right to make decisions , even when the engineers disapprove .
Therefore , I have no confidence the people making the decisions about how MySQL is developed and released are competent to do so .
If MySQL ’s marketing materials were written and presented by people with serious tech savvy , I ’d be a lot more comfortable about the invisible parts of the company .
I assume most other engineers are going to extrapolate backwards from the faÃ§ade , just like me , and conclude the decision - making process is untrustworthy .
Incidentally , this is exactly why my current employer ( an advertising agency ) rocks : because the sales folks and execs have decades of experience running companies in the industries we serve , and the people who answer when you call to discuss your account are analysts , not customer service reps .
Whoever picks up the phone is an Excel wizard and has a SQL window ( not a reporting system , a SQL prompt ) open directly to an analysis server — our analysts and sales people are smart and capable and generally have business or engineering degrees from top universities ; they ’re not just friendly voices .
Contrary to popular wisdom , you can tell a lot about the book by looking at the cover .
That ’s why MySQL needs a sales pitch that ’s convincing and respectable to an engineer .
Conclusion
MySQL AB says it needs to offer its paying customers something of value , and rightly so .
Unfortunately , someone who does n’t seem to understand software engineering at all has decided on a truly backwards way to do that .
The result is a release policy that seriously degrades the quality of both product versions .
MySQL AB ’s marketing folks keep trying to say the Emperor ’s new clothes are beautiful , but proof by repeated assertion just does n’t work on people who know software engineering .
Put another way , MySQL AB is trying to sell Enterprise on the so - called benefit of including bug fixes so the product is “ more stable . ”
This is an oxymoron .
They should be selling the service of excluding untrusted code instead .
The current Enterprise offering not only is n’t compelling , but is designed to actually be lower quality than the Community source because there are fewer people testing it .
Not using the Enterprise source is a no - brainer for me .
However , if they ’ll correct this mistake and start producing a source tree that ’s conservative , high - quality , and stable , I ’ll recommend people buy it .
I wish MySQL well in their efforts to commercialize the product , but I do n’t want what they ’re trying to sell right now .
RETAIL behemoth Wal - Mart is tossing more than 1,000 magazines from the racks in its stores , sending yet another shock wave through the battered publishing industry .
Most of the magazines are small , and more than a few of the victims are titles that have long since stopped publishing , including Child , Celebrity Living , Elle Girl , Teen People , Suede , Shop Etc. , Weekend and FHM .
However , virtually no major publisher was spared .
Wal - Mart , which released its official purge list on Jan. 15 , is believed to be responsible for generating more than 20 percent of all retail magazine sales in the US .
Wal - Mart had not returned calls by presstime .
The move is likely to hurt new magazines , which take time to nurture and develop a following .
But one magazine executive said it might actually help magazines that made the cut , because it will remove some of the clutter and give the survivors more visibility on the racks inside Wal - Mart ’s 4,000 stores .
One of the biggest corporate losers appears to be Meredith Publishing .
Its flagship Better Homes & Gardens is out , as is its sister service magazine Ladies Home Journal .
Family Circle stays , however .
Fitness , which Meredith picked up from the defunct Gruner +
Jahr , is out , though rivals Shape and Self are still in .
Time Inc. ’s
In Style will remain , though its spin - off title In Style Home is out .
The main Sports Illustrated will remain on shelves , but Sports Illustrated for Kids is getting the heave - ho .
Hearst ’s Town & Country is out , as is Hachette ’s Home and Metropolitan Home .
Condé Nast lost space on Wal - Mart ’s racks for upscale parenting magazine Cookie , the urbane and sophisticated The New Yorker and the glitzy oversized W. Self magazine made the cut , but some slower - selling special interest spin - offs got the ax .
Several titles owned by Swedish publishing giant Bonnier , which less than a year ago paid $ 220 million for 16 Time Inc. titles , are being left behind .
Among them : Parenting , Ski , Skiing , Yachting and Salt Water Sportsman .
Wal - Mart also tossed out some of longstanding titles , including foodie mag Saveur and Caribbean Travel & Life .
And a number of business titles , including The Economist , BusinessWeek , Forbes and Fortune , are also getting the boot .
Perhaps not unexpectedly , a title aimed at the very wealthy – Robb Report – is losing shelf space .
The retailing giant prides itself on meticulously tracking inventory , but the purge list suggests there were a few glitches .
Several of the magazines on Wal - Mart ’s hit list were shuttered titles that the chain had n’t sold in months , but none of the wizards at Wal - Mart ’s Bentonville , Ark. , headquarters appear to have deleted the names from their system – a surprising oversight given several titles have n’t been around for as long as two years .
Even magazines that one might think fit with Wal - Mart ’s conservative and working - class image were left out in the cold .
Among them : Boar Hunter Magazine , Spirituality & Health , Cabin Life and Log Home Living .
Even the Saturday Evening Post is being spurned .
Changes
Newly appointed Newsweek CEO Thomas E. Ascheim this week made his official mark on the newsweekly he joined in October , greeting staffers with announcements that the magazine is eyeing space downtown and that staff cuts are in the offing .
At the meeting , which was moderated by veteran media reporter Johnnie Roberts and attended by new Chairman Ann McDaniel and Editor Jon Meacham , Ascheim detailed several steps the magazine is taking to cope with the pain afflicting every major magazine title .
A spokeswoman confirmed that “ a voluntary retirement incentive program was a possibility in the coming months . ”
She also confirmed that the magazine is moving from its West 57th Street headquarters to lower Manhattan .
Said the spokeswoman , “ It is no secret our lease is up in early 2009 .
We ’ve been reviewing 100 Church Street , but we have n’t signed anything yet . ”
An insider said that Ascheim told the staff that Newsweek was cutting its rate - base , the amount of circulation the magazine guarantees to advertisers , by 500,000 to 2.5 million , following a similar move made by rival Time magazine last January .
The spokeswoman would not confirm the circulation cut .

My Open Wireless Network
Whenever I talk or write about my own security setup , the one thing that surprises people — and attracts the most criticism — is the fact that I run an open wireless network at home .
There ’s no password .
There ’s no encryption .
Anyone with wireless capability who can see my network can use it to access the internet .
To me , it ’s basic politeness .
Providing internet access to guests is kind of like providing heat and electricity , or a hot cup of tea .
But to some observers , it ’s both wrong and dangerous .
I ’m told that uninvited strangers may sit in their cars in front of my house , and use my network to send spam , eavesdrop on my passwords , and upload and download everything from pirated movies to child pornography .
As a result , I risk all sorts of bad things happening to me , from seeing my IP address blacklisted to having the police crash through my door .
While this is technically true , I do n’t think it ’s much of a risk .
I can count five open wireless networks in coffee shops within a mile of my house , and any potential spammer is far more likely to sit in a warm room with a cup of coffee and a scone than in a cold car outside my house .
And yes , if someone did commit a crime using my network the police might visit , but what better defense is there than the fact that I have an open wireless network ?
If I enabled wireless security on my network and someone hacked it , I would have a far harder time proving my innocence .
This is not to say that the new wireless security protocol , WPA , is n’t very good .
It is .
But there are going to be security flaws in it ; there always are .
I spoke to several lawyers about this , and in their lawyerly way they outlined several other risks with leaving your network open .
While none thought you could be successfully prosecuted just because someone else used your network to commit a crime , any investigation could be time - consuming and expensive .
You might have your computer equipment seized , and if you have any contraband of your own on your machine , it could be a delicate situation .
Also , prosecutors are n’t always the most technically savvy bunch , and you might end up being charged despite your innocence .
The lawyers I spoke with say most defense attorneys will advise you to reach a plea agreement rather than risk going to trial on child - pornography charges .
In a less far - fetched scenario , the Recording Industry Association of America is known to sue copyright infringers based on nothing more than an IP address .
The accuser ’s chance of winning is higher than in a criminal case , because in civil litigation the burden of proof is lower .
And again , lawyers argue that even if you win it ’s not worth the risk or expense , and that you should settle and pay a few thousand dollars .
I remain unconvinced of this threat , though .
The RIAA has conducted about 26,000 lawsuits , and there are more than 15 million music downloaders .
Mark Mulligan of Jupiter Research said it best : “ If you ’re a file sharer , you know that the likelihood of you being caught is very similar to that of being hit by an asteroid . ”
I ’m also unmoved by those who say I ’m putting my own data at risk , because hackers might park in front of my house , log on to my open network and eavesdrop on my internet traffic or break into my computers .
This is true , but my computers are much more at risk when I use them on wireless networks in airports , coffee shops and other public places .
If I configure my computer to be secure regardless of the network it ’s on , then it simply does n’t matter .
And if my computer is n’t secure on a public network , securing my own network is n’t going to reduce my risk very much .
Yes , computer security is hard .
But if your computers leave your house , you have to solve it anyway .
And any solution will apply to your desktop machines as well .
Finally , critics say someone might steal bandwidth from me .
Despite isolated court rulings that this is illegal , my feeling is that they ’re welcome to it .
I really do n’t mind if neighbors use my wireless network when they need it , and I ’ve heard several stories of people who have been rescued from connectivity emergencies by open wireless networks in the neighborhood .
Similarly , I appreciate an open network when I am otherwise without bandwidth .
If someone were using my network to the point that it affected my own traffic or if some neighbor kid was dinking around , I might want to do something about it ; but as long as we ’re all polite , why should this concern me ?
Pay it forward , I say .
Certainly this does concern ISPs .
Running an open wireless network will often violate your terms of service .
But despite the occasional cease - and - desist letter and providers getting pissy at people who exceed some secret bandwidth limit , this is n’t a big risk either .
The worst that will happen to you is that you ’ll have to find a new ISP .
A company called Fon has an interesting approach to this problem .
Fon wireless access points have two wireless networks : a secure one for you , and an open one for everyone else .
You can configure your open network in either “ Bill ” or “ Linus ” mode :
In the former , people pay you to use your network , and you have to pay to use any other Fon wireless network .
In Linus mode , anyone can use your network , and you can use any other Fon wireless network for free .
It ’s a really clever idea .
Security is always a trade - off .
I know people who rarely lock their front door , who drive in the rain ( and , while using a cell phone ) and who talk to strangers .
In my opinion , securing my wireless network is n’t worth it .
And I appreciate everyone else who keeps an open wireless network , including all the coffee shops , bars and libraries I have visited in the past , the Dayton International Airport where I started writing this and the Four Points Sheraton where I finished .
You all make the world a better place .

Todd Haynes ’s much - anticipated Bob Dylan biopic , I ’m Not There — in which the legendary musician is played by Cate Blanchett and an 11 - year old black kid — debuts this week at the New York Film Festival .
Critics say the film “ jumps all over the place , ” is “ densely idiosyncratic , ” and lacks “ a thread of narrative coherence . ”
In other words , it ’s a fitting tribute to rock and roll ’s most iconic absurdist , a guy who has n’t made any literal sense since 1963 .
Dylan ’s made baffling music ( Self Portrait ) , books ( his 1966 novel , Tarantula ) , and films ( 1978 ’s Renaldo and Clara , 2003 ’s Masked and Anonymous ) , but he ’s never made less sense than when he was talking to reporters .
Here ’s our list of the Top Ten Most Incomprehensible Bob Dylan Interviews of All Time .
10 . Time magazine , 1965 .
Dylan heckles
Time reporter Horace Judson and rants about the magazine :
“ It ’d go off the newsstands in a week if they printed the real truth … [ like ] a plain picture … a tramp vomiting , man , in the sewer .
And next door to the picture , Mr. Rockefeller …
Just make some kind of collage , which they do n’t do .
There ’s no ideas at Time magazine . ”
Touché !
9. MTV , 1986 .
Dylan fixes his makeup , admits to being a Cyndi Lauper fan , and discusses the finer points of hat - wearing , all while looking sort of like a corpse .
Also , check out that shirt .
8. Eat the Document , 1965 .
In this rarely seen outtake from the documentary of Dylan ’s 1966 European tour , he and John Lennon are interviewed together in the back of a cab .
Lennon effortlessly wins the coherency contest because Dylan is ( allegedly ) high on heroin .
7. Chabad telethon , 1991 .
Just a decade after converting to Christianity , Dylan hits the shul and brings his usual charm .
6. CBS , Fall 1961 .
In one of his first - ever interviews , a pre-fame Dylan was not yet very good at lying to journalists :
Dylan : Yeah , well , I was in the carnival when I was about 13 — all kinds of shows .
Dylan : Yeah , well , I was in the carnival when I was about 13 — all kinds of shows .
Dylan : Yeah , well , I was in the carnival when I was about 13 — all kinds of shows .
Dylan : Yeah , well , I was in the carnival when I was about 13 — all kinds of shows .
Dylan : Yeah , well , I was in the carnival when I was about 13 — all kinds of shows .
5. Vienna street interview , 1981 .
Dylan is actually fairly intelligible here , signing autographs and answering questions for Viennese fans — what ’s difficult to comprehend is how he got so polite all of a sudden .
4. MTV , 1993 .
Here , Bob leaves the nonsensical babbling to tourmate Carlos Santana and just tries really hard to make his interviewer feel uncomfortable .
( It works . )
3. BBC , 1986 .
Dylan invites a BBC documentary film crew into his trailer in Toronto for what very well could be the worst interview we ’ve ever seen in our entire lives , during which he mumbles , deflects questions ( “ I ca n’t tell you that , because I ’m not God , am I ? ” ) , and sketches a caricature of his interviewer .
2. Tokyo , 1986 .
We take that back — this is the worst interview we ’ve ever seen in our entire lives .
Dylan stutters and talks in circles ( even more than usual ) — but at least he manages to avoid a sunburn .
1. Playboy , February 1966 .
Dylan on how he chose his career :
Carelessness .
I lost my one true love .
I started drinking .
The first thing I know , I ’m in a card game .
Then I ’m in a crap game .
I wake up in a pool hall .
Then this big Mexican lady drags me off the table , takes me to Philadelphia .
She leaves me alone in her house , and it burns down .
I wind up in Phoenix .
I get a job as a Chinaman .
I start working in a dime store , and move in with a 13 - year - old girl .
Then this big Mexican lady from Philadelphia comes in and burns the house down .
I go down to Dallas .
I get a job as a “ before ” in a Charles Atlas “ before and after ” ad .
I move in with a delivery boy who can cook fantastic chili and hot dogs .
Then this 13 - year - old girl from Phoenix comes and burns the house down .
The delivery boy — he ain’t so mild :
He gives her the knife , and the next thing I know I ’m in Omaha .
It ’s so cold there , by this time I ’m robbing my own bicycles and frying my own fish .
I stumble onto some luck and get a job as a carburetor out at the hot - rod races every Thursday night .
I move in with a high school teacher who also does a little plumbing on the side , who ai n’t much to look at , but who ’s built a special kind of refrigerator that can turn newspaper into lettuce .
Everything ’s going good until that delivery boy shows up and tries to knife me .
Needless to say , he burned the house down , and I hit the road .
The first guy that picked me up asked me if I wanted to be a star .
What could I say ?

10 Most Incomprehensible Bob Dylan Interviews
Do n't Structure Data All The Way Down
Let 's write some functions to operate on circles , where a circle is a defined by a 2D center point and a radius .
In Erlang we 've got some options for how to represent a circle :
{X , Y , R} % raw tuple {circle , X , Y , R} % tagged tuple # circle{x = X , y = Y , r = R} % icky record
Hmmm ... why is a circle represented as a structure , but a point is unwrapped , so to speak , into two values ?
Attempt # 2 :
{ {X , Y} , R} % raw tuples {circle , {point , X , Y} , R} % tagged tuples ... % gonna stop with records
Now let 's write a function to compute the area of a circle , using this new representation :
area( {circle , {point , _X , _Y} , R} ) -> math : pi( ) * R * R .
Simple enough .
But take a few steps back and look this .
First , we 're not actually making use of the structure of the data in area .
We 're just destructuring it to get the radius .
And to do that destructuring , there 's a bunch of code generated for this function : to verify the parameter is a tuple of size 3 , to verify that the first element is the atom circle , to verify the second element is a tuple of size 3 with the atom point as the first element , and to extract the radius .
Then there 's a trivial bit of math and we 've got an answer .
Now suppose we want to find the area of a circle of radius 17.4 .
We 've got a nice function all set to go ... sort of .
We need the radius to be part of a circle , so we could try this :
area( {circle , {point,0,0} , 17.4} )
Kind of messy .
What about a function to build a circle for us ?
Then we could do this :
area( make_circle ( 0 , 0 , 17.4 ) )
We could also have a shorter version of make_circle that only takes a radius , defaulting the center point to 0,0 .
Okay , stop , we 're engineering ourselves to death .
All we need is a simple function to compute the area of a circle :
area( R ) -> math : pi() * R * R .
Resist the urge to wrap it into an abstract data type or an object .
Keep it raw and unstructured and simple .
If you want structure , add it one layer up , do n't make it part of the foundation .
In fact , I 'd go so far as to say that if you pass a record - like data structure to a function and any of the elements in that structure are n't being used , then you should be operating on a simpler set of values and not a data structure .
Keep the data flow obvious .

Every now and then I see complaints about the stacktraces in SBCL .
They contain too little info , or too much info , or are formatted the wrong way , etc .
But the backtrace printing is n't really any dark magic , it 's just basic Lisp code .
If you do n't like the default format , just write a new backtrace function that prints something prettier / less cluttered / more informative / etc .
For inspiration , below is one implementation , based on a really quick hack I wrote in answer to a c.l.l post a few weeks ago .
In addition to cosmetic changes , it adds a a couple of extra features : printing filenames and line numbers for the frames when possible , and printing the values of local variables when possible .
Just call backtrace - with - extra - info in any condition handler where you 'd normally call sb-debug : backtrace , or call it from the debugger REPL instead of using the backtrace debugger command .
The code assumes that you 've got Swank loaded .
For best results , compile your code with ( debug 2 ) or higher .
( defun backtrace - with - extra - info ( &key ( start 1 ) ( end 20 ) ) ( swank - backend::call- with - debugging - environment ( lambda ( ) ( loop for i from start to ( length ( swank - backend : : compute - backtrace start end ) ) do ( ignore - errors ( print - frame i ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun print - frame ( i ) ( destructuring - bind ( &key file position &allow - other - keys ) ( apply #'append ( remove - if #'atom ( swank - backend : frame-source-location -for-emacs i ) ) ) ( let* ( ( frame ( swank - backend : : nth - frame i ) ) ( line - number ( find - line - position file position frame ) ) ) ( format t " ~2@a : ~s~ % ~ ~:[~*~;~:[ ~2:*
At ~a ( unknown line ) ~*~%~ ;~ ~2 :* At ~a:~a~%~ ] ~ ] ~
~:[~*~ ; Local variables : ~%~{ ~a = ~ s ~%~}~ ] " i ( sb - debug : : frame - call ( swank - backend : : nth - frame i ) ) file line - number ( swank - backend : : frame - locals i ) ( mapcan ( lambda ( x ) ;;
Filter out local variables whose variables we ; ; do n't know ( unless ( eql ( getf x : value ) :< not- available > ) ( list ( getf x : name ) ( getf x : value ) ) ) ) ( swank - backend : : frame - locals i ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun find - line - position ( file char - offset frame ) ;;
It would be nice if SBCL stored line number information in ;; addition to form path information by default Since it does n't ;; we need to use Swank to map the source path to a character ;; offset , and then map the character offset to a line number ( ignore - errors ( let* ( ( location ( sb - di : : frame - code - location frame ) ) ( debug - source ( sb-di:: code - location - debug - source location ) ) ( line ( with - open - file ( stream file ) ( 1+ ( loop repeat char - offset count ( eql ( read - char stream ) # \ Newline ) ) ) ) ) ) ( format nil " ~:[ ~a ( file modified ) ~ ; ~a~ ] " ( = ( file - write - date file ) ( sb-di: : debug - source - created debug - source ) ) line ) ) ) )
For example on the following code :
( declaim ( optimize debug ) ) ( defun foo ( x ) ( let ( (y (+ x 3 ) ) ) ( backtrace ) ( backtrace - with - extra - info ) (+ x y ) ) ) ( defmethod bar ( ( n fixnum ) (y ( eql 1 ) ) ) ( foo (+ y n ) ) )
The old backtrace would look like :
1 : ( FOO 4 ) 2 : ( ( SB - PCL :: FAST - METHOD BAR ( FIXNUM ( EQL 1 ) ) ) #< unused argument > #< unused argument > 3 1 ) 3 : ( SB -INT : SIMPLE-EVAL-IN -LEXENV ( BAR 3 1 ) #< NULL-LEXENV >)
And the new backtrace like :
1 : FOO At /tmp/testlisp:5 Local variables : X = 4 Y = 7 2 : ( SB - PCL :: FAST - METHOD BAR ( FIXNUM ( EQL 1 ) ) )
At /tmp/testlisp : 8 Local variables : N = 3 Y = 1 3 : SB -INT : SIMPLE -EVAL-IN -LEXENV
At / scratch/src/sbcl/src/code/evallisp:93 ( file modified ) Local variables : ARG - 0 = ( BAR 3 1 ) ARG - 1 = #< NULL-LEXENV >
An improvement ?
That 's probably in the eye of the beholder , and depends on the codebase and the use cases .
For example I can imagine that for large functions showing the values of local variables in the trace would make it way too spammy .
But that 's besides the point : if the default stacktrace format is making debugging difficult for you , it 's not hard to customize it .
The open - source KDE desktop environment is making the jump across platforms with broad support for Windows and Mac OS X .
The core KDE desktop programs , the KOffice suite , and the Amarok music player are actively being ported .
These efforts are largely made possible by the inherent portability of Trolltech 's Qt development toolkit , the underlying framework used by KDE software .
Qt is designed for cross- platform portability and even uses native widgets on both Windows and Mac OS X . Trolltech uses a multi-licensing model that makes
Qt available under the GPL for open - source software development and requires programmers to buy a commercial license for proprietary development .
Previously , only Mac OS X and Linux / X11 versions were available under the GPL , but Trolltech decided to make the Windows version available under the GPL too with the introduction of Qt 4 .
This finally opened the door for porting open - source KDE applications to the Windows operating system .
There are also several key technologies in the KDE 4 stack that make the desktop environment more conducive to porting .
The most notable of these technologies are the Phonon multimedia abstraction layer and the Solid hardware wrapper library , which are both described in my recent review of KDE 4.0 .
The KDE development community 's adoption of CMake is another major factor that has contributed to the increased portability of the desktop environment .
KDE 's build system was previously based on Autotools , an intractably arcane and grotesquely anachronistic cesspool of ineffable complexity that makes even seasoned programmers nauseous .
The migration to CMake instantly simplified portability issues because CMake has very robust built - in support for generating makefiles for widely - used compilers on all three major operating systems .
CMake can even automatically generate project files for commonly - used IDEs like KDevelop , Visual Studio , and XCode .
After Alexander Neundorf performed the initial migration from Autotools to CMake for the core KDE libraries , it took developer Benjamin Reed only two days to get it to the point where it could compile on Mac OS X .
This was seen as a major breakthrough for portability .
Additional details about KDE's CMake adoption and the implications thereof can be found in an article written by Neundorf .
With the build system issues resolved , the last major hurdle was removing platform - specific code from the core libraries and major applications .
This work was mostly done by Holger Schroder and the aforementioned Benjamin Reed .
Schroder did much of the legwork for the Windows port and Reed worked on the Mac OS X port .
Their efforts are beginning to pay off and many KDE applications currently work surprisingly well on alternate platforms .
Running KDE on Windows
A new KDE snapshot release for Windows was issued yesterday , and the binaries are currently available from KDE mirrors .
A simple installation program allows users to select desired KDE packages and will then automatically resolve the dependencies , download , and install the necessary pieces .
I put it to the test on Windows XP in VMware to see how well it works .
My basic KDE installation on Windows used about 600MB and included the KDE games collection as well as the core applications and libraries .
Major applications are mostly functional with only minor rendering glitches and a few remaining platform - related bugs .
When I tested the Windows port of the Konqueror web browser , I noted many serious HTML rendering bugs , but the user interface worked flawlessly .
I also tested the Dolphin file manager , which had a number of minor issues .
For instance , the progress bar in the Dolphin status bar has some nasty rendering glitches and it can't figure out the path of the home directory .
Some of the applications , like the Kate text editor and many of the KDE games , worked almost flawlessly .
I 'm very impressed with the current progress of the Windows port and what I have seen of the Mac OS X port impresses me too .
The Mac OS X port is approximately 1GB and consists of universal binaries , which means that the applications will run on both Intel and PPC Macs .
For additional details about the Mac OS X port , check out this recent blog entry written by Reed .
The binaries can be obtained via BitTorrent from the KDE TechBase page for the Mac OS X port .

The Kate text editor running on windows
The Dolphin file manager running on windows
The Kmahjongg tile game running on windows
Presentations about cross-platform KDE support were amongst the highlights of the recent KDE 4 release event , which I attended last week at Google headquarters in California .
Reed is looking forward to engaging with the Mac OS X enthusiast community to help improve KDE support on Apple 's operating system .
He also expressed strong enthusiasm for CMake .
" Things just worked that I thought we would have to spend a lot of time working on , " said Reed at the event .
" A lot of things work out of the box right now . "
KDE developer Aaron Seigo also spoke about KDE 's cross-platform ambitions and discussed some of the broader implications .
Bringing popular KDE programs to Windows and Mac OS X is somewhat controversial in the open source software community , because doing so is seen by some as a means of eroding incentives for Linux adoption .
Seigo and many in the KDE community contend that making KDE applications available on other platforms brings more freedom and choice to Windows users and gives them the ability to adopt open standards and establish an easier migration path to Linux .
Broad support for Windows and Mac OS X is an ambitious goal , but the KDE development community appears to have made a very good start in that direction .
Many of the new abstraction layers in KDE 4 are geared towards increasing portability and reducing dependence on platform - specific mechanisms .
KDE definitely enriches the Windows and Mac OS X software ecosystems and will likely be welcomed by many .
It is also worth noting that the manner in which these porting efforts are being undertaken — with a largely uniform code base for all major platforms and very few instances where divergent code paths are used to resolve platform - specific issues in individual applications — is very positive because it will ensure that portability does n't detract from the quality of the applications or turn Linux into a second - class citizen .
I look forward to seeing how a stronger commitment to cross-platform compatibility will influence the evolution of KDE on the desktop .

African cultures that sing alike tend to be genetically similar .
Feel the rhythm : music is tightly tied to biology .
Punchstock
A study of 39 African cultures has shown that their genetics are closely linked to the songs they sing .
Music , it seems , could reveal deeper biological connections between people than characteristics , such as language , that change rapidly when one culture meets another , says Floyd Reed , a population geneticist at the University of Maryland in College Park , who led the study .
" Other aspects of these populations ’ cultures have undergone tremendous change , but the music seems to persist , " he says .
" In a way music is very resilient to cultural change . "
The work , presented late November at the American Anthropological Association ’s annual meeting in Washington DC , compares modern genetic data to a catalogue of traditional songs gathered in the 1950s and 1960s by ethnographer Alan Lomax .
Lomax , best known for his recordings of American folk music and his popularization of singers such as Woodie Guthrie and Lead Belly , collected some 5,500 songs from 857 cultures .
To reveal connections between musical styles , Lomax , who died in 2002 , and ethnomusicologist Victor Grauer created a system called cantometrics .
This classifies vocal songs based on a sliding scale for 37 traits , such as yodelling and tempo .
Victor Grauer , now retired and living in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , wondered whether their cantometric database could be fused with modern genetics .
Grauer contacted Sarah Tishkoff , a geneticist at the University of Maryland who studies human diversity .
She offered the project to her post - doc , Floyd .
“ At first I just dismissed it , I thought ' this is kind of nuts ' , ” Floyd says .
But after a night ’s sleep he decided it had potential .
Sing along
In the 1970s , Luigi Luca Cavalli - Sforza , a geneticist at Stanford University in California , argued that combining genetics with fields such as linguistics and demography could help trace human ancestry .
But Cavalli -Sforza had n't looked at how genes and songs travelled together across cultures .
To make this comparison , Floyd crunched through Lomax and Grauer ’s catalogue to convert the cantometric database into a two - dimensional scatter plot , with each dot representing a culture .
The closer two dots are , the more similar their music .
For example , the music of African bushmen cultures , such as the Juhoansi ( listen to Juhoansi audio clip ) , fell close to that of pygmy tribes such as the Aka ( listen to Aka audio clip ) .
Both include yodelling and a vocal trick called an interlock , in which people sing in tight succession .
Further away are styles by groups such as the Hutu ( listen to Hutu audio clip ) , who live in central Africa and sing in unison .
When Floyd compared the graph with a database of genotypes from more than 3,000 people in Africa , he found a correlation between genes and songs .
In other words , cultures that had grouped together musically tended to share genetic markers .
The link was stronger than the correlation between songs and geography : cultures next door to each other were n't as likely to sing the same tunes as were cultures with similar genotypes .

Measure that yodel
“ This is very cool stuff , ” says Erez Lieberman , a mathematical biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge who has analysed the evolution of language using darwinian principles .
He cautions that the method for scoring songs is quite subjective , making it difficult to use quantitatively .
“ How do you figure out the metrics of what 's yodelling and what 's not yodelling ? ” he says .
Floyd agrees that it is hard to quantify culture .
But he says he thinks that Lomax 's cantometrics must tap into something fundamental , since the statistical significance of the link to genetics is so high .
Taking an evolutionary perspective on song and language has the power to uncover how cultural traits travel the world , Lieberman adds .
Well , I 'm a pretty big fan of formal semantics , but at the risk of saying something controversial , I think pushing too far in this direction may be a red herring , Controversial ?
Just the opposite I would say , as hardly anyone actually wants to apply formal semantics to real problems .
It is my strong feeling that programming is , and will always be , at some level , a social undertaking .
First , are you making a prediction , or simply expressing a desire ?
Do you want to see formal semantics put to good use , or are you happier with it just being a game for pointy - headed people to occupy their time with ?
Second , I think that if you ask mathematicians about their work , many of them will say it has a strong social element .
Formal methods and social interaction are not an either - or proposition : that 's why , for example , people organize conferences on formal methods , coauthor papers with others on formal methods , and generally work together in groups on formal methods just as they do on software development projects or even , say , - cough - quilt - making .
Third , please pretend you have journeyed back in time to 1950 .
Eager to impress people with the development of future technology only you are aware of , you tell an acquaintance : " In half a century , things called `computers ' will make our lives much easier . "
" Golly , " your friend says --- because they said things like that back then ---" you mean you just tell them what to do and they do it for you , like everyone has their own robot servant or something ?
That sounds wonderful !
I would have him write all my school papers for me , and do my laundry and take out the trash , and answer all the questions about the universe which I could never figure out myself . "
You reply , " Well , uh , actually you would have to employ a specially trained person called a `programmers ' to tell the computer how to do specialized stuff like that ( and it ca n't answer all your questions for you anyhow ) . "
" Gee whiz , `programmer ' ?
That sounds awfully cold and intimidating .
What do they do , exactly , these `programmer ' - types , and how do they get the computer to do stuff ? "
" Well , they sit all day in front of a keyboard , typing in text written in a special , technical , formal language , which eventually translates into numbers , which the computer processes by arithmetic . "
Your friend starts looking queasy , so you hurriedly add : " Actually , it 's not as bad as you think , though : almost everyone in 2003 spends hours in front of a computer , reading mail messages , communicating via instant messengers , surfing the Internet , chatting electronically , and so on . "
" That sounds horrible ! " he says .
" Why , it 's the most inhuman thing I 've ever heard .
If I wanna talk to a friend , why , I 'll go over an ' pay him a call personal - like , so he knows I really wanna see him .
Or , if he 's too far away , I 'll write him a letter , in my own handwritin ' , so he can see I spent some time on him .
And the prospect of sittin ' in front of a machine every day for hours on end , why , it just sounds like the most lonely , isolatin ' thin ' I ever did hear .
An ' these `programmers ' sound like automatons , slave laborers in the most horribly repetitive and mind - numbin ' factory I can imagine !
Pushin ' numbers all day , prolly speakin ' in numbers too .
Are they even human ? "
" No , no !
It 's not like that , " you insist , " you can still see friends in person and still write real letters .
But that takes so long , and if you can do things more quickly via your computer , it just lets you communicate more ( and more often ) , so the upshot is mostly positive .
And , really , programmers are actually quite social .
Although they create things which are formal and technical in nature , the way they interact to get those results is organic and creative , though admittedly they have to follow some rules which are unavoidable and imposed by logic , or the computer , or the programming language itself . "
" Bah , I don ' believe you ! " says your friend .
" `Computers ' , `programs ' , `programmers '...
It all sounds like in your future them Russkies already done come over an ' turned our wonderful nation into some kinda authoritarian nightmare .
When'd you say you came from ?
1984 ?
Cough it up , you 're a commie , ai n't ya , boy ?
Tryin ' ta pervert our beautiful way of life with your ungodly ways .
Lemme tell you something , and lemme tell you so it 's crystal clear : we ain't never gonna let something like that happen in this here country , by God . "
OK , I got a bit carried away there at the end ... :)
The entire idea of name overloading is to take operations that are not , in the formal sense , precisely the same and draw an analogy between them .
At a very fundamental level , this involves a social convention , an understanding ( or guess , or theory , or whatever ) of who the other readers of the program will be ( including yourself at later times ) , the greater context of the code fragment in question ( language idiom , project idiom , stylistic choices ... ) , and so on .
I disagree .
Semantics often give more than one equivalence on things : in one sense they are different , but in another , coarser sense , they may be the same .
So I would restate your claim as :
The entire idea of name overloading is to take distinct operations that are in some formal sense the same and draw an analogy between them by giving them the same name .
For example , we use the same symbol for addition of integers and reals because the addition operation obeys the some of the same properties in both cases .
Are these two additions the same operation ?
Certainly not : they do n't even operate on the same sets .
But they are equivalent in the sense that they 're both commutative , associative , etc .
It would be pointless to identify operations ( in the same scope ) if there were no formal basis for the identification * , because the whole point of using symbols for things which are themselves not symbols ( the denotations of those symbols ) is to do formal manipulation .
*( There is one reason for doing this : when you do n't want to manufacture a new name . )
The social aspect here is the choice of name or symbol itself , for example whether you write addition as + or * or & or what - have - you , and , only in cases when it is sensible to do so , the choice of when to identify things rather than treat them distinctly .
In any case , I 'd like to state unequivocally that I 'm a strong believer in semantics for programming languages , and I 'm a strong believer in elegant language design .
I 'm just convinced that it's not a silver bullet , It 's not a silver bullet , but why does it have to be ?
Formal semantics wo n't do your cooking and cleaning or keep you company late at night .
So what ?
But in this case , it is not only applicable , but also far more successful at giving answers to questions than --- well , what is your alternative , anyway ?
Group discussion ?
Long , hard thinking ?
Prayer and finger - crossing ?
Those are approaches , not methods : is n't software development supposed to be an engineering discipline ?
I believe that sooner or later these issues of convention and interpretation will show up , because I think they 're basically built into the kinds of abstraction that programmers love so much .
Convention is one thing , but problems of interpretation are exactly what formal methods and semantics are designed to solve , and have been successful at solving in all other scientific and engineering fields .
I wo n't be watching President Bush 's " State of the Union " speech tonight .
And I 'll studiously avoid reading about it tomorrow .
Not because Bush is a lame duck - thank God for that .
But , because he a megalomaniac and a pathological lair .
You know how it works .
Whether it 's your friend , relative or acquaintance ; whenever you 've reached the conclusion that he / she is an inveterate liar , you simply stop listening to him / her , because he / she has lost all credibility and respect .
Actually , Bush never had my respect .
Instead , I marveled over how a punk child of privilege could drink and bluff his way through mediocrity and failure - whether it be in college , the Texas Air National Guard , private enterprise ( oil , baseball ) or as governor of Texas - and still emerge with the belief that " God wants me to be President . "
Once in office , America 's psychopathic president began to plot the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
Why ?
Because , Saddam was " the guy who tried to kill my dad . "
Unfortunately , while obsessing about Saddam the psychopath blew off intelligence indicating that Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda terrorists were preparing to strike the United States .
Of course , the psychopath then concealed his own personal negligence ( " As a leader , you can never admit a mistake . " ) , behind a puerile vow to " rid the world of evil " and a barrage of lies about Saddam Hussein .
Thus , in the two years following the 9/11 attacks , the Bush administration made some 935 false statements about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda .
Bush made 259 false statements , 231 about weapons of mass destruction and 28 about Saddam 's ties to al Qaeda .
Unfortunately , behind his lies was a psychopathy feeding off willful self - delusion .
Thus , according to Rev. Pat Robertson , who met with Bush in Nashville on the eve of the invasion , Bush " was the most self - assured man I ever met in my life … like a contented Christian with four aces . "
Robertson had deep misgivings about the war ( " The Lord told me it was going to be , A , a disaster and B , messy . " ) .
Thus , he told Bush : " Mr. President , you better prepare the American people for casualties . "
To which the psychopathic president responded : " Oh , no , we 're not going to have any casualties . "
[ Alan Cooperman , " Bush Predicted No Iraq Casualties , Robertson Says , " Washington Post , Oct. 21 , 2004 ]
Moreover , only a psychopath would pump his fist , as if kicking a game winning field goal , just moments before announcing that he had given the order to send America 's sons and daughters into harm 's way in Iraq .
" Feels good , " Bush said .
What the psychopath did n't know , however , was that the other psychopath , Saddam Hussein , was making his own plans for Bush 's invasion .
He ordered the reproduction of " more than three thousand copies of the film , Black Hawk Down " - the film documenting the chaos in Somalia that caused American forces to flee from that country .
Saddam had the copies distributed " among senior figures in the military , the Baath , the Mukhabrat , and a new home guard , the Fedayeen Saddam . "
The tape was accompanied by some very simple instructions : " Create chaos . " [ Geoffrey Perret , Commander in Chief , p. 352 ]
Shortly after the invasion , Senator Biden questioned Bush 's smug optimism about events in Iraq : " Mr. President , how can you be so sure when you do n't know the facts ? "
Bush put his hand on Biden 's shoulder and responded : " My instincts .
My instincts . "
Notwithstanding such instincts , widespread looting ravaged Iraq in April 2003 .
It was a critical indicator .
According to George Packer , the looting told Iraqis " that they could fight against us and we were not a serious force . "
[ Packer , The Assassin's Gate p.138 ]
Yet , within weeks of the looting , America 's psychopathic president was standing on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln telling the country that , as far as Iraq was concerned , it was " Mission Accomplished . "
Proud of his accomplishments , on June 4 , 2003 , the psychopath even boasted to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas : " God told me to strike at Al Qaeda and I struck them , and then He instructed me to strike at Saddam , which I did . "
[ Dilip Hiro , Secrets and Lies , p. 1 ]
As the military historian , Geoffrey Perret , has observed : " This is the language of no other commander in chief in American history . " [ .p 375 ]
In July , the psychopath would feel compelled to challenge the insurgents .
" Bring 'em on , " he told them from the safety of his office in Washington DC .
Accepting the challenge , in August the insurgents blew up the Jordanian Embassy and the UN headquarters in Baghdad .
The blossoming insurgency caused the gloves to come off , which meant that torture became the order of the day .
According to Professor Perret , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld " were making sure that torture would become inevitable and systematic . " [ p. 371 ]
Predictably , our psychopathic president denied that the U.S. was engaged in torture .
But , a November 14 , 2005 edition of Frontline , showed an army interrogator , Anthony Lagouranis , who asserted that torture occurred all over Iraq .
" The infantry units are torturing people in their homes .
They are using things like burns .
They smash people 's feet with the back of an ax head .
They break bones , ribs … serious stuff . "
[ Ibid , p. 372 ]
By November 2003 , America 's defeat in Iraq had become so etched in concrete that Israel 's former prime minister , Ehud Barak , gave Cheney the benefit of his experience as a career soldier : " You can not win an occupation .
All you can do now is choose the size of your humiliation , " [ p. 377 ]

Spurned by major newspapers , Dem Congressman takes ' impeach Cheney ' appeal to Web Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 14 , 2007

As the House Judiciary Committee continues to refuse any action on proposals to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney , three of that panel 's members tried to take their case to influential op - ed pages of the nation 's largest newspapers .
They were turned down by every one -- including the New York Times , Washington Post and Miami Herald -- so now one of the lawmakers has taken his campaign to the Internet .
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) on Friday launched a new Web site , WexlerWantsHearings.com to advance his call to impeach Cheney .
The site hosts an op - ed article rejected by the nation 's major newspapers and outlines the case for impeaching Cheney .
" The truth is the mainstream media have no interest in this issue , " Wexler said Friday .
" They have bought into the notion that impeachment hearings are outside the bounds of what the congress ought to be doing , " the six - term Congressman elaborated during a conference call Friday .
The House Judiciary Committee has before it a resolution introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) calling for Cheney 's impeachment and accusing the vice president of a raft of high crimes , including manipulating intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war , obstructing federal investigations and conspiring to expose the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said impeachment in strictly off the table , and the Judiciary Committee seems unlikely to move forward with any hearings .
Wexler encouraged impeachment supporters to sign a petition on his new site to allay the notions of Democratic leaders that impeachment supporters are little more than " a fringe , marginal group of people . "
Wexler said the House has the constitutional obligation to begin impeachment hearings to investigate malfeasance within the Bush administration , and he blamed the lack of enthusiasm thus far on the " bad taste " left by the GOP 's last impeachment crusade .
" People are just afraid that we would just be putting the shoe on the other foot and just doing ... what the Republicans did to Bill Clinton , " Wexler told the conference call , which was organized by Democrats.com .
The " kangaroo court " Republicans used to impeach Clinton , on grounds that he lied about his liaison with an intern , cannot become the precedent by which the constitutional tool is judged , Wexler said .
Although Bush and Cheney will be leaving the White House for good in 13 months , Wexler said impeachment hearings were necessary because of the need to ferret out possible criminality in the administration .
" We have to follow the evidence where it leads , " he said .
" We have an obligation to do it , and to do it as thoroughly as possible . "
Wexler posted the following video appeal on his impeachment Web site .
Editors note :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Wexler 's op - ed was censored by newspapers ; newspapers to which he and other lawmakers submitted the column simply declined to publish it
Ms Bligh was met with boos as she climbed onto the back of a ute to address the crowd , promising to hear the group 's concerns .
" I did just want to come out and say that I do understand that people have different views on this issue , " Ms Bligh told the gathering .
" I feel very strongly that this is the right thing to do . "
Screaming and chanting erupted from the crowd before Ms Bligh retreated back to Parliament House , swamped by protesters who blocked her path .
" We feel it 's the wrong thing to do - how about a referendum ?
How about democracy ? " one man screamed .
As she made her way through the mob , she was stopped by protesters who cited research statistics and posed questions about health and safety .
Politely explaining she was running late for Parliament , Ms Bligh remained tight - lipped .
She will meet with the group 's president and a naturopathic health specialist this afternoon .
New laws will be introduced into parliament this week to fast - track the introduction of fluoride into the state 's water .
Ms Bligh announced in December plans to end a 40 - year impasse that has left Queensland children with the nation 's worst teeth .
However QAWF claim forced fluoridation would mass - medicate four million Queenslanders in the face of legitimate health concerns .
As many as 40,000 people in the state could be allergic or intolerant to fluoride , naturopathic GP John Ryan said .
" ( The Premier is ) seeking to do to everybody what a doctor would not do to anybody ... what she 's seeking to do is treat every single person , " Dr Ryan said .
The government expects to have fluoride in south - east Queensland 's drinking water by the second half of the year .
Anti-fluoride campaigners are said to be exploring a legal challenge .
Foods of the kind that were consumed during human evolution may be the best choice to control diabetes type 2 .
A study from Lund University , Sweden , found markedly improved capacity to handle carbohydrate after eating such foods for three months .
During 2.5 million years of human evolution , before the advent of agriculture , our ancestors were consuming fruit , vegetables , nuts , lean meat and fish .
In contrast , cereals , dairy products , refined fat and sugar , which now provide most of the calories for modern humans , have been staple foods for a relatively short time .
Staffan Lindeberg at the Department of Medicine , Lund University , has been studying health effects of the original human diet for many years .
In earlier studies his research team have noted a remarkable absence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes among the traditional population of Kitava , Trobriand Islands , Papua New Guinea , where modern agrarian - based food is unavailable .
In a clinical study in Sweden , the research group has now compared 14 patients who were advised to consume an ‘ ancient ’ ( Paleolithic , ‘ Old stone Age ’ ) diet for three months with 15 patients who were recommended to follow a Mediterranean - like prudent diet with whole - grain cereals , low - fat dairy products , fruit , vegetables and refined fats generally considered healthy .
All patients had increased blood sugar after carbohydrate intake ( glucose intolerance ) , and most of them had overt diabetes type 2 .
In addition , all had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease .
Patients in the Paleolithic group were recommended to eat lean meat , fish , fruit , vegetables , root vegetables and nuts , and to avoid grains , dairy foods and salt .
The main result was that the blood sugar rise in response to carbohydrate intake was markedly lower after 12 weeks in the Paleolithic group ( – 26 % ) , while it barely changed in the Mediterranean group ( –7 % ) .
At the end of the study , all patients in the Paleolithic group had normal blood glucose .
The improved glucose tolerance in the Paleolithic group was unrelated to changes in weight or waist circumference , although waist decreased slightly more in that group .
Hence , the research group concludes that something more than caloric intake and weight loss was responsible for the improved handling of dietary carbohydrate .
The main difference between the groups was a much lower intake of grains and dairy products and a higher fruit intake in the Paleolithic group .
Substances in grains and dairy products have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of carbohydrates and fat in various studies .
" If you want to prevent or treat diabetes type 2 , it may be more efficient to avoid some of our modern foods than to count calories or carbohydrate , " says Staffan Lindeberg .
This is the first controlled study of a Paleolithic diet in humans .

A multi-millionaire but the new notes do n't buy much
Zimbabwe 's central bank is to introduce new higher - denomination banknotes in an effort to ease the critical shortage of cash in the country .
Zimbabwe has been in economic decline for the past eight years , with annual inflation widely thought to be in excess of 50,000 % .
The highest value note that will go into circulation on Friday is worth 10 m Zimbabwean dollars .
But that is worth less than US$ 3.90 ( £ 2 ; 2.60 euros ) on the black market .
The introduction of the new banknotes , or " bearer cheques " as they are officially called , is a further attempt to stabilise the Zimbabwean economy .
Hyperinflation
There have been long queues every day at banks as people have struggled to withdraw cash .
The government 's only response is to print more money - and that is seen as the main reason for the hyperinflation .
There have been no official inflation figures published for the past three or four months .
Zimbabwe 's Reserve Bank governor , Gideon Gono , has called on the business community not to increase prices every time new measures are taken to adjust the currency .
The new higher denomination bank notes are certain to cause more confusion and they may only bring short term relief .
In the meantime , many people have become dependent upon imported goods , there are still severe shortages of fuel and power supplies remain erratic .

Elections are sometimes portrayed as practically giving people automatic remote control on the government .
Elections kindly provide a chance for people to pre-program the government for the following years .
The government will be based on the popular will , regardless of the ignorance of the populace or the duplicity of the government .
President Lyndon Johnson declared in 1965 that  the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men . 
But the fact that voting rights helped undermine Jim Crow restrictions on blacks did not prevent the government from ladling new restrictions and burdens on all citizens .
During the election campaign the prior year , Johnson had promised ,  We are not about to send American boys 9,000 or 10,000 miles away to do what Asian boys ought to be doing to protect themselves .
The fact that parents could vote for or against Johnson did nothing to stop him from betraying his promise and sending their sons to die .
In his 1989 farewell address , President Ronald Reagan asserted ,
 We the People tell the government what to do , it does n’t tell us .
 We the people are the driver — the government is the car .
And we decide where it should go , and by what route , and how fast .
But the American people did not choose to drive into Beirut and get hundreds of Marines blown up , choose to run up the largest budget deficits in American history , provide thousands of anti-tank weapons to Ayatollah Khomeni , or have a slew of top political appointees either lie or get caught in conflicts of interest or other abuses of power or ethical quandaries between 1981 and 1988 .
On the eve of his 1992 election debacle , President George H.W. Bush told a Texas audience ,
And tomorrow , you participate in a ritual , a sacred ritual of stewardship … .
With your vote , you are going to help shape the future of this , the most blessed , special nation that man has ever known and God has helped create .
And so , look at your vote — especially the young people — look at your vote as an act of power , a statement of principle .
Yet few of the people who voted the following day were making a statement of principle in favor of permitting the president to deploy troops ( or additional troops ) abroad on his whim ( as Clinton did in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , Kosovo , and elsewhere ) , permitting the government to waive the Posse Comitatus Act and use military equipment against American civilians ( as happened at Waco ) , or permitting the government to vastly increase its surveillance of the American people .
Yet voting in the 1992 election was still  a statement of principle ,  regardless of how much the winner scorned the voters ’ principles .
Two days after his 2004 reelection victory , President George W. Bush declared ,
When you win , there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced your point of view … and the people made it clear what they wanted .
But did voters on November 2 consent to the destruction of Fallujah in the following weeks ?
Did they consent to the nomination of a Homeland Security czar who was openly hostile to any criticism of politicians ?
Did Bush ’s National Rifle Association supporters consent to his nominating a man for attorney general who advocated far more federal restrictions on gun ownership ?
Did voters consent to the illegal wiretapping of the chief of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency , as the Bush administration sought to discredit and remove an impediment to a U.S. war on Iran ?
If Bush had made ending tyranny everywhere via preemptive U.S. military attacks  the theme for his fall 2004 campaign , he very likely would have lost the election .
Instead , he downplayed this notion — until his second inaugural address .
The only way to suppose voters consented to such government actions is to assume they granted Bush boundless power to use as he sees fit .
But this is the type of consent given by people who forfeit their rights and accept a court - appointed guardian to run their lives .
Absolution through election
Politicians routinely invoke elections as absolutions .
Shortly before his second inauguration , a journalist asked Bush ,  Why has n’t anyone been held accountable , either through firings or demotions , for what some people see as mistakes or misjudgments  on Iraq ?
Bush replied ,
Well , we had an accountability moment , and that ’s called the 2004 election .
And the American people listened to different assessments made about what was taking place in Iraq , and they looked at the two candidates , and chose me , for which I ’m grateful .
An election victory expunges all abuses from the official record .
Unfortunately , the more ignorant and negligent the citizens , the easier it becomes for winners to invoke their election victories to shroud their abuses .
In the aftermath of the November 2004 election , the refrain from both politicians and editorial pages was that the result of the voting showed the will of the people .
But was it the will of the people to have to choose between George W. Bush and John Kerry , or between Al Gore and Bush , or between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole ?
( Third - party candidates provided good protest votes but could not block career politicians from office . )
That is like saying that it was the will of the Bulgarian consumer in communist times to choose between an unreliable , ramshackle Trabant from East Germany and an unreliable ramshackle Skoda car from Czechoslovakia .
Many American voters felt as frustrated by their choice of presidential candidates as did Eastern Bloc car shoppers in the 1980s .
The fact that voters expressed a preference for Bush or Kerry proves nothing about either candidate ’s being the will of the individual voter .
King Louis XIV of France declared ,  Kings are absolute lords and naturally enjoy the full and free disposal of all the possessions of their subjects .
The only way that the 2004 election could exonerate all of Bush ’s first - term actions is if voting levers are naturally vested with absolute power over everything .
Voting levers cannot legitimize violations of rights unless voters and election winners have the right Louis XIV claimed for kings to use and abuse everything in the nation .
Electing our despot
The average American voter had no recourse on November 2 , 2004 , to make the federal government obey the Constitution or keep the peace .
But this was the same situation the voters faced on November 7 , 2000 , November 5 , 1996 , and November 3 , 1992 .
Instead , each voter was merely asked to personally consecrate the continued violations of the highest law of the land by whoever won .
The current system of government is structured so that voters effectively have to vest near - absolute power in someone .
This is simply how the rulers and the establishment have fixed the game .
Any choice that would deny nearly boundless power to the rulers is kept out of the sunlight by the powers that be .
Bush ’s reelection symbolized that the Constitution is now far less of a restraint on presidential powers .
The torture scandal , the power to nullify all rights by using the enemy combatant label , and other gross abuses of power were not major issues in the 2004 presidential campaign .
Thus , the first - term abuses became the starting line for the second - term abuses .
Bush ’s reelection made clear that a president ’s proclaimed goals could exonerate his methods — thus largely obliterating many of the safeguards built in by the Framers of the Constitution .
But elections based on the winner ’s receiving unlimited power are based on far different principles than are elections in which winners remain subservient to the Constitution and the law .
This is the difference between voting for a master and voting for a chief law - enforcement officer .
America is far closer today to what the Framers dreaded — slavery by constitutional forms . 
The more power that voting levers confer , the more unreliable elections become as a mode of governance .
Instead of being antibiotics for the body politic , elections become simply another quack cure .
French historian Marc Bloch noted that , during the Middle Ages ,  the notion arose that freedom was lost when free choice could not be exercised at least once in a lifetime . 
The only freedom many people sought was to pick whose man they would become .
Medieval times included elaborate ceremonies in which the fealty was consecrated .
With current elections , people are permitted to choose whose pawns they will be .
Voting is becoming more like a medieval act of fealty — with voters bowing down their heads and promising obedience to whoever is proclaimed the winner .
What if being permitted to choose a master once every four years is the primary freedom left ?
Are citizens merely choosing whose vassal they will be ?
Many citizens today behave like slaves who spent their time wishing for a good master , rather than scouting up information on runaway routes .
America was born as a republic — with limited - government powers , carefully crafted checks and balances , and distinct roles for the people , for legislators , for judges , and for the executive branch .
Many Americans these days are content with  democracy  — regardless of how much of the strength and safeguards of the original Constitution have been lost .
 Representative government is a phrase far less prone to induce mass delusions than is democracy .
 Democracy  sounds like automatic pilot — that the government will serve the people simply because that is part of the mission statement .
In contrast , the term representative government sounds more hit and miss .
There is no transcendence in the term representative government — nothing to make people believe that government bureaus magically fulfill the rhetoric of presidential speech writers .
Representatives are merely representatives , not incarnations of the General Will or the voice of God.
Instead , they are usually simply people who preferred the pursuit of power to other ways of making a buck .
Even when representative government works tolerably well , it is difficult to inspire the representatives to do much more than hustle for their own reelection .

Details about the space shuttle may have been passed on to China
A 72 - year - old former Boeing engineer is accused of giving China details about the space shuttle and other aerospace programmes .
In a separate case , two men and a woman are accused of handing over US defence department documents about Taiwan .
A US justice department spokesman said the cases represented serious breaches of national security .
Spying charges
Chinese - born Dongfan " Greg " Chung , 72 , of California , faces charges including eight counts of economic espionage , conspiracy , and making false statements to FBI investigators .
Certain foreign governments are committed to obtaining the American trade secrets that can advance the development of their military capabilities
Kenneth Wainstein
Assistant Attorney General for National Security
The US justice department said Mr Chung , a naturalised US citizen , worked in the aerospace industry for about 30 years - mostly at Rockwell International and Boeing on the space shuttle programme .
It added that he retired in 2002 but was working for Boeing as a contractor until 2006 .
The charges claim he took Boeing trade secrets relating to the space shuttle , the C - 17 military transport aircraft and the Delta IV rocket for the benefit of China .
He is also said to have sent China 24 secret manuals relating to the B - 1 Bomber .
Mr Chung received instructions from Chinese officials from as early as 1979 , prosecutors said .
In a letter he sent back to China , he is reported to have expressed " a desire to contribute to the Motherland " , US Attorney Tom O'Brien told reporters .
Mr Chung is thought to have had links to Chinese - born engineer Chi Mak , who was found guilty of conspiring to export sensitive defence technology from the US to China last year , the justice department said .
If convicted , Mr Chung faces about 100 years in prison .
Taiwan focus
In a separate case , a defence department employee and two others are accused of passing US government documents and information to China .
The three suspects are Tai Shen Kuo , 58 ; Yu Xin Kang , 33 ; and Gregg William Bergersen , 51 .
Mr Bergersen , a weapons systems policy analyst for an agency within the defence department , was charged with conspiracy to disclose national defence information " to persons not entitled to receive it " .
Tai Shen Kuo and Yu Xin Kang are charged " with conspiracy to disclose national defence information to a foreign government " .
Mr Kuo has Taiwanese and US passports and is alleged to have cultivated a relationship with Mr Bergersen to get information including details of potential sales of US military goods to Taiwan , according to court documents .
Ms Kang , a Chinese national living in the US , ferried information between Mr Kuo and Chinese officials , prosecutors said .
Different styles
Mr Kuo and Ms Kang each face up to life in prison if convicted .
Mr Bergersen faces up to 10 years in prison .
Assistant Attorney General for National Security Kenneth Wainstein said the cases represented different styles of espionage , but both with the same objective .
" Certain foreign governments are committed to obtaining the American trade secrets that can advance the development of their military capabilities , " he said .
" Today 's case demonstrates that the justice department is equally committed to foiling those efforts through the arrest and prosecution of those who conduct economic espionage at the expense of our economic and national security . "
Heavy selling hit each Asian and European stock market as soon as it opened .
Some of Asia ’s easternmost exchanges , which had closed on Monday before the sharpest declines occurred in India and then Europe , suffered particularly steep drops .

The Japanese stock market dropped 5.7 percent , for the worst two - day loss in 17 years , while the Australian stock market tumbled 7.1 percent , its worst single - day loss in nearly two decades .
The Shanghai market lost 7.2 percent while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong plummeted 8.7 percent .
“ At this stage , you can say there is panic selling in the market , ” said Kwong Man Bun , the chief operating officer of KGI Asia Ltd. , a large Asian futures broker .
“ We do n’t think the Hang Seng index has found its bottom yet ; the index will continue to go down and will only find its bottom when external markets  namely , the U.S. market  stabilize . ”
Jane Coffey , head of equities at Royal London Asset Management in London , said there was some sense that the sell - off in global markets might have been overdone on Monday .
She said the partial recovery in Europe in the late morning had been in part fueled by the possibility that the Federal Reserve could act to cut interest rates , perhaps before the open on Wall Street , and that prediction was borne out .
One of the biggest losers on Monday and again on Tuesday was India .
Trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange was halted for an hour on Tuesday after the Sensex index dropped 11.5 percent shortly after the opening .
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram of India tried to soothe markets with a news conference .
“ My advice to investors is to stay calm , ” he said , adding that India ’s economy was slated to grow 9 percent this year and 8.5 percent next year .
Investors did not immediately heed his words , though , and when the market reopened the Sensex fell to more than 12 percent below Monday ’s close .
But the market rebounded sharply in the afternoon to show a loss of 5 percent .
Across the Asian region , government officials and economists alike blamed the selling on worries about the United States economy , while expressing lingering hopes that the region ’s economies would not suffer quite as much in the months ahead as the American economy .
Markets in the United States were closed on Monday for the observance of Martin Luther King ’s Birthday , but will open Tuesday morning .
DAVOS , Switzerland 
Over the years , the United States has fulfilled many roles at the World Economic Forum : dot - com dynamo , benevolent superpower , feared aggressor .
Now add wounded giant .
On the first day of the annual conference here , a parade of bankers , economists and government officials expressed deep fears about the faltering American economy  and blunt criticism , particularly of the Federal Reserve , which some blame for sowing the seeds of today ’s crisis .
For George Soros , the financier who made a fortune betting against the British pound , the slump now goes beyond subprime loans .
It signals a reordering of the postwar economy and the end of dollar dominance .
“ The current crisis is not only the bust that follows the housing boom , ” Mr. Soros declared .
“ It ’s basically the end of a 60 - year period of continuing credit expansion based on the dollar as the reserve currency . ”
One of the most common arguments I hear from the religious is that their beliefs and mine are the same .
They believe they know what the creator of the universe thinks and desires , and I think they are wrong .
They view these positions as having equal weight .
Let me try to illustrate how strange this is .
—
Imagine two people discover a ruined city somewhere while hiking in a remote location and come to find a huge number of things that do n’t make sense .
Neither of them are archeologists or otherwise specifically prepared to decipher the civilization .
They find doors in strange places , plates shaped like triangles , pottery in odd shapes , etc .
And the whole city is set up in a very strange way .
The roads loop back to themselves , there are abrupt stops in certain places — overall , the place just seems quite different than anything either of them have ever seen .
The first person says , “ This city was created by aliens .
They were 4 feet tall and spoke Hindi .
Their spaceship looked like a fireman ’s boot , and they are from the planet Zorba , which sits behind the moon — invisible and undetectable . ”
The second guy says , “ I think you ’re insane .
None of that is true . ”
“ Ah , well that ’s your belief . ” , says the first guy , “ You have yours , I have mine , and that ’s fine , but just do n’t go thinking that yours is superior . ”
—
In short , you ca n’t make outrageous claims as to the nature of reality without providing evidence , and then attempt to share equal ground with those who simply dismiss you as silly .
Remember , the 4 - foot tall aliens who spoke Hindi and lived behind the moon — that ’s all VERY SPECIFIC .
And they ’re claiming not that it ’s interesting , or that it ’s just fun to think about — they ’re claiming it ’s how the world actually works .
They ’re claiming it ’s reality .
Well , it ’s the exact same thing when someone says that the creator of the universe created his own son who he knew would die , sent him to earth to absorb all sin from humans , all of which he put there in the first place ( he had full control of the entire process , remember ? ) .
Throw in some snakes , virgin births , and some miracles for good measure — all of which have been in other religions long before Christianity .
For someone to say that these claims are false — just as with planet Zogra or a flying teapot near Mars — is NOT the same thing as saying they are true .
The responsibly lies with the believer of these very detailed and specific claims about reality , not with those who think they are preposterous . :

Q From Tim Nagle :
What is the origin of the expression nit-picking ?
A The phrase comes from the task of removing the tiny eggs of lice ( nits ) from someone ’s hair and clothing , a tedious activity that required close attention and care .
The word nit , which could also refer to the eggs of other insect parasites such as fleas , has been around in the language for as long as we have records ( it appears in Old English around 825 as hnitu , but it has relatives in most European languages and has been traced back to an Indo - European root , so ancient has been the association of such pests with human beings ) .
But what seems a little odd is that the figurative sense of nit-picking , of petty criticism or fault finding , is modern .
The Oxford English Dictionary records it first only in 1951 , in the form nit-picker , in this helpful explanation from Collier ’s : “ Two long - time Pentagon stand - bys are fly - speckers and nit-pickers .
The first of these nouns refers to people whose sole occupation seems to be studying papers in the hope of finding flaws in the writing , rather than making any effort to improve the thought or meaning ; nit-pickers are those who quarrel with trivialities of expression and meaning , but who usually end up without making concrete or justified suggestions for improvement ” .
The first of these two slang terms has died out , with the second taking on much of its meaning .
Why it took so long for this expressive figurative sense to appear is a small mystery .
Perhaps we had to wait for a time when the memory of the finicky nature of the task was still current , but when the need for it in industrialised countries had been greatly reduced through better hygiene and insecticides .
Or perhaps the image came not from humans , but from some natural - history programme about our simian relatives , who spend much of their time literally nit-picking as part of grooming .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz broke staff rules when he intervened directly in the personnel matters of his girlfriend even though he said he wanted no part in a deal to transfer her outside the bank , the head of a bank ethics panel at the time said on Tuesday .

In a statement to a bank committee examining Wolfowitz ’s role in arranging a high - paid promotion for his girlfriend , the former official , Ad Melkert , said it would have been better if Wolfowitz had instructed one of his deputies to handle the transfer for Shaha Riza , to avoid conflict of interest issues .
“ Contrary to what the staff rules allowed for , Mr. Wolfowitz ’s proposal explicitly insisted on the possibility of maintaining professional contacts with Ms. Riza , ” said Melkert , who has been at the U.N. Development Program since March 2006 .
“ He kept that opinion even after grudgingly following the advice by the ethics committee .
Thus , Mr. Wolfowitz denied that the general staff rules should be applicable to his particular situation , ” Melkert said .
In a late - night statement , the World Bank ’s overseeing board of directors , said the special committee had completed interviews on the matter and would now draw up a report .
The board expressed concern over the impact of the controversy on the poverty - fighting institution , which has been paralyzed since the issue exploded into the open a month ago .
“ The executive directors remain very concerned about the impact on the work of the bank group and are committed to the earliest possible resolution of the matter , ” the board said .
In his statement , Melkert said he decided to speak out when those speaking for Wolfowitz “ were intent on continuing to spread erroneous information ” about the ethics panel .
Wolfowitz , an architect of the Iraq war when he was U.S. deputy defense secretary , has accused his critics of conducting a smear campaign .
He contends he followed guidance offered by the bank ’s ethics officers in arranging Riza ’s promotion and transfer to an outside job at the State Department .
Wolfowitz said on Monday that the ethics panel would not accept his recusal and “ told me over my strong and repeated objections ” to address the issue .
But Melkert said the president of the World Bank -- and not its board or committees -- is responsible for staff matters .
GOOD FAITH ACTIONS
Melkert , the Dutch government ’s representative to the bank ’s board at the time , vowed he personally acted in “ good faith ” in trying to resolve the issue , saying he wanted to save the institution from “ a confrontational and embarrassing situation ” over its newly minted president .
Melkert said the ethics panel was not consulted , nor did it approve , the terms and conditions of Riza ’s transfer , which included a “ large initial pay increase . ”
Meanwhile , Wolfowitz continued to face calls for his resignation .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Democrat from Montana , said Wolfowitz should bow out before the bank ’s credibility was further damaged by the controversy .
“ It would be my hope , frankly , that Mr. Wolfowitz realizes that discretion is the better part of valor and finds a graceful way to no longer be president of the bank , ” Baucus told reporters at a state economic development conference .
Without the “ trust of the world ... it is very difficult for the bank to function as an institution , ” he said .
In calling for Wolfowitz to step down , Baucus joined other prominent Democrats , including presidential candidates Bill Richardson , a former U.N. ambassador , and John Edwards , a former U.S. senator and 2004 vice presidential nominee .
The controversy has raised questions over whether having only Americans head the World Bank should give way to a more transparent system based more on qualifications for the job .
What is there about utilitarians that makes them such miserabilists ?
The greatest happiness for the greatest number is the heart of their philosophy , but just try to find a happy utilitarian .
The first of them , Jeremy Bentham , was such a sourpuss that he seemed pickled in vinegar .
And in fact , he was , sort of .
His embalmed body ( pictured ) still sits in a cabinet in University College London , one of its principal tourist attractions .
He had no wife and no children .
The greatest of them , John Stuart Mill , made utilitarianism a mainstream philosophy .
But he suffered a nervous breakdown at the age of 20 , stole another man ’s wife and had no children of his own .
And while Peter Singer , the most notorious of contemporary utilitarians , may be a karaoke champ in private life , his writings suggest otherwise .
However , these are bit players in the drama of miserabilism compared with South African academic David Benatar , author of Better Never to Have Been : The Harm of Coming into Existence .
Although the book has not been widely reviewed in the popular press , it was published by Oxford University Press and has been presented as a serious contribution to the increasingly influential philosophy of utilitarianism .
Professor Benatar ’s thesis is that life is so horrid that we all would be better off had we never existed .
And not just us , but all sentient life .
He introduces his thesis with a Jewish witticism : “ Life is so terrible , it would have been better never to have been born .
Who is so lucky ?
Not one in a hundred thousand ! ”
But Benatar is serious .
“ The central idea of this book is that coming into existence is always a serious harm . ”
And , he continues , “ coming into existence is always bad for those who come into existence .
In other words , although we may not be able to say of the never - existent that never existing is good for them , we can say of the existent that existence is bad for them . ”
How does he reach this conclusion , which , even by his own reckoning , seems absurd and repellent ?
As a utilitarian , he calculates the benefits of existence by balancing benefits against harms .
What possible benefit could a non-existent person receive that would outweigh a pinprick of pain ?
Since most people find this hard to accept , Benatar spends a chapter demonstrating that “ human lives contain much more bad than is ordinarily recognised ” .
Given his distaste for life , why has he hung around so long ?
Hard to say .
Perhaps he agrees with American writer Dorothy Parker :
Razors pain you , Rivers are damp ,
Acids stain you ,
And drugs cause cramp .
Guns are n’t lawful , Nooses give ,
Gas smells awful .
You might as well live .
As you might expect , the extinction of the human race seems like an excellent idea to Prof B , although he acknowledges that it might be difficult for society to manage in a humane fashion .
However , if a couple of asteroids could be persuaded to collide with Earth , it would be a positive outcome for all concerned .
The 19th century German Arthur Schopenhauer is generally reckoned the most pessimistic of all philosophers , but in Benatar he has no mean rival .
For the South African has more than a philosophy , he has a practical bioethical program .
Although , as a libertarian , he acknowledges that people have a right to have children , he feels that it is generally unethical , since it brings them into a world of harm .
Supporters of abortion contend that women have a moral right to have abortions , but Prof B begs to differ : they have an moral obligation to have abortions , lest they add to the total amount of suffering in the world .
Needless to say , this applies to animals , too .
He describes his standpoint , somewhat defiantly , not as pro-choice , but as “ pro-death ” .
Philosophers have often inspired poets .
Epicurus had Lucretius ; Thomas Aquinas had Dante ; Shaftesbury had Pope ; Kant had Coleridge ; Mme Blavatsky had Yeats .
But I ca n’t think of a poet who could bear to warble on about Prof Benatar ’s vision .
Perhaps the novelist H.G. Wells comes closest .
In his classic The Time Machine , the Time Traveller goes so far into the future that all life is extinct :
“ All the sounds of man , the bleating of sheep , the cries of birds , the hum of insects , the stir that makes the background of our lives — all that was over .
As the darkness thickened , the eddying flakes grew more abundant , dancing before my eyes ; and the cold of the air more intense .
At last , one by one , swiftly , one after the other , the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness .
The breeze rose to a moaning wind .
I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me .
In another moment the pale stars alone were visible .
All else was rayless obscurity .
The sky was absolutely black . ”
Sounds like a great place to send Prof B for his Christmas holiday .
As one Amazon reviewer of Better Never to Have Been pointed out , “ you need a PhD to be this stupid ” .
Benatar ’s pessimism is the blind elaboration of the central utilitarian thesis : that good is a balance of pleasure and pain .
But everyday life gives the lie to this .
Utility is a soulless way to assess happiness and to know what is good .
You do n’t have to be a martyr to realise that the pain of raising children is amply compensated by their love .
Or that the pain of work is outweighed by the joy of achievement .
Or that a sunrise over Everest obliterates the pain of climbing there .
Are these watertight refutations ?
No , and , to be fair , Benatar deserves a few rounds of philosophical fisticuffs with a fellow academic .
But common sense is enough .
The great Samuel Johnson was once challenged to counter Berkeley ’s theory that matter was a figment of our imagination : “ I never shall forget , ” says his biographer Boswell , “ the alacrity with which Johnson answered , striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone , till he rebounded from it , ‘ I refute it THUS . ' ”
Nonetheless , Better Never to Have Been has its own utility .
It unveils “ the greatest good of the greatest number ” as the secret password of nihilism .
And it is a lesson in intellectual history : after two centuries , the bitter streams gushing from Bentham and Mill have finally trickled into the Dead Sea of the University of Cape Town philosophy department .
Anyone toying with the seductive arguments of Peter Singer and his ilk should read it .
There they will see what happens when the precepts of utilitarianism are taken to their logical conclusions .

One of the reasons it ’s hard to convince Congress Members to support opening Cheney impeachment hearings is that they are not fully aware of the level of support among the public for impeaching the least popular vice president in history .
There have been very few mainstream national polls done on the topic , primarily because polling companies have not done them on their own ( or not published the results ) and have refused to do them for money .
The few polls that have been published are posted here .
Now , widely respected polling company Zogby International has agreed to allow OpEdNews.com to commission a poll question in a national telephone poll .
The question Zogby has agreed to ask is one that has never been asked before .
It corresponds to the effort being led in the House Judiciary Committee by Congressman Robert Wexler here .

I ’ve whipped up meals in fancy copper saucepans , in battered woks , and in my grandfather ’s old iron skillet , but never before have I used a syringe to make dinner .
There I was , feeling like a cross between a superstar chef and a crack addict , madly jabbing a needle into a scrunched - up pouch of freeze - dried NASA shrimp cocktail , injecting a bit of water , and watching the water dribble uselessly back out .
Welcome to space — the final food frontier .
Since the days of Project Mercury ’s squeeze tubes , the food scientists at Johnson Space Center have come back to Earth a bit .
Astronauts flying the space shuttle or working the International Space Station ( ISS ) can choose among 180 food and beverage items .
Their menus are routinely reviewed by nutritionists — but rarely by food critics .
That ’s where I come in , to investigate an oft - overlooked but essential aspect of life in space .
With a dozen rations to reconstitute before me , I wished the good folks at NASA believed in packaging instructions as fervently as they do good nutrition .
Astronauts cook by fitting a packet of freeze - dried food onto a needle - tipped rehydration station , or heating a thermostabilized food pouch in a briefcase - shaped electric warmer .
A pair of scissors — in space , more useful than a fork and spoon — opens the pouch , and a Velcro disk on the bottom anchors it to the meal tray .
Lacking NASA ’s food preparation equipment , I made do with saucepans of simmering water and a 60 - milliliter syringe supplied by the space agency .
The freeze - dried packages tersely list , in English and Russian , the name of the food , how much water to use , and how long to let it sit in its bath .
I learned the hard way that they ’re double packed , with an inner pouch that looks sort of like the IV bags used in hospitals , and that the needle has to go into a specialized inlet that allows water to enter but lets nothing out .
My shrimp cocktail ’s inlet was hiding among the tails , and I managed only to irrigate the space between the bags .
Finally I just cut open the freeze - dried packages and poured in the water .
Food scientists , not chefs , are in charge of NASA ’s space meals .
Portability and shelf life are as important as flavor and nutrition .
Not that flavor matters much : Aromas do n’t waft upward toward the nose in space .
Bodily fluids do , though .
They puff up the astronauts ’ features into a Charlie Brown face that makes it hard to smell ( and therefore taste ) .
Space food is n’t restaurant cooking ; it ’s not even takeout .
If anything , it ’s more along the lines of a frozen dinner — but you get bigger portions from the frozen - food aisle .
I could easily have downed two packages of the shrimp cocktail , long an astronaut favorite .
The six medium - size orange shrimp were just a touch chewy after their slapdash , 10 - minute water bath , but they looked and smelled like what you get at the supermarket .
NASA ’s cocktail sauce is spiked with plenty of horseradish and salt .
If anything can revive tired taste buds in space , this dish is it .
I chased it with a pouch of powdered mango - orange drink .
The lush but tangy mango flavor juiced up the orange ’s sweetness , and the mango aroma was pronounced .
It was delicious .
Aromas do n’t waft upward toward the nose in space .
bodily fluids do , though .
In deference to the international character of the space station , NASA has raided menus ( or food courts ) from around the world .
For a south - of - the - border dinner , I gathered pouches of beef fajitas , black beans , and tortillas .
The beans managed to be soft without getting all mushy , and they were seasoned enough to enliven the bland tortillas .
But no amount of black beans could rescue the fajitas , two soggy rectangles of meat so uniform in shape it was as if they had been spit from a machine .
The beef had a tender , brisketlike texture but none of the slow - cooked flavor you ’d expect .
I pined for a spoonful of picante sauce .
My Mexican meal ended with a four - pack of Lorna Doone cookies and some dried peaches .
Ironically , the peaches were meatier than the beef , with an intense flavor and a satisfying chewy texture .
The Asian - themed entrée sounded promising , but my hopes were dashed when I peeked into the pouch .
The precut chicken pieces were a strange pinky - beige color , sort of an avian version of Malibu Barbie .
The chicken was as tender as the beef fajitas , but the big problem was lack of flavor .
The chicken was paired with a gummy wad of skinny noodles and some carrot slivers .
The peanut sauce was a clunker too .
Despite a healthy dose of black pepper — the liquid kind sticks to food in zero gravity — the sauce seemed dull and overprocessed .
Fortunately , an all - American dessert came to the rescue .
The thermostabilized cranapple cobbler was a homey thing , sort of like chunky pie filling looking for a crust .
Roughly mashed apples were tossed with some cranberries , lots of sliced almonds , and cinnamon .
It was ugly , but for once I was n’t left feeling cheated about the portion size .
The almonds really made the dessert by giving it some crunch , although the spicing needed more complexity and the apples could have been sturdier .
The food scientists had also sent two breakfast items , freeze - dried “ Mexican ” eggs and a sausage patty .
The eggs , colored a bright buttercup yellow , were bouncy and broke down into small , dry curds .
Flavorwise they were like a reluctant suitor , vaguely sweet but unwilling to make the full taste commitment .
Hot sauce , ketchup even , would work wonders here .
Nothing , however , could have saved the sausage patty .
For solace , I turned to drink : NASA ’s tea with lemon and sugar ( no alcohol is offered in space ) .
It had a good , strong lemon flavor , identical to the jarred powdered teas found in every supermarket .
I could see why such a recognizable flavor would matter in space :
It tasted of home .
“ When crew members come back , they ’re ready for some home cooking , ” says Vickie Kloeris , manager of the center ’s Shuttle and ISS Food Systems .
So was I .

Weak Dollar Airbus , VW Headed to America
With the dollar as weak as ever , European companies are trying to avoid disaster .
Factories in North America are becoming more attractive , and over the weekend , both Airbus and VW hinted they might take the plunge .
Here is the Euclide Core 3 Processor Kit , Core 3 Trio .
That could be a big sensation .
A new triple core processor appeared in Russia .
Look at the package and it ’s contents on those pictures .
It promises triple performance for all things you usually do .
It ’s name is Euclid Core 3 .
Yes vodka in Russia is now being sold as a triple core CPU .
That might be a special appeal for Russian and worldwide geeks .
“ It was a ghastly thing , truly horrible to look at .
I could barely even take pictures of it . ”
This quote could easily have been overheard at , say , the scene of a terrible crime or a tragic accident .
Unfortunately for Mercedes - Benz , I overheard this little gem in the press lounge when the subject turned to the technology - laden F700 design study .
During its theatrical press conference — complete with gyrating dancers and extravagant lighting display — Mercedes rolled 19 concept cars and production vehicles onto its stand .
However , the F700 was undeniably the star of the occasion .
This is with good reason , as the F700 packs some very advanced technology under its controversial skin .
Despite being nearly the same length as the top - of - the - line Mercedes S - Class sedan , the F700 is powered by a 238 horsepower 1.8 - liter 4 - cylinder engine .
This is almost half the size of the smallest engine presently available in the current S - Class .
Called the Diesotto , this engine employs turbocharging , direct fuel injection , and extremely precise control of the combustion process to produce V - 6 levels of power with 4 - cylinder economy .
Mercedes says that the F700 is capable of 44.3 miles per gallon — a very impressive figure for a car of this size .
There ’s even more wizardry in the Pre - Scan suspension system , which packs two laser sensors mounted alongside the headlights .
While driving , these lasers send pulses onto the surface of the road ahead .
Measurements are taken , and the information is passed along to the hydraulic suspension .
In short , the F700 can react to a pothole before it even reaches it .
The cabin also has some novel features , like individual seating positions in which passengers ( though hopefully not the driver ) can turn their seats to face each other or rearward .
A driver can also “ discuss ” items like satellite navigation input with a customizable avatar , an electronic personal assistant .
So the F700 is n’t short on hardware .
Yet Mercedes might have been better served putting this gadgetry into a cardboard box .
With few exceptions , the design of the F700 is what got tongues wagging in Frankfurt .
From the front , the bulging fenders and bold grille look like what we might see on the next - generation S - Class .
From there on back , things get a little odd .
It seems that the Mercedes designers borrowed styling elements from all over the automotive landscape .
The side window treatment is very much in line with the current Mercedes CLS sedan , but the split window rear sunroof apes a 1963 Corvette and the lumpy tail seems bizarre .
Personally , I sort of like it .
Or at least I ’ll forgive it some stylistic faults for the cool technology lurking within .
But from what I overheard , very few journalists were in quite as forgiving a mood .
After breakfast and the morning update , the boss had meetings and briefing for the next 6 hours …
I did n’t have a computer around so I decided to write a letter …
[ Note : I typed up this letter after handwriting it , and I am mailing it to 100 voters in every state before their primary , from Iraq ]
Dear Voter ,
My name is Joe .
I am currently serving in my second deployment to Iraq as an Army officer .
The biggest differences between this deployment and my last one are :
- The location ( within Iraq )
- The Job ( much busier : less free time / sleep )
- The duration ( last deployment was 12 months , this one is 15 )
I am sure you are wondering why some random soldier in Iraq would write you a letter … there are several reasons , but the primary one will be obvious by the end .
The only reason I state my affiliation with the military is so you understand that I have a credible perspective .
First I ’ll tell you a little about myself .
I ’m 26 years old , I ’ve been married for almost 7 years , and I have a son and a daughter in elementary school .
I grew up in Georgia , but I live in Colorado Springs now .
I come from a long line of military officers , so I was sort of “ destined ” to serve .
Although I only have 3 ½ years in the Army , I ’ve been wearing the uniform for 12 years ( JROTC & ROTC ) .
I have a degree in computer science and I ’m a music & movie enthusiast .
Now that you know a little about me , I ’d like to inform you on what Iraq is really like .
Iraq is a war - torn country in political and engineering shambles .
When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 , the intent was to remove Saddam Hussein from power .
Once that was done , the military then targeted all Ba’athists ( members of Saddam ’s political party ) because they were assumed to be loyal to Saddam .
The problem with this “ eradication ” was the Ba’athists were the people who managed Iraq ’s infrastructure .
So our targeting caused the collapse of all of their water , power , sewage , oil , and transportation capabilities !
Also , because we dismantled their military , there was nobody to guard all of the thousands of artillery rounds and bullets that we stock - piled from Saddam ’s Army .
Where do you think the insurgents & terrorists got all of their weapons , ammo , and IED material to attack U.S. troops ???
These are second - order effects of the U.S. policy to intervene in foreign countries .
While our intentions might be good , Americans would be better off minding our own business and using diplomacy and trade to influence other nations .
Considering that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have both stated that Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks on September 11th , 2001 , why did we invade Iraq ?
And why is the number of deployed troops significantly larger in Iraq than any other country ??
Iraqis ( and most middle - easterners in general ) are used to having a dictator .
The cultures of that region have a long history of authoritarian rule .
Iraq had a dictator before Saddam Hussein , and they will likely resort to a dictatorship when we leave .
They do n’t care about democracy , they just want peace .
( This is not my conclusion , those are the words of the Iraqis I ’ve talked to during my time here . )
And the truest assessment that nearly all politicians , generals , diplomats and bureaucrats agree on is :
You cannot find a military solution to a diplomatic / political problem .
“ The surge is working . ”
In recent months , attacks have gone down .
Many soldiers are shocked at how long it has been since they hit an IED in certain locations , or received incoming mortar rounds hit their camp .
While there is a correlation ( more troops , less attacks ) there is no causation .
Also , most of the influx of troops have been placed in Baghdad … this increase in volume simply displaced the “ terrorists ” and insurgents into areas surrounding Baghdad !
Since the surge began , there have been more innocent , non-combatant Iraqis killed and more soldiers have died .
We have had 3 suicides in 2 weeks !!
Do you think the Army attracts suicidal people ?
Or perhaps the cost of carrying out U.S. foreign policy is making soldiers suicidal ( 15 month deployments , deployment extensions , stop - loss program , etc. ) …
How can anyone justify the deaths of thousands of people with optimistic predictions based on premature statistics ?!?
The truth is : the country is still war - torn , people are still attacking U.S. troops and our military is still occupying their country .
Studies have proven that the primary reason for suicide ( terrorist ) attacks is occupation .
The U.S. grows a lot of corn and wheat – What would Americans do if a foreign country that clearly consumes massive amounts of corn & wheat invaded the United States to free Americans from the tyrannical regime of President Bush , and set up bases around America ??!
Would you believe that they only invaded to remove Bush from power ?
Would n’t We Fight THEM ?!?!
Most American Soldiers , Sailors , Marines , and Airmen signed their contract because they wanted to defend the United States .
We all swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
How can we defend America and protect her Constitution from the other side of the world ?!
We can’t .
That is why I implore you to help keep America worth fighting for …
Even if it is something as simple as voting in your state ’s primary election , calling your senator to voice your opposition to a bill , or telling your friends and family to vote and contact their senators .
There is a candidate who is running for President that breaks the typical mold of a corrupt politician .
Not one single time , in his 17 years in Congress , has he voted to raise taxes .
He served his country as a flight surgeon on the Air Force , he is a medical doctor who has been married for ever 50 years , and he never votes “ yes ” on legislation unless it is expressly permitted by the Constitution .
There is a candidate who is running for President that backs up his words with actions .
Every stance he takes is backed by legislation he has proposed in Congress .
He opposed invading Iraq because the method Congress wanted to use was unconstitutional .
Even though he did not want to invade a country that posed no threat to the U.S. , he still proposed a Declaration of War on Iraq just so the invasion would be Constitutional .
He has the largest following of real people across the world , yet he is selectively marginalized by main - stream media .
He recently broke the record for most donations received in a single day ( over $ 6 Million ! ) , and somehow he is still proclaimed to be “ a long shot . ”
Most importantly :
He is the only candidate running for President who voices genuine , consistent concern for the Constitution , the economy , foreign policy , and Liberty .
That candidate is RON PAUL .
The facts I ’ve mentioned are the reasons that Ron Paul has more campaign donations from Active Duty Military and Veterans than any other candidate .
The current conditions in Iraq are the unpredicted effects of a flawed foreign policy .
The most likely ( and noticeable ) result of a Ron Paul presidency will be a more secure and prosperous America , because the military would defend the U.S. instead of being used as a world police force , and the money not spent overseas would dramatically improve America ’s economy .
The reason that I hold Ron Paul in such high esteem is not because he is experienced , or eloquent , or because he seems “ like he can beat Hillary . ”
I support Ron Paul because I swore an oath to defend the Constitution , and Ron Paul is the only one running for President who cares about it .
( It ’s also likely he is the only one who reads it ! )
It is Ron Paul ’s message of freedom that draws thousands of people to hear him speak and donate their time & money to his campaign .
Ron Paul is a proven man of principle who does n’t cater to special interest groups .
His number one concern is the very thing that made America such a desired place to live :
FREEDOM
I am open to answer any questions you may have about Iraq , Ron Paul , my life , history , politics , religion , philosophy , quantum theory , or whatever else you ’d like to know .
I will vote for Ron Paul in Colorado ’s primary election this February .
I hope you will find out when your state primary election is and vote in it .
When you cast your vote , please consider how it will effect the soldiers who implement the foreign policy .
And if you choose to vote for someone other than Ron Paul , I will still respect you for choosing to vote … it ’s more than many Americans do .
I just hope that you are prepared to live with the second and third - order effects of your decision .
But please Do Something to help keep Americans free , so that soldiers like me have something worth fighting for .
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter .
In Liberty ,
Captain Joe

Of course I hand - write the addresses on the envelope , and each letter is personalized and has my real name ( which I choose not to post here ) .
… We flew back early evening and I went back to the office to learn more of my job while the boss went to more briefings .
Did n’t get into bed until around midnight again .
Damn , and I thought I worked long hours in garrison !
I work 4 - 8 hours MORE each day here !!
But at least I get to climb into a real bed each night … thousands of other soldiers in this country do n’t get that luxury …
From the 1970s the economy stalled while Europe faced numerous social problems .
And yet as the cold war ran down the clock , it became gradually clearer that liberal democracy and a market economy mitigated by welfare had won a complete political victory over “ actually existing socialism . ”
At the same time Europe was fully “ civilianized ” : conscription was abandoned , armies themselves assimilated the values of civilian society and , as the great English military historian Michael Howard has put it , “ death was no longer seen as being part of the social contract . ”
But life is full of surprises .
Sheehan ’s book is sprinkled with confident but foolish predictions , like H. N. Brailsford averring in the early summer of 1914 that “ there will be no more wars among the six great powers , ” or The Economist in September of that year dilating on “ the economic and financial impossibility of carrying out hostilities many more months on the present scale .
” Just over 70 years later , as cocksure as ever and as wrong , that magazine asserted in 1985 “ that nothing much will have changed by the year 2025 . ”
Shortly after those words were published , the Berlin Wall fell , the Soviet empire imploded and savage violence consumed the Balkans , whence so many of Europe ’s woes had long stemmed .
Here Sheehan is most sagacious .
He sees that the game was up for the Soviet regime the moment Gorbachev disavowed “ force and the threat of force , ” and he gets the break - up of Yugoslavia right .
In late 1991 , at the insistence of the German government ( itself egged on , one might add , by Serb - bashing right - wing columnists in papers like The Frankfurter Allgemeine ) , the European Union recognized the sovereignty of Slovenia and Croatia , and then Bosnia , crucially and disastrously before the nationality questions in those territories had been resolved .
This encouraged a competitive round of territorial acquisition and ethnic expulsion and “ intensified the predatory war being fought by Serbs and Croatians against Bosnia . ”
It was of course ludicrous as well as hubristic for Jacques Poos , foreign minister of Luxembourg , to say at this juncture that “ the hour of Europe has dawned , ” but trans -Atlantic denunciations of European weakness were also misplaced .
When the tub - thumpers of Capitol Hill and the op - ed pages were asked 15 years ago what kind of military intervention in the Balkans they had in mind , it turned out to mean American air cover while the Western Europeans provided the P.B.I. , as the British Army used to say , the poor bloody infantry , a division of labor that had little appeal in Europe .
What sense does “ Mars and Venus ” have in the light of the past century , and the price paid by different countries ?
In 1914 - 18 , 1.3 million Frenchmen ( those cheese - eating surrender monkeys ) were killed defending their country , which is to say more than twice as many as all the Americans who have died in every foreign war from 1776 until today .
There has been much anguish about American casualties in Iraq , where last year was the worst since 2003 , with all of 901 deaths .
Reading that , the European may reflect silently on the dates Aug. 22 , 1914 , when 27,000 French soldiers were killed in a day , or July 1 , 1916 , when 20,000 British troops died .
It is n’t necessary to agree with Evelyn Waugh writing to his friend Graham Greene 
“ Of course the Americans are cowards .
They are almost all the descendants of wretches who deserted their legitimate monarchs for fear of military service ”  to see clearly that the United States is n’t a warlike country at all .
In many ways it has always been more deeply peaceable in its instincts than ever Europe was .
And is the civilianization of Europe such a bad thing ?
Although there has been much grumbling about the Bundeswehr ’s inadequate contribution in Afghanistan , some of us cannot see it as an occasion for pure regret if the Germans have changed character so drastically .
In World War II , the Wehrmacht was unquestionably the best army , man for man and unit for unit , not least against the less ferocious “ citizens in uniform ” of the British and American Armies .
Is that really a cause for British or American shame ?
When German rearmament began in the 1950s , at American urging , Gustav Heinemann resigned as Adenauer ’s interior minister , with the words , “ God took arms out of our hands twice ; we must not take hold of them a third time . ”
Was he so wrong ?
First Computer Programmers Inspire Documentary
First computer programmers were women ; they figured it out without manuals .
Dec. 4 , 2007  --
At 83 , Betty Jean Jennings Bartik -- a devoted bridge player and grandmother of five -- had a secret past that was invisible to many who knew her .
Her grandson
Alex knew her story .
He stormed out of school one day when his teacher refused to believe his gray - haired granny was a computer pioneer who had calculated firing tables and ballistic trajectories during World War II .
The boy 's parents had to explain to the teacher that Bartik and five other women had , indeed , legally hacked the world 's first programmable computer , converting it into a stored machine and eventually helping to usher in the digital age .
" She was dumbfounded , " said Bartik .
So , too , were the historians , who for a half century never acknowledged the wartime contributions of the six women who programmed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer ( ENIAC ) and made programming easier and more accessible to those who followed .
In 1945 , Bartik was one of a handful of female math majors at what was then Northwest Missouri State Teachers College .
The feisty 20 - year - old farm girl knew only one thing :
She did n't want to teach .
As the war came to a close , the Army had run out of male mathematicians .
Bartik answered a recruitment ad for women " computers " in a classified project at the Aberdeen Proving Ground operations at the University of Pennsylvania .
" I wanted to do something exciting and adventuresome , " she told ABCNEWS.com .
" I wanted to get to the big city and see what life was like . "
Ignored by History
Bartik went on to help program the BINAC for Northrop Aircraft Company in 1949 and design logic for UNIVAC I , the first commercial computer delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951 .
After that , she took time off to raise three children , but then returned in 1967 to help businesses understand the new microcomputers .
Her personal story -- a sort of Rosie the Riveter meets Bill Gates -- recalls the enormous talent women have brought to computer technology and illustrates the challenges today 's women face in what 's still a male - dominated field .
Many say their story is especially timely , because the already low numbers of female computer scientists are dropping , posing a new threat to the nation 's global competitiveness .
For decades , Bartik and her colleagues were ignored by computing history .
At the 40th anniversary of the ENIAC project at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 , the women were initially not invited -- only one was on the list as a spouse .
But now , a documentary film -- " Invisible Computers : The Story of the ENIAC Programmers " -- will chronicle their groundbreaking stories .
" The documentary is n't just about the history , " said executive producer and ENIAC Programmers historian Kathy Kleiman , an Internet lawyer from Northern Virginia , who is fundraising for the project , " but how these programmers provided role models to really inspire women to believe that computer careers were within their reach . "
Susan Hadary , a Maryland documentary producer , will help Kleiman produce a multimedia film that explains not only how ENIAC worked , but to give long - awaited recognition to the ENIAC women .
Kleiman , a former Wall Street programmer , has spent years recording their oral histories .
Three of the women -- all in their 80s -- are still alive .
" There were few women in my college classes , " said Kleiman .
" Few people had exposure before college and they did n't think they could do it .
I saw a block that began to trouble me . "
As student at Harvard University in 1985 , Kleiman began research for a history paper on women in computing .
" I did n't think I 'd hit the 40 - page word limit , " she said .
" I found nothing . "
While reading a biography of an Army captain who found funding for ENIAC , Kleiman discovered a 1940s photo of women at a 9 - foot tall computer .
A computer historian told her those were " just refrigerator ladies " who had been posed in front of the machine " to make it look good . "
' Tracked Them Down '
" They looked knowledgeable to me , and I made it my job to track them down , " said Kleiman .
In fact , working on ENIAC required physical stamina , mental creativity and patience .
The machine was enormous , with an estimated 18,000 vacuum tubes and 40 black 8 - foot cables .
The programmers used 3,000 switches and dozens of cables and digit trays to physically route the data and program pulses .
Bartik tells how she had great male mentors , like science giants J. Presper Eckert , Richard Clippinger and John Mauchly .
But in the in the second half of her career , while working in business , she experienced subtle discrimination .
" I would go to a meeting with men where I was usually the only woman , and I would make a suggestion , and no one would say anything , " said Bartik .
" If a man said something , they would jump all over him . "
That atmosphere still persists , according to Bartik .
" There 's still a glass ceiling . "
Figures from the National Science Foundation show women earn more than half of all bachelor 's degrees in science , yet fewer than 25 percent take computer science .
By comparison , women represent 59 percent of all graduates in biology and agricultural sciences and 47 percent of math degrees .
Experts say that these numbers do not bode well for the burgeoning Internet technology industry , and could be catastrophic .
" Women are canaries in the coal mine , " said Claudia Morell , director of the Women in Information Technology at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , signaling a decline in the American IT work force overall .
" This is about getting the best and the brightest people , " said Morrell .
Seeking talented women " makes good economic sense , " she said .
" It 's good for business and it 's good for women . "
Morrell and others say women have found careers in computing socially isolating and unwelcoming .
Those who do stick with computing in college and enter the workplace find they are in a " masculine world , " often patronized and uncomfortable .
Opening Doors
" We 'd like to get the doorways open and let them push through , " said Morrell .
The filmmakers hope the ENIAC story will dispel some of the " geeky " stereotypes that have dissuaded women from computing .
All young women see is " the nerdy kid with glasses , " said David Leighton of Women in Technology International ( WITI ) , which " helps companies understand the business value behind women . "
WITI inducted the ENIAC women into its Hall of Fame in 1997 and sees them as role models for leadership in today 's global economy .
" The way women lead is advantageous , " said Leighton .
" They have better interpersonal skills and build consensus and work horizontally across multiple organizations . "
The challenge is how to recruit women , according to Shirley Malcom , director of education for American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" I want people who are smart and solve problems , " she said .
" You have to be able to nurture talent and be eager to point to opportunities . "
" It 's not all about the machine , " Malcom tells young women , encouraging them to learn technology to address issues like global warming , voting and monitoring nuclear arsenals .
" Women are drawn to social issues and impact rather than being interested in the machine as a puzzle . "
Unlike men , women pay attention to detail and tend to get the job done , she said .
" They are more willing to do whatever it takes , " said Malcom .
" Men want to delegate the nasty part of the job , like handing off the baby when it 's number two . "
' Do What You Love '
Those qualities were a key to ENIAC 's success , according to Bartik .
" We were given responsibility because we were good finishers .
We looked at the whole job . "
Today , Bartik lives in New Jersey and , after the incident with her grandson Alex 's teacher , she visits schools to tell her story .
Keeping up with technology , she plays bridge online and chats with other women in computing on listserves like Systers , which is run by the renowned Anita Borg Institute .
Bartik also stays involved her alma mater , now Northwest Missouri University , which named its computer museum in her honor .
" Do what you love , because it 's not really work , " Bartik advises girls intimidated by computing .
" There are no stupid questions .
Act as if you have permission to do things and do n't let anyone intimidate you . "
" What I did seemed like play because it was fun , " she tells them .
" Even though we were pushing back frontiers . "

BAGHDAD , Sept. 11 — Iraqis reflecting on the report to Congress by General David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker found themselves in a difficult spot : although there is nothing they want more than to have American soldiers leave Iraq , there is nothing they can less afford .
About 20 Iraqis of different sects and ethnicities said in interviews that they viewed the report favorably because it — or at least the parts shown on television in Iraq — portrayed the situation accurately and because it signaled that there would be little change in the status quo .
There is a rueful recognition of their vulnerability and that they must allow foreign troops to help keep order for some time to come .
Politicians ’ views were more modulated , but only those allied with Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr suggested they wanted to see a rapid decline in the American presence , and even they backed away from setting a date .
A city worker in Baquba , the capital of Diyala Province , described his ambivalence in strong terms .
“ The withdrawal of the occupation forces is a must because they have caused the destruction of Iraq , they committed massacres against the innocents , they have double - crossed the Iraqis with dreams , ” said Ahmad Umar al - Esawi , a Sunni worker .
“ I want them to withdraw all their troops in one day . ”
THE ENTIRE MANUSCRIPT of this story was written with the E type - bar of the typewriter tied down ; thus making it impossible for that letter to be printed .
This was done so that none of that vowel might slip in , accidentally ; and many did try to do so !
There is a great deal of information as to what Youth can do , if given a chance ; and , though it starts out in somewhat of an impersonal vein , there is plenty of thrill , rollicking comedy , love , courtship , marriage , patriotism , sudden tragedy , a determined stand against liquor , and some amusing political aspirations in a small growing town .
In writing such a story , purposely avoiding all words containing the vowel E , there are a great many difficulties .
The greatest of these is met in the past tense of verbs , almost all of which end with ed . 
Therefore substitutes must be found ; and they are very few .
This will cause , at times , a somewhat monotonous use of such words as  said ;  for neither replied ,  answered  nor asked  can be used .
Another difficulty comes with the elimination of the common couplet of course ,  and its very common connective , consequently ; which will  unavoidably cause bumpy spots .
The numerals also cause plenty of trouble , for none between six and thirty are available .
When introducing young ladies into the story , this is a real barrier ; for what young woman wants to have it known that she is over thirty ?
And this restriction on numbers , of course taboos all mention of dates .
Many abbreviations also must be avoided ; the most common of all ,  Mr.  and  Mrs .  being particularly troublesome ; for those words , if read aloud , plainly indicate the E in their orthography .
As the vowel E is used more than five times oftener than any other letter , this story was written , not through any attempt to attain literary merit , but due to a somewhat balky nature , caused by hearing it so constantly claimed that it cant be done ; for you cannot say anything at all without using E , and make smooth continuity , with perfectly grammatical construction  so twas said .
Many may think that I simply drop the Es , filling the gaps with apostrophes .
A perusal of the book will show that this is not so .
All words used are complete ; are correctly spelled and properly used .
This has been accomplished through the use of synonyms ; and , by so twisting a sentence around as to avoid ambiguity .
The book may prove a valuable aid to school children in English composition .
People , as a rule , will not stop to realize what a task such an attempt actually is .
As I wrote along , in long - hand at first , a whole army of little Es gathered around my desk , all eagerly expecting to be called upon .
But gradually as they saw me writing on and on , without even noticing them , they grew uneasy ; and , with excited whisperings amongst themselves , began hopping up and riding on my pen , looking down constantly for a chance to drop off into some word ; for all the world like sea- birds perched , watching for a passing fish !
But when they saw that I had covered 138 pages of typewriter size paper , they slid off onto the floor , walking sadly away , arm in arm ; but shouting back :
 You certainly must have a hodge - podge of a yarn there without Us !
Why , man !
We are in every story ever written , hundreds of thousands of times !
This is the first time we ever were shut out !
Pronouns also caused trouble ; for such words as he , she , they , them , theirs , her , herself , myself , himself , yourself , etc. , could not be utilized .
But a particularly annoying obstacle comes when , almost through a long paragraph you can find no words with which to continue that line of thought ; hence , as in Solitaire , you are stuck ,  and must go way back and start another ; which , of course , must perfectly fit the preceding context .
I have received some extremely odd criticisms since the Associated Press widely announced that such a book was being written .
A rapid - talking New York newspaper columnist wanted to know how I would get over the plain fact that my name contains the letter E three times .
As an authors name is not a part of his story , that criticism did not hold water .
And I received one most scathing epistle from a lady ( woman ! ) denouncing me as a  genuine fake ;  ( that paradox being a most interesting one ! ) , and ending by saying :   Everyone knows that such a feat is impossible .
All right .
Then the impossible has been accomplished ; ( a paradox to equal hers ! )
Other criticism may be directed at the Introduction ; but this section of a story also is not part of it .
The author is entitled to it , in order properly to explain his work .
The story required five and a half months of concentrated endeavor , with so many erasures and retrenchments that I tremble as I think of them .
Of course anybody can write such a story .
All that is needed is a piece of string tied from the E type - bar down to some part of the base of the typewriter .
Then simply go ahead and type your story .
Incidentally , you should have some sort of a bromide preparation handy , for use when the going gets rough , as it most assuredly will !
Before the book was in print , I was freely and openly informed  there is a trick , or catch , somewhere in that claim that there is not one letter E in the entire book , after you leave the Introduction ,  Well ; it is the privilege of the reader to unearth any such deception that he or she may think they can find .
I have even ordered the printer not to head each chapter with the words  Chapter 2 ,  etc. , on account of that bothersome E in that word .
In closing let me say that I trust you may learn to love all the young folks in the story , as deeply as I have , in introducing them to you .
Like many a book , it grows more and more interesting as the reader becomes well acquainted with the characters .

In search for foreign intelligence , spies turn to YouTube , MySpace , blogs Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

Print This Email This With rapidly advancing technology spreading across the globe , US spies are shifting their focus from surreptitiously photographing secret Soviet documents to trolling the Internet for what could be the next key nugget of foreign intelligence .
Among the most valuable sources , one top spook says , are blogs , MySpace and other Web 2.0 hallmarks .
" We 're looking now at YouTube , which carries some unique and honest - to - goodness intelligence , " Doug Naquin , director of the CIA 's Open Source Center said in a recent speech to CIA retirees .
The speech was posted this week on SecrecyNews , the blog of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy .
" I would not have thought of YouTube as an obvious source of intelligence , " Steven Aftergood , the project 's director , told InfromationWeek , " but I think it 's a good sign that the Open Source Center is looking at it , and at other new media . "
Open source intelligence collection focuses on compiling and analyzing unclassified data from publicly available sources for use by the CIA , policy makers and other law enforcement agencies .
Formerly known as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service , the Open Source Center 's mission in recent years has shifted from translating newspaper and television reports from abroad to culling the Web for information on foreign targets .
The center trains intelligence agents and others in government .
" This training includes everything from media analysis to advanced Internet exploitation , way beyond Googling , " Naquin said .
The goal of open - source collection is to provide information that goes beyond what appears in the morning newspaper , and analysis of Web 2.0 content has become a key part of that , he said .
" A couple years back we identified Iranian blogs as a phenomenon worthy of more attention , about six months ahead of anybody else , " he said .
Now even Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has his own blog .
" We 're looking at chat rooms and things that did n't even exist five years ago , and trying to stay ahead , " Naquin said .
" We have groups looking at what they call ' Citizens Media ' : people taking pictures with their cell phones and posting them on the Internet .
Then there 's Social Media , phenomena like MySpace and blogs . "
With the end of the Cold War , Naquin said open source collection became a low priority in the Intelligence Community , causing the FBIS staff to be cut in half during the 90s .
The terror attacks aimed at New York and Washington changed all that .
" [ Nine - Eleven ] was sort of a watershed for us , " Naquin said .
" The 9/11 Commission and WMD Commission both said , ' You know what ?
There are a lot of open sources out there .
We should be putting a lot more attention toward exploiting those sources . "
Naquin 's full speech is available here ( .pdf ) .
Memo : Giuliani ignored warnings about WTC7
A 1998 memo reveals that then - Mayor Rudy Giuliani , currently running for President on the GOP ticket , built New York City 's emergency command center in World Trade Center Building 7 over the objections of the city , the New York Times reports .
Experts were alarmed over many factors that they say made the site unacceptably vulnerable to attacks and accidents , including the fact that the World Trade Center had already been the target of one attack .
7 World Trade Center would ultimately fall shortly after the collapse of the nearby " twin towers " on September 11 , 2001 , sparking suspicions of a government cover-up .
EXCERPTS :
#
 Seven World Trade Center is a poor choice for the site of a crucial command center for the top leadership of the City of New York ,  a panel of police experts , which was aided by the Secret Service , concluded in a confidential Police Department memorandum .
The memorandum , which has not been previously disclosed , cited a number of significant points of vulnerability .
Those included : the buildings public access , the centers location on the 23rd floor , a 1,200 - gallon diesel fuel supply for its generator , a large garage and delivery bays , the buildings history as a terrorist target , and its placement above and adjacent to a Consolidated Edison substation that provided much of the power for Lower Manhattan .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , the mayor then , has acknowledged some police skepticism about the site , but he has described it as resulting from a jurisdictional dispute between police officials and his emergency management director , who had played a role in selecting the site .

Opinion
Suppose we elected an atheist president ?
The presidential campaign is increasing the visibility of religion in public and political spaces .
Candidates are scrambling to prove their religious bonafides , on the left as well as the right .
Mitt Romney is trying to overcome the perception that Mormonism is a cult while Mike Huckabee , a Baptist minister , flashes the words " Christian leader " on his television advertisements and John McCain refers to America as a " Christian nation . "
Hillary Clinton talks about her long - standing Christian faith , and Barack Obama speaks of reconnecting to Christian principles as an adult after being raised by a spiritual , but religiously skeptical mother , despite rumors that he is a closeted Muslim .
Some days it seems as if candidates are running for the nation 's office of first cleric rather than commander in chief .
It is ironic that believing in invisible beings and hearing their voices is viewed as a qualification for an office in the West Wing when traditionally it qualified one for a room in a psychiatric ward .
However , the majority of Americans seem to want a candidate who believes in God as well as America .
Although the Constitution strictly prohibits any religious test as a requirement to hold office , a de facto religious test is in effect today .
Candidates must profess their faith in order to be elected .
The Constitution 's promise of religious freedom and prohibition of religious tests will be fulfilled when an atheist can be elected president of the United States .
We atheists are a small and misunderstood minority .
Only 3 percent to 9 percent of Americans report that they do not believe in God.
Professor Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi's review of psychological studies reveals that atheists are less authoritarian and suggestible than religious believers , less dogmatic , less prejudiced , more tolerant of others , law - abiding , compassionate , conscientious , highly intelligent and well educated .
Some religiously inclined mistakenly believe that atheists are amoral .
However , we atheists tend to subscribe to the highest moral principles and do so without being motivated by fear of hell or hope of heaven .
One benefit of having a president who is atheist would be that policies would be adopted or rejected due to science and reason rather than a religious creed that may not represent the beliefs of all Americans .
Issues such as stem cell research , evolution and gay marriage would be considered on their merits and in accordance with the Constitution rather than human interpretations of religious texts .
A disadvantage , however , is that journalists and voters would have to focus on substantive policy positions held by candidates rather than their professed beliefs .
No longer could a voter hold up a Christian Bible , as one questioner did at a recent Republican debate , and ask if candidates believed every word in the book .
Perhaps candidates would have to pledge , instead , that they have read and believe every word in the Constitution .
Another benefit of having an atheist president is that bloodshed could be less likely .
Some of the most brutal episodes in world history , including the Crusades , the Inquisition , witch burnings , genocides and bombings by Christian and Islamic fundamentalists , have been conducted in the name of God .
Other countries might well be more trusting of our motives if religious subtexts were absent .
If religious tests were no longer required for public office and more atheists were elected , believers could focus more on their traditional realm of feeding the hungry and clothing the poor .
The faithful could seek spiritual enlightenment rather than elected office .
One day this country may fulfill the Constitution 's promise and specifically prohibit religious tests for office .
What a welcome change it would be to elect someone based on what they believe in rather than whom they believe in .
The nation 's founders will rest in peace when all beliefs are protected , including the right not to believe .

A former SAS soldier was served with a high court order yesterday preventing him from making fresh disclosures about how hundreds of Iraqis and Afghans captured by British and American special forces were rendered to prisons where they faced torture .
Ben Griffin could be jailed if he makes further disclosures about how people seized by special forces were allegedly mistreated and ended up in secret prisons in breach of the Geneva conventions and international law .
Griffin , 29 , left the British army in 2005 after three months in Baghdad , saying he disagreed with the " illegal " tactics of US troops .
He told a press conference hosted by the Stop the War Coalition this week that individuals detained by SAS troops in a joint UK - US special forces taskforce had ended up in interrogation centres in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as Guantánamo Bay .
He had not witnessed torture himself but added : " I have no doubt in my mind that non-combatants I personally detained were handed over to the Americans and subsequently tortured . "
Referring to the government 's admission that two US rendition flights containing terror suspects had landed at the British territory of Diego Garcia , Griffin said the use of British territory and airspace " pales into insignificance in light of the fact that it has been British soldiers detaining the victims of extraordinary rendition in the first place " .
The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on special forces ' activities .
In a separate move , the media have been prevented by a court order from reporting a court martial of six SAS soldiers charged with a conspiracy to " defraud of a value of about £ 3,000 " .
Noel Goodman subscribes to three video game magazines , but he wants information faster than the magazines can reach his mailbox .
“ I can find out on the Internet information that wo n’t be in magazines for another month , ” said Mr. Goodman , a 30 - year - old electrician in Newport News , Va. , who took Halloween off to play video games .
The magazines , he said , are “ always going to lose when it comes down to content .
I can get everything online . ”
While video game magazine publishers beg to differ , that is precisely their challenge — retaining readers as the Internet grabs their audience and advertisers .
Why wait for a monthly mailing when the Web has fresh game reviews , articles and tips on how to beat the games ?
In the last few months , the two biggest publishers — Ziff Davis Media and Future US , which control most of the major game magazines in the United States — have been trying to tip the balance back in their favor .
The war in Iraq is lost .
This fact is widely recognized by American military officers and has been recently expressed forcefully by Lt. Gen.
Ricardo Sanchez , the commander of US forces in Iraq during the first year of the attempted occupation .
Winning is no longer an option .
Our best hope , Gen. Sanchez says , is " to stave off defeat , " and that requires more intelligence and leadership than Gen .
Sanchez sees in the entirety of our national political leadership : " I am absolutely convinced that America has a crisis in leadership at this time . "
More evidence that the war is lost arrived June 4 with headlines reporting : " U.S. - led soldiers control only about a third of Baghdad , the military said on Monday . "
After five years of war the US controls one - third of one city and nothing else .
A host of US commanding generals have said that the Iraq war is destroying the US military .
A year ago Colin Powell said that the US Army is " about broken . "
Lt. Gen. Clyde Vaughn says Bush has " piecemealed our force to death . "
Gen. Barry McCafrey testified to the US Senate that " the Army will unravel . "
Col. Andy Bacevich , America 's foremost writer on military affairs , documents in the current issue of The American Conservative that Bush 's insane war has depleted and exhausted the US Army and Marine Corps : " Only a third of the regular Army 's brigades qualify as combat - ready .
In the reserve components , none meet that standard .
When the last of the units reaches Baghdad as part of the president 's strategy of escalation , the US will be left without a ready - to - deploy land force reserve . "
" The stress of repeated combat tours is sapping the Army 's lifeblood .
Especially worrying is the accelerating exodus of experienced leaders .
The service is currently short 3,000 commissioned officers .
By next year , the number is projected to grow to 3,500 .
The Guard and reserves are in even worse shape .
There the shortage amounts to 7,500 officers .
Young West Pointers are bailing out of the Army at a rate not seen in three decades .
In an effort to staunch the losses , that service has begun offering a $ 20,000 bonus to newly promoted captains who agree to stay on for an additional three years .
Meanwhile , as more and more officers want out , fewer and fewer want in : ROTC scholarships go unfilled for a lack of qualified applicants . "
Bush has taken every desperate measure .
Enlistment ages have been pushed up from 35 to 42 .
The percentage of high school dropouts and the number of recruits scoring at the bottom end of tests have spiked .
The US military is forced to recruit among drug users and convicted criminals .
Bacevich reports that wavers " issued to convicted felons jumped by 30 percent . "
Combat tours have been extended from 12 to 15 months , and the same troops are being deployed again and again .
There is no equipment for training .
Bacevich reports that " some $ 212 billion worth has been destroyed , damaged , or just plain worn out . "
What remains is in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Under these circumstances , " staying the course " means total defeat .
Even the neoconservative warmongers , who deceived Americans with the promise of a " cakewalk war " that would be over in six weeks , believe that the war is lost .
But they have not given up .
They have a last desperate plan : Bomb Iran .
Vice President Dick Cheney is spear - heading the neocon plan , and Norman Podhoretz is the plan 's leading propagandist with his numerous pleas published in the Wall Street Journal and Commentary to bomb Iran .
Podhoretz , like every neoconservative , is a total Islamophobe .
Podhoretz has written that Islam must be deracinated and the religion destroyed , a genocide for the Muslim people .
The neocons think that by bombing Iran the US will provoke Iran to arm the Shiite militias in Iraq with armor- piercing rocket propelled grenades and with surface to air missiles and unleash the militias against US troops .
These weapons would neutralize US tanks and helicopter gunships and destroy the US military edge , leaving divided and isolated US forces subject to being cut off from supplies and retreat routes .
With America on the verge of losing most of its troops in Iraq , the cry would go up to " save the troops " by nuking Iran .
Five years of unsuccessful war in Iraq and Afghanistan and Israel 's recent military defeat in Lebanon have convinced the neocons that America and Israel cannot establish hegemony over the Middle East with conventional forces alone .
The neocons have changed US war doctrine , which now permits the US to preemptively strike with nuclear weapons a non-nuclear power .
Neocons are forever heard saying , " what 's the use of having nuclear weapons if you can't use them . "
Neocons have convinced themselves that nuking Iran will show the Muslim world that Muslims have no alternative to submitting to the will of the US government .
Insurgency and terrorism cannot prevail against nuclear weapons .
Many US military officers are horrified at what they think would be the worst ever orchestrated war crime .
There are reports of threatened resignations .
But Dick Cheney is resolute .
He tells Bush that the plan will save him from the ignominy of losing the war and restore his popularity as the president who saved Americans from Iranian nuclear weapons .
With the captive American media providing propaganda cover , the neoconservatives believe that their plan can pull their chestnuts out of the fire and rescue them from the failure that their delusion has wrought .
The American electorate decided last November that they must do something about the failed war and gave the Democrats control of both houses of Congress .
However , the Democrats have decided that it is easier to be complicit in war crimes than to represent the wishes of the electorate and hold a rogue president accountable .
If Cheney again prevails , America will supplant the Third Reich as the most reviled country in recorded history .

The CIA asked the Justice Department to investigate whether former operative John Kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect , government officials say .
Ex -CIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds .
Kiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations , including CNN , after the CIA disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005 .
That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill .
The Bush administration appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday to answer a judge 's questions about the tapes ' destruction .
Speaking to CNN last week , Kiriakou said that U.S. interrogators drew valuable information from al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda by " waterboarding " him .
But Kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped .
Waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane - covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning , Kiriakou said .

Kiriakou told CNN he was unaware that CIA interrogations were being taped , but that the tapes should have been kept " as a matter of historical record . "
Kiriakou 's attorney Mark Zaid told CNN that the referral of the case to the Justice Department is standard procedure .
" A criminal referral from the CIA would be both expected and normal under the circumstances , " Zaid said in a written statement .
" It is a routine act that the CIA undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred . "
Zaid added that the question is whether the Justice Department will proceed , and that such a decision " must be measured carefully . "
" Doing so will unlock a Pandora 's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved . " he said .
" There would also exist a challenge regarding whether Mr. Kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights . "
CIA officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information .
Written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication , and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the Justice Department after the fact .
About one case a week is referred to the Justice Department , and an investigation could take months to complete , a source in the intelligence community said .
For private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard , penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time .
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the department has no comment on the Kiriakou matter , and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case .
Kiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on Abu Zubayda , but that he was told the al Qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds .
Kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training , and lasted about five seconds before having to stop .

Every Tuesday is Finance & Family Day at Zen Habits .
I ’m always looking for ways to simplify my finances ( I ’m weird like that , I know ) , and recently I ’ve been scrutinizing my already - simple budget to make it even simpler .
I thought it would be helpful to share some of the ways to make your budget as simple as possible .
The goal is to reduce headaches , eliminate the need for complicated tracking schemes , and reduce the time you spend on your budget and finances to about 15 - 20 minutes per week .
I ca n’t claim these ideas are original , or that I have n’t discussed them in various places before , but in my experience , they work .
They ’re simple and powerful .
Let ’s first look at setting up a budget .
If you have n’t done it yet , it ’s probably because budgets seem intimidating to you , or they are too much hassle to set up and maintain .
Those are both valid points — which is why you should follow this simplified plan if these things apply to you .
Now , there ’s plenty of fancy software out there for setting up budgets , but I do n’t think they ’re necessary .
A simple spreadsheet will do — and if you can create a SUM formula to add up the total of a column of numbers , you have all the spreadsheet knowledge necessary .
Create a simple spreadsheet for your budget , if you have n’t already , and start by listing your income and your monthly expenses .
Estimate , in round numbers , how much you spend on each expense every month .
You can adjust later , but it ’s better to err on the side of too high a number , rather than putting a low number and breaking your budget .
Now let ’s look at ways to create a simple budget :
60 Percent Solution .
There are many ways to structure your budget , but the simplest I ’ve found is the 60 % solution .
Basically , this budget asks you to fit your regular monthly expenses within 60 % of your gross income , so that you have room for savings ( long - term and short - term ) , retirement and spending money ( “ fun money ” ) .
These are the things that most often break a budget , because most people do n’t budget for them .
Now , your percentage will vary , but the percentages given here are just rough guidelines : 60 percent : Monthly expenses — such as housing , food , utilities , insurance , Internet , transportation .
This is the part most commonly thought of as a budget .
— such as housing , food , utilities , insurance , Internet , transportation .
This is the part most commonly thought of as a budget .
10 percent : Retirement — and if you ’re doing it right , this is being automatically deducted from your paycheck for a 401 ( k ) investment .
— and if you ’re doing it right , this is being automatically deducted from your paycheck for a 401 ( k ) investment .
10 percent : Long - term savings or debt reduction .
It ’s best to invest this in something such as stocks or an index fund , and this can serve as your emergency fund .
But if you are in debt ( not including a home mortgage ) , I would advise that you use this portion of the budget to pay off your debts , and even draw some from the other categories such as retirement to increase this to about 20 percent for now .
Once your debts are paid off , you can switch this to long - term savings .
You still need to have an emergency fund , but while you ’re in debt - reduction mode you can either create a small , temporary emergency fund out of the money from this category or the next .

10 percent : Short - term savings — this is for periodic expenses , such as auto maintenance or repairs , medical expenses ( not including insurance premiums ) , appliances , home maintenance , birthday and Christmas gifts .
For this savings account , be sure to spend the money when you need it — that ’s what it ’s for .
When these expenses come up , you will have the money for them , instead of trying to pull them from other budget categories .

10 percent : Fun money — you can spend this on eating out , movies , comic books — whatever you want .
Guilt free .
Fewer categories .
A lot of budget software asks you to fill in a million categories and subcategories .
Those can be useful if you want to track all that stuff , but I do n’t .
I recommend simplifying : just use broad categories like food and gas and spending and utilities .
Use what works .
Pay bills online .
As much as possible , pay your bills online .
These would be most of the bills in the first category above — utilities , rent or mortgage , cell phone , Internet , etc .
If you ca n’t pay electronically , have your bank send out a check to the vendor .
Make these payments automatic , so you do n’t need to worry about them .
Automatic savings .
Make your savings automatic as well .
Every time your paycheck is deducted , have a scheduled transaction transfer a set amount from checking to savings .
Use a high - yield online savings account such as Emigrant Direct , HBSD , or ING Direct .
Cash .
For everything else , use cash .
If you ’re doing automatic bill payments and savings deductions , the only things you ’ll likely need cash for are gas , groceries and fun money .
Withdraw these amounts in cash twice a month , rather than using checks or credit cards .
The reason is that it ’s simpler — with cash , you do n’t need to worry about overspending , or tracking how much is left in that category .
You can see how much is left .
Leave the credit cards for when you absolutely need them — traveling , for example .
Envelopes .
If you use cash for three categories , for example , use three envelopes .
This is an old - fashioned system , but I use it because it works .
I have an envelope for groceries , gas and fun money .
If I ’m going grocery shopping , I bring the groceries envelope .
I know how much is left in the envelope before I go grocery shopping .
I spend the cash for groceries , and then can easily see how much is left now .
Simple , and no tracking necessary .
When the money is gone , you ’ve spent your budgeted amount .
If necessary , you could transfer cash from one envelope to another , and there ’s no need to adjust your budget .
15 - 20 minutes a week .
Now , the budget and spending plan I ’ve outlined above is fairly simple and headache - free — but you should n’t assume that it does n’t need any maintenance .
You should devote 15 - 20 minutes a week to ensuring that your finances are in order .
Just this little amount of time each week will greatly simplify your financial life , reduce headaches , and prevent any messes from occurring later .
Set a day and time when you take a look at your finances each week .
Set aside 30 minutes , just to be safe .
Now take 5 - 10 minutes to enter your transactions into your financial software ( I use MS Money , because it came with my computer , but a spreadsheet or other financial software will do fine ) .
If you ’re following the plan above , all you ’ll need to do is go online , look at your bank account , and enter your deposits , bills paid , ATM withdrawals ( only do this twice a month ! ) , and any other fees .
It should n’t take long .
Now spend another 5 - 10 minutes to review your budget and make sure that all bills have been paid that should be paid .
If not , pay them .
It ’s that simple .
You ’re done .
Now go back to reading your blogs .
Fewer accounts .
Some people have complicated systems set up with lots of different accounts .
I say simplify .
You do n’t want to be checking a million different accounts .
You should have one checking account and one or two savings accounts ( one for emergency fund and one for periodic expenses ) .
You could have a bunch of investment accounts if you want , but I ’ve found it simpler to just have one .
I lose diversity , but my fund is already pretty diversified .
Dump credit cards .
Multiple credit cards are also a headache .
Simplify by just having one .
Or do what I do — have none .
This will draw the usual outraged or preachy reaction from those who really love their credit cards , but I do n’t care .
I do n’t like credit cards .
Call me old fashioned .
They charge high interest and they ’re potentially dangerous ( if you run up a high bill and an expense comes up that you need to pay for which means you ca n’t pay your credit card bill on time , you now are stuck with high - interest credit card debt ) .
Use a debit card if you need to .
Pay all bills at the same time .
It often just takes a simple call to get a vendor or creditor to change the due date on your bills .
If you can get all your bills to be due on , let ’s say , the 10th of the month , you can do all your bill paying at once .
For some people , this will mean they will need to do a bit of scrimping to get ahead enough so that they can afford to make all their month ’s payments at the beginning of the month , but it ’s worth it .
You can pay all your bills and be done with it .

According to a blogged up blog post on the interblogs , a Netflix survey that 's supposedly been making the rounds suggests that the service may be coming to both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .
If you believe what Seanbajuice has to say , the survey asked , " If as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS / 3 or XBOX 360 , how likely would you / anyone in your household be to do that ? "
The survey then goes on to state that both the PS3 and the 360 will be able to play streaming media by using a " special Netflix disc . "
Here 's the kicker : there wo n't be any extra fees besides the $ 3 charge for the disc .
Of course , nothing is mentioned about how the PS3 will handle the Microsoft - based DRM , and while the whole thing sounds too good to be true , there have been rumblings about this recently , so let 's just cross our fingers and make a wish , okay ?

A long - simmering dispute over digital copyrights between the Church of Scientology and its critics has boiled over in recent weeks after video clips turned up on the Internet from a 2004 interview by the church ’s most famous member , actor Tom Cruise .
When Scientology officials complained the clips were copyrighted and requested their removal from YouTube and other websites , a shadowy organization of online troublemakers sprang into action .
The group known as “ Anonymous ” posted an eerie video on the Internet featuring a computer - generated voice announcing a campaign to destroy the church and calling for worldwide protests Feb. 10 .
It was all for laughs , said a member who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
But things are now getting serious .
A series of cyber attacks the group claimed responsibility for slowed access to church websites and apparently shut down the main one , www.scientology.org, one day last month .
As of Friday , suspicious white powder was mailed to 23 church locations in Southern California , forcing 60 people to be cleared from buildings in Tustin and causing police to close part of busy Brand Boulevard in Glendale for two hours .
Preliminary tests by the LAPD determined the powder was cornstarch and wheat germ .
The FBI is investigating whether the mailings were connected to the hacking .
Shortly after the mailings were disclosed by authorities , a caller who identified himself as a spokesman for the group Anonymous told a Times reporter that the group was not to blame .
The incidents have drawn new attention to Scientology .
Critics of the religion are flocking to Anonymous postings on YouTube , the popular video - sharing site .
Their campaign has sparked a debate among long - time Scientology ’s opponents , who wonder whether the aggressive rhetoric and tactics , including illegal denial - of - service attacks on the church ’s websites , help the cause by raising awareness of the religion ’s controversial beliefs , or hurt it by using the same type of heavy - handed methods they accuse Scientology officials of employing against critics .
“ I do n’t know if anybody in Anonymous did this but Anonymous set themselves up to be targeted in this way . . . , ” said Mark Bunker , who runs one of the leading websites criticizing the church , www.xenutv.com, and posted a video last week warning Anonymous to tone down its campaign .
“ I hope it does n’t hurt the larger critic community who have been speaking out for years about Scientology ’s abuse . ”
Scientology was founded in 1954 by science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard .
It teaches that “ spiritual release and freedom ” from life ’s problems can be achieved through one - on - one counseling called auditing , during which members ’ responses are monitored on an e-meter , similar to a polygraph .
The process , along with a series of training courses , can cost Scientologists tens of thousands of dollars .
Cruise has become an outspoken proponent of the religion .
In 2004 , he won the International Assn. of Scientologists Freedom Medal of Valor award and part of the ceremony included a taped interview with him talking about why the religion is important to him .
The video was posted on YouTube and other sites this month , leading the Church of Scientology to request its removal for copyright violation .
A Scientology spokeswoman said the church was n’t trying to suppress the video , which it says can be watched at any of its facilities around the world .
But it was made for “ the Scientology congregation ” and “ never intended for replay on television or the Internet , ” spokeswoman Karin Pouw said in a written response to questions .
The requests to have it removed are similar to take - down requests by movie studios and TV networks , she said .
But members of Anonymous were angered by the requests and decided to take on the church , said the group ’s representative .
The group is a loose confederation of about 9,000 people who post anonymous messages in chat rooms on websites he would not identify .
While they are experienced Internet users , few are computer hackers , he said .
But there are enough people with knowledge of how to attack websites that they were able to launch the attacks , the spokesman said .
One of the attacks , known as distributed denial of service , involves flooding a website with requests , overloading its capacity .
Pouw said Scientology ’s websites “ have been and are online . ”
The Church of Scientology also shifted the company that hosts its site last week to Prolexic Technologies Inc. , which specializes in stopping denial - of - service attacks .

On July 4th , 2004 , Jeffery and Nicole Rank attended an public Independence Day event in Charleston , WV where President Bush was to speak .
Despite the fact that the event was open to the public and was held on public land , the Ranks were arrested for wearing anti-Bush t- shirts .
On Monday 's " Hardball " the couple told their astonishing story of being arrested , the charges that were filed against them and eventually dropped and why they decided to sue the United States government -- a suit they thankfully won .

In the wake of two recent incidents in which wheelchair pedestrians were hit in city crosswalks and then ticketed , City officials are finally speaking out .
On Monday afternoon , Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo spoke publicly about the cases , and apologized for the first time to victims Gerry Mitchell and Deborah Hamlin .
A few hours later during the public comment segment at the city council meeting , several community members expressed their outrage about the incidents , while Mitchell , who was struck by an Albemarle police cruiser on November 5 , announced Charlottesville " has a problem with the police not respecting the rights of the citizens . "
He received a standing ovation from the near - capacity crowd .
Pedestrian activist Kevin Cox demanded councilors investigate who ordered that the ticket be issued to Mitchell .
" Was this done to protect Albemarle county from a lawsuit ?
And if it was , why ? " he asked .
" Who made that decision ? "
Chief Longo seemed to answer that question during a 15 - minute segment on WINA 's talk radio show Charlottesville Right Now yesterday afternoon , when he denied having any knowledge of the ticket until it was made public in the Hook 's December 6 cover story .
The decision to ticket Mitchell was made " in the field " by Charlottesville police officer Steve Grissom , Longo said ; he added that both incidents are under review by the police department and the office of the Commonwealth 's Attorney .
In the second incident , Deborah Hamlin , who has both cerebral palsy and a visual impairment , was struck by a dump truck in the crosswalk at the intersection of Lee Street and Jefferson Park Avenue .
She , too , was ticketed while she was being treated in the UVA emergency room .
Among options being considered in both cases , said Longo , are dropping charges against Mitchell and Hamlin or levying new charges against the drivers for failing to yield to a pedestrian .
Mitchell says diagnostic tests revealed this week that his right rotator cuff was torn and his shoulder bones were fractured when he was lifted from the street into his chair by Albemarle County Officer Greg Davis and a witness after he'd been hit .
Still , despite ongoing pain , he says recent developments have him feeling more upbeat .
Receiving a standing ovation at the council meeting was " an unbelievable , joyous moment , " says Mitchell .
" I felt that the community is concerned about the welfare of all of us . "
This morning , he says , he met with several police representatives who are reviewing his case .
The point he tried to make to investigators , he says : " In spite of all the laws , they need to talk to these police about how to deal with the public . "
Mayor David Brown says he welcomed the public input at last night 's meeting and noted that several of the speakers also praised the police department .
" I really appreciated people taking the time to express that , " he says .
" Otherwise , police could feel they were being criticized with nothing positive there . "
He notes that police policy prevents them from commenting on controversial matters , which can leave them " blasted " and " tarred in the press " before further details exonerating their behavior come out in court .
Brown feels that Mitchell should not have been ticketed , but he stops short of implying that Officer Davis should have been ticketed .
" Sometimes accidents happen , " he says , adding that as a result of these accidents , council will tackle inconsistencies at pedestrian crosswalks to make sure that " they all work in the same way so they 're predictable . "
City Councilor Kevin Lynch was more outspoken in his criticism of the police department 's handling of Mitchell 's case .
Lynch said he was not satisfied with a three - page memo sent by Chief Longo to City Councilors explaining the incident from the police department 's perspective .
" I feel like while we want to be supportive of our police department ; they are human like everyone else , " said Lynch .
" Trying to pretend this is Mr. Mitchell 's fault is not justice . "
At the time of this posting , the city had not responded to the Hook 's FOIA 'd request for that memo .

We wanted to make the record as if people were actually sitting there and watching it all take place .
Not as if we were onstage , but like we were in somebody ’s living room — we almost were — and people were there and we were entertaining them ” , explains Patty Loveless in an interview with No Depression ‘s Bill Friskics - Warren .
She is describing here the guiding principle behind her most recent , and clearly the most personal album of her career , Mountain Soul , a record of traditionally based folk and country music .
In today ’s commercial music climate , it would be easy to dismiss Mountain Soul as a country singer ’s attempt to revive a declining career , to catch the wave of the roots - bluegrass revival sweeping music in the wake of the successful O Brother , Where Art Thou ? soundtrack .
After all , Patty Loveless , a two - time Country Music Association “ Female Vocalist of the Year ” who has been nominated for multiple Grammies , now finds herself relegated to the “ Classic Country ” category — she has only had two Top ten hits since 1997 .
But the fact is , Mountain Soul is not a career - revival strategy but a homecoming for Loveless , a native of eastern Kentucky and a descendant of the coal mines .
( Her father died of black lung in 1979 . )
In short , Patty Loveless had a “ mountain soul ” long before the Cohen Brothers conceived their hillbilly revision of The Odyssey .
John and Naomi Ramey raised daughter Patty right , with Naomi teaching her Bill Monroe , Kitty Wells , and Molly O’Day while John made sure she heard The Stanley Brothers .
He never missed an episode on Flatt and Scruggs ’s Saturday night television show and also took a young Patty to see them play at the Pollyanna Drive - in .
With Mountain Soul , Loveless returns to her childhood .
As she explains , “ Those are the three kinds of music [ country , bluegrass , and hillbilly ] I grew up on , and I really wanted to blend those three for this record , but keep the different kinds different ” ( http://sonynashville.com/PattyLoveless).
Simply put , Mountain Soul is the album Loveless has been preparing for all her life — and to see the disc as only a return to hillbilly standards is to miss much of its complexity .
Besides , Loveless ’s hillbilly roots have been poking through her Hot Country façade since the beginning of her career , though they became more apparent after 1993 when she and husband / musician / producer Emory Gordy , Jr. put a band together for a Ralph Stanley - hosted bluegrass festival .
The response was so positive that Loveless added a bluegrass segment to her live shows , which included classics like “ Pretty Polly ” and “ Some Morning Soon ” .
It ’s also worth noting that her “ Pretty Polly ” duet with Ralph Stanley from his Clinch Mountain Country disc stayed at # 1 for three weeks on the “ National Bluegrass Survey ” in 1997 .
That Mountain Soul is a personal album becomes apparent on a number of levels .
First , Loveless has dedicated the disc to her parents , and family pictures supplement the lyrics , placing the songs and the Ramey family story in the context of a larger musical and regional history .
Second , its songs are a mix of gospel , country , and hillbilly standards , as well as contemporary tunes that parody their musical heritage ; in its composition and themes , Mountain Soul is about stories and music that are historical and contemporary .
A third factor that contributes to Mountain Soul ‘s intimacy is Loveless ’s decision to use her road band / family rather than studio musicians , and , as with any family get - together , a few old friends stop by — in this case Ricky Skaggs , Jon Randall , and Travis Tritt .
Moreover , the album was recorded “ mostly live ” , drum - free , and with few overdubs .
As she told Newsweek ‘s David Gates , “ Here it is , warts and all ” .
All of this is unheard of in Nashville ’s current tidy , Hot Country sound .
Mountain Soul ‘s parodic nature is apparent even in the disc ’s artwork .
On the cover , Loveless ’s picture is foregrounded , superimposed upon another graphic of men gathering around an old building .
Some are playing music ; others appear to be miners on their way home after work .
But Loveless ’s image does n’t entirely fit with this glimpse into another time and place , for just as her modern clothes are at odds with those the men wear , so is the shading of her figure different from that of the background .
Thus we are reminded that modern technology has placed her in an old picture .
There is a schism between the two , the present and the past , that cannot be bridged , just as Loveless ’s covers of traditional songs cannot truly recreate that time and place .
Building on the artwork is Loveless ’s inclusion of both traditional and contemporary songs , raising questions of “ authenticity ” as new songs both replicate and build on the rich tradition of country music .
It is , after all , impossible for Patty Loveless to do a truly “ authentic ” album ; the times and technology have changed too much .
Loveless ’s decision to work with a living - room model — even though the songs were recorded in a studio — reflects that compromise .
The living - room motif is apparent from Mountain Soul ‘s beginning , the lively “ The Boys Are Back in Town ” , a song that joyfully tells the girls to get ready because , as Loveless exuberantly puts it , “ The ships are in and the sails are down / The boys are back in town ” .
The song ’s rhythm echoes a vaudeville dance tune , here played with acoustic , stringed instruments , though Loveless ’ vocal phrasing is too modern , too syncopated for “ authenticity ” — which is , of course , a point of Mountain Soul .
With “ The Boys Are Back in Town ” , Loveless also links her album to the traditional community dance , held in someone ’s home after the furniture and carpet had been picked up .
In effect , the listener is invited into the living room .
From there , Mountain Soul welcomes country , hillbilly , and gospel songs , some old , some new , all played with acoustic , stringed instruments that highlight the Kentucky holler in Loveless ’s alto voice .
Adding to this is the album ’s foundation in the fundamental tensions of country music : the honky - tonk ’s “ Saturday Night ” or the church ’s “ Sunday Morning ” .
Loveless ’s country music background is apparent in Mountain Soul ‘s “ Saturday Night ” songs .
Hank Williams could sing “ The Richest Fool Alive ” , though here it has an acoustic sound .
Much the same is true of “ Cheap Whiskey ” ( by Emory Gordy , Jr. ) , which uses the traditional waltz form to tell the story of a man who learns the consequences of “ trad[ing ] her love for a drink ” .
At times , Loveless ’s voice struggles with this slow song — in this case , not a production flaw but , rather , a nod to the living room .
Adding to this are three duets , a bedrock form of classic country .
Loveless sings “ Someone I Used to Know ” with Jon Randall as echoes of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton flit through the mix .
She also works with Travis Tritt on two duets , “ Out of Control Raging Fire ” and “ I Know You ’re Married ( But I Love You Still ) ” .
Tritt ’s no George Jones , but he holds his own .
These duets point to how such relationships do little to abate the isolation that Saturday night tries so desperately to stave off ; the sense that the singers will return to the tragedy of isolation is overwhelming .
Complicating Mountain Soul are the “ Sunday Morning ” songs that provide a very different answer to the problems posed by Saturday Night .
Take , for example , Loveless ’s version of Ralph Stanley ’s “ Daniel Prayed ” .
A bluegrass ballad and morality tale , the song reminds the listener , “ Pray to God and He ’ll see us through ” .
Ricky Skaggs adds mandolin and vocals , during the refrain assuming the role of a mountain preacher who exalts the congregation to a call - and - response .
In a similar vein are “ Rise Up Lazarus ” and “ Two Coats ” , both gospel songs that assure the faithful they will be rewarded .
But between Saturday Night and Sunday Morning stretches a gray area , a place without easy answers , and it is in this ambiguity that Mountain Soul finds much of its richness .
Take , for example , “ Pretty Little Miss ” , a revision of “ Shady Grove ” .
In this traditional song of a woman ’s first heartbreak ( and losing her beau to an older sister , no less ) , Earl Scruggs ’s banjo sets a pace that belies the song ’s final lines : “ Guess I ’ll spend my winter months a sad and lonely maiden ” .
With “ Sorrowful Angels ” , the main character does live her life as a sad and lonely maiden in a story so tragic that the angels weep for her .
A highlight is Loveless ’s revision of “ Man of Constant Sorrow ” .
It ’s impossible not to hear her version against the infectiously upbeat , hit version of the Soggy Bottom Boys from O Brother , but Loveless ’s “ Soul of Constant Sorrow ” is more in keeping with the song ’s mountain - ballad roots .
There ’s no playful banjo here , just a slow quest that tests endurance .
Ricky Skaggs adds mandolin and backing vocals to this tale of isolated wandering that can only end with death .
Two tracks merit particular attention .
The first is “ You ’ll Never Leave Harlan Alive ” .
Darrell Scott ’s 1995 song sounds as if it were written 100 years ago with its mountain - ballad form , prophecies of death , and dark sense of futility .
This account of the singer ’s grandfather , who attempts to escape the mines but is ultimately driven back to them by economic desperation , is haunted by vivid characters and descriptive language ( “ Where the sun comes up about 10 in the morning / And the sun goes down about 3 in the day /
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you ’re drinking /
And you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave ” ) .
Loveless ’s version , with its acoustic opening , is perfect and raises a central issue :
Here is Scott , writing an old - timey ballad about a great , great - grandfather , a man time had obliterated from family history .
It speaks to the ways in which the present revisits and revises the past , extending the tradition .
All of these pieces — past and present , light and dark , Saturday Night and Sunday Morning , personal and public , artistic and commercial — come together in the disc ’s final track , “ Sounds of Loneliness ” , a song written by a 14 - year - old Patty Ramey ( now Loveless ) long before she was a professional singer .
Instead , she was a talented , isolated teenager struggling to cope with her family ’s move from Pikeville to Louisville .
The song has tremendous personal value for Loveless :
It was her father ’s favorite ; she used it when auditioning for Porter Wagoner ; and it originally appeared on her 1987 debut album .
Important paradoxes lie at the heart of the “ Sounds of Loneliness ” .
The first is the song ’s sound , its Celtic heritage that uses a fiddle to create the drone of bagpipes ( and points to Scotland ’s central contribution to Appalachian culture ) and an almost rock beat ; the high - lonesome harmony singing ; the acoustic instruments inherent to folk music .
One of the sounds of loneliness , then , is the many voices and sounds from which American music has descended .
The second paradox is the notion that loneliness would have a “ sound ” .
The general belief is that loneliness is the result of silence , of isolation .
But Loveless moves beyond that as she sings of being unable to endure the sounds of her tears and her heart .
She finishes the song — indeed the album — by singing , “ Hear the sounds of loneliness / Hear the sounds all around / Since you ’ve gone and left me alone / I ’ll just hear these sounds from now on ” .
It is a chilling final thought .
Although , lyrically , “ Sounds of Loneliness ” is about isolation , in the context of this personal album and , indeed , the music of the song itself , it moves beyond that to show the universality of music and its power to overcome isolation .
That is , the music allows Loveless to articulate her loneliness just as it enables the listener to hear her message — a multifaceted one of family , cultural , and regional history , beautifully told in Mountain Soul .

ED #66 : Is 64 - Bit Crysis Really Faster Than 32 - Bit Crysis ?
Those who have already given the Crysis single - player demo a try have not only been impressed by the visual effects but also the incredibly stress it put on their hardware .
Even a high - end system with the new 3 GHz Intel Core 2 QX9650 ( Yorkfield ) and an NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 640 MB graphics card can hardly hit the minimum frame rate of 30 fps at 1600 x 1200 , and that 's without anti-aliasing enabled .
In a recent GameSpot interview , Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli mentioned that the 64 - bit version of Crysis would be better than the 32 - bit version .
Here 's a direct quote : " ... 64 - bit in general runs better than 32 - bit .
In fact I would recommend gamers run 64 - bit only under very high configurations .
We ship both 32 - and 64 - bit out of box . "
Before you go rushing off to buy the 64 - bit version of Windows Vista though , take a look at what we found when we benchmarked the 64 - bit Crysis and compared it to the performance of the 32 - bit Crysis .
The Testbed
Processor Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650
- 3.0 GHz core clock
- 12 MB L2 cache Motherboard Intel X38 motherboard Memory 4 GB PC2-6400 DDR2 memory Graphics Card NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT Graphics Card Driver NVIDIA ForceWare 169.02 for Windows Vista Operating System Microsoft Windows Vista ( 64 - bit & 32-bit )
The Results
At the resolution of 1600 x 1200 , there was absolutely NO difference in performance between the 64 - bit Crysis and the 32 - bit version .
This is quite surprising since the system used is practically built using the latest hardware , including the just - released 45 nm Intel Core 2 QX9650 ( Yorkfield ) CPU and the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT graphics card .
This system also had 4 GB of fast DDR2 memory .
The only real difference between 64 - bit and 32 - bit software is the ability to address memory of 4 GB or more .
The main advantage of a 64 - bit Crysis would be the ability to use larger textures , which would be seen with the settings of High or Very High .
Even so , we saw no difference in frame rates .
Some of our team members feel that since the game is GPU - limited , the advantage of 64 - bit Crysis might not be readily apparent .
So , we also tried testing at a lower resolution of 1280 x 1024 but with the High setting ( to force the use of larger textures ) .
But as you can see , the results are pretty similar - absolutely no performance difference between the 64 - bit and 32 - bit versions of the Crysis demo .
As far as we can tell , there is no real performance difference between the two versions of Crysis .
If your system is not fast enough , moving to 64 - bit will not help you .
Of course , the performance results using this demo may also not be reflective of the performance of the final build of Crysis .
We will only find out for sure when Crysis is released and that is n't far off .

The chip industry will continue to be able to add more transistors to a silicon chip for the foreseeable future , but the problem lies in the amount of power they consume and thus the amount of heat generated .
That will limit the rate at which processing speeds increase .
The need to get around what the industry is calling the “ power wall ” has touched off a frantic hunt for new computing languages , as well as new ways to automatically break up problems so they can be solved more quickly in parallel .
Although the Microsoft effort was started about five years ago by Craig Mundie , one of the company ’s three chief technical officers , it picked up speed recently with the hiring of a number of experts from the supercomputing industry and academia .
Mr. Mundie himself is a veteran of previous efforts in the supercomputer industry during the 1980s and 1990s to make breakthroughs in parallel computing .
“ I ’m happy that by hiring a bunch of old hands , who have been through these wars for 10 or 20 years , we at least have a nucleus of people who kind of know what ’s possible and what is n’t , ” he said .
The more recent arrivals at Microsoft include luminaries like Burton Smith , a supercomputer designer whose ideas on parallel computing have been widely adopted , and Dan Reed , an expert on parallel computing .
Dual - core microprocessors are already plentiful in consumer devices .
For example , both Intel and A.M.D. ’s standard desktop and portable chips now have two cores , and even the iPhone is reported to have three microprocessors .
Microsoft sees this as the company ’s principal opportunity , and industry executives have said that the arrival of manycore microprocessors is likely to be timed to the arrival of “ Windows 7 . ”
That is the name the company has given to the follow - on operating system to Windows Vista .
Abstract
In the discourse surrounding the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , extreme criticisms of Israel ( e.g. , Israel is an apartheidstate , theIsraelDefenseForcesdeliberatelytargetPalestiniancivilians ) , coupled with extreme policy proposals ( e.g. , boycott of Israeli academics and institutions , divest from companies doing business with Israel ) , have sparked counterclaims that such criticisms are anti-Semitic ( for only Israel is singled out ) .
The research in this article shines a different , statistical light on this question : based on a survey of 500 citizens in each of 10 European countries , the authors ask whether those individuals with extreme anti-Israel views are more likely to be anti-Semitic .
Even after controlling for numerous potentially confounding factors , they find that anti-Israel sentiment consistently predicts the probability that an individual is anti-Semitic , with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed .

U.S. immigration officials said on Thursday they had dismantled a Guatemalan human smuggling ring that brought more than 100 illegal immigrants a week into the Los Angeles area .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) said 13 people , including two of the suspected ringleaders , face charges in connection with what officials described as one of the largest human smuggling operations uncovered on the West Coast in recent years .
The nearly three - year investigation was sparked by the discovery in May 2005 of two “ drop ” houses in south Los Angeles where more than 140 illegal immigrants were living .
According to court documents , immigration agents uncovered an organization run by Guatemalan nationals that provided housing and transport to immigrants who had already been smuggled across the U.S. - Mexico border to Phoenix .
The immigrants were taken from Arizona to the Los Angeles area where they were held in drop houses before being loaded onto vehicles and driven to U.S. cities around the nation .

A more potent " skunk " form of cannabis now accounts for 70 - 80 % of the British market for the drug , but many users are cutting down and only smoking enough to get high , the initial results of a Home Office study show .
A special meeting of the government 's expert committee on drugs which is looking again at the legal status of cannabis was told by Dr Les King that the rise in the use of " homegrown skunk " - which accounted for 15 % of the market in 2002 against 70 % now - had been driven by the growth of " cannabis factories " run by organised crime gangs , who were often Vietnamese .
He said British - grown skunk had almost squeezed traditional imported herbal cannabis out of the market with cannabis resin mostly from Morocco still holding about 20 % of British sales .
King , a technical adviser to the Home Office scientific development branch , said the skunk has an average THC content - the active ingredient in a joint - of about 12 % to 14 % , two and a half times that of traditional cannabis resin .
He compared it to the difference in strength between beer and wine and said the amount smoked was as important as strength .
He was supported in his claim that users were moderating their intake of the more powerful cannabis by Dr Mike White from the Forensic Science Service who said it was rare for a smoker to get through an entire joint in one go .
He also suggested that the potency of British skunk had actually fallen by 10 % in the past two years as growers substituted quantity for quality in the face of an expanding market .
King said media reports were wrong to claim that a new " superskunk " form of cannabis 10 to 20 times stronger than traditional types was now sweeping the British market .
The two - day meeting of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs opened with its chairman , Sir Michael Rawlins , saying he had accepted a written assurance from the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , that the government still had an open mind over regrading cannabis from class C back to class B , which would again make possession punishable with a jail sentence .
Ipsos Mori polling evidence published last night exploded the myth that the downgrading of the drug 's status by David Blunkett in 2004 had led to confusion about its status , with over 80 % of those polled correctly saying the drug was still illegal .
British Crime Survey data shows that cannabis consumption has fallen since the change .
The two - day meeting also heard evidence from the government 's mental health tsar , Professor Louis Appleby , that a link between cannabis and mental illness was not yet proven .
But he backed reclassification , saying there was now sufficient evidence that cannabis was a harmful drug that could contribute to a pattern of relapse and risk in mental health patients .
Appleby said he felt that many health professionals had been guilty of complacency on the issue and that reclassification would reinforce the public health message .
However he had reservations about further criminalising mental health patients for using cannabis .
The scientific experts also heard calls for regrading from the Association of Chief Police Officers , which argued that the emergence of British cannabis farms and confusion over its legal status on the streets justified tightening the law .
The Home Office study now under way is the first time that there has been a concerted attempt to find out what strength and type of cannabis is actually available on the street .
Police forces across the country have been asked to send up to 1,000 samples of cannabis confiscated in stop and search operations to the Home Office for analysis .
King , who is the technical adviser to the six - week study , said the initial findings were based on " several hundred " samples .
The Home Office - funded study is to report to the advisory council and the home secretary in March before the government decides whether or not to regrade cannabis in April .

I do n’t usually like to blog about my client work , but in this case I ’ll make an exception , since so many other people are blogging about it who do n’t have any idea what they ’re talking about .
A lot of these people , it seems , think that the Chandler project is dead , dying , or a “ failure ” of some kind .
And that ’s simply not true .
Could the project have delivered more , in less time ?
Sure , absolutely .
Does it have anything to do with the tools used ?
Absolutely not .
Is the project dead ?
Not at all .
Did it achieve its original goals ?
No .
Is it likely to achieve its original goals ?
I ’m inclined to say no .
Does that matter ?
Hardly !
Why ?
Because in addition to creating a nice desktop application that :
does online / offline calendars with overlays , recurrence and timezone support , date parsing , etc .
has an extensible sharing framework that allows peer - to - peer or server sync with a variety of protocols , including CalDAV and gData
allows plugins to extend the data model and include that data in peer and server sharing
has an Eclipse - like plugin model allowing extenders and extendees with sophisticated UI extensibility
and a nice CalDAV server with an AJAX UI , the Chandler project has also funded ( through paid developer time ) a lot of open source libraries and tools , especially for Python .
Here ’s a partial list of other projects that are or were funded by Chandler , in whole or in part :
I ’m sure I ’ve missed some , even among the things that I personally worked on .
Anyway , the point is that between the client , server , and libraries , the Chandler project has produced quite a lot of working code , all of which would remain useful and beneficial to the community , even if the organization had already been disbanded .
But it has n’t disbanded .
On Tuesday I ’ll be in San Francisco , meeting with the other members of the team , as we hash out our strategy for moving forward .
It is certainly possible that we ’ll decide to just wrap up the outstanding work on bug fixes , quality improvement , and so on for the existing packages , and not try to continue past the end of this year .
It ’s also possible that we ’ll decide to push forward with new feature work , or focus on integrating our cool calendar / plugin platform with other open source applications .
Really , there are quite a few possibilities there .
What a lot of people outside OSAF do n’t get about this is that the re-org is a good thing .
Do n’t get me wrong – it ’s not so good for the people who got laid off .
But for the project , it was a godsend .
See , out of all the junk that people have been writing for years and years about the project , almost nobody has actually seen what the real problem is , why Chandler did n’t get anywhere near the original , highly - ambitious goals .
Sure , people have pointed fingers at lots of things , and the idea that there was plenty of time and resources with no hard deadlines is often brought up as a culprit .
But that ’s not quite right , either .
Having worked on , in , and around the project for about three years now , I can tell you quite simply what the problem was , and why the re-org fixes that problem .
There was no objective basis for decision - making .
It ’s that simple , really .
Without an objective basis , there was no way to argue from anything except opinion , with nobody ’s opinion being more important than anyone else ’s .
There was no benevolent dictator but Mitch , and Mitch had already stopped being available day - to - day before I even started working for them .
( And I ’ve heard that even when he was the benevolent dictator , he was perhaps sometimes a bit too benevolent – i.e. , inclined to just let people choose their own direction / vision for what the project was going to be . )
Thus , there was no unified design , architecture , vision , nothing .
We had fiefdoms , not because anybody wanted to shut anybody else out , but because the natural response of a good developer faced with chaos is to find a way to organize the part that he or she can deal with .
It was easier for each person to just go and focus on the things he or she cared about , than to try to build consensus in the absence of an objective idea of what “ success ” was supposed be .
Now , you can point to inadequate specification , lack of constraints , and all sorts of other contributing factors as to why there was no objective criteria for success .
But to me , those are n’t really central .
You could have every single one of those things correct , for example , and still find some other way to create a culture that lacks objective criteria !
And it ’s the lack of these common , objective criteria that does you in , regardless of why the criteria are lacking .
Without them , you ca n’t really have productive discussions or planning , whenever the necessary action crosses organizational boundaries .
( Since different sub - groups will have their own views and criteria , with no common criteria to sync against . )
Anyway , next week , we ’re actually going to sit down and work on defining some objective criteria for the Chandler project as a whole , going forward .
Those criteria may not be what Mitch originally had in mind , and they may be considerably less ambitious .
But , my sincere hope is that they will be sufficiently objective , to allow us a chance at achieving them this year .
So , if and when the project is really dead , we ’ll certainly say so .
In the meantime , IMO , the obituaries are more than a little premature .
We ’re only pinin ’ for some criteria , you see . 😉
Cocaine seizures and major drug raids in Argentina and Brazil have surged in the past two years .
The influx of raw cocaine paste used to make crack , from both Bolivia and Peru , has been particularly acute .
In Brazil , such seizures by the federal police nearly quadrupled from 2006 to 2007 , to 2,700 pounds from about 710 pounds , according to the police .

In Argentina , the deep financial crisis of late 2001 turned places like Ciudad Oculta into what are known here as villas miserias , or towns of misery , easily exploitable markets of impoverished people looking for escape .
“ Cocaine is no longer the drug only of the elite , of high society , ” said Luiz Carlos Magno , a Brazilian narcotics officer in the São Paulo State Police Department .
“ Today kids buy three lines of cocaine for 10 reals , ” or about $ 6 .
For about $ 1 in Brazil and about $ 1.50 in Argentina , users can buy enough of the cocaine for a 15 - minute high .
Paco is highly addictive because its high lasts just a few minutes  and is so intense that many users smoke 20 to 50 paco cigarettes a day to try to make its effects linger .
Paco is even more toxic than crack cocaine because it is made mostly of solvents and chemicals like kerosene , with just a dab of cocaine , Argentine and Brazilian drug enforcement officials said .
The surge in lower - quality cocaine hitting the streets has resulted from a crackdown by both countries on the chemicals needed to transform cocaine paste , or pasta base , as it is called , into powder form .
Tougher customs rules to track the flow of the chemicals , manufactured in large quantities in both countries , have limited access for Bolivian traffickers seeking to refine the base cocaine into higher - value powder , said Gen. Roberto Uchõa , Brazil ’s national drug secretary .
As the quality of Bolivian cocaine has fallen off , the European market , in particular , has rejected it , the general said .
So more of it has gone to Argentina and Brazil .
In São Paulo , the police say the cocaine on the streets is less than 30 percent pure .
“ Every year they are producing more , and that is driving down prices , ” said Mr. Magno , with the state police .

This morning on Fox NFL Sunday 's pregame show , co-host and former NFL player , Howie Long , decided it would be a good idea to insult Al Gore to make a point about sports .
Not only is this moron 's statement wrong , it 's unprofessional and he should be called out for it .
Why do people like Howie and Al Michaels feel the need to mix politics with sports ?
You can write to FOXSports and tell them what you think about Howie 's hackery .
Long : " ... Mike Martz suffers from a rare form of the Al Gore syndrome , where Al still thinks he's the president and Mike Martz still thinks he 's the head coach ... "
* Note to Keith Olbermann - If you 're looking for someone for your Worst Person In The NFL segment tonight , I think Howie is your man ...
As you 're probably aware , Ohio's 10th Congressional is in the midst of a fierce primary battle .
Motivated to seize the House seat for its preferred corporate candidate , and driven by hatred stretching back to Muny Light , the Cleveland Plain Dealer -- a very conservative newspaper and the town 's only daily -- is trying to push Dennis Kucinich out after more than ten years of loyal and able service to his constituency .
Cleveland 's movers and shakers have thrown their support by sitting Ward 13 councilman Joe Cimperman , a corporate - owned politician .
His argument for running is based in part on the most ludicrous of claims : that a sitting elected official ought not to spend taxpayer time and money running for another elected office .
But that is precisely what Cimperman is doing .
Furthermore , he is running on a patently false claim that Kucinich has missed more votes than almost any other member of Congress .
The truth , however , is not on Cimperman 's side .
According to GovTrack.us :
Dennis Kucinich missed 346 of 7054 votes ( 5 % ) since Jan 7 , 1997 .
Compare this to campaigning Republican Ron Paul , who according to GovTrack.us has missed twice as many votes as Kucinich .
Ronald Paul missed 687 of 7054 votes ( 10 % ) since Jan 7 , 1997 .
And what of the sitting U.S. senators running for president ?
John McCain has missed sixteen percent of his votes .
John McCain missed 592 of 3720 votes ( 16 % ) since Jan 22 , 1997 .
Barack Obama has missed seventeen percent .
Barack Obama missed 185 of 1098 votes ( 17 % ) since Jan 6 , 2005 .
And Hillary Clinton has missed six percent of votes , just one percent below Kucinich 's attendance record .
Hillary Clinton missed 152 of 2406 votes ( 6 % ) since Jan 23 , 2001 .
So what may we conclude from this ?
That Cimperman is either lying his fool ass off , or else he is too lazy or too stupid to get his facts straight -- or a combination thereof .
My money , if I had any , would be on the combo theory .
And whatever the case may be , is this really the kind of person Ohio's 10th Congressional District really wants or needs representing it ?
Here 's another case against Cimperman and his backers at the Plain Dealer .
The Pee Dee used the entire space of the Sunday editorial slot to bless Cimperman .
Actually , it was not so much to anoint Cimperman as to throw slaps at his opponent , Dennis Kucinich .
And ...
What struck me as really odd was how little space the paper spent on telling us of any accomplishments of Cimperman .
His major accomplishment , as I can see , is giving away city money to developers .
While we 're on that note , let 's ask ourselves , of the two main candidates for Ohio - 10 , who has accomplished more ?
Kucinich , hands down .
Kucinich -
Cosponsored HR 676 , which is Medicare for all Americans .
H.R. 4060 : Universal Prekindergarten
Act
H.R. 3400 : Rebuilding America's Infrastructure
H.R. 1234 : To end the United States occupation of Iraq immediately
H. Con. Res. 23 : Expressing the sense of Congress that the President should not order an escalation in the total number of members of the United States Armed Forces serving in Iraq .
H.R. 2707 : To reauthorize the Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program
H.R. 3875 : To permit the Secretary of Labor to make an administrative determination of the amount of unpaid wages owed for certain violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the New Orleans region after Hurricane Katrina .
And then , of course , there are his articles of impeachment against Dick Cheney .
Pretty busy for a " part - time " member of the House of Representatives , huh ?
And what , by the way , has Cimperman done for his constituents ?
According to ClevelandLeader.com ( bear with me , this one 's a long quote but it is absolutely necessary ) :
Just to remind people of what the donation - gobbling Cimperman has become as the downtown councilman , I 've listed below what the city and others , with Cimperman 's strong backing , gave to the Wolstein project in the Flats .
The project is in Cimperman 's ward .
Of course , the city also helped with eminent domain to shift properties to Wolstein from others .
There 's an interesting battle now going on for downtown real estate development with several major corporations and law firms reportedly interested in new office space .
Looking for new digs : Baker & Hostetler , Eaton Corp. , Ernst & Young , Huntington Bank and Squire , Sanders & Dempsey .
So there 's demand .
It will be interesting in the climate of demand to observe how city officials - Mayor Frank Jackson and City Council - react to this renewed interest in new office space .
Since there 's high demand should the city avoid offering all kinds of subsidy incentives to developers to do what they must do - meet the demand by building ?
( It 's also unclear whether the new space will be added space or simply newer space to shift tenants from older buildings , in other words , rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic / Cleveland . )
The Pee Dee could do a service to the citizens by researching and telling us which downtown property owners got what part of the $ 100 million in taxable property that came off the tax rolls in recent years .
Likely suspects : Forest City Enterprises , Dick Jacobs and John Carney interests .
The market is supposed to rule .
And , to some degree , it does .
The best example is the empty space on the west side of Public Square .
The city in 1989 awarded Dick Jacobs the same sweet subsidy deal to build on that site as the developer received for the north side of Public Square ( Key Center & Marriott Hotel ) .
Yet , 19 years later , the site remains fallow , a parking lot .
That 's because there has been no market for new office space and thus no development .
Now , since there is said to be demand , why do n't the developers meet the demand - but without seeking to wring out abatements and other subsidies from the depressed City of Cleveland ?
The answer is simple : greed .
They do n't because our political leaders are too eager ( Cimperman ) to serve their benefactors at the expense of their constituents .
Below are the incredible " incentives " given to the Wolstein partnership for the Flats East Side project .
Here is the list : BDOHS ( port authority ) will provide $ 11 million in loans .
City of Cleveland will provide $ 6 million in Core City loans .
Cleveland Public
Power will provide $ 3.4 million in services .
Cleveland Water Division will provide $ 740,000 in infrastructure costs .
Cleveland will provide another $ 1 million from its general obligation bonds .
The County , City and Cleveland schools will forgo $ 11,140,000 in property taxes under a TIF ( tax abatement ) program to help the project .
Cuyahoga County will provide $ 1 million in subsidies .
The State of Ohio will provide a grant of $ 3 million for " environmental remediation , " matched by a loan from Cuyahoga County of $ 1 million , both committed from the 2005 Clean Ohio program .
Tax exempt Parking Revenue Bonds estimated at $ 8,540,000 will be repaid from Public parking facility revenues .
Tax - exempt infrastructure bonds estimated to be $ 9 million are secured by annual payments by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District .
The sum of approximately $ 4,550,000 will be made available through the Federal Highway Administration .
The federal government has appropriated and the city shall obtain and make available when required for eligible project costs a grant of $ 1,464,735 from the U. S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic Atmosphere Administration ( NOAA grant ) .
All rental and condominium units ( some 300 units ) will be tax abated at 100 % for 15 years .
No cost estimate given by the city , port authority or county .
The city agrees to enact legislation as necessary to amend and extend the CRA residential tax abatement program to assure that all residential improvements are eligible for the full 15 - year , 100 % abatement of real estate taxes .
No cost given .
The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority ( RTA ) will construct a transit station on the RTA Waterfront Rail Line for the project " ... all at no cost or expense " to the developer .
No total or estimated cost mentioned .
The City of Cleveland " shall take all necessary action to vacate all existing streets within the project site to the extent no longer require as public improvements for the project , and any easements which impair or adversely affect the development , construction or occupancy of the project , or which lie within the project site and are no longer required for use as public improvements for the Project . "
No cost estimate given .
The City of Cleveland " shall convey to the developer all the land owned by it ( the city ) within the residential site not necessary for public improvements by official quit - claim deed ... "
No cost estimate given .
Under a section called " public improvements " , it states : " Public improvements necessary to support the Residential project will include but may not be limited to the following ....
Abatement , demolition and environmental remediation ( including all necessary earthwork and soil clean - up ) of the Project properties as they exist as of the execution date of this Agreement so as to allow for construction of the Residential Project .
On - site paving and landscaping for all areas from the building lines of the Residential Project to the street curb as well as the public spaces of the Riverfront Park described below .
A Riverfront Park extending from the southern boundary of the Project along the Cuyahoga River 's edge north to the Norfolk & Southern rail line with an eastern edge defined by a realigned Old River Road and a new street network described below .
The Park may include but not be limited to the following elements : a riverfront boardwalk , gather places ; pavilions ; project signage , retail kiosks ; and a marina for transient boater use .
The Riverfront Park shall be planned in such a manner so as to receive the proposed extension of the Towpath Trail ...
Utility improvements , replacements and / or upgrades sufficient to provide necessary storm and sanitary sewer , water , electrical , gas and thermal heating and cooling services for the Residential Project and the permanent improvements in the public right of way ( e. g. street lighting ) and property ( e.g. Riverfront Park fixtures and appurtenances ) for ongoing and seasonal needs .
Street improvements , realignments and additions to serve the Residential Project and its associated parking facilities , including all necessary traffic control equipment and signage ...
Bulkhead repair , replacement and improvements sufficient to maintain the long - term integrity of the eastern edge of the Project site bordered by the Cuyahoga River .
The Public Parking Facilities and Private Parking Facilities estimated to consist of a minimum of 1,600 spaces in total and sufficient to serve the retail and residential uses of the Project by way of four structured facilities and no fewer than two surface lots , including all necessary equipment , landscaping and appurtenances .
An allocable share of land acquisition costs associated with the square footage occupied by the Public Improvement as a percentage of the entire Project square footage ( Residential Project plus Public Improvements . )
Any and all soft costs which may be attributable to construction of the Public improvements including but not limited to architectural and engineering services , lighting , traffic and parking consultants , permits / fees , testing and inspection , temporary utilities , financing fees and costs and capitalized interest on bonds or loans .
With Joe in Congress just think of how much booty can be delivered to our developers .
Rosemary Palmer and Barbara Anne Ferris , the latter of whom comes from a family - owned steakhouse and was endorsed by the Plain Dealer in 2006 , are also on the ballot for Ohio - 10 .
But with Cimperman getting corporate money thrown at him like water splashed on a kid at the local pool , neither of them stands as big a chance against the far worthier incumbent .
Furthermore , Ferris has received help from Cleveland - area Republicans [ 1 ] in order to seize the seat the only way it can -- through a bought off " Democrat " .
In 2004 she ran against Dennis Kucinich as an independent before switching her party affiliation over to Democrat so she would fare better in the heavily - Democratic town .
You really have to wonder if The Plain Dealer thinks it can fool all the people all the time .
That 's my thought when I see a rather long editorial " un-endorsing " Congressman Dennis Kucinich and telling readers to vote for a woman who ran as an independent in 2004 and who appears to be a Republican now .
No matter to the Plain Dealer .
She is not Kucinich .
That is what seems to matter to this Republican newspaper .
On the other hand , maybe they believe by electing Ferris , the Republican candidate will win District 10 in November .
I gather her Republican leanings from a ringing endorsement on her website from Republican Robert Brown .
He heads up " Republicans for Ferris " though she 's running in a Democratic primary .
Ohio -10 voters were n't fooled by Ferris in 2004 or 2006 , and they certainly shan't be fooled by her again .
And while her financial resources are n't bad , they 're not enough to compete with the million or so dollars Cimperman has been handed for his run .
So she 's a non-entity in a race the Plain Dealer wants won by a moneyed candidate with an actual chance against their hated nemesis .
The bottom line is this : Progressives must keep Ohio - 10 safe .
If Cimperman manages to buy his way into Congress , with help from Cleveland 's conservative movers and shakers , we can say goodbye to that seat for years to come .
Because once Dennis is out , and a weak , corporate Democrat is in , you can be damned sure that the Ohio Republican Party will be emboldened to make a serious grab for that seat .
Please go to www.kucinich.us and donate your money , time , and energy to helping keep this vital Congressional seat solidly in Progressive hands .

About author I 'm from Ohio , and a registered member of the Green Party of Ohio .
While working on
, I needed someone in the restaurant industry to explain the situation honestly .
Understandably , no restaurant owner in Houston wanted to come out and say he was hiring illegals .
So I e-mailed Tony Bourdain , who is not only a television star and a best - selling author , but is also one of the most outspoken chefs in America .
He supplied me with a long quote on the subject .
I could n’t use all of it in the article , but you can read the full quote below . --

" People have differing opinions on what we should do about immigration in the future .
How open or how closed our borders should be .
Fine .
But let 's be honest , at least , about who is cooking in America NOW .
Who we rely on -- have relied on for decades .
The bald fact is that the entire restaurant industry in America would close down overnight , would never recover , if current immigration laws were enforced quickly and thoroughly across the board .
Everyone in the industry knows this .
It is undeniable .
Illegal labor is the backbone of the service and hospitality industry -- Mexican , Salvadoran and Ecuadoran in particular .
To contemplate actually doing without is to contemplate mass closings , a general shake - out of individually owned and operated restaurants -- and , of course , unthinkably ( now ) higher prices in the places that manage to survive .
Considering that our economy and employment picture is now largely based on us selling hamburgers to each other , the ripple effects would be grave .
I know very few chefs who 've even heard of a US born citizen coming in the door to ask for a dishwasher , night clean - up or kitchen prep job .
Until that happens -- let 's at least try to be honest when discussing this issue . "

Fear that a hobbled banking sector may set off another Great Depression could force the U.S. government and Federal Reserve to take the unprecedented step of buying a broad range of assets , including stocks , according to one of the most bearish market analysts .
That extreme scenario , which would aim to stave off deflation and stabilize the economy , is evolving as the base case for Bernard Connolly , global strategist at Banque AIG in London .
" Avoiding a depression is , unfortunately , going to have to involve either a large , quasi - permanent increase in the budget deficit -- preferably tax cuts -- or restoring overvaluation of equity prices , " Connolly said on Monday .
" If conventional monetary policy is not enough to produce that result , the government may have to buy equities , financed by the Fed , " Connolly said .
Legal changes would be needed to give the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government the authority to buy stocks .
Currently the Federal Reserve can buy only debt issued by the Treasury , as well as U.S. agency debentures and mortgage - backed securities .
While Connolly already sees some parallels with the 1930s , he expects that a more pro-active central bank and government will probably help avert a repeat of that scenario today .
The build up of a credit bubble in recent years was similar to the late 1920s run-up to the Great Depression , he said .
WASHINGTON --
The banking industry , struggling to contain the fallout from the mortgage debacle , is urgently shopping proposals to Congress and the Bush administration that could shift some of the risk for troubled loans to the federal government .
As the credit bubble unravels , will the bad debts be written off , resulting in a debt - deflation spiral ?
Or will central banks do everything within their power , including the use of " unconventional methods " to prevent asset prices from falling ?
I suggest the latter outcome .
The benefits to a deflation are deferred and dispersed , and require a considerable amount of pain first ; while the benefits of bailing out financial institutions are immediate and concentrated .
With 70 % of Americans owning homes , public opinion generally favors rising , or at least not - falling home prices .
It 's hard to see any political figure making a case for letting the system wash out and find its own leve .
Reuters reports and .
and the Wall Street Journal writes , Worried bankers seek to shift risk to Uncle Sam
People in my line of work try to answer certain questions .
Why did Hillary surge after misting up in New Hampshire ?
Why have primary victories produced no momentum for the victors ?
Why did John McCain win among Republicans who oppose the Iraq war in both New Hampshire and Michigan , but lose among voters who support it ?
The truth is that many of the theories we come up with are bogus .
They are based on the assumption that voters make cold , rational decisions about who to vote for and can tell us why they decided as they did .
This is false .
In reality , we voters  all of us  make emotional , intuitive decisions about who we prefer , and then come up with post - hoc rationalizations to explain the choices that were already made beneath conscious awareness .
“ People often act without knowing why they do what they do , ” Daniel Kahneman , a Nobel Prize winner , noted in an e-mail message to me this week .
“ The fashion of political writing this year is to suggest that people choose their candidate by their stand on the issues , but this strikes me as highly implausible . ”
Nobody really knows how voters think , especially during primary seasons when the policy differences are minute , but it would n’t be surprising if the cognitive chain went something like this :
After seeing a candidate for 100 milliseconds , voters make certain sorts of judgments based on expressiveness , facial structure , carriage and attitude .
Alexander Todorov of Princeton has found that he can predict 70 percent of political races just by measuring peoples ’ snap judgments of candidates ’ faces .
Analysis of unseen trials and other data concludes it is no better than placebo
Prozac , the bestselling antidepressant taken by 40 million people worldwide , does not work and nor do similar drugs in the same class , according to a major review released today .
The study examined all available data on the drugs , including results from clinical trials that the manufacturers chose not to publish at the time .
The trials compared the effect on patients taking the drugs with those given a placebo or sugar pill .
When all the data was pulled together , it appeared that patients had improved - but those on placebo improved just as much as those on the drugs .
The only exception is in the most severely depressed patients , according to the authors - Prof Irving Kirsch from the department of psychology at Hull University and colleagues in the US and Canada .
But that is probably because the placebo stopped working so well , they say , rather than the drugs having worked better .
" Given these results , there seems little reason to prescribe antidepressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients , unless alternative treatments have failed , " says Kirsch .
" This study raises serious issues that need to be addressed surrounding drug licensing and how drug trial data is reported . "
The paper , published today in the journal PLoS ( Public Library of Science ) Medicine , is likely to have a significant impact on the prescribing of the drugs .
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) already recommends that counselling should be tried before doctors prescribe antidepressants .
Kirsch , who was one of the consultants for the guidelines , says the new analysis " would suggest that the prescription of antidepressant medications might be restricted even more " .
The review breaks new ground because Kirsch and his colleagues have obtained for the first time what they believe is a full set of trial data for four antidepressants .
They requested the full data under freedom of information rules from the Food and Drug Administration , which licenses medicines in the US and requires all data when it makes a decision .
The pattern they saw from the trial results of fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , paroxetine ( Seroxat ) , venlafaxine ( Effexor ) and nefazodone ( Serzone ) was consistent .
" Using complete data sets ( including unpublished data ) and a substantially larger data set of this type than has been previously reported , we find the overall effect of new - generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance , " they write .
Two more frequently prescribed antidepressants were omitted from the study because scientists were unable to obtain all the data .
Concerns have been raised in recent years about the side - effects of this class of antidepressant .
Evidence that they could prompt some young people to consider suicide led to a warning to doctors not to prescribe them for the under - 18s - with the exception of Prozac , which was considered more effective than the rest .
In adults , however , the depression - beating benefits were thought to outweigh the risks .
Since its launch in the US in 1988 , some 40 million people have taken Prozac , earning tens of billions of dollars for the manufacturer , Eli Lilly .
Although the patent lapsed in 2001 , fluoxetine continues to make the company money - it is now the active ingredient in Sarafem , a pill sold by Lilly for premenstrual syndrome .
Eli Lilly was defiant last night .
" Extensive scientific and medical experience has demonstrated that fluoxetine is an effective antidepressant , " it said in a statement .
" Since its discovery in 1972 , fluoxetine has become one of the world 's most - studied medicines .
Lilly is proud of the difference fluoxetine has made to millions of people living with depression . "
A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline , which makes Seroxat , said the authors had failed to acknowledge the " very positive " benefits of the treatment and their conclusions were " at odds with what has been seen in actual clinical practice " .
He added : " This analysis has only examined a small subset of the total data available while regulatory bodies around the world have conducted extensive reviews and evaluations of all the data available , and this one study should not be used to cause unnecessary alarm and concern for patients . "
The majority of the world 's coral reefs are in danger of being killed off by rising levels of greenhouse gases , scientists warned yesterday .
Researchers from Britain , the US and Australia , working with teams from the UN and the World Bank , voiced their concerns after a study revealed 98 % of the world 's reef habitats are likely to become too acidic for corals to grow by 2050 .
The loss of big coral reefs would have a devastating effect on communities , many of which rely on fish and other marine life that shelter in the reefs .
It would leave coastlines unprotected against storm surges and damage often - crucial income from tourism .
Among the first victims of acidifying oceans will be Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , the world 's largest organic structure .
The oceans absorb around a third of the 20bn tonnes of carbon dioxide produced each year by human activity .
While the process helps to slow global warming by keeping the gas from the atmosphere , in sea water it dissolves to form carbonic acid - rising levels of which cause carbonates to dissolve .
One of these minerals , aragonite , is used by corals and other marine organisms to grow their skeletons .
It is particularly susceptible to carbonic acid .
Without it , corals become brittle and are unable to grow and repair damage caused by fish , snails and natural erosion .
The scientists used computer simulations to model levels of aragonite in the world 's oceans from pre-industrial times , when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels stood at 280 parts per million .
Present day levels of carbon dioxide are 380 ppm , but scientists expect the figure will rise substantially by the end of the century .
The team looked at three scenarios based on predictions of greenhouse gas emissions by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The first assumed that atmospheric carbon dioxide was held at today 's level , leading to an increase in temperature of 1C by the end of the century .
Under this scenario there was enough aragonite left in the oceans for corals to continue growing .
The second scenario looked at the effect of carbon dioxide levels at between 450 and 500 ppm , a rise that would increase global temperatures by 2C .
Under these conditions only very hardy corals and creatures that lived off them would survive .
In the worst scenario , when carbon dioxide levels rose above 500 ppm , the models predicted a 3C rise and a substantial increase in ocean acidity , causing the majority of reefs to die off .
The study appears in the journal Science .
" Before the industrial revolution over 98 % of warm water coral reefs were bathed with open ocean waters 3.5 times supersaturated with aragonite , meaning that corals could easily extract it to build reefs , " said Long Cao , a co-author from the Carnegie Institution in Stanford .
" If atmospheric carbon dioxide stabilises at 550 ppm , and even that would take concerted international effort , no existing coral reef will remain in such an environment . "
Peter Mumby , a reef ecologist at Exeter University , who worked on the study , said : " Reefs help protect coastlines from storm damage by acting as a buffer , so without them storm surges will go straight over and hit the coast . "
Under threat
Philippines
One of the most threatened coral hot spots , the reefs face damage from pollution , run -off from logging , and dynamite fishing
Gulf of Guinea Around 20 sq km of reef between four islands off the west African coast under threat from coastal development and coral harvesting
Sunda Islands
Part of the coral triangle , one of the most diverse coastal areas .
Already at threat from destructive fishing and reef fish trade
Southern Mascarene Islands Reefs surrounding Mauritius , Reunion and Rodriguez islands in southern Indian Ocean are under threat from pollution from the sugar cane industry and agricultural development
Eastern South Africa Next to Cape Floristic , this smaller reef is also at risk from over - fishing and tourism
What makes someone charming ?
Is it their bearing , their countenance ?
Is it their sparkling conversation ?
Their dazzling personality and razor - sharp wit ?
You might be surprised to know that it 's really none of the above .
As Brian Tracy says , " Charm is the ability to create extraordinary rapport that makes others feel exceptional . "
What 's remarkable about this ability is that it 's easily obtained , not genetic .
There 's no special trick to it ; it just takes a little practice .
I 'm about as far from charming as you can get .
It might be the mark of a blogger ; we 're fun- lovin ' , hard - drinkin ' types , but we 're not necessarily the most socially graceful people you will ever meet .
[ Speak for yourself .
- Ed. ]
I 'm just not great with people .
I 'm naturally shy and rather anti-social .
I 'm talkative once I get to know someone , but introduce me to a total stranger at a party , and I 'm usually a wreck .
That 's why I took a class on charm and schmoozing a while back .
See , I 'd always figured that charming people are the ones who are always the center of attention .
The class clowns , the life of the party .
The ones that are always ready with a sarcastic quip or a smart - aleck comeback .
The people who can make the whole room bust a gut .
The Chris Rocks of the world .
During the first few minutes of my How to Be Charming , our instructor asked us to list qualities that we found charming .
Most people said the same thing : funny , warm , memorable .
But ultimately , it was very difficult to define charm .
Our next task was to name people in our lives that we found charming .
The first person that popped into my head is the medical assistant who runs my father 's medical office .
Her name is LaWanda , and you 've never met a more charming lady in your life .
She 's the warmest , kindest , and most thoughtful woman that I 've met in years .
The class took turns summarizing our personal impressions of charming people , and we all realized that most of the qualities that we associated with charming people were n't just that they were warm and kind , but that they made US feel special .
That description fits LaWanda to a T .
She 's the kind of person who seems to find everything I do fascinating .
Got a new contract job ?
Cool !
Working on a blogging website !
Fabulous .
And she wants to hear all about it .
Every time I talk to LaWanda , I end up feeling like I really am accomplishing things in life , that I lead an exciting urban existence .
The whole class agreed that our charming examples were all people who drew out the best in us .
Charming people all seem to :
Listen exceptionally well
Have excellent memory for details
Praise our accomplishments and empathized with our troubles
Make good eye contract
Ask lots of relevant questions
Be good at accepting compliments
Be genuine in their expressions , never false or flaky
Understand the power of touch , be it a great handshake , hug , or arm squeeze
Make the other person feel really special
Avoid offering unsolicited advice
Use our first name a bit more than most people would during conversation ( without overdoing it )
Ask great follow - up questions
Be honest , if not brutally so
In other words , being charming is n't about being the center of attention .
In fact , it 's just the opposite .
Charming people put the spotlight on SOMEONE ELSE , allowing someone else to bask in the glory .
A charming person acts almost like an interviewer , and almost everyone LOVES to be interviewed .
As The Shrubbery puts it , " People love to hear themselves talk .
Even more so do they love to talk about themselves .
If you are sincere , keeping eye contact , and asking questions about your Charm - ee , you will be sure to keep an audience with him or her .
This will also help you learn about them to the point where you can find some common ground to talk about . "
Brian Kim , on his self - improvement web site , offers a list of tips on how to be charming , and gives some great examples of charming people that he has encountered .
Wikihow has a good article with some advice on how to be more charming .
But why bother being charming ?
After all , being charming is really more about giving than receiving .
You 're putting yourself out there , asking questions of people , learning their names and their kids ' names and their birthdays and likes and dislikes , and by the end of the evening , you know a lot about someone else and no one knows anything about you .
Exactly .
One counterintuitive thing about charming people is that they do n't reveal much .
They keep their cards close to their chests .
And why ?
Well , some charming people are actually very private .
Others just enjoy hearing about other people 's lives more than discussing their own .
But one cliche that applies well to this situation is " Knowledge is power . "
The more someone knows about you , the more power they have over you .
Whether you are talking about intelligence agencies , ex-girlfriends , or your own mom , knowledge is power .
It does n't mean that this knowledge will be used for nefarious means : the fact that LaWanda remembers my birthday every year only means that she comes across as much more thoughtful than I do , since I have not a clue when her birthday is .
It 's not that charming people are complete enigmas , living in a shroud of mystery that no one can penetrate .
It 's just that they are much more selective about who they reveal the details of their lives to .
The reward for this is that people think very highly of you , because ... well , because you 're so charming .
You get invited to more shindigs .
You are spoken well of .
You get more business referrals .
Because I 'm such a lousy listener , I 'm not sure that I 'll ever be particularly charming .
But I 'm pretty happy to know that there 's a method to the madness , and that it 's not particularly difficult to attain a certain level of charm .
FWIW , OCaml is an amazing language .

Economists may be warning of tough times ahead and homeowners fretting about the state of the property market , but one London nightclub remains undeterred .
Today , it will launch the world 's most expensive Christmas cocktail , costing £ 35,000 a glass .
The Movida nightclub , a hangout of celebrities , footballers and the super - rich , has already taken a small number of orders for the drink , named the Flawless .
The cocktail consists of a large measure of Louis XII cognac , half a bottle of Cristal Rose champagne , some brown sugar , angostura bitters and a few flakes of 24 - carat edible gold leaf .
The drink is described as warming and refreshing , but that is not the main reason for the exorbitant cost : at the bottom of the crystal glass is an 11 - carat white diamond ring .
Customers will also be treated to an unusual floorshow .
The drink will be mixed in the presence of two security guards , who will then watch over the client 's table until it is finished .
" They 're definitely paying for the show as well , " said Ed Rollason the Movida 's bar manager .
" And they 'll have the attention of everyone else in the bar . "
Among the first to order the drink was Max Reigns , 28 , a property developer and manager .
He intends to give it to his girlfriend for Christmas .
" I just thought it would be a nice thing to do for her .
She has so many other things . "
Asked whether he could n't think of a better use for £ 35,000 , he replied : " It 's about the same as a holiday , is n't it ? "
According to What Car ?
£ 35,000 would buy a Porsche Boxster Open and still leave you with plenty of change for the glove compartment .
Alternatively , it would get you just short of 31,500 shares in the troubled mortgage - lender Northern Rock , according to prices yesterday afternoon .
As an annual income , £ 35,000 is more than about three quarters of the workforce earns in a year .
Others treated news of the drink as further evidence of the spending power and irresponsibility of the super - rich .
" It 's like sticking two fingers up at the rest of society , " said the Labour MP Sion Simon .
" You might as well set fire to your money in front of those less well - off .
It 's a very deliberate way of saying ' We are not part of the same country as you . ' "
The drink will appeal to " the stupid segment of the super - rich " , said the social commentator Peter York .
" It is so gauche , so crashingly crass , that everyone else will see the buyers as barely literate , as one step up from a potato .
" It will be one of those things that unite both the middle class and the old rich in a belief that the super - rich come out of some kind of primeval ooze . "
Nor did the cocktail appeal to others in the drinks industry .
" It sounds pretty revolting and most people I know would n't spend as much as £ 2.50 on it , " said Tim Martin , chairman of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain .
" They 'd be better off with a pint of Abbot Ale . "

In a dramatic moment at UCLA 's Pauley Pavilion , California First Lady Maria Shriver just strode out onto a stage that had already seen its share of celebrities -- Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder among them -- and announced that she was joining the Kennedy half of the family backing Barack Obama , reports our colleague Mark Z. Barabak , who is there .
More details will be posted shortly and in tomorrow 's print edition , but Shriver reportedly was waiting backstage wavering over whether she should make her support public , and then finally strode out on stage .
Her husband , Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , earlier this week announced his endorsement for Sen. John McCain .
The Kennedy family has split over the two top Democratic contenders , with Ted Kennedy joined by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg -- daughter of his brother John F. Kennedy -- and his son , U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy , all going with Obama .
Ethel Kennedy , widow of Robert F. Kennedy , also went with the Illinois senator .
But Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up the support of three of Robert and Ethel 's children -- Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , Kerry Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr .
UPDATE : Shriver told the crowded gym that she had not intended to be at the rally , and had come straight over after going horse riding with her daughter .
She joked about her appearance -- riding clothes , sans makeup and without having her hair done -- as she added her pitch for Obama .
" If Barack Obama was a state he'd be California , " Shriver said , drawing roars from the crowd .
" I mean think about it : diverse , open , smart , independent , oppose tradition , innovative , inspiring , dreamer , leader . "
And she touched on the ( see more of the blog post below the jump ) ...
For those of you who missed the C - SPAN coverage , it 's here :
Buried inside the nation ’s news pages â€ ” lost among the big takeout stories about which presidential candidate said what to whom with what insulting effect , President Bush ’s confusing trip to the Middle East , and surge and resurgence in Iraq and Afghanistan â€ ” was the reason 13 people died and 100 were injured when the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed last year .
A weakness built into that bridge went undetected for 40 years because it involved a part so basic that highway departments and bridge contractors seldom considered it even when they reanalyzed a bridgeâ€™s capacity , experts said Tuesday .
The flaw : Undersized gusset plates .
So , case closed ?
It was n’t a portentous sign of a failing national infrastructure after all ?
Just a sad , tragic miscalculation by an engineer four decades ago ?
Nope .
The discovery of a tragic design flaw does not change the fact that the nation ’s roads , bridges , harbors , sewage treatment plants , railroads , dams , reservoirs and other public infrastructure systems are inadequate because of lack of maintenance , modernization , overuse or abuse .
Nor does it change the fact that pressure should continue to be brought to bear on Congress to provide valid , realistic solutions that retain the public ’s infrastructure in the public ’s hands .
The National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 proposal by Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) and Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) , while appropriate for the intent of repairing public infrastructure , would place too much control in private ( read “ corporate ” ) hands .
But even that bill has gone nowhere since its introduction .
It has rested in committee since Aug .
3 . Only two co-sponsors have signed on .
The political clamor for action to address the severity of the nation ’s infrastructure problems vanished as quickly as the I - 35W bridge vanished from the headlines .
That amounts to sweeping the issue under the political rug .
These severe infrastructure problems remain .
According to TRIP ( The Road Information Program ) , a national transportation research group :
â€¢ 33 percent of the nation ’s major roads are in â€œpoor or mediocre condition .â€ 
â€¢ 36 percent of major urban highways are congested .
â€¢ 26 percent of bridges are â€œstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete.â€ 
Read TRIP ’s fact sheet .
It is an alarming assessment of the nation ’s highway system .
Infrastructure fixes will be expensive .
Consider the I - 35W bridge alone : According to Minnesota Public Radio , Minnesota will get $ 195 million from the feds to help replace the fallen I - 35W bridge .
Minnesota just finished inspecting its 4,000 bridges and found 15 that needed to be closed , repaired or replaced .
While low - volume bridges , they represent a financial burden to be addressed .
As the presidential candidates unfurl position after position on issue after issue , few have spoken at length and in detail about proposed solutions for the nation ’s infrastructure crisis .
Congress has been stalled in partisan bickering .
Journalists so intent last summer on covering the I - 35W collapse to assign blame and affix solutions have n’t kept their eye on the ball .
That ’s sad .
Another deadly bridge collapse should n’t be necessary to renew calls for action and refocus media attention .

I. Genocide and So On
" I mean the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot , 1975 through 1978 - that atrocity - I think it would be hard to find any example of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury and so on and so forth . " --
Noam Chomsky , in the documentary " Manufacturing Consent , " 1993 .
(1)
How did a man who describes the Khmer Rouge regime as " the great act of genocide of the modern period " come to be vilified as a vocal supporter of Pol Pot ?
In a long , illustrious career , Chomsky has amassed a formidable array of books , articles , and speeches .
He has been a tireless advocate for the underdog , and has demonstrated admirable commitment to his principles .
The underdogs , however , are not always the good guys , a fact clearly illustrated by the Khmer Rouge .
The question of whether or not Noam Chomsky supported the Khmer Rouge is not as clear as either his critics or his defenders would like to pretend .
His critics frequently extract a handful of quotes from " Distortions at Fourth Hand " or After the Cataclysm and suggest that Chomsky was an enthusiastic advocate for the Cambodian communists .
His defenders , meanwhile , limit their collections of quotes to Chomsky 's disclaimers and qualifiers , conveniently ignoring the underlying theme of his articles : that Khmer Rouge Cambodia was not nearly as bad as the regime 's detractors claimed .
Gathering all of Chomsky 's fig leaves into a single pile , they exclaim : My , what a lot of greenery . (*)
There is something vaguely unsettling in Chomsky 's words , even as he acknowledges the horrible toll of the Cambodian communists :
There was an atrocity , people were outraged , so on and so forth , blah blah blah .
The reaction is Chomsky 's primary concern ; genocide itself is a lesser point .
If Chomsky was initially skeptical of the reports of Khmer Rouge atrocities , he was certainly not alone .
Given that he now acknowledges the brutality of the Khmer Rouge regime , is it fair to continue to criticize him ?
A peculiar irony is at the heart of this controversy : Noam Chomsky , the man who has spent years analyzing propaganda , is himself a propagandist .
Whatever one thinks of Chomsky in general , whatever one thinks of his theories of media manipulation and the mechanisms of state power , Chomsky 's work with regard to Cambodia has been marred by omissions , dubious statistics , and , in some cases , outright misrepresentations .
On top of this , Chomsky continues to deny that he was wrong about Cambodia .
He responds to criticisms by misrepresenting his own positions , misrepresenting his critics ' positions , and describing his detractors as morally lower than " neo -Nazis and neo-Stalinists .
"
( 2) Consequently , his refusal to reconsider his words has led to continued misinterpretations of what really happened in Cambodia .
Misconceptions , it seems , have a very long life .
II .
The Right Villains
Any detailed examination of Chomksy 's comments on Cambodia should begin with his comments in the wake of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak 's 1970 coup , which overthrew Prince Norodom Sihanouk , and brought to power a staunchly pro-American regime .
In Cambodia , prior to the coup , the war in neighboring Vietnam had been held largely in check .
Fighting was limited mainly to the border areas , where large numbers of Vietnamese communists had set up sanctuaries inside Cambodian territory .
After the coup , Sihanouk promptly allied himself with the rebels , and in June , 1970 , Chomsky wrote a long article in the New York Review of Books , outlining the dire consequences of American involvement in Cambodia .
Despite some misleading remarks , it is , on the balance , a very astute analysis .
Chomsky accurately predicted the repercussions of Sihanouk 's alliance with the rebels :
" Speculating a year ago about the prospects of the Cambodian rebels for success , Michael Leifer wrote that these prospects ' will depend ( discounting external factors ) not only on the exploitation of genuine grievances but also on an ability to identify with the nationalist cause for which Prince Sihanouk has been the most ardent and passionate advocate .
This would seem unlikely . '
Before March 18 , this was a reasonable assessment .
Now , however , Sihanouk , the ' most ardent and passionate advocate ' of the national cause , the person whom one American expert described as being ' a significant expression of the Cambodian people 's will , ' has identified himself with the rebels .
It is doubtful that the right - wing Lon Nol government , with its narrow urban base , can counter this popular force or win it over . " ( 3 )
His remarks on the U.S. invasion , too , were fairly accurate :
" It is a virtual certainty that great victories will be claimed in the Cambodian invasion , and that the military will release reports of arms caches and rice destroyed , military bases demolished , and much killing of ' North Vietnamese , ' i.e. , people who find themselves in the way of an American tank or in an area bombed or strafed .
So many reputations and careers are at stake that glorious victories are guaranteed .
" Furthermore , some of these reports may even be correct .
On probabilistic grounds alone , one would expect that American military intelligence can't always be wrong about everything .
The headquarters of the Vietnamese resistance forces and the bases that they use for R - and - R must be somewhere , and they may well be found and destroyed during the American - Saigon sweep .
Whether the invading troops will withdraw remains to be seen .
That the countryside will be devastated and its population removed or destroyed is reasonably certain .
Very probably , if these territories are abandoned by the invading forces , some , at least , will be joined to the area on the South Vietnamese side of the border as an extended free fire zone . " ( 4 )
Chomsky 's article underscores an important point :
With the coup , the delicate balance that had kept Cambodia out of a wider war collapsed .
U.S. and South Vietnamese forces poured across the border , and the Vietnamese communists suddenly retreated deeper into Cambodia , mauling Lon Nol 's forces along the way .
War soon enveloped the entire country .
These events confirmed Chomsky 's 1970 predictions .
The ascendancy of the Khmer Rouge had dire consequences for the Cambodian people .
This , however , was not a matter of critical importance for Chomsky .
His writings follow a consistent pattern : Chomsky excels at illuminating crimes ... but only the crimes of the right villains .
The first evidence of this is apparent in December 1972 , in Chomksy 's introduction for Cambodia in the Southeast Asia War by Malcolm Caldwell and Lek Tan .
In the introduction , Chomsky writes , quite rightly , " The misery and destruction for which Nixon and Kissinger bear direct responsibility are crimes that can never be forgotten . "
He then continues :
" By the impulse it has given to the revolutionary forces , this vicious attack may have also prepared the ground , as some observers believe , not only for national liberation but also for a new era of economic development and social justice . "
( 5 )
It is a rather drastic jump to move from remembering the crimes of Nixon and Kissinger , to suggesting that the Khmer Rouge would be " liberators " who would usher in " economic development and social justice . "
By 1972 , there was already disturbing evidence of the brutality of the Cambodian communists , and only a naive romantic would have seen them as just and noble freedom fighters .
Caldwell , however , was a devout Marxist , and not surprisingly his book makes no mention of the reports of Khmer Rouge brutality .
This , in essence , was a sign of things to come .
Unlike the crimes of the West , the crimes of the Khmer Rouge were not to be illuminated .
They were to be obfuscated .
III .
The Wrong Villains
Early reports of Khmer Rouge brutality could , to some extent , be attributed to the natural consequences of warfare .
Once the Khmer Rouge seized power , however , such rationalizations were no longer possible .
Draconian measures were instituted immediately .
Within hours of their victory , they ordered the complete evacuation of Phnom Penh , and all other cities as well .
The Khmer Rouge flouted traditions of diplomatic immunity , political asylum , and extraterritoriality .
High - ranking officials of the former regime were executed .
Cambodians who had taken refuge in the French Embassy were forced out .
Members of the press , for all practical purposes captives within the Embassy , witnessed macabre scenes of horror as the entire city of Phnom Penh , swollen with refugees , was evacuated .
Even hospitals were emptied ; witnesses saw patients pushed through the streets on hospital beds .
An unprecedented atrocity had begun .
It is important to understand the nature of Khmer Rouge Cambodia .
The Khmer Rouge regime was , without question , one of the most disastrous social experiments of the last century .
One could make a persuasive case that it was in fact the single worst government in the modern era , combining mind - numbing brutality with astonishing incompetence .
History was to begin anew : the Khmer Rouge declared that henceforth Cambodia was to be known as Democratic Kampuchea , and the beginning of their reign was " Year Zero . "
Determined to convert Cambodia into an agrarian communist state , the Khmer Rouge upended every institution in Khmer society , exterminating millions in a frenzy of executions and criminal neglect for the welfare of its citizens .
Enemies , both real and imagined , were executed .
Families were split apart as husbands and wives , brothers and sisters were sent to communal work groups in the countryside .
Currency was abolished .
Buddhism , the religion of roughly 95 % of the population , was for all practical purposes banned .
Angkar , " The Organization , " assumed control over virtually all aspects of its subjects ' lives .
( 6 ) ( For an overview of Cambodia 's history , see The Banyan Tree . )
Much of this was documented in a book by Francois Ponchaud , Cambodge Annee Zero ( " Cambodia Year Zero " ) .
Published in France in 1977 , and later translated into English , Ponchaud 's book was discussed in several major newspapers , including the Christian Science Monitor and the New York Review of Books .
It was at this point that Chomsky began to protest the supposed " bias " of the media 's coverage of Cambodia .
One of the earliest expressions of this was in an article Chomsky co-wrote , with Edward Herman , for The Nation , entitled " Distortions at Fourth Hand . " ( 7 )
Describing the media coverage of Southeast Asia as a " farce , " Chomsky and Herman contrasted the grim reports on Vietnam by New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield with the with the much more favorable comments of the members of a handful of non-governmental groups .
This , Chomsky and Herman asserted , was evidence of a campaign of disinformation :
" The drab view of contemporary Vietnam provided by Butterfield and the establishment press helps to sustain the desired rewriting of history , asserting as it does the sad results of Communist success and American failure .
Well suited for these aims are tales of Communist atrocities , which not only prove the evils of communism but undermine the credibility of those who opposed the war and might interfere with future crusades for freedom . "
( 8 )
Seeking to bolster their point , Chomsky and Herman examined three books on Cambodia : Murder of a Gentle Land , by John Barron and Anthony Paul , Ponchaud 's Cambodge Annee Zero , and Cambodia : Starvation and Revolution , by George Hildebrand and Gareth Porter .
Chomsky and Herman write :
" The response to the three books under review nicely illustrates this selection process .
Hildebrand and Porter present a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it , giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies , based on a wide range of sources .
Published last year , and well received by the journal of the Asia Society ( Asia , March - April 1977 ) , it has not been reviewed in the Times , New York Review or any mass - media publication , nor used as the basis for editorial comment , with one exception .
The Wall Street Journal acknowledged its existence in an editorial entitled ' Cambodia Good Guys ' ( November 22 , 1976 ) , which dismissed contemptuously the very idea that the Khmer Rouge could play a constructive role , as well as the notion that the United States had a major hand in the destruction , death and turmoil of wartime and postwar Cambodia . "
( 9 )
Hildebrand and Porter 's book deserves examination .
One simple fact provides a clue to the authors ' sympathies :
The book does not contain even a single sentence critical of the Khmer Rouge .
Chomsky and Herman make no note of this : Just as Hildebrand and Porter had nothing negative to say about the Khmer Rouge , Chomsky and Herman had nothing negative to say about Hildebrand and Porter .
At only 124 pages , Starvation and Revolution is a slim volume .
Describing the reports of atrocities in Cambodia as " systematic process of mythmaking , " ( 10 ) Hildebrand and Porter present a glowing depiction of the Khmer Rouge .
The authors assert that the charges of starvation in Cambodia are unfounded : " It is the officially inspired propaganda of starvation for which no proof has been produced ...
Thus the starvation myth has come full circle to haunt its authors . " ( 11 ) The Khmer Rouge , according to Hildebrand and Porter , were rebuilding the country quite effectively , implementing a " coherent , well - developed plan for developing the economy . " ( 12 )
A few of the book 's omissions should be noted .
The book makes no mention of public executions .
It makes no mention of the forcible separation of children from their families , no mention of the separation of husbands and wives , no mention of the repression of ethnic minorities , no mention of restrictions on travel , or the abolition of the mail system .
Put simply , the book bears no earthly resemblance to the reality of communist Cambodia .
Hildebrand and Porter 's claims regarding the evacuation of Phnom Penh are particularly galling :
" The evacuation of Phnom Penh undoubtedly saved the lives of many thousands of Cambodians ... what was portrayed as a destructive , backward - looking policy motivated by doctrinaire hatred was actually a rationally conceived strategy for dealing with the urgent problems that faced postwar Cambodia . " ( 13 )
The remark is surely one of the most sordid fabrications within Porter and Hildebrand 's work .
There are a number of points which need to be made .
First , all major towns and cities were evacuated , not just Phnom Penh .
And this was not a new policy :
As Ponchaud pointed out in Cambodia : Year Zero , " ever since 1972 the guerrilla fighters had been sending all the inhabitants of the villages and towns they occupied into the forest to live , often burning their homes so that they would have nothing to come back to . " ( 14 ) Clearly , if the policy had been in place since 1972 , it had nothing to do with a shortage of food inside Phnom Penh in 1975 .
Although most sources suggest that there was enough food in the capital for only about a week , Ponchaud , who was there , believes it was more likely that there was enough for a month .
Several voluntary agencies and foreign countries offered aid , but the Khmer Rouge refused .
This refusal suggests that the Khmer Rouge believed that starvation was less important than maintaining the purity and self - sufficiency of their revolution .
Whatever the reason for the exodus , how can its brutal nature be justified ?
Ben Kiernan , arguably the West 's foremost authority on the Khmer Rouge , estimates that 20,000 people died in the evacuation of Phnom Penh .
( 15 ) How could evacuating hospitals possibly have saved lives ?
To quote Ponchaud 's eyewitness account : " I shall never forget one cripple who had neither hands nor feet , writhing along the ground like a severed worm , or a weeping father carrying his ten - year old daughter wrapped in a sheet tied around his neck like a sling , or the man with his foot dangling at the end of a leg to which it was attached by nothing but skin . " ( 16 )
It is difficult to reconcile these words with descriptions of " a rationally conceived strategy . "
Similarly , Hildebrand and Porter do not discuss the final siege of Phnom Penh , when the Khmer Rouge rained rockets and artillery down on the city every day .
One would think that a description of the plight of civilians in the midst of a civil war might mention that they were being shelled on a daily basis .
By 1978 , even Gareth Porter seemed to want to distance himself from the book .
Interviewed by Ed Bradley for the CBS documentary " What Happened to Cambodia , " Porter 's eyes dart back and forth when Bradley questions him about the Khmer Rouge regime .
He casts his eyes down and stutters slightly .
" My ... my only plea is for some degree of balance in assessing the human suffering that undoubtedly still exists in Cambodia . " ( 17 )
It is frustrating that Chomsky and Herman do not note the obvious omissions in Hildebrand and Porter 's book .
Equally frustrating is their claim that the book is " based on a wide range of sources . " ( 18 )
This is arguably true with regard to the opening chapter on conditions in Phnom Penh .
Ironically , however , the sources for this chapter are primarily the very media outlets which Chomsky and Herman claim ignored the horrible effects of the war .
The first chapter includes citations from the Washington Post , the Chicago Daily News , the Chicago Tribune , the Baltimore Sun , the Christian Science Monitor , the New York Times , and the Los Angeles Times .
The presence of these sources demonstrates that the media coverage -- which was , according to Chomsky and Herman , monolithic in its condemnation of the Khmer Rouge , and negligent in its coverage of the horrors of the Lon Nol period -- was neither as monolithic nor as negligent as Chomsky and Herman would like us to believe .
The claim that the media ignored the role of the US in the Cambodian war is unfounded .
Consider a few of the events that occurred when the invasion and bombing were taking place :
The protests at Kent State and Jackson State .
The Cooper - Church amendment , restricting the role of U.S. troops in Cambodia .
The Congressional refusal to fund further bombing .
These pivotal events , driven by public outcry , occurred when Americans were supposedly in the dark about the U.S. role in Cambodia .
But what about the sections of the book dealing specifically with the Khmer Rouge ?
The primary sources for these chapters : The Khmer Rouge .
The book 's last fifty footnotes , from the chapter on " Cambodia 's Agricultural Revolution , " provide an excellent case in point .
Out of these 50 citations , there are 43 that pertain to the Khmer Rouge regime .
Of these , 33 can be traced directly to the Khmer Rouge sources .
Six more come from Hsinhua , the official news agency of Communist China , i.e. , the Khmer Rouge 's wealthiest patron .
Two come from an unnamed source , described only as " a Cambodian economist . "
And the remaining two references ?
Both come from Le Monde : one is a dubious estimate of future rice production , and the other simply notes that , in the future , large rice paddies would be subdivided , " giving the country the appearance of an enormous checkerboard . " ( 19 )
The diversity of Hildebrand and Porter 's sources , however , is a relatively unimportant point .
By the time this book was written , the Khmer Rouge were already directly responsible for - at the very least - a hundred thousand deaths , and quite probably far more .
( 20 ) But let 's accept for a moment the dubious claim that the nature of the Khmer Rouge was still unclear at the time of the book 's publication .
Would n't an unbiased account have described the situation as " unclear " ?
That is not what Hildebrand and Porter do .
On the contrary , everything is clear to them : if the Khmer Rouge say that it is so , then it is so .
Bearing this in mind , let 's examine Chomsky and Herman 's reaction to the other two books , both of which described Khmer Rouge atrocities in detail .
With regard to Anthony Paul and John Barron 's book Murder of a Gentle Land , Chomsky and Herman are completely dismissive , calling it a " third - rate propaganda tract . " ( 21 ) They discount Barron and Paul 's sources as unreliable , implying that connections to the US government , or the Thai government , or the Malaysian government make them inherently unreliable .
( And yet the Khmer Rouge connections of Hildebrand and Porter 's sources did not strike them as inappropriate . )
With vintage Chomsky disdain , they attempt to discredit the book with the snide remark that Barron and Paul " claim " to have analyzed refugee reports .
" Their scholarship , " Chomsky and Herman write , " collapses under the barest scrutiny . " ( 22 )
Barron and Paul are justly criticized for sloppy and misleading citations of other press accounts .
But they are also criticized for ignoring more benign accounts of the Khmer Rouge regime :
" They do not mention the Swedish journalist , Olle Tolgraven , or Richard Boyle of Pacific News Service , the last newsman to leave Cambodia , who denied the existence of wholesale executions ; nor do they cite the testimony of Father Jacques Engelmann , a priest with nearly two decades of experience in Cambodia , who was evacuated at the same time and reported that evacuated priests ' were not witness to any cruelties ' and that there were deaths , but ' not thousands , as certain newspapers have written ' ( cited by Hildebrand and Porter ) . " ( 23 )
The validity of this criticism , however , rests on whether or not Barron and Paul 's refugee testimony was accurate .
If we wish to dispute the stories told by the refugees , the testimony of " witnesses " who did not see the events described is irrelevant .
The accuracy of the refugee accounts , then , is of utmost importance when evaluating the merit of Barron and Paul 's book .
We will return to the question of the refugees ' accuracy later .
Ponchaud fares slightly better than Barron and Paul .
Chomsky 's supporters often point out that he described Ponchaud 's book as " serious and worth reading " .
They rarely mention his other comments about the book , such as the claim that the book " lacks the documentation provided in Hildebrand and Porter and its veracity is therefore difficult to assess , " and that Ponchaud " plays fast and loose with quotes and with numbers . "
Chomsky and Herman asserted that the book had " an anti-Communist bias " and was " careless , sometimes in rather significant ways . "
They claimed that Ponchaud 's refugee testimonies are " at best second - hand with many of the refugees reporting what they claim to have heard from others . "
And yet in spite of its supposed " anti-Communist bias , " Chomsky and Herman claimed that Ponchaud 's book " also gives a rather positive account of Khmer Rouge programs of social and economic development , while deploring much brutal practice in working for egalitarian goals and national independence . " ( 24 )
The grounds for the claim that Ponchaud " plays fast and loose with numbers " are absurdly trivial .
According to Chomsky and Herman ,
" Ponchaud cites a Cambodian report that 200,000 people were killed in American bombings from March 7 to August 15 , 1973 .
No source is offered , but suspicions are aroused by the fact that Phnom Penh radio announced on May 9 , 1975 that there were 200,000 casualties of the American bombing in 1973 , including ' killed , wounded , and crippled for life ' ( Hildebrand and Porter ) .
Ponchaud cites ' Cambodian authorities ' who give the figures 800,000 killed and 240,000 wounded before liberation .
The figures are implausible .
By the usual rule of thumb , wounded amount to about three times killed ; quite possibly he has the figures reversed . " ( 25 )
Apparently , Chomsky and Herman are suggesting that , in the first instance , Ponchaud cited a figure for all casualties as though it were an estimate of those killed .
If this is so , then Ponchaud is overstating the number of victims of American actions ... not Khmer Rouge actions .
This is hardly support for Chomsky and Herman 's propaganda model .
In the second instance , it is Chomsky and Herman who have it wrong :
The number of 240,000 is not given as the number of wounded .
It is cited as the Khmer Rouge 's own estimate of the number of those disabled as a result of the war ( " invalides de guerre " ) .
( 26 )
The supposed " fast and loose " use of quotes is also inconsequential .
Chomsky and Herman claim that two similar quotes from different sources are misrepresentations of the same quote : one is described as an unattributed Khmer Rouge slogan that " one or two million young people will be enough to build the new Cambodia " and the other is attributed to a Khmer Rouge military commander : " To rebuild the new Cambodia , a million people are enough . "
But the meaning of the quotes is not significantly different , and there is nothing to suggest that both quotes are n't perfectly accurate :
It is not at all unlikely a Khmer Rouge military commander would indeed rephrase that slogan as quoted by Ponchaud .
The claim that Ponchaud gives " a rather positive account " of Khmer Rouge social and economic programs is baffling .
Reading Ponchaud 's book , it is difficult to determine exactly what Ponchaud said that could be construed as " rather positive . "
Certainly the Khmer Rouge were disciplined , and relatively free of corruption in comparison to other regional governments , but it is difficult to see these traits as " positive " when they are in the employ of a government which regards genocide as a viable tool for restructuring society .
Chomsky and Herman , however , insist that there were many sources presenting a more favorable view of the Khmer Rouge than that presented by Barron and Paul and Ponchaud .
These sources , they argued ,
" ... have not been brought to the attention of the American reading public .
Space limitations preclude a comprehensive review , but such journals as the Far Eastern Economic Review , the London Economist , the Melbourne Journal of Politics , and others elsewhere , have provided analyses by highly qualified specialists who have studied the full range of evidence available , and who concluded that executions have numbered at most in the thousands ; that these were localized in areas of limited Khmer Rouge influence and unusual peasant discontent , where brutal revenge killings were aggravated by the threat of starvation resulting from the American destruction and killing .
These reports also emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides during the civil war ( provoked by the American attack ) and repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false .
They also testify to the extreme unreliability of refugee reports , and the need to treat them with great caution , a fact that we and others have discussed elsewhere ( cf. Chomsky : At War with Asia , on the problems of interpreting reports of refugees from American bombing in Laos ) . " ( 27 )
Chomsky 's defenders suggest that Chomsky and Herman were not attempting to cast doubt on the refugee accounts , but were merely stressing the need evaluate their testimony objectively .
Chomsky 's earlier insistence on evaluating refugee testimony with " great caution , " however , came in the context of another case where the refugees were telling him what he did not want to hear : that they hated the Pathet Lao .
It would be far easier to accept Chomsky 's objectivity if he voiced the same concerns in relying on the reports of refugees fleeing U.S. - sponsored regimes , such as Salvadorans or Guatemalans .
Hildebrand and Porter 's refusal to consider refugee testimonies ensured that their book would provide a markedly different assessment than that of Barron and Paul or Ponchaud .
Which assessment was correct ?
Of the three books under review , Chomsky and Herman claimed that the book based largely on reports from Khmer Rouge and communist sources , a book which presented " a very favorable picture " of the Khmer Rouge regime , was " a carefully documented study . "
The other two books relied heavily on those troublesome refugee reports , which are by nature characterized by " extreme unreliability . "
Those books were " third - rate propaganda , " or marred by " an anti-Communist bias ; " they were " careless , " and " fast and loose " with facts .
Wary that their sophistry might come back to haunt them , however , Chomsky and Herman concluded their review with a disclaimer :
" We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments ; rather , we again want to emphasize some crucial points .
What filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available , emphasizing alleged Khmer Rouge atrocities and downplaying or ignoring the crucial U.S. role , direct and indirect , in the torment that Cambodia has suffered . " ( 28 )
In later years , many of Chomsky 's supporters have argued that the point of his comments on Cambodia was to contrast the media response to events in Cambodia with what were ( according to Chomsky ) atrocities of similar scale in other countries , such as East Timor .
This , however , is not the argument advanced by Chomsky and Herman in 1977 ; there is no mention of East Timor , or any other comparable country , in " Distortions . "
The premise of the article is straightforward : the media was distorting the truth .
History has provided a very different judgment .
Ponchaud 's book has withstood the test of time .
The testimony of the refugees , and Ponchaud 's analysis of Khmer Rouge policy , were entirely accurate .
Even Barron and Paul 's flawed , right - wing account depicts Khmer Rouge Cambodia far more accurately than did Hildebrand and Porter .
Barron and Paul presented Khmer Rouge Cambodia as a land of slavery , fear , violence , and tyranny .
That is accurate .
Nonetheless , Chomsky 's quest to reveal the allegedly flawed coverage of Cambodia continued .
Chomsky raised some of his objections in personal correspondence with Ponchaud , and when Cambodge Annee Zero was translated into English , in 1977 , Ponchaud alluded to Chomsky 's criticisms .
In an " Author 's Note " at the beginning of the American edition , commenting on Chomsky 's reaction to Jean Lacouture 's review of the book , he writes :
" Mr. Chomsky was of the opinion that Jean Lacouture had substantially distorted the evidence I had offered , and , considering my book to be ' serious and worth reading , as distinct from much of the commentary it has elicited , ' he wrote me a personal letter on October 19 , 1977 , in which he drew my attention to the way it was being misused by antirevolutionary propagandists .
He has made it my duty to ' stem the flood of lies ' about Cambodia -- particularly , according to him , those propagated by Anthony Paul and John Barron in ' Murder of a Gentle Land . ' " ( 29 )
Chomsky 's words , quoted by Ponchaud , seem at odds with his publicly stated position :
One wonders why a man who claims that he does not know the truth would describe the reports of atrocities as a " flood of lies . "
Still , while professing to be uncertain about the nature of the Khmer Rouge , Chomsky and Herman deemed Cambodia a suitable case study for demonstrating the propaganda mechanisms of the free press .
They outlined their position in a book , After the Cataclysm : Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology .
The book went to press in 1979 , shortly after the Khmer Rouge regime had collapsed under the onslaught of a Vietnamese invasion .
With the fall of the Khmer Rouge , the " bamboo curtain " of secrecy surrounding Cambodia was thrown open .
Hundreds of thousands of refugees , freed at last from one of the most totalitarian regimes in history , suddenly poured across the border into Thailand .
They brought with them irrefutable proof of the misery of the previous three years .
The Vietnamese invasion not only put an end to Pol Pot 's regime : it also put an end to attempts to deny the horrors wrought by Cambodia 's Communists .
Or , more accurately , it put an end to most attempts .
In After the Cataclysm , Chomsky and Herman advanced a lengthier argument of the same charges they had made in The Nation two years earlier .
IV . Eyes Wide Shut
After the Cataclysm is , according to Chomsky and Herman , concerned primarily with " U.S. global policy and propaganda , and the filtering and distorting effect of Western ideology . "
( 30 ) Consequently , many of Chomsky 's supporters claim that it is unfair to criticize the book on the basis of the impressions it might convey about Vietnam , Laos , or Cambodia .
The book includes a disclaimer to that effect : " [ W ]e have not developed or expressed our views here on the nature of the Indochinese regimes . " ( 31 )
This disclaimer , however , comes after nearly 300 pages of arguments that seem to be expressing a very clear set of views .
This is surely inevitable : if one is to contend that a particular viewpoint is " filtered " or " distorted , " one must have some opinion of what constitutes an unfiltered or undistorted view .
Near the beginning of the chapter on Cambodia , Chomsky and Herman note that " it is surely worthwhile , if one is going to discuss Cambodia at all , to try to comprehend what has in fact taken place there , which is quite impossible if critical standards are abandoned and ' facts ' are contrived even out of honest anger or distress . " ( 32 ) Given that Chomsky and Herman spend the next 150 pages discussing Cambodia , one can assume that the authors are indeed trying to comprehend what had taken place under the Khmer Rouge .
Their claim -- that the media was distorting the truth about the Khmer Rouge -- necessarily implies that the image painted by the media was inaccurate .
Falsehoods and misrepresentation abound , according to Chomsky and Herman , and " evidence about Cambodia has a way of crumbling when one begins to look at it closely , a fact that should raise some questions about the examples that have not been investigated because of their lesser prominence in the international campaign . "
( 33 )
This theme is consistent throughout the book : the widely accepted view of the Khmer Rouge was based on dubious evidence .
Chomsky and Herman begin painting their alternative picture in the book 's Preface :
" The ferocious U.S. attack on Indochina left the countries [ of Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia ] devastated , facing almost insuperable problems .
The agricultural systems of these peasant societies were seriously damaged or destroyed ...
With the economies in ruins , the foreign aid that kept much of the population alive terminated , and the artificial colonial implantations no longer functioning , it was a condition of survival to turn ( or return ) the populations to productive work .
The victors in Cambodia undertook drastic and often brutal measures to accomplish this task , simply forcing the urban population into the countryside where they were compelled to live the lives of poor peasants , now organized in a decentralized system of communes .
At heavy cost , these measures appear to have overcome the dire and destructive consequences of the U.S. war by 1978 . " ( 34 )
The reference to " brutal measures " suggests that Chomsky and Herman were beginning to back away from the stance in their Nation article , which had implied that Hildebrand and Porter 's " very favorable picture " of the Khmer Rouge was more accurate than Barron and Paul 's and Ponchaud 's negative views .
Nonetheless , Chomsky and Herman still seemed unaware -- or unwilling to admit -- that the regime had been an unmitigated disaster .
Moreover , they seemed determined to deflect blame away from the Khmer Rouge .
Thus , they imply that the Khmer Rouge were forced to implement these " drastic " measures in part because foreign aid had been terminated .
They neglect to mention that the foreign aid was terminated by the Khmer Rouge .
Francois Ponchaud pointed this out in Year Zero , noting that the Khmer Rouge even refused a transport plane which had been previously loaded with urgently needed medical supplies .
( 35 )
There is similar sophistry in the claim that the urban population was " forced to live the lives of poor peasants . "
Peasants in years prior to the Khmer Rouge did not suffer the repression imposed upon the evacuees ( the " new people " ) by Angkar .
The population was not forced to live the lives of peasants : they were forced to live the lives of slaves .
The claim that the policies implemented by the Khmer Rouge managed to " overcome " the difficulties of the damaged economy is contradicted by the evidence .
Khmer Rouge economic policies , if they can even be called that , were brutal , naive , inefficient , and often downright destructive .
In The Quality of Mercy , describing his visit to Cambodia in 1979 , William Shawcross noted that there was no way to evaluate the rice production during the Khmer Rouge years :
" Rather astonishingly , rice was being exported again , but the Cambodian people themselves were being deprived of adequate rations throughout much of the country .
Afterward , peasants claimed that the vast new fields , dams , and canals that they had been ordered to build rarely worked .
Instead they upset the ecological balance of the countryside .
" Once , I was in a boat steaming up a narrow river , just off the Great Lake .
I was being taken to see a fishery in one of the richest of the fishing areas .
Along with rice , fish is a staple food in Cambodia and the most important source of protein .
Long before our old boat came around the bend of the river , an extraordinary smell came wafting out to greet us .
The river was jammed with hundreds of thousands of dead fish , packed tight as ice floes .
What had happened ?
I asked .
' Pol Pot ' came the reply .
" It turned out that the Khmer Rouge had built a huge dam just upstream from here and the water in this ancient fishing village was now far shallower than it had ever been before .
In the heat of the dry - season sun the fish had , quite simply , cooked . " ( 36 )
The Cambodian communists ' economic plans were , at times , utterly surreal .
Scholar David Chandler notes that , in a Democratic Kampuchea report on General Political Tasks of 1976 , there are three lines devoted to education , and six devoted to urine .
The document states that , regarding human urine , " We collect thirty per cent .
That leaves a surplus of 70 % . " ( 37 ) .
These were indicative of the types of policies that Chomsky and Herman claimed had lifted Cambodia out of the ashes of war .
The Preface of After the Cataclysm sets the tone for the entire book : again and again , Chomsky and Herman apply dubious spin to reality .
Commenting on the flow of boat people out of Vietnam , for example , Chomsky and Herman claim that " In a sense , the refugee flow from Vietnam in 1978 is comparable to the forced resettlement of the urban population of Cambodia in 1975 . " ( 38 ) How is an exodus of refugees , voluntarily risking their lives to escape a communist regime , in any way comparable to the deadly forced march into the Cambodian countryside ?
Rather than expressing concerns about the fate of the Khmer people , Chomsky and Herman seem primarily concerned with the " abuse " directed at the Khmer Rouge regime :
" While all of the countries of Indochina have been subjected to endless denunciations in the West for their ' loathsome ' qualities and unaccountable failure to find humane solutions to their problems , Cambodia was a particular target of abuse .
In fact , it became virtually a matter of dogma in the West that the regime was the very incarnation of evil with no redeeming qualities , and that the handful of demonic creatures who had somehow taken over the country were systematically massacring and starving the population . " ( 39 )
Whether or not this was a matter of " dogma " hardly seems important in the context of the larger question : was the regime really systematically murdering and starving its people ?
From time to time , Chomsky and Herman acknowledge that there were , perhaps , some bad things happening in Cambodia , but they quickly shift focus back to their propaganda model .
After arguing that , in Vietnam , the treatment of " collaborators " has been " relatively mild , " ( 40 ) the authors allowed that the situation in Cambodia was different :
" But in the case of Cambodia , there is no difficulty in documenting major atrocities and oppression , primarily from the reports of refugees , since Cambodia has been almost entirely closed to the West since the war 's end ...
The record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome , but it has by no means satisfied the requirements of Western propagandists , who must labor to shift the blame for the torment of Indochina to the victims of France and the United States .
Consequently , there has been extensive fabrication of evidence , a tide that is not stemmed even by repeated exposure . " ( 41 )
Despite the occasional acknowledgements of brutality , the tone of After the Cataclysm is essentially the same as their 1977 article .
Commenting in retrospect on that article , Chomsky and Herman reprise their comment that " 'we do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments , ' all of which , incidentally , assume substantial atrocities and thousands or more killed . " ( 42 ) The second part of this statement , however , is blatantly false : Porter and Hildebrand did not " assume substantial atrocities , " nor " thousands or more killed . "
On the contrary , recall that Hildebrand and Porter had described the reports of atrocities as " a systematic process of mythmaking . "
There is relatively little discussion of Porter and Hildebrand 's book , though Chomsky and Herman do mount a brief , oblique defense , noting that it was " well received by the journal of the Asia Society , " and that the magazine Choice described the book as " 'A rare combination of humanitarianism and scholarly research . ' " ( 43 )
John Barron and Anthony Paul , meanwhile , again come in for harsh criticism .
Chomsky and Herman claim that " Very little in the Barron - Paul book is subject to possible verification .
Therefore an assessment of the credibility of their primary evidence ( refugee reports ) rests very largely on the accuracy of their brief historical remarks . " ( 44 ) ( p. 245 ) This is not an appropriate claim in 1979 ; with the massive buildup of refugees on the Thai border , one could easily have verified the credibility of their refugee testimony simply be talking to other refugees .
Rather than speak to refugees , however , Chomsky and Herman simply pretend that the refugees existed only in some other , inaccessible dimension , and even imply that Barron and Paul had n't spoken with them either : their evidence is " unverifiable documentation : alleged interviews with Cambodians . " ( 45 )
In disparaging Barron and Paul , Chomsky and Herman write that their sources are " in toto : specialists at the State and Defense Departments , the National Security Council , and three unnamed foreign embassies in Washington . " ( 46 ) This remark is worth remembering , for Chomsky would later make a very different claim regarding these same specialists .
Dismissing Barron 's claim that Murder of a Gentle Land was based on " ' diverse sources , ' " Chomsky and Herman ask rhetorically , " Can anyone imagine a researcher limiting himself to comparable sources on the other side of the fence for a critical study of U.S. imperial violence , then to be lauded for his meticulous and exhaustive scholarship ? " ( 47 )
It is impossible to ignore the hypocrisy here : Hildebrand and Porter based their work on comparably limited sources , and Chomsky and Herman lauded them for their meticulous and exhaustive scholarship .
Francois Ponchaud , too , is again criticized , even more harshly than in the Nation article .
If Ponchaud actually cared about Cambodian peasants , Chomsky and Herman claim , " he never publicly expressed this sympathy ...
Furthermore , he describes nothing that he did that might have been to the benefit of the peasants of Cambodia . " ( 48 )
Having thus insinuated that Father Ponchaud was callous and indifferent to the Khmer people , they continue :
" It apparently has not been noticed by the many commentators who have cited Ponchaud 's alleged sympathy with the Khmer peasants and the revolutionary forces that if authentic , it is a remarkable self - condemnation .
What are we to think of a person who is quite capable of reaching an international audience , at least with atrocity stories , and who could see with his own eyes what was happening to the Khmer peasants subjected to daily massacres as the war ground on , but kept totally silent at a time when a voice of protest might have helped to mitigate their torture ?
It would be more charitable to assume that Ponchaud is simply not telling the truth when he speaks of his sympathy for the Khmer peasant sand for the revolution , having added these touches for the benefit of a gullible Western audience ... " ( 49 )
Naturally , it would not fit Chomsky and Herman 's propaganda model to suggest that Ponchaud was able to reach a large audience when describing Khmer Rouge atrocities simply because he was one of the few people who had gathered exhaustive information on the subject .
Consistent with their comments in " Distortions " , they again describe Ponchaud 's refugee testimony as " unverifiable material . "
( 50 ) Never mind the thousands of other refugees who could have corroborated this " unverifiable material " : Chomsky and Herman boldly assert that " The fact is that Ponchaud 's book is highly unreliable where an independent check is possible . " ( 51 ) If it was worthy of consideration , it was just barely worthy :
" A fair review of informed opinion about postwar Cambodia would , in our opinion , include this book as a serious though also seriously flawed and obviously unreliable contribution , in some ( but not all ) respects , to be placed at the more extreme critical end of the spectrum of specialist judgment and analysis ...
It is noteworthy that not only the media but also governments appear to have relied uncritically on Ponchaud , despite his evident unreliability . " ( 52 )
Again returning to the claims that Phnom Penh was evacuated for humanitarian reasons , Chomsky and Herman note that Ponchaud suggested the shortage was not nearly as dire as some sources claimed , and that there may have been adequate supplies to last as much as two months .
Chomsky and Herman dispute this , and add that " Even if Ponchaud 's possibly ' excessive ' two month - estimate were correct , it remains unclear how famine could have been averted after two months had the cities not been evacuated ... " ( 53 ) Apparently , the idea that rice could have been brought into the city is too difficult for Chomsky and Herman to grasp .
In the wake of Chomsky and Herman 's Nation article , Ponchaud 's failure to denounce the media treatment of Cambodia seems to have incurred Chomsky and Herman 's wrath .
In After the Cataclysm , Chomsky and Herman devote several pages to the subtle differences between the American and British translations of Cambodia Year Zero , noting in particular differences in the introductions of the two books .
The manner in which Chomsky and Herman present these differences provides an excellent example of their highly selective editing .
First , they provide an excerpt from the American edition :
" On March 31 , 1977 , the New York Review of books published an account of my book by Jean Lacouture , which provoked considerable reaction in all circles concerned about Asia and the future of socialism .
With the responsible attitude and precision of thought that are so characteristic of him , Noam Chomsky then embarked on a polemical exchange with Robert Silvers , Editor of the NYR , and Jean Lacouture , leading to the publication by the latter of a rectification of his initial account .
Mr. Chomsky was of the opinion that Jean Lacouture had substantially distorted the evidence I had offered , and , considering my book to be ' serious and worth reading , as distinct from much of the commentary it has elicited , ' he wrote me a personal letter on October 19 , 1977 , in which he drew my attention to the way it was being misused by antirevolutionary propagandists ... " ( 54 )
Chomsky and Herman then contrast this excerpt with the British version of the introduction , from which they provide the following excerpts :
" Even before this book was translated it was sharply criticized by Mr Noam Chomsky and Mr Gareth Porter .
These two ' experts ' on Asia claim that I am mistakenly trying to convince people that Cambodia was drowned in a sea of blood after the departure of the last American diplomats .
They say there have been no massacres , and they lay the blame for the tragedy of the Khmer people on the American bombings .
They accuse me of being insufficiently critical in my approach to the refugee 's accounts .
For them , refugees are not a valid source ...
" After an investigation of this kind , it is surprising to see that ' experts ' who have spoken to few if any refugees should reject their very significant place in any study of modern Cambodia .
These experts would rather base their arguments on reasoning : if something seems impossible to their personal logic , then it does n't exist .
Their only sources for evaluation are deliberately chosen official statements .
Where is that critical approach which they accuse others of not having ? " ( 55 )
Describing these differences as " quite striking , " Chomsky and Herman write that " Our favorable reference to Ponchaud 's book in the American version becomes a sharp attack in the British version .
The ' responsible attitude and precision of thought ' that receive such fulsome praise in the American version become complete irrationality , refusal to consider evidence , blind dogmatism , lack of any critical approach , and faked ' expertise ' in the simultaneous British version . " ( 56 )
Note that Chomsky and Herman 's quote from the American edition is the very same passage cited earlier in this article .
But Chomsky and Herman excerpt slightly less of the passage :
They stop immediately before the sentence in which Ponchaud quotes Chomsky 's description of the coverage of Cambodia as a " flood of lies . "
The truncated excerpt suggests that Ponchaud was effectively agreeing with Chomsky 's claim that the book was being " misused " by antirevolutionary propagandists .
But let 's pick up where Chomsky and Herman left off .
Referring to Chomsky , Ponchaud writes :
" He has made it my duty to ' stem the flood of lies ' about Cambodia -- particularly , according to him , those propagated by Anthony Paul and John Barron in ' Murder of a Gentle Land . ' "
" Mr. Gareth Porter also criticized my book very sharply during a congressional hearing on the subject of human rights in Cambodia , and argued that I was trying to convince people that Cambodia was drowned in a sea of blood after the departure of the last American diplomats .
He denied that a general policy of purge was put into effect and considered that the tragedy through which the Khmer people are now living should mainly be attributed to the American bombings .
He censured me for lacking a critical approach in my use of the refugee accounts , on the ground that they were not credible because the refugees were deliberately trying to blacken the regime they had fled . " ( 57 )
Ponchaud continues :
" In the beginning , I was not opposed to the Khmer revolution ... I welcomed the revolutionaries ' victory as the only possible means of bringing Cambodia out of its misery .
But after making a careful and full study ...
I was compelled to conclude , against my will , that the Khmer revolution is irrefutably the bloodiest of our century .
A year after the publication of my book I can find no reason to alter my judgement . "
( 58 )
The longer excerpts make it clear that the two introductions are not nearly as different as Chomsky and Herman pretend .
Ponchaud notes that Porter was also criticizing his position on Cambodia ; that is , Porter was taking the same position as Chomsky .
Cambodia was awash in a flood of lies , drowning in a sea of nonexistent blood .
The Jean Lacouture affair , discussed briefly in Distortions , is examined in greater detail in After the Cataclysm .
Lacouture 's review of Cambodge , Annee Zero included an incorrect reference to the Ponchaud 's estimate deaths in Cambodia .
Ponchaud had cited an estimate of 1.2 million deaths , and Lacouture apparently added to this an estimate of deaths during the civil war , claiming a total of 2 million deaths .
Lacouture also incorrectly attributed a quote from a Thai reporter to a Khmer Rouge official .
Chomsky immediately alerted Lacouture to these errors , and Lacouture issued a correction , which was then published by the New York Review of Books .
Chomsky 's corrections , Lacouture noted , " have caused me great distress .
By pointing out serious errors in citation , he calls into question not only my respect for texts and the truth , but also the cause I was trying to defend . "
Nonetheless , Lacouture argued , Chomsky 's points were not of great significance .
" Faced with an enterprise as monstrous as the new Cambodian government , should we see the main problem as one of deciding exactly which person uttered an inhuman phrase , and whether the regime has murdered thousands or hundreds of thousands of wretched people ?
Is it of crucial historical importance to know whether the victims of Dachau numbered 100,000 or 500,000 ?
Or if Stalin had 1,000 or 10,000 Poles shot at Katyn ? " ( 59 )
Chomsky and Herman , in response , argue that if " a factor of 100 is relatively insignificant ... then why bother to present alleged facts at all ? "
However , they continue ,
" If , indeed , the Cambodian regime was , as Lacouture believes , as monstrous as the Nazis at their worst , then his comment might be comprehensible , though it is worth noting that he has produced no evidence to support this judgment .
But if a more appropriate comparison is , say , to France after liberation , where a minimum of 30 - 40,000 people were massacred within a few months with far less motive for revenge and under far less rigorous conditions than those left by the U.S. war in Cambodia , then perhaps a different judgment is in order . "
( 60 )
Even in 1979 it was obvious that Khmer Rouge Cambodia was in no way similar to " France after liberation . "
The implication is a profound insult to the victims of the Khmer Rouge : one cannot equate Cambodian civil servants with Nazi collaborators .
Now , years later , it is beyond dispute that the Khmer Rouge regime was indeed " as monstrous as the Nazis at their worst . "
One would think , then , that Chomsky would have conceded Lacouture 's point .
But quite the contrary : in recent years Chomsky has implied that the exaggeration of the death toll was even greater , perhaps by a factor of 1000 .
In an article in the Z Magazine forum Chomsky claims that " Ed Herman and I responded to his challenge to me by saying that we thought that a factor of 1000 did matter . " ( 61 ) Lest we assume that he simply misspoke , it is worth noting that he made the same claim in a 1999 discussion on Cambodia : " in short , a factor of 1000 matters in estimating deaths , and we should try to keep to the truth , whether considering our own crimes or those of official enemies . " ( 62 ) Since Lacouture had cited a figure of two million deaths , it would appear that Chomsky is implying that the real toll at that point was on the order of two thousand .
And , just as they question Ponchaud 's sympathy for the peasants , Chomsky and Herman dispute Lacouture 's own admission that he had at one time supported the Khmer Rouge : " His previous writings indicate that he was a supporter of Sihanouk , who was a bitter enemy of the Khmer Rouge until they joined forces against Lon Nol in 1970 and whose subsequent relations with the Khmer Rouge were not at all clear .
In fact , it is difficult to see how a Westerner could have supported the cause of the Khmer Rouge , since virtually nothing was known about it . " ( 63 ) By this logic , of course , one could also claim that the Cambodian peasants who flocked to the Khmer Rouge in the wake of Sihanouk 's overthrow also did not actually support the cause of the Communists ... though as we shall see , Chomsky and Herman make the opposite argument with regard to the peasants .
Lacouture , however , was simply following " the herd " :
" When the herd stampedes in a different direction for one reason or another , and service to some favored foreign state no longer has its appeal , we entered the ' God that Failed ' phase , which at one time had a certain validity and integrity , but now has become , all too often , a pose for those who adopt the more typical stance of the intelligentsia , namely , service to the propaganda system of their state .
To this end , it is often convenient to manufacture past allegiance to the current enemies against which recriminations are directed . " ( 64 )
Lacouture was hardly alone in his support for the Communists in Southeast Asia .
Many in the West accepted the idea that the Communists would be " liberators " freeing the masses from the servitude of imperialism .
( Chomsky and Herman themselves on several occasions refer to the Khmer Rouge victory as " liberation . " ( 65 ) ) Many years later , when Lacouture did change his views , he would write that " ... it is not only because I once argued for the victory of this very regime , and feel myself partially guilty for what is happening under it , that I believe I can say : there is a time , when a great crime is taking place , when it is better to speak out , in whatever company , than to remain silent . " ( 66 )
Disparaging these sentiments , Chomsky and Herman and describe Lacouture 's mea culpa as " deeply wrong . " ( 67 ) They suggest that " Future victims of imperial savagery will not thank us for assisting in the campaign to restore the public to apathy and conformism so that the subjugation of the weak can continue without annoying domestic impediments . "
( 68 )
Apparently , contemporary victims of Communist savagery were less important than the hypothetical future victims of imperialism .
Or were the Khmer really " victims " at all ?
Chomsky and Herman advance a number of arguments that imply that they were n't .
" ... how can it be that that a population so oppressed by a handful of fanatics does not rise up and overthrow them ? " ( 69 ) It is not unlikely , in Chomsky and Herman 's view , that " the regime has a modicum of support among the peasants . "
( 70 ) Noting that the Khmer Rouge attacked both Thailand and Vietnam , Chomsky and Herman suggest that a regime with no popular support would surely find its army unwilling to fight on behalf of their country .
( 71 ) Examining the comments of several " specialists " on the willingness of Cambodians to resist the Vietnamese during outbreaks of fighting in 1977 , Chomsky and Herman again raise the same point :
" It is noteworthy that in the varied attempts to find a solution to this most difficult question , one conceivable hypothesis does not seem to have been considered , even to be rejected : that there was a significant degree of peasant support for the Khmer Rouge and the measures that they had instituted in the countryside . " ( 72 )
These arguments are infuriatingly wrong - headed .
Consider the implications of the first question : why did n't the population overthrow their oppressors ?
If the lack of a successful revolt indicates that a government was not oppressive , we must concede that Hitler 's Germany , Stalin 's Soviet Union , and Mao's China were actually benign .
After all , their subjects did not rise up and overthrow them .
Chomsky and Herman do not bother to explain exactly how unarmed peasants living under the most totalitarian regime in modern history were supposed to achieve this spontaneous rebellion .
The idea that Khmer Rouge attacks on Thailand and Vietnam indicate that the Khmer Rouge had popular support is bewildering .
This presents a rather unique yardstick for measuring a regime 's popularity : apparently , according to this logic , any country that attacks its neighbors must surely be endowed with the support of its populace .
Moreover , Chomsky and Herman 's arguments ignore a very basic fact : the military was a privileged class in the Khmer Rouge regime .
Khmer Rouge soldiers were not part of the suffering masses .
They were part of the apparatus of control .
Finally , it is should be remembered that the book went to press after the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978 .
The earlier strikes that Vietnam had launched in response to the Khmer Rouge border raids had been limited , and , given that Vietnam quickly withdrew , one could claim that the attacks had been repelled .
The December 1978 invasion , however , was the real thing .
The result ?
The Khmer Rouge regime collapsed like a house of cards , in part because of a complete lack of support from the population they had enslaved .
( 73 )
The lack of support was rooted in many things .
One in particular bears comment here : the forcible removal of residents from their homes .
The evacuation of Phnom Penh in particular surely ranks as one of the regime 's most epic violations of basic human rights , and deserves additional discussion .
Chomsky and Herman echo the arguments advanced by Hildebrand and Porter , suggesting that , because of unsanitary conditions and food shortages in the city , the evacuation " may actually have saved lives . " ( 74 ) As noted above , this claim is contradicted by the evidence .
In any case , according to Chomsky and Herman , " The horrendous situation in Phnom Penh ( as elsewhere in Cambodia ) as the war drew to an end was a direct and immediate consequence of the U.S. assault ... " ( 75 )
A reminder is in order here : the U.S. bombing had ended a year and half earlier .
And yet the situation in Phnom Penh is still a " direct and immediate consequence " of the U.S. attack ... not , apparently , a consequence of the Communist encirclement , or the blockade of the Mekong , or the daily rocket and artillery attacks launched by the Khmer Rouge .
The book 's underlying theme surfaces again : whatever happens , the U.S. is entirely to blame .
Regardless of who was to blame for conditions inside the city , there is absolutely no evidence to support the contention that the evacuation was done for humanitarian reasons .
William Shawcross , commenting on a five - hour speech by Pol Pot , broadcast on Phnom Penh radio , and in a subsequent press conference in Beijing , noted that :
" Pol Pot made no mention of food shortages or famine as the motive for evacuating Phnom Penh -- his explanation is in fact closer to that of Barron and Paul than to that of Hildebrand and Porter .
He said the decision to clear the city was made ' before the victory was won , that is in February 1975 , because we knew that before the smashing of all sorts of enemy spy organizations , our strength was not enough to defend the revolutionary regime . '
In light of this , arguments about the precise quantities of food available in the city in April 1975 become somewhat academic . " ( 76 )
It is impossible to ignore Chomsky and Herman 's double standards on the issue of the evacuation .
Consider their reaction to another forced relocation : the U.S. government 's " strategic hamlet " program in South Vietnam .
Was the Saigon regime lauded for " saving lives " by removing people from combat zones ?
Of course not : Chomsky and Herman quite rightly labeled the strategic hamlets as " virtual concentration camps , " and described the program as " savage . " ( 77 ) The irony here is that Chomsky and Herman do indeed detect a double standard with the forced relocations instigated by the U.S. , and the forced relocations instigated by the Communists ... but they detect it only with regard to the West 's criticisms of communist Vietnam 's relocation of the Montagnards .
This , they claim , " exemplifies once again the typical hypocrisy of the media . " ( 78 ) They do not , however , detect any hypocrisy in their own defense of the far more brutal and far more extensive forced relocations conducted by the Khmer Rouge .
Regarding the evacuation of Phnom Penh , Chomsky and Herman devote several pages to an account written by Shane Tarr , a New Zealander , and Chou Meng , his Khmer wife .
The Tarrs originally left Phnom Penh in the evacuation , then returned to Phnom Penh and were confined to the French embassy along with the other foreigners .
Devout communists , the Tarrs claimed to have seen " ' no organised executions , massacres , or the results of such like . ' "
The evacuation , they claim , was " ' slow and well - organized , ' " and " ' The aged and the ill were not expected to join in the march .
We saw very few who were old or sick on the road ; those that we met elsewhere told us that the revolutionary organisation catered for their needs . ' " ( 79 )
" Again , we may ask why the eyewitness report of Chou Meng and Shane Tarr does not enter the record , as shaped by the selective hand of the media and mainstream scholarship ? " ( 80 ) Chomsky and Herman allude to the fact that journalists in the Embassy despised Tarr , but do not bother to consider that perhaps their dislike was entirely warranted .
Years later , in his outstanding memoir River of Time , journalist Jon Swain describes
Tarr in no uncertain terms :
" There are also those with whom we , who had abandoned our Cambodian friends , did not wish to pass the time of day .
One was Shane Tarr , a twenty - four - year - old New Zealander and his Cambodian wife ( who , if she was lucky , would be able to stay ) .
He was full of self - righteous and nauseating revolutionary rhetoric and extolled the deeds of the ' liberation forces ' .
That the Khmer Rouge had kicked two million people out into the countryside without making adequate provision to feed them ; looted the city ; ripped off watches , radios , cars ; and executed people , did not trouble his conscience .
' They are not looting .
They are expropriating private property , ' he said .
' The people give up their things willingly . '
" But when it came down to it he was as bourgeois and in need of creature comforts as the rest of us .
Nearly always the first in line for the food we ate at 3 p .m. -- a soggy mixture of rice sprinkled with fragments of meat or vegetable -- he complained bitterly when the air - conditioning stopped .
And he did little work .
He and his wife , Chou Meng , fraternised with the Khmer Rouge guards over the walls .
The more paranoid among us worried that they might be passing on our little secrets .
He had a low opinion of the capitalist press ; as we had of his hypocrisy .
He was shunned . " ( 81 )
One may compare the Tarr 's account of the evacuation with any of the many memoirs of Cambodia written by those forced out of Phnom Penh , and judge which is warranted : Chomsky and Herman 's suggestion that Tarr was a reputable source , or Swain 's contempt .
In addition to suggesting that the evacuation saved lives , Chomsky and Herman also suggest that it was n't really very important to the Cambodians themselves : they quote one of the men who accompanied a Swedish delegation to Cambodia in 1976 , Jan Lundvik , who claims that the evacuation of the cities was not " 'as noteworthy for the Kampuchean people as had been represented in the West ' because Cambodia is an agricultural country . " ( 82 )
One wonders whether or not Lundvik himself would have found it " noteworthy " if he had been forcibly evicted from his home and deposited in the middle of a malaria - infested jungle , with the instructions to convert the forest into a rice paddy .
Richard Boyle , another source whom Chomsky and Herman cite in attempting to discredit the common perception of the evacuation as a brutal exercise , claims that the evacuation was " ' justified by horrendous conditions in Phnom Penh . ' " ( 83 ) Among Boyle 's other claims : Phnom Penh 's water filtration plants and power lines had been destroyed by " ' secret police agents ' " , and " ' not one of the 1100 foreign nationals , including about 20 journalists , who left on the two convoys provided by the Khmer Rouge ever witnesses any bodies abandoned on the roadside . ' " ( 84 ) It is peculiar that Chomsky and Herman cite this last claim , since their own book contradicts it : on page 251 , they write that Sydney Schanberg in fact did see bodies on the road leading out of Phnom Penh .
( Strictly speaking , however , their reference is not quite correct ; Schanberg wrote that he spoke with others who saw bodies along the road .
He does not say that he himself saw bodies . )
Chomsky and Herman also cite a report by Patrice de Beer of Le Monde :
" De Beer urges caution with refugee or secret service reports ( ' how badly mistaken they were is only too well known ' ) .
He is skeptical about the reports of executions .
' One instance cited is that of Oudong , which we went through on April 30 , and where we saw nothing of the sort . '
He is also skeptical of monitored radio messages , ' when you recall that the day after Phnom Penh fell a clandestine transmitter on the Thai border announced that a score of journalists had been killed by the Khmer Rouge , when in fact they were all alive . '" ( 85 )
There are several points worth raising here .
Chomsky and Herman 's recurring theme - the unreliability of refugee testimony - is once again put forward .
But the specifics here are particularly noteworthy .
First , de Beer 's comment regarding the executions in Oudong is simply absurd : are we expected to believe that , after confining all foreigners to the French embassy for weeks , the Khmer Rouge would conveniently drive a convoy of journalists past the corpses of those they had murdered ?
Moreover , there were executions at Oudong .
From Ben Kiernan's The Pol Pot Regime :
" In March 1974 , CPK forces captured Cambodia 's nineteenth - century capital , Oudong .
On Mok 's orders , it was immediately evacuated .
A participant recalls : ' Forty thousand people were sent in all directions .
The Khmer Rouge burnt houses everywhere ...
Uniformed Lon Nol soldiers were executed along the way . ' " ( 86 )
Aside from the confirmation of executions , the passage from Kiernan also reinforces the point made by Ponchaud with regard to the evacuation of Phnom Penh : evacuating towns and cities under their control was standard practice for the Khmer Rouge .
The evacuation was not a response to starvation : it was established policy .
It is also worth commenting on de Beer 's claim that there were false reports of journalists being killed .
Perhaps de Beer is correct ; perhaps there was such a report .
But Chomsky and Herman fail to note a significant fact : in 1970 , Communist forces murdered a total of twenty - five journalists in Cambodia . ( 87 ) The consequences of this omission are predictable : readers whose only knowledge of Cambodia comes from Chomsky and Herman will confidently proclaim that the stories of the Khmer Rouge murdering reporters is an outright lie .
The inclusion of comments like those of Lundvik and de Beer again suggests that Chomsky and Herman were trying to convey the impression that conditions in Cambodia were not as dire as critics claimed .
Why else would Chomsky and Herman cite the accounts of Swedish , Finnish , and Danish Ambassadors , noting that they did not see any sign of " oppression or cruelty , " nor signs of starvation ? ( 88 ) Are we to believe that the fact that the Khmer Rouge did not murder their victims in front of visiting foreign dignitaries is evidence that they did not murder or starve them at all ?
Why include Swedish Ambassador 's comment that Khmer Rouge ideologue Khieu Samphan " gives the impression of being an intellectual of quality " ?
( 89 )
Continuing in this same vein , Chomsky and Herman attempt to downplay the significance of child labor by claiming that " vocational training " for twelve - year - old children is " not generally regarded as an atrocity in a poor peasant society . "
( 90 ) The argument is a waste of ink .
No amount of scholarly doublespeak can conceal the fact that child slavery is not " vocational training . "
Nonetheless , this argument pales in comparison with some of After the Cataclysm 's other misrepresentations .
For example , Chomsky and Herman devote three pages to the remarks of Francois Rigaux , a member of a delegation from " the Association Belgique - Kampuchea " in Mid-1978 .
Supposedly a specialist in " the area of family life , " Rigaux claimed that conditions he saw in Cambodia were ( in Chomsky and Herman 's words ) " not unlike that of Western European villages before the industrial revolution , with a strong emphasis on family life .
Children over a year of age had collective care during the work day , and he reports efforts to arrange for married couples and families to share related occupations where possible .
With the extreme decentralization and local arrangements for personal affairs , bureaucracy appeared to be reduced to a minimum . "
Chomsky and Herman describe Rigaux 's impression of health care in Democratic Kampuchea : " Similarly , medical care is not concentrated in the cities and reserved for the elite but is distributed through the most backward regions with an emphasis on preventative medicine and hygiene . " ( 91 )
" ' The best propaganda for the new regime , ' Rigaux writes , was the attitudes and behavior of the older peasants whom he came upon by chance in his travels .
To Rigaux , they appeared to have acquired dignity , serenity , and security after a lifetime of oppression and violence . " ( 92 )
Chomsky and Herman also say that :
" Rigaux believes that 'relative to what it was before liberation , or compared to that of the peasants of Bangladesh , India , or Iran ... , the condition of the Khmer peasant has improved notably . '
For urban or Western elites , the results are ' shocking , ' in part because of the deliberate insistence on equality , which requires that all share in ' the conditions of work to which the immense majority of the world 's population have been subjected for millennia . '
Now everyone faces ' the exalting task of cooperating in the progressive improvement of the conditions of life of the entire population . '" ( 93 )
Rigaux 's comments are obscene .
A " strong emphasis on family life " ?
The Khmer Rouge implemented policies deliberately designed to break the allegiance of children to their parents , siblings , other relatives .
Among the many ludicrous claims advanced in After the Cataclysm , this is surely one of the most disgraceful , particularly as it was being propagated in 1979 , when the camps of the Thai border were rapidly filling with thousands of refugees capable of refuting the claim .
" Medical care " ?
The Khmer Rouge murdered doctors as a matter of policy .
The claim is that medical care was not reserved for the elites is completely wrong .
It is a safe guess that Pol Pot , Ieng Sary , and Khieu Samphan were not treated with the same " medicine " as the rest of the population : the grainy dark pellets that refugees commonly described as " rabbit shit . "
A " deliberate insistence on equality " ?
For all of the Khmer Rouge rhetoric about a classless society , their regime was defined by rigid , inflexible classes : the Khmer Rouge themselves , the " old people , " and , at the bottom , the " new people . "
The " best propaganda for the new regime ? "
No , that would have been the likes of Rigaux himself .
Or , one is tempted to add , Chomsky and Herman .
Other accounts relayed by Chomsky and Herman include the reports of a team of Yugoslav journalists who were given a guided tour of the country in March 1978 .
Chomsky and Herman seem to accept many of their claims at face value : that the work day was only 9 hours , for example , or the completely wrong claim that there was an " absence , even in mild form , of political indoctrination . " ( 94 )
Had they bothered to speak with any of the refugees pouring into Thailand , they could have found ample evidence to the contrary :
In most areas , nightly political meetings and " self - criticism " sessions were common , and few Cambodians worked nine - hour days ; many , if not most , were often forced to rise before dawn , and worked until well after sundown .
Chomsky and Herman also note the account of a Vietnamese man who supposedly crossed Cambodia on foot without seeing any evidence of massacres .
Of course , the ability of one man to walk through the countryside without witnessing murder does not make particularly compelling evidence for the existence of a new era of social justice .
Chomsky and Herman did not , however , dismiss all accounts of Khmer Rouge atrocities .
Instead , they argue that the existence of relatively benign accounts shows that there were local variations inside the country .
On this point , they are correct .
However , the conclusions they draw from this are wrong .
They argue that these variations provide evidence against the existence of state - directed violence .
( 95 ) Regarding responsibility for the massacres , Chomsky and Herman discuss the work of Ben Kiernan , and suggest that Kiernan 's interpretation of events in Cambodia " is rather different from what has been featured by the press .
Specifically , he took issue with the horror stories published in Time ( April 26 , 1976 ) , which alleged that 500,000 - 600,000 people had died under the rule of the Khmer Rouge ... like others , he notes that most of the most of the atrocity stories come from areas of little Khmer Rouge strength , where orders to stop reprisals were disobeyed by soldiers wreaking vengeance , often drawn from the poorest sections of the peasantry ...
He questions the assumption that there was central direction for atrocities as well as the assumption that the stories from specific areas where , in fact , the Khmer Rouge had little control , can be freely extrapolated to the country as a whole . " ( 96 )
The presence of local variations , however , most certainly does not argue against the presence of central direction ; in fact , many of the worst massacres in Democratic Kampuchea occurred as the result of centrally - directed purges of specific geographic areas .
Moreover , one wonders if Chomsky and Herman would exempt the Salvadoran government from culpability , if , for example , the murderous right - wing death squads had been organized by local commanders , and were not the result of " central direction . "
At the time After the Cataclysm was written , several scholars did suggest that the Khmer Rouge never really exercised complete control throughout the country ; according to this view , directives provided by the central authority in Phnom Penh were perverted by local commanders bent on settling old scores .
Ben Kiernan was originally one of the proponents of this theory .
Kiernan , however , reconsidered his position shortly after the publication of After the Cataclysm .
In the Bulletin of Concerned Asia Scholars , October - December 1979 , the editors of that publication asked him why he had " changed his mind " and had become critical of the Khmer Rouge regime .
" I was late in realizing the extent of the tragedy in Kampuchea , " he wrote .
He continued : " I was wrong about an important aspect of Kampuchean communism : the brutal authoritarian trend within the revolutionary movement after 1973 was not simply a grassroots reaction , and expression of popular outrage at the killing and destruction of the countryside by US bombs , although that helped it along decisively . " ( 97 ) He echoes this statement in Peasants and Politics in Kampuchea 1942 - 1981 .
" In analysing the reasons for continuing violence after the war , I failed to identify the deliberate , if hampered , activities of the Pol Pot group . " ( 98 )
In The Pol Pot Regime , written in 1996 , Kiernan goes even farther in refuting the claims that Khmer Rouge atrocities were the work of overzealous local authorities :
" We are also in a position to resolve a number of other contentious issues about the Pol Pot regime .
Its racialist preoccupations and discourse were of primary importance , but so were totalitarian ambitions and achievements .
Along with Vickery 's theory of a ' peasant revolution ' ( see Chapter 5 ) , we can now dismiss Thion 's assertion that in Democratic Kampuchea , ' The state never stood on its feet . '
Despite its underdeveloped economy , the regime probably exerted more power over its citizens than any state in world history .
It controlled and directed their public lives more closely than government had ever done . " ( 99 )
In the wake of Kiernan 's reversal , it is maddening that Chomsky continues to insist that the positions he outlines in After the Cataclysm were correct .
Cataclysm is accurate in the sense that Chomsky faithfully records the remarks of Kiernan and others ; but Kiernan and many others subsequently admitted that those remarks were wrong .
One would expect a serious scholar to acknowledge the implications of those admissions .
With regard to the overall " propaganda " picture , however , Chomsky and Herman do make some concessions , noting that some reporters ' work did not conform to their model .
These reporters did not accept the idea that the Khmer Rouge were monsters .
Chomsky and Herman note , for example , a Washington Post article by Lewis Simons , in which Simons quotes Gareth Porter 's claim that " The fact is that the evacuation and the regime 's concentration on rice production have averted mass starvation .
If you look at the three Indochinese countries today , you 'll find that Cambodia undoubtedly is in the best food position . "
Simons ' article also says that this claim " is more or less supported by State Department officials " and notes that there are reports of rice exports .
" It is particularly worthy of note , " Chomsky and Herman write , " that visitors in late 1978 found food supplies to be more than adequate ... it seems that the extensive development of dikes and dams in the postwar period , which has consistently impressed visitors , sufficed , despite some damage , to overcome the worst effects and to afford the population an ample supply of food , even including a surplus for export , according to the regime ... " ( 100 )
But despite Chomsky and Herman 's claim , there is no evidence that the dams which " consistently impressed visitors " had any positive effect at all on the production of rice .
Comments such as these seem to be based on nothing more than the ( supposed ) ability of the Khmer Rouge to avoid starvation among the population .
Cambodia , however , had historically been an exporter of rice , and it did this without evacuating cities and building massive canals and dams .
Many of the dams and dikes never worked at all .
In her book When the War Was Over , Elizabeth Becker described the typical effects of these projects .
Her comments echo the judgment of the peasants , noted by Shawcross earlier :
" The plans were drawn up by cadre with no engineering experience and without advice from peasants familiar with the area .
The construction of the First January Dam is a good example of the awful results .
" That dam was built in the northwest in 1977 .
The Center ordered it to be completely dug and constructed between the January harvest and the May planting season .
It was to irrigate 20,000 hectares of land .
There was practically no mechanical equipment available -- no bulldozers for digging and few trucks for hauling
The cooperatives in the general vicinity had to ' donate ' labor teams of thousands of people with no training .
They worked like ants , digging the earth with crude picks and shovels , carrying back - breaking loads of dirt and rocks in bamboo baskets balanced on poles across their shoulders .
They worked around the clock with the moon and lanterns lighting the area at night .
But they finished on time .
And in the 1978 rainy season the dam burst .
It had been constructed without a spillway , a shortcut that halved construction time but made it certain that the dam would not hold up under heavy rains and swelling rivers during the monsoon season .
" Nearly every dam in Democratic Kampuchea was built that way .
One engineer who later surveyed the irrigation projects of the Khmer Rouge described the criminal neglect of these construction schemes .
' Without a spillway there is no effective way to control the water and it broke through the dam .
When the dam broke there was little protection for the people who lived downstream and they were flooded .
The rest of the irrigation system was usable but many canals were either out of alignment or in need of basic repairs that would have been unnecessary if the canals had been built correctly in the first place . '
" But such care and consideration were impossible in the regime 's schemes for a great leap forward and in its basic political philosophy that the political character of the workers was more important than engineering skills . " ( 101 )
Chomsky and Herman , however , seem to take it for granted that rice production was increased by the Khmer Rouge : " Recall the widespread acknowledgement that the new regime had considerable , perhaps ' spectacular ' success in overcoming the food crisis caused by U.S. bombing , considerably more so than the other countries of Indochina . '" ( 102 ) They fail to note , however , the simple fact that the end of combat would inevitably have provided an impetus to recovery .
To the limited extent that the food crisis abated , it was in spite of Khmer Rouge policy ... not because of it .
There is another crucial point here as well : large segments of the population in fact did suffer from severe malnutrition and starvation in 1975 and 1976 .
Not surprisingly , Chomsky and Herman fail to understand what this says about the Khmer Rouge regime : ensuring that the population had adequate food was simply not a priority .
Finally , it should be noted that the claims of spectacular agricultural " success " are somewhat at odds with another of Chomsky 's contentions , that being that the U.S. was to blame for many of the deaths which occurred during the Khmer Rouge regime .
If the Khmer Rouge quickly overcame the damage done by the U.S. bombing , that damage cannot be responsible for significant numbers of deaths .
Just as Chomsky and Herman 's interpretation of evidence about conditions inside Cambodia is dubious , their interpretation of how the media responded to the reports is also questionable .
A good example can be seen in Chomsky 's comments on the reports of three Westerners who were allowed to make a guided tour of the country .
In December 1978 , the three -- Becker , of the Washington Post , Richard Dudman , of the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , and scholar Malcolm Caldwell -- were briefly permitted to enter Cambodia .
The goal , presumably , was to reverse the world 's negative view of the Khmer Rouge regime .
Caldwell , co-author of the book in which Chomsky made his " new era of economic development and social justice " comment , did not survive to write his impressions .
He was murdered in Phnom Penh on the final night of their visit , apparently by a Khmer Rouge faction determined to embarrass Pol Pot . ( 103 )
Both Dudman and Becker wrote long articles on their visit .
Chomsky and Herman claim that the media ignored these accounts , noting that " The New York Times dismissed their visit in a line .
Bernard Weinraub , in the 11th paragraph of a 13 paragraph story on the reported purges in Cambodia , remarked that their visit ' produced no substantial surprises since the visitors only saw what the government wanted them to see . '" ( 104 ) Never mind that Weinraub 's summary was quite accurate .
And never mind that Dudman and Becker 's own papers ran extended articles detailing their reports : the fact that a competing newspaper did not devote lengthy space to reports written by someone else 's reporter is , in the " propaganda model " of Chomsky and Herman , evidence of a campaign of distortion and disinformation .
Of course , if the media is governed by Chomsky and Herman 's propaganda model , one wonders why Barron and Paul 's book was described as " 'a Cold War propaganda piece " in the Washington Post . ( 105 )
Chomsky and Herman 's faith in their model , however , remained unshakeable .
Thus the authors confidently asserted that " It is a fair generalization that the more extreme the condemnation of Cambodia , the more confident the claim that ' Communism ' lies at the roots of its present travail , the more diminished the U.S. share and responsibility -- then the greater the exposure . " ( 106 )
That assertion , however , has not been borne out .
Barron and Paul 's book -- which ignores the U.S. role in Cambodia 's agony -- is long forgotten , while William Shawcross ' Sideshow -- which lays the blame for the destruction of Cambodia at the feet of Nixon and Kissinger -- is still in print more than 20 years after its original publication .
After the Cataclysm can be evaluated by two separate measures : the validity of its propaganda model , and the accuracy of its alternative picture of the Khmer Rouge reign .
The evidence for the existence of what the authors describe as a " system of brainwashing " ( 107 ) is unconvincing at best .
The value of their observations on the nature of the Khmer Rouge regime are completely without merit .
How bad was Democratic Kampuchea ?
Chomsky and Herman do not at any point provide their own estimates of the death toll .
They do , however , quote Laura Summer 's contention that it is " not surprising that the revolution was violent for in addition to the human destruction heaped upon the community by intensive American bombing , there were profound social grievances and scores to be settled , " and note that Summers goes on to suggest that the postwar death toll from " exhaustion , disease , and execution " was " in the range of two hundred thousand . " ( 108 ) Of course , Chomsky and Herman have also suggested that some sources predicted that " a million people were certain to die of starvation " in postwar Cambodia , a situation that was " squarely the responsibility of the United States . " ( 109 ) Combine these estimations with their claim that actions such as the evacuation of Phnom Penh " may actually have saved lives , " and consider the implications :
If we accept Chomsky and Herman 's most extreme arguments , we would arrive at the conclusion that the Khmer Rouge " liberation " actually saved roughly 800,000 people .
But in case some readers were not persuaded by the arguments that the Khmer Rouge were actually not all that bad , Chomsky and Herman are ready with a second argument : if the Khmer Rouge were bad , it was because the U.S. deliberately made them that way .
Thus , they repeat Michael Vickery 's claims that US policy in Cambodia was driven by a desire to " 'insure that the post - war revolutionary government be extremely brutal , doctrinaire , and frightening to its neighbors , rather than a moderate socialism to which the Thai , for example , might look with envy . ' "
" Then , " Chomsky and Herman write , " the aggressors would at least be able to reap a propaganda victory from the misery they had sown . " ( 110 )
This theme is reiterated near the end book :
" If a serious study of the impact of Western imperialism on Cambodian peasant life is someday undertaken , it may well be discovered that the violence lurking behind the Khmer smile , on which Meyer and others have commented , is not a reflection of obscure traits in peasant culture and psychology , but is the direct and understandable response to the violence of the imperial system , and that its current manifestations are a no less direct and understandable response to the still more concentrated and extreme savagery of a U.S. assault that may in part have been designed to evoke this very response , as we have noted .
Such a study may also show that the Khmer Rouge programs elicited a positive response from some sectors of the Cambodian peasantry because they dealt with fundamental problems rooted in the feudal past and exacerbated by the imperial system with its final outburst of uncontrolled barbarism . " ( 111 )
Among all of Chomsky and Herman 's troubling comments on Cambodia , this stands out .
It is difficult to see this paragraph as anything other than blatant apologetics .
If the Khmer Rouge were brutal , it was " understandable , " since the policies of the United States were " designed to evoke this very response . "
Never mind that the scenes of warfare , death , and dismemberment carved into the stones of Angkor demonstrate that the " violence lurking behind the Khmer smile " has been around for at least 800 years : the " imperial system " is to blame .
Evidence be damned .
V. Apples , Oranges , and Myopia
Chomsky 's comments regarding the Khmer Rouge have changed somewhat in the years following the Vietnamese invasion .
With the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime a matter of historical record , references to " liberation " and the " constructive role " of the communists disappeared .
This shift was readily apparent by 1988 , when Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent .
Manufacturing Consent is a more palatable book than After the Cataclysm , and makes a far more compelling case for bias in the media , particularly with regard to Central America .
Nonetheless , there are again a number of distortions regarding events in Cambodia , and misrepresentations regarding the media coverage of those events .
At times these inaccuracies are subtle .
Discussing events in 1967 , for example , Chomsky and Herman write that " Vietnamese peasants and guerrillas fled for refuge to border areas in Cambodia , " creating the impression that Cambodia was overrun with frightened refugees .
( 112 ) In reality , the problem for Cambodia was not an influx of terrified peasants .
The problem was a massive infiltration by North Vietnamese Army regulars .
One might argue that this is nothing more than creative use of the language : a bit of poetic license .
At other times , however , Chomsky and Herman are clearly misreprenting their sources .
Consider , for example , their claim regarding conditions in Phnom Penh in 1975 : " As the war ended , deaths from starvation alone were running at about 100,000 a year , and the U.S. airlift that kept the population alive was immediately terminated . "
( 113 )
As their source , Chomsky an Herman cite Starvation and Revolution .
Presumably Chomsky and Herman are basing this " rate " on Hildebrand and Porter 's claim that " if a conservative estimate of 250 deaths per day from starvation is used the total for March [ 1975 ] alone comes to nearly 8000 people . "
Extrapolating an annual rate from this , of course , is a dubious proposition ; one might similarly argue that , based on the death toll from September 2001 , terrorists were murdering Americans at a rate of 30,000 a year .
Nonetheless , if we assume that there truly were 250 people dying each day , we would arrive at an annual rate of 91,250 .
If this were the full extent of Chomsky and Herman 's exaggeration , perhaps it would be within an acceptable margin of error .
But Hildebrand and Porter 's very next sentence notes that " the total number [ of deaths by starvation ] for the last five months of the war must have been at least 15,000 and possibly far more . "
Conditions in the capital worsened as the siege of Phnom Penh dragged on , and consequently the final months of the siege were the most deadly .
Even if we ignore this , and base our estimate of the death toll for the entire year on the last months , we arrive at a figure of 36,000 deaths .
This is a horrible toll , but it is vastly lower than Chomsky and Herman 's claim of 100,000 a year .
And yet we are still not done : what happens when we examine Hildebrand and Porter 's numbers in greater detail ?
The supposedly " conservative " estimate of 250 deaths a day is based solely on a remark by Dr. Gay Alexander of Catholic Relief Services .
Yet Hildebrand and Porter admit that " no effort was made to estimate how many people were dying each day from starvation . "
Were there any hard statistics on deaths from starvation and malnutrition ?
In fact , there were .
Hildebrand and Porter note figures from the Toul Kauk nutrition center , the Catholic Relief Services children 's clinic , and the Red Cross children 's clinic .
At the Toul Kauk clinic , there were 49 deaths in January 1975 , or slightly less than 2 per day .
Dr. Alexander 's report , according to Hildebrand and Porter , cites an average of 3 deaths per day at the CRS clinic .
At the Red Cross clinic , there were 65 deaths in the last week of February , or roughly 10 per day .
The combined total from these three facilities , then , was around 15 deaths per day .
There is no question that there were many individuals who died beyond the reach of the relief agencies , and Hildebrand and Porter 's assertion that the clinic deaths were " the tip of the iceberg " may have been correct .
Nonetheless , in the face of Hildebrand and Porter 's admission that no one was actually keeping track , the supposed death rate of 100,000 per year is , at best , a misuse of statistics , and at worst a flagrant exaggeration . ( 114 )
The precise numbers , however , are less important than the larger question :
Who is responsible for these deaths ?
The Americans , who had ceased direct involvement in combat more than a year and a half earlier ?
Or the Communists , who had encircled the city and cut off all supplies ?
A realistic assessment would note that the Khmer Rouge , the Americans , and the Vietnamese were all partly to blame .
Chomsky and Herman , however , are not in the business of providing realistic assessments .
Thus , the toll can be inflated arbitrarily , and laid entirely at the feet of the Americans .
As with After the Cataclysm , Chomsky and Herman again selectively omit relevant facts , and apply different standards when doing so will bolster their case .
Discussing articles by Sydney Schanberg which appeared in the New York Times on the tenth anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover , for example , Chomsky and Herman quote Schanberg 's observation that " the Khmer Rouge were a meaningless force when the war was brought to Cambodia in 1970 ....
In order to flourish and grow , they needed a war to feed on .
And the superpowers -- including this country , with the Nixon incursion of 1970 and the massive bombing that followed -- provided the war and that nurturing material . "
Commenting on this quote , Chomsky and Herman complain that Schanberg " does not , however , inform us about which superpower , apart from ' this country , ' invaded Cambodia and subjected it to massive bombing . "
( 115 )
The implication of this remark is that among the superpowers , the United States alone was responsible for the devastation of Cambodia .
The role of the Chinese is completely ignored : and yet it was the Chinese who provided arms and munitions to the Khmer Rouge during the civil war , during the repression of the Pol Pot years , and during the subsequent war against the Vietnamese .
China was also the only foreign country to provide a significant amount of aid to the Pol Pot regime , including roughly 15,000 advisors .
( 116 ) The double standard employed throughout Chomsky and Herman 's work is again apparent : while the United States is deemed wholly responsible for the actions of its client states , as in Central America , no such culpability is assigned to the Chinese for the actions of the Khmer Rouge , nor for the USSR with regard to the actions of the Vietnamese .
( 117 )
Some of what appears in Manufacturing Consent is a rehash of After the Cataclysm ; Francois Ponchaud , for example , is again a target .
He is " known to be unreliable " ( 118 ) , " highly dubious " ( 119 ) and guilty of " remarkable deception " ( 120 ) .
William Shawcross , too , comes in for harsh criticism .
In particular , Chomsky and Herman complain that Shawcross falsely characterized their stance on Cambodia .
( 121 ) The basis of this complaint is a footnote in The Quality of Mercy , in which Shawcross extracted three separate paragraphs from The Political Economy of Human Rights as a summary of Chomsky 's position .
Shawcross deserves to be criticized for not indicating that the paragraphs he cited were not contiguous .
The fact remains , however , that the excerpts Shawcross cites accurately summarize Chomsky and Herman 's arguments .
But what happens when the roles are reversed : do Chomsky and Herman accurately summarize Shawcross ' position ?
They do not .
Chomsky and Herman imply , for example , that Shawcross claims that Sihanouk did not object to the bombing of Cambodia : they quote Shawcross as saying that " ' Sihano

February 11 , 2008
From the time I first journeyed through the rabbit hole and up until recently , I had always thought it was the message .
I thought if the people could somehow hear the message , surely they would accept it . . . the message , of course , being freedom .
I now know that the people have heard the message , and that message was rejected .
All elections are examples of why ' Dumbocracy ' is evil and only further demonstrate why governments love to promote this farce , but this one was slightly different .
Sure the rhetoric still sounded the same , but for the first time , there was someone who was speaking about freedom and liberty who actually understood what these words meant .
The person , of course , was Ron Paul , and this person was , of course , portrayed as senile and crazy for speaking about such things .
I never really thought Ron Paul would survive his battle with Leviathan , but I was interested to see what the sheep would think of his message .
After all , I had always thought if the sheep would listen to the message , they would no longer be sheep .
I was wrong .
I had spent most of my adult life telling others they just do n't ' get it , ' but as it turned out , I was the one who did not ' get it . '
The sheep ' get it ' just fine , I am the one who has been delusional all these years for thinking people actually want to be free ; they do n't .
It 's really sad that when for the first time the people were actually given a chance to vote for someone who actually was for freedom and liberty and did not just give these words lip service , they pulled the lever for more of the same : more war , more theft , more lies and more fascism , and they did this of course because they wanted change .
It 's true , all one needs to do is listen to the talking heads on television , the people want change !
I guess in the Orwellian world we live in today , change is what the people will receive .
While watching the MTV debate , I noticed that since this was a younger group of people that all the questions were about ' if elected , what can I expect from government ? '
Of course , with the exception of Ron Paul , all of the Republicrats tried to compete to see which one of them could throw open the doors of the Treasury ( assuming there is such a thing ) the quickest and offer the most opportunity to plunder and pillage other people 's money .
Yes , the people really are nothing more than sheep .
How could anyone say they are looking for change , while at the same time ask for more of the same ?
Looking at the usual suspects that have been offered up to us from our great Dumbocracy , what exactly separates these tyrannical puppets ?
Other than the left / right , liberal / conservative dogma that is used as a guise , there is no difference .
What great philosophical decision would someone need to make when moving his or her support from Giuliani to Romney and then to McCain ?
There is no difference between any of these Nazis , so other than the task of changing the sign in the yard and the bumper sticker on the car , no effort or thought is involved at all .
You would never see a McCain sign being replaced by a Ron Paul sign , as this would require a change in philosophy and some actual thought .
I know Ron Paul personally and I think he is a good man .
With that being said , I know nothing really would have changed even if he had somehow managed to enlighten the sheep and get their support .
The machine would have never allowed someone like Ron Paul to survive .
If the machine had not been able to minimize and ridicule him , it would have been just as willing to kill him and silence him .
Leviathan will not be stopped ; it has spent too much time , effort and stolen money to let someone try to stifle it .
I mention all of this not because I lost my mind and actually considered voting or supporting Dumbocracy ; no , I am merely admitting that I was wrong in my thinking the message was not being heard .
The people heard the message and it was the message they did not like .
No longer will I tell people they just do n't ' get it , ' because it was I who did not ' get it . '
I now know ' It 's the message , stupid !'

Velociraptor : More like a penguin than we thought
They had one of the most efficient respiratory systems of all animals , similar to that of modern diving birds like penguins , fossil evidence shows .
It fuelled their bodies with oxygen for the task of sprinting after prey , say researchers at Manchester University .
The bipedal meat - eaters , the therapods , had air sacs ventilated by tiny bones that moved the ribcage up and down .
" Finding these structures in modern birds and their extinct dinosaur ancestors suggests that these running dinosaurs had an efficient respiratory system and supports the theory that they were highly active animals that could run relatively quickly when pursuing their prey , " said Dr Jonathan Codd , who led the research .
" It provides a mechanism for facilitating avian - like breathing in non-avian dinosaurs and it was there long before the evolution of flight occurred , " he told BBC News .
Bony projections
Modern - day birds have a highly specialised respiratory system , made up of a small rigid lung and around nine air sacs .
The bellows - like movement of the sternum and ribs moves air through the system .
The researchers examined fossils , including the famed ' fighting dinosaurs '
Bony projections on the ribcage known as uncinate processes play an important role in both respiration and locomotion .
The small bones act as levers to move the ribs and sternum during breathing .
They have become adapted in different types of birds to deal with different ways of getting around .
The bones are shortest in runners like emus that do n't need large breast muscles for flight , intermediate in flying birds and longest in divers such as the penguin .
The Manchester team studied a wealth of fossil remains of dinosaurs and extinct birds such as Archaeopteryx , and compared these with skeletons of living birds .
They found that uncinate processes are also found both in the extinct ancestors of birds , the theropod dinosaurs , and in modern species .
Dinosaurs are most like diving birds in their morphology .
" The dinosaurs we studied from the fossil record had long uncinate processes similar in structure to those of diving birds , " said Dr Codd .
" This suggests both dinosaurs and diving birds need longer lever arms to help them breathe , " he added .
The data , published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences , may provide clues to how dinosaurs evolved and how they might have lived .
The unemployment report on Friday was brutally bad .
Unemployment rose in December , while job creation was minimal  and it ’s highly likely , for technical reasons , that the job number will be revised down , showing an actual decline in employment .
It ’s the latest piece of bad news about an economy in which the employment situation has actually been deteriorating for the past year .
It ’s no longer possible to hope that the effects of the housing slump will remain “ contained , ” as one of 2007 ’s buzzwords had it .
The levees have been breached , and the repercussions of the housing crisis are spreading across the economy as a whole .
It ’s not certain , even now , that we ’ll have a formal recession , although given the news on Friday you have to say that the odds are that we will .
But what is clear is that 2008 will be a troubled year for the U.S. economy  and that as a result , the overall economic record of the Bush years will have been dreary at best : two and a half years of slumping employment , three and a half years of good but not great growth , and two more years of renewed economic distress .
The November election will take place against that background of economic distress , which ought to be good news for candidates running on a platform of change .

Amazon Biocentrism : How Life and Consciousness Are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe by Robert Lanza & Bob Berman
Every now and then , a simple yet radical idea shakes the very foundations of knowledge .
The startling discovery that the world was not flat challenged and ultimately changed the way people perceived themselves and their relationships with the world .
For most humans of the 15th century , the notion of Earth as ball of rock was nonsense .
The whole of Western natural philosophy is undergoing a sea change again , forced upon us by the experimental findings of quantum theory .
At the same time , these findings have increased our doubt and uncertainty about traditional physical explanations of the universe ’s genesis and structure .
Biocentrism completes this shift in worldview , turning the planet upside down again with the revolutionary view that life creates the universe instead of the other way around .
In this new paradigm , life is not just an accidental byproduct of the laws of physics .

The extraordinary thing about Sanskrit is that it offers direct accessibility to anyone to that elevated plane where the two — mathematics and music , brain and heart , analytical and intuitive , scientific and spiritual — become one .
Sanskrit & Artificial Intelligence
NASA scientist Rick Briggs shows that Sanskrit is the most perfectly suited , unambiguous , language for programming Artificial Intelligence .
There exists a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence .

The telescope cannot penetrate the outermost cover of the universe and the microscope is composed of atoms and therefore cannot see the atom or anything smaller .
Likewise , the system of mental speculation is also insufficient to perceive the spiritual element .
Mind is a material element whose density is very slight , yet it 's speculations are no more spiritual than hard rocks .
Positive & Progressive Immortality
If immortality means " no influence of mortality , " what , then , is its positive conception ?
The normal , wholesome , and happy plane is in the life of dedication .
Without exploiting or borrowing anything from the environment , and without attempting to artificially renounce it , one who is sincere to dedicate himself naturally comes into contact with a higher and more subtle plane of life .
Darwins Theory Debunked
Where Are All the Half - Evolved Dinosaurs ?
Darwins theory of Evolution is accepted and taught as fact but less known is that scienctific evidence shows clearly that this theory is wrong .
There are far too many contradictions and too little proof .
Intelligent Design ? -
The simplicity that was once expected to be the foundation of life has proven to be a phantom .
Instead , systems of horrendous , irreducible complexity inhabit the cell .
The resulting realization that life was designed by an intelligence is a shock to us in the twentieth century who have gotten used to thinking of life as the result of simple natural laws .

This US spokesman says ' not the greatest news '
Thousands of Turkish troops have crossed into northern Iraq and thousands more are at the border ready to join them in their hunt for Kurdish PKK guerrillas , a senior military source said today .
Turkey 's military said the land offensive - the first major incursion in a decade - had fighter aircraft in support , and Turkish television reported that 10,000 troops had entered Iraq .
" The Turkish Armed Forces , which attach great importance to Iraq 's territorial integrity and stability , will return home in the shortest time possible after its goals have been achieved , " the General Staff said in a statement posted on its website .
The military source based in southeast Turkey told Reuters : " Thousands of troops have crossed the border and thousands more are waiting at the border to join them if necessary . "
The US military said it was aware that Turkish forces had launched an offensive into northern Iraq against members of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , considered a terrorist group by Ankara , the United States and the European Union .
Rear Admiral Gregory Smith , a US military spokesman in Baghdad , said the operation was understood to be of " limited duration " and aimed at PKK fighters in the largely autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq .
" Turkey has given its assurances that it will do everything possible to avoid collateral damage to innocent citizens or Kurdish infrastructure , " Smith said in a statement .
Nato member
Turkey says it has the right under international law to hit Turkish PKK rebels who shelter in northern Iraq and have mounted attacks inside Turkey that have killed scores of troops .
Turkey says some 3,000 PKK rebels are based in Iraq .
Turkey 's military said the cross - border offensive was launched at 7 pm on Thursday .
Turkish media said troops , backed by warplanes and Cobra attack helicopters , had moved six miles inside Iraq .
Television footage showed dozens of tanks moving at high speed along the Iraqi - Turkish border .
A US State Department official said the land incursion was " not the greatest news " .
" A land operation is a whole new level , " Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza told reporters in Brussels .
He said Washington had been cooperating fully with ally Turkey in providing intelligence on PKK positions in northern Iraq since last November to enable the Turkish air force to make pinpoint attacks minimising civilian casualties .
The EU and the United States have in the past raised concerns that a major offensive could destabilise the region , though they have not criticised recent small cross - border raids .
In Baghdad , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said his government was not aware of any Turkish ground offensive .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki called on his Turkish counterpart last night to respect Iraq 's borders after renewed shelling .
President Jalal Talabani accepted an invitation from Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Turkey .
Iraq has repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the PKK problem but Turkey 's government is under domestic pressure to take military action against the rebels .
Turkey 's military said the PKK was the target of the ground offensive and vowed to act with restraint towards local groups .
" Turkish troops will stay in the region as long as the conditions dictate this .
It will be very difficult for the PKK to re-base itself in northern Iraq , " Turkey 's former counter - terrorism chief , retired General Edip Baser , told NTV .
Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began an armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984 .
Bush : Outside forces ' unbelievably counterproductive ' in Africa , but needed in Iraq Eric Brewer

This I do n't know whether it was the whining I did in my last post about how Dana Perino was ignoring me , or whether it was just that there were so few reporters in the briefing room on Monday that I was able to move up to the second row of chairs ( I took the seat reserved for the NY Times ) , but I finally got to ask Dana a question .
My inspiration for the question was the great surge of hope I felt when I heard President Bush claim last week that he had recently learned something : " A clear lesson I learned in the museum was that outside forces that tend to divide people up inside their country are unbelievably counterproductive . "
He was in Kigali , Rwanda , talking about his visit to the genocide museum there , and although the remark was part of his explanation for why he has not intervened in Darfur , I thought the " clear lesson " might apply equally to other countries .
Iraq , for instance .
So I asked Dana : " Last week , President Bush said that during his visit to Rwanda , he learned the clear lesson that outside forces that tend to divide people up inside their country are unbelievably counterproductive .
How will the President 's newfound insight affect his Iraq policy ? "
Sadly , it appears , not very much .
The rest of our interchange : Dana :
The President has been working towards reconciliation between the Sunnis and the Shia , and it 's actually working on a political level in some ways .
Especially we saw that last month , when they passed three laws in one day , which was quite a significant achievement for the Iraqis .
And he will continue to work with them on it .
Me : Does he know what percentage of the Iraqi people want U.S. forces to leave ?
Dana : Look , what we do know is that the -- there might be polls telling -- saying different things about who wants us where .
What we know is that the Iraqi government wants us there , neighboring countries want us there .
And we also know that if we were to leave too quickly that the possibility for chaos and mass violence is too great , and the President wo n't risk that .
On Wednesday , Perino called on me again , so I followed up Monday 's question .
Me : The U.S. military conducted 19 focus groups throughout Iraq last November , and its report on those focus groups stated that Iraqis from every ethnic and sectarian group are united in the belief that the U.S. invasion is the root cause of the sectarian violence in Iraq , and that the departure of the U.S. military is the key to national reconciliation .
And I wondered , has the President seen the military 's report on those focus groups ?
Dana 's reply : I do n't know if he has .
I have n't either , and I 'd refer you to DOD because I do n't know the accuracy of that .
I knew that the Bush White House would never acknowledge that its strategy for preventing chaos and mass violence in Iraq is , in the eyes of the Iraqi people , the very cause of that violence even when the evidence was provided by a report prepared by the U.S. military .
But someone in military must 've taken a big risk in leaking that report to Washington Post reporter Karen De Young .
And I did n't want his or her bravery to be completely wasted .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .
Bush Administration Blocked Waterboarding Critic Former DOJ official tested the method himself , in quest to form torture policy .
Nov. 2 , 2007  --
A senior Justice Department official , charged with reworking the administration 's legal position on torture in 2004 became so concerned about the controversial interrogation technique of waterboarding that he decided to experience it firsthand , sources told ABC News .
Daniel Levin , then acting assistant attorney general , went to a military base near Washington and underwent the procedure to inform his analysis of different interrogation techniques .
After the experience , Levin told White House officials that even though he knew he would n't die , he found the experience terrifying and thought that it clearly simulated drowning .
Levin , who refused to comment for this story , concluded waterboarding could be illegal torture unless performed in a highly limited way and with close supervision .
And , sources told ABC News , he believed the Bush Administration had failed to offer clear guidelines for its use .
Bush Administration Blocked Critic
The administration at the time was reeling from an August 2002 memo by Jay Bybee , then the head of the Office of Legal Counsel , which laid out possible justifications for torture .
In June 2004 , Levin 's predecessor at the office , Jack Goldsmith , officially withdrew the Bybee memo , finding it deeply flawed .
When Levin took over from Goldsmith , he went to work on a memo that would effectively replace the Bybee memo as the administration 's legal position on torture .
It was during this time that he underwent waterboarding .
In December 2004 , Levin released the new memo .
He said , " Torture is abhorrent " but he went on to say in a footnote that the memo was not declaring the administration 's previous opinions illegal .
The White House , with Alberto Gonzales as the White House counsel , insisted that this footnote be included in the memo .
But Levin never finished a second memo imposing tighter controls on the specific interrogation techniques .
Sources said he was forced out of the Justice Department when Gonzales became attorney general .
Critics Decry Waterboarding as Torture
Critics say waterboarding should never be used .
According to retired Rear Adm. John Hutson , " There is no question this is torture -- this is a technique by which an individual is strapped to a board , elevated by his feet and either dunked into water or water poured over his face over a towel or a blanket . "
The legal justification of waterboarding has come to the forefront in the debate swirling around Michael B. Mukasey 's nomination for attorney general .
While Democrats are pressing him to declare waterboarding illegal , he has refused to do so .
He calls it personally " repugnant , " but he is unwilling to declare it illegal until he can see the classified information regarding the technique and its current use .
ABU DHABI , United Arab Emirates ( CNN ) -- President Bush said Sunday that Iran is threatening the security of the world , and that the United States and Arab allies must join together to confront the danger " before it 's too late . "
President Bush delivers speech critical of Iran on Sunday in Abu Dhabi .
Bush said Iran funds terrorist extremists , undermines peace in Lebanon , sends arms to the Taliban , seeks to intimidate its neighbors with alarming rhetoric , defies the United Nations and destabilizes the entire region by refusing to be open about its nuclear program .
" Iran is the world 's leading state sponsor of terror , " Bush said in a speech he delivered about midway through his eight - day Mideast trip that began with a renewed push for an Israeli - Palestinian peace pact -- an accord he said whose " time has come . "
Bush also chided U.S. allies who have withheld civil liberties , saying governments will never build trust by harassing or imprisoning candidates and protesters .
But his rebuke was general , and he did not single out any U.S. partner in the region for oppressive practices .
" You can not expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government , " Bush said .
" And you cannot stand up a modern , confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms . "
Watch excerpts from Bush speech »
Bush gave the speech on democracy in one of the few countries in the region -- the United Arab Emirates -- where democracy has been virtually ignored .
In other countries in the region , especially Egypt , the fight between democracy activists and autocratic governments has been much more pointed and controversial .
He called on the Palestinians to reject extremists , although he did not mention the Islamic radical group Hamas , which has gained control of Gaza .
And he said the Iranian government in Tehran should make itself accountable to its people .
" Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere , " Bush said .
" So the United States is strengthening our long - standing security commitments with our friends in the Gulf , and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late . "
Bush spoke at the Emirates Palace , at an opulent , gold - trimmed hotel where a suite goes for $ 2,450 a night .
Built at a cost of $ 3 billion , the hotel is a kilometer long from end to end and has a 1.3 kilometer white sand beach -- every grain of it imported from Algeria , according to Steven Pike , a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy here .
Half the audience was dressed in western attire and the other half in Arabic clothes -- white robes and headdresses for men and black abayas , many with jeweled edges , for women .
Bush said advancing democracy and freedom is the core of his administration 's foreign policy and critical to U.S. security .
" The United States has no desire for territory .
We seek our shared security in your liberty .
We believe that stability can only come through a free and just Middle East where the extremists are marginalized , " the president said .
He noted democratic reform in Iraq .
" You have made your choice for democracy and have stood firm , " Bush said , speaking to the Iraqi people .
" The terrorists and extremists cannot prevail . "
Watch report on the state of democracy in the United Arab Emirates . »
Making an equally direct appeal to the Palestinians , Bush said " The dignity and sovereignty that is your right is within your reach . "
In renewing his " Freedom Agenda " -- Bush 's grand ambition to seed democracy around the globe -- he declared that " democracy is the only form of government that treats individuals with the dignity and equality that is their right . "
" We know from experience that democracy is the only system of government that yields lasting peace and stability , " he added .
Yet he was speaking about democracy in a deeply undemocratic country , the Emirates , where an elite of royal rulers makes virtually all the decisions .
Large numbers of foreign resident workers have few legal or human rights , including no right to citizenship and no right to protest working conditions .
Some human rights groups have accused the Emirates of tolerating virtual indentured servitude , where workers from poor countries like Sri Lanka are forced to work to pay off debts to employers , and have their passports seized so they can't leave .
Officials in Abu Dhabi and the neighboring emirate of Dubai have said they are taking slow and gradual steps toward reform , both democratic and in labor rights .
In the country 's first - ever elections in late 2006 , the government hand - picked a group of voters to cast ballots to choose members of a government advisory panel .
But there is little clamor for elections in a wealthy country whose citizens are a privileged minority with access to free housing and lucrative government jobs .
Many here say the galloping economy is evidence the government has done a good job .
Earlier Sunday in Bahrain , U.S. Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff , commander of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet , which patrols the Gulf , told Bush that he took it " deadly seriously " when an Iranian fleet of high - speed boats on January 6 charged at and threatened to blow up a three - ship U.S. Navy convoy passing near Iranian waters .
The Iranian naval forces vanished as the American ship commanders were preparing to open fire .
Bush spoke with Cosgriff after he had a breakfast of pancakes and bacon with troops of the U.S. 5th Fleet based in Bahrain .
In visits over three days in Kuwait , Bahrain and Abu Dhabi , Bush also was urging continued and visible Arab support for fragile peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Arab backing , and probably funding , is considered essential to make any agreement stick .

Scientists used a supercomputer - driven “ virtual earthquake ” to explore likely ground shaking in a magnitude 9.0 megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest .
Peak ground velocities are displayed in yellow and red .
The legend represents speed in meters per second ( m /s ) with red equaling 2.3 m/s .
Although the largest ground motions occur offshore near the fault and decrease eastward , sedimentary basins lying beneath some cities amplify the shaking in Seattle , Tacoma , Olympia , and Vancouver , increasing the risk of damage .
Credit : Kim Olsen , SDSU
On January 26 , 1700 , at about 9 p.m. local time , the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the ocean in the Pacific Northwest suddenly moved , slipping some 60 feet eastward beneath the North American plate in a monster quake of approximately magnitude 9 , setting in motion large tsunamis that struck the coast of North America and traveled to the shores of Japan .
Since then , the earth beneath the region – which includes the cities of Vancouver , Seattle and Portland -- has been relatively quiet .
But scientists believe that earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 8 , so - called “ megathrust events , ” occur along this fault on average every 400 to 500 years .
To help prepare for the next megathrust earthquake , a team of researchers led by seismologist Kim Olsen of San Diego State University ( SDSU ) used a supercomputer - powered “ virtual earthquake ” program to calculate for the first time realistic three - dimensional simulations that describe the possible impacts of megathrust quakes on the Pacific Northwest region .
Also participating in the study were researchers from the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego and the U.S. Geological Survey .
What the scientists learned from this simulation is not reassuring , as reported in the Journal of Seismology , particularly for residents of downtown Seattle .
With a rupture scenario beginning in the north and propagating toward the south along the 600 - mile long Cascadia Subduction Zone , the ground moved about 1 ½ feet per second in Seattle ; nearly 6 inches per second in Tacoma , Olympia and Vancouver ; and 3 inches in Portland , Oregon .
Additional simulations , especially of earthquakes that begin in the southern part of the rupture zone , suggest that the ground motion under some conditions can be up to twice as large .
“ We also found that these high ground velocities were accompanied by significant low - frequency shaking , like what you feel in a roller coaster , that lasted as long as five minutes – and that ’s a long time , ” said Olsen .
The long - duration shaking , combined with high ground velocities , raises the possibility that such an earthquake could inflict major damage on metropolitan areas -- especially on high - rise buildings in downtown Seattle .
Compounding the risks , like Los Angeles to the south , Seattle , Tacoma , and Olympia sit on top of sediment - filled geological basins that are prone to greatly amplifying the waves generated by major earthquakes .
“ One thing these studies will hopefully do is to raise awareness of the possibility of megathrust earthquakes happening at any given time in the Pacific Northwest , ” said Olsen .
“ Because these events will tend to occur several hundred kilometers from major cities , the study also implies that the region could benefit from an early warning system that can allow time for protective actions before the brunt of the shaking starts . ”
Depending on how far the earthquake is from a city , early warning systems could give from a few seconds to a few tens of seconds to implement measures , such as automatically stopping trains and elevators .
Added Olsen , “ The information from these simulations can also play a role in research into the hazards posed by large tsunamis , which can originate from such megathrust earthquakes like the ones generated in the 2004 Sumatra - Andeman earthquake in Indonesia . ”
One of the largest earthquakes ever recorded , the magnitude 9.2 Sumatra - Andeman event was felt as far away as Bangladesh , India , and Malaysia , and triggered devastating tsunamis that killed more than 200,000 people .
In addition to increasing scientific understanding of these massive earthquakes , the results of the simulations can also be used to guide emergency planners , to improve building codes , and help engineers design safer structures -- potentially saving lives and property in this region of some 9 million people .
Even with the large supercomputing and data resources at SDSC , creating “ virtual earthquakes ” is a daunting task .
The computations to prepare initial conditions were carried out on SDSC ’s DataStar supercomputer , and then the resulting information was transferred for the main simulations to the center ’s Blue Gene Data supercomputer via SDSC ’s advanced virtual file system or GPFS - WAN , which makes data seamlessly available on different – sometimes distant – supercomputers .
Coordinating the simulations required a complex choreography of moving information into and out of the supercomputer as Olsen ’s sophisticated “ Anelastic Wave Model ” simulation code was running .
Completing just one of several simulations , running on 2,000 supercomputer processors , required some 80,000 processor hours – equal to running one program continuously on your PC for more than 9 years !
“ To solve the new challenges that arise when researchers need to run their codes at the largest scales , and data sets grow to great size , we worked closely with the earthquake scientists through several years of code optimization and modifications , ” said SDSC computational scientist Yifeng Cui , who contributed numerous refinements to allow the computer model to “ scale up ” to capture a magnitude 9 earthquake over such a vast area .
In order to run the simulations , the scientists must recreate in their model the components that encompass all the important aspects of the earthquake .
One component is an accurate representation of the earth ’s subsurface layering , and how its structure will bend , reflect , and change the size and direction of the traveling earthquake waves .
Co-author William Stephenson of the USGS worked with Olsen and Andreas Geisselmeyer , from Ulm University in Germany , to create the first unified “ velocity model ” of the layering for this entire region , extending from British Columbia to Northern California .
Another component is a model of the earthquake source from the slipping of the Juan de Fuca plate underneath the North American plate .
Making use of the extensive measurements of the massive 2004 Sumatra - Andeman earthquake in Indonesia , the scientists developed a model of the earthquake source for similar megathrust earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest .
The sheer physical size of the region in the study was also challenging .
The scientists included in their virtual model an immense slab of the earth more than 650 miles long by 340 miles by 30 miles deep -- more than 7 million cubic miles -- and used a computer mesh spacing of 250 meters to divide the volume into some 2 billion cubes .
This mesh size allows the simulations to model frequencies up to 0.5 Hertz , which especially affect tall buildings .
“ One of the strengths of an earthquake simulation model is that it lets us run scenarios of different earthquakes to explore how they may affect ground motion , ” said Olsen .
Because the accumulated stresses or “ slip deficit ” can be released in either one large event or several smaller events , the scientists ran scenarios for earthquakes of different sizes .
“ We found that the magnitude 9 scenarios generate peak ground velocities five to 10 times larger than those from the smaller magnitude 8.5 quakes . ”
The researchers are planning to conduct additional simulations to explore the range of impacts that depend on where the earthquake starts , the direction of travel of the rupture along the fault , and other factors that can vary .

People across the western hemisphere may be surprised to see a rust - coloured Moon in the sky on 21 February .
Early that morning ( the evening of the 20 February for observers in North and South America ) will be this year ’s first and only total eclipse of the Moon .
In a total lunar eclipse , the Earth , Sun and Moon are almost exactly in line and the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun .
The Moon is full , moves into the shadow of the Earth and dims dramatically but usually remains visible , lit by sunlight that passes through the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Stronger atmospheric scattering of blue light means that the light that reaches the lunar surface is predominantly red in colour so observers on Earth see a Moon that may be brick - coloured , rusty , blood red or sometimes dark grey , depending on terrestrial conditions .
The Moon travels to a similar position every month , but the tilt of the lunar orbit means that it normally passes above or below the terrestrial shadow .
A Full Moon is seen but no eclipse takes place .
Lunar eclipses are visible wherever the Moon is above the horizon .
The whole of this eclipse will be visible from northwest Africa , Western Europe including the British Isles , the eastern half of North America and the whole of South America .
Depending on their location , sky watchers just outside these regions should be able to see at least part of the eclipse too .
In the UK night owls and early risers will both have a chance to watch the eclipse .
It begins at 0035 GMT when the Moon enters the lightest part of the Earth ’s shadow , the penumbra .
Soon after the Moon will have a slight yellowish hue .
At 0142 GMT the Moon starts to enter the dark core of the Earth ’s shadow , the umbra .
At 0301 GMT the Moon will be completely within the umbra – the ‘ total ’ part of the eclipse has begun .
This is the time when it should have an obvious red colour .
Mid-eclipse is at 0326 GMT and the total phase ends at 0352 GMT .
At 0509 GMT the Moon leaves the umbra and the eclipse ends when the Moon leaves the penumbra at 0617 GMT .
During the eclipse the Moon lies in front of the stars of the constellation of Leo .
On the right of the Moon will be the bright star Regulus and on the left will be the planet Saturn .
The lunar eclipse promises to be a spectacular sight and unlike the solar equivalent , the whole event is quite safe to watch and needs no special equipment .
Missing almost entirely from news coverage of the destroyed CIA tapes is the explosive fact that they involve Jose Padilla , the American citizen held incommunicado and without charges or a trial for nearly four years .
The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution , the " Bill of Rights " states : " In all criminal prosecutions , the accused , shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State . "
On May 8th , 2002 , the government seized Padilla on American soil on allegations , but not formal charges , of terrorism .
George Bush ordered the military to take custody of Padilla as an " enemy combatant " in the June 9 , 2002 Presidential Order to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , which said :
" I , GEORGE W. BUSH , as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the U.S. armed forces , hereby DETERMINE for the United States of America that ... Jose Padilla , who is under the control of the Department of Justice and who is a U.S. citizen , is , and at the time he entered the United States in May 2002 was , an enemy combatant ... you are directed to receive Mr. Padilla from the Department of Justice and to detain him as an enemy combatant . "
In military detention , Padilla was made to sleep on a metal cot , subjected to hooding , stress positions , assaults , threats of imminent execution , and the administration of “ truth serums , ” according to his lawyer .
Padilla was not even allowed a lawyer until two years after his arrest .
When the government released him to the civilian courts 3 - and - a - half years later , Padilla was docile , and did little to assist in his own defense .
The charges against him bore no resemblance to the original allegations .
The CIA's DI Disgrace By Robert Parry
July 13 , 2004 T o understand why the Central Intelligence Agencys Directorate of Intelligence  or DI  failed so miserably to analyze the evidence on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction , one has to look back almost a quarter century to when ideological conservatives decided to deconstruct the DIs tradition of objective analysis .
In the heady days after Ronald Reagans victory in 1980 , conservatives took dead aim at the CIAs analytical division for not agreeing with the Rights preferred assessment that the Soviet Union was a rising superpower with both the capability and intent to overwhelm the United States militarily .
The incoming Reagan administration wanted an alarmist assessment of the Soviet Union to justify a major arms buildup .
But the CIA analysts didnt buy into the Rights theory of Moscow as a 10 - foot tall ogre directing world terrorism , planning a first - strike nuclear attack and provoking conflict in Central America and the Third World to isolate and ultimately defeat the United States .
The CIAs view of the Soviet Union was of a difficult enemy , but one with weaknesses , vulnerabilities and limited ambitions  a nuanced view that would not fit with the new eras  Evil Empire rhetoric .
Softened Up
So the DI  at least as it had existed since the CIAs founding in 1947  had to be taken apart .
The task of softening up the DI fell to a Reagan - Bush transition team of conservatives and neoconservatives .
 That the Reaganites saw their arrival as a hostile takeover was apparent in the most extraordinary transition period of my career ,  recalled CIA officer Robert Gates , himself an anti-Soviet hardliner who would become a key assistant to Reagans CIA Director William Casey .
 For the first time in decades , an incoming President orchestrated a comprehensive battle plan to seize control of a city long believed to be in enemy hands ,  Gates wrote in his memoirs , From the Shadows .
 Main force political units , flanking maneuvers , feints , sappers , and psychological warfare all played their part as Reagan and company between November and January deployed their forces for a political blitzkrieg .
During the transition , every department and agency became a political and ideological battlefield .
That was especially true of the CIAs analytical division .
In a scalding assessment of the CIAs Soviet analysis , the transition team accused the DI of an abject failure to foresee a supposedly massive Soviet buildup of strategic weapons and  the wholesale failure to comprehend the sophistication of Soviet propaganda .
The transition report even questioned the patriotism of the career analysts who supposedly had underestimated the Soviet commitment to world domination .
" These failures are of such enormity , " the transition report said , " that they cannot help but suggest to any objective observer that the agency itself is compromised to an unprecedented extent and that its paralysis is attributable to causes more sinister than incompetence . "
[ For details , see Mark Perry 's Eclipse . ]
This head - on assault against the CIAs analytical division set the stage for its later retreats .
 The reaction inside the Agency to this litany of failure and incompetence from the transition team , Gates wrote , was a mix of resentment and anger , dread and personal insecurity .
Amid rumors that the transition team wanted to purge several hundred top analysts , career officials feared for their jobs , especially those considered responsible for assessing the Soviet Union as a struggling power often seeking to avoid confrontation and eager for détente with the United States .
Once Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush took office and Casey arrived at the CIA , the war over intelligence broke out in earnest .
The first pitched battle came over an analysis of the Soviet Unions support for international terrorism .
It had become an article of faith among the Reagan - Bush newcomers that Moscow was supporting international terror groups as a way to destabilize the West in general and the United States in particular .
Conservative author Claire Sterling was making this case in her book , The Terror Network  and the foreign policy principals of the Reagan - Bush administration were fans of Sterlings hypothesis .
 The day after Reagan 's inauguration , Secretary of State Alexander Haig , believing that Moscow had tried to assassinate him in Europe where he served as Supreme Allied Commander , linked the Soviet Union to all acts of international terrorism ,  wrote Melvin Goodman , then - chief of the CIAs office for Soviet analysis .
 There was no evidence to support such a charge but Casey had read Claire Sterling 's The Terror Network and , like Haig , was convinced that a Soviet conspiracy was behind global terrorism .
[ Foreign Policy , Summer 1997 ] CIA analysts had a secret reason for doubting Sterlings theories , however .
 Specialists at CIA dismissed the book , knowing that much of it was based on CIA black propaganda ,  anticommunist allegations planted in the European press ,  Goodman wrote .
 But Casey contemptuously told CIA analysts that he had learned more from Sterling than from all of them . 
Unlucky Analyst Carolyn McGiffert Ekedahl of the CIAs Soviet office was the unfortunate analyst who was handed the assignment to prepare the analysis on Soviet support for terrorism .
 Because of the importance of the request and the volatility of the issue , exceedingly high priority was given to collecting and evaluating all available information dealing with Soviet involvement , direct and indirect , to any group dealing in terrorist activities ,  Ekedahl testified later before the Senate Intelligence Committee .
 We discarded no piece of evidence and , when I wrote the draft , I included an annex with all the evidence , good and bad , carefully described and explained .
[ See Nomination of Robert M. Gates , Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate , Volume III . ]
Contrary to Sterlings allegations , Ekedahl said the consensus of the intelligence community was that the Soviets discouraged acts of terrorism by groups getting support from Moscow for practical , not moral , reasons .
 We agreed that the Soviets consistently stated , publicly and privately , that they considered international terrorist activities counterproductive and advised groups they supported not to use such tactics ,  Ekedahl said .
 We had hard evidence to support this conclusion . 
Still , the CIA analysis noted that the Soviets did provide assistance to revolutionary or resistance groups , such as the Yasir Arafats Palestine Liberation Organization and Nelson Mandelas African National Congress .
The PLO was challenging Israels occupation of the West Bank and Gaza , while the ANC was resisting the white supremacist government of South Africa .
Both the PLO and the ANC were accused of employing terrorist tactics in their struggles , though their organizations also represented the aspirations of broader popular movements .
 We reported that we had found no persuasive evidence of Soviet support for those European terrorist groups ( the IRA , the Red Brigades and the Red Army Faction ) about which Secretary Haig had specifically asked ,  Ekedahl said about the analytical divisions draft of its intelligence estimate .
Ekedahl said Gates , then an assistant to Casey , was dissatisfied with the analysis and joined in rewriting the draft to suggest greater Soviet support for terrorism .
In his memoirs , Gates denied politicizing the CIAs intelligence product while acknowledging that he was aware of Caseys hostile reaction to the analysts  disagreement with Sterling s theory .
 The first draft by the analysts proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Haig had exaggerated the Soviet role  that the Soviets did not organize or direct international terrorism ,  Gates wrote in From the Shadows .
But Casey was mad , telling the division chiefs that he was greatly disappointed  with the report and vowing not to pass the analysis on to senior officials , Gates wrote .
Casey believed the CIA analysts were too wedded to solid evidence while the director felt  the practical judgments on which policy is based in the real world do not require that standard of proof , which is frequently just not available ,  Gates wrote .
Casey denigrated the Soviet analysts as deficient in intellectual and semantic rigor and too reliant on Soviet statements .
Casey then assigned the terrorism project to a new group of analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency .
 All the DIA analysts who had been involved originally had been replaced by people new to the subject who insisted on language emphasizing Soviet control of international terrorist activities ,  Ekedahl said .
 The second draft , completed on April 8 , asserted that the Soviet Union was directly supporting and controlling most international terrorist activity .
Casey liked the draft .
Hidden Battle A donnybrook ensued inside the U.S. intelligence community .
Some senior officials responsible for analysis fought back against Caseys dictates , warning that the revised draft would undermine the integrity of the process that had been used for decades to analyze intelligence .
Casey agreed to permit some modifications of his favored analysis , but senior CIA officials accepted the bureaucratic reality that the revision was being done under constraints ,  Ekedahl said .
 I was the only one of the original group of analysts who attended the coordination meetings on the third draft ,  Ekedahl said .
 I was told that I could not speak unless I were asked a direct question ,  a restriction that Ekedahl said she violated a few times when she observed serious misuse of operational material .
To finesse the divergent analytical positions on Soviet responsibility for worldwide terrorism , the revised draft widened the scope of the analysis .
The new approach merged concerns about Soviet support for revolutionary movements with questions about terrorism .
By conflating the two issues , the report found the Soviets guilty of aiding terrorism by backing revolutionary groups .
Ekedahl said she viewed this approach as misleading  and joined with her division chief , Melvin Goodman , in writing a memo to Casey that protested  the convoluted nature of the estimate and its implicit support for conclusions that could not be supported by the evidence .
But the protest had no effect , except perhaps to harden Caseys determination to bring the CIAs analytical division under control .
Casey , the wily old spymaster , realized he needed to find a way to outflank the old guard of traditional analysts and crush their resistance .
 With its emphasis on coordination , institutional independence and analytical objectivity , the process was not sufficiently responsive to Caseys interests ,  Ekedahl said .
Elevating Gates Working with Gates , Casey undertook a series of institutional changes that gave him fuller control of the analytical process .
He required that drafts needed clearance from his office before they could go out to other intelligence agencies .
Casey also appointed Gates to be director of the DI and consolidated Gatess control over analysis by also making him chairman of the National Intelligence Council , another key analytical body .
 Casey and Gates used various management tactics to get the line of intelligence they desired and to suppress unwanted intelligence ,  Ekedahl said .
 The latter is relatively simple because a given report or estimate can be dismissed on a variety of grounds ( insufficient evidence , irrelevance , poor analysis , etc. ) not clearly traceable to politicization .
The tradition of expressing opposition in footnotes also suffered .
 During the period of Gatess tenure , the DI [ the analytical division ] was effectively prevented from dissenting when its analysts disagreed with estimates of interest to Casey / Gates ,  Ekedahl said .
With Gates using top - down management techniques , CIA analysts sensitive to their career paths intuitively grasped that they could rarely go wrong by backing the company line  and presenting the worst - case scenario about Soviet capabilities and intentions , Ekedahl and other CIA analysts said .
 Replacing experts with people willing to cooperate became a central element in the Casey - Gates approach to intelligence management ,  Ekedahl said .
 Whereas the pre-Gates ethic emphasized analytic independence and objectivity , the new culture is that of the hired pen ,  loyal to the current leadership and its views .
Whereas intelligence production should be based on informed and objective analysis of the available evidence , in the Gatess culture it is based on the anticipated reaction of senior managers and officials . 
[ Ekedahl left the Office of Soviet Analysis in September 1985 because of issues involving politicization ,  she said . ]
Junior Analysts Mel Goodman , the chief of the Soviet analysis office in the early 1980s , said the clash over Soviet support for terrorism began a period of career retribution against out - of - step analysts .
 Junior analysts became responsible for analysis on Soviet domestic and foreign policy as senior analysts sought other positions inside the intelligence community and elsewhere ,  Goodman told the Senate Intelligence Committee a decade later .
Over a period of a few years in the early 1980s , the CIAs proud Soviet analytical office underwent a purge of its most senior people .
 Nearly every senior analyst on Soviet foreign policy eventually left the Office of Soviet Analysis ,  Goodman said .
 The picture for Soviet domestic policy is similar , with the departure of most senior analysts and the introduction of managers with virtually no experience in Soviet domestic politics . 
Another management strategy used to assert control was a restructuring of the analytical division , which had traditionally functioned along disciplinary lines  economics , politics , military and technical analysis  rather than within geographical areas .
That changed in September 1981 when the old subject - area offices were abolished and were replaced with new ones structured along geographic lines , a change that allowed wholesale removal of senior management personnel .
 The ripping off of the mask of the plan was when all the Directorate of Intelligence office chiefs were invited to go to an off - site conference over the weekend ,  recalled Peter Dickson , an analyst who concentrated on proliferation issues .
 When they came back the offices didnt exist anymore .
The offices were abolished out from under them . 
Dickson told me that the significance of the structural change became apparent at the start of 1982 when Casey promoted the boyish - looking Gates to run the analytical division .
 The structure was changed to give Bobby Gates a blank slate to create his own DI , and that was , in effect , what happened ; he was able to pick a whole new set of cadre , chiefs , and they were beholden to him ,  Dickson said in an interview .
 You had an awesome regime change in the Directorate of Intelligence with that act . 
Gatess rise under Casey was considered meteoric .
Though entering the CIA as an analyst , Gates spent a relatively short time at the Langley - based spy agency .
He followed an unusual career path that involved two stints on the National Security Council staff where he operated within a more political environment than most CIA professionals experienced .
Because of his White House tours , Gates would say that he understood the shortcomings of the CIA product because he had viewed the process through the eyes of the consumers  of intelligence , not just the producers .
 Clones  Gates soon was salting the analytical division with his allies , a group of managers who became known as the " Gates clones . "
Some of those who rose with Gates were David Cohen , David Carey , George Kolt , Jim Lynch , Winston Wiley , John Gannon and John McLaughlin ( the CIA 's current acting director ) .
Along with the new structure and new management team , Gates made clear he intended to shake up the DIs culture , demanding greater responsiveness to the needs of the White House and other policymakers .
In a speech to the DIs analysts and managers on Jan. 7 , 1982 , Gates berated the division for producing shoddy analysis that administration officials didnt find helpful .
Gates said the weaknesses included analysis that was irrelevant or untimely or unfocused or all three ; close - minded , smug , arrogant responses to legitimate questions and constructive criticisms ; flabby , complacent thinking and questionable assumptions combined with an intolerance of others  views , both in and out of the CIA ; poor , verbose writing ; a pronounced tendency to confuse objectivity  and independence with avoidance of issues germane to the U.S. government and policymakers . 
Gates also endorsed some of the criticisms of the CIA that conservatives had raised .
 We significantly misjudged the percentage of Soviet GNP allocated to defense ,  Gates said .
 We ignored Soviet interest in terrorism . 
Gates unveiled an 11 - point management plan to whip the DI into shape .
His plan included rotating division chiefs through one - year stints in policy agencies and requiring CIA analysts to refresh their substantive knowledge and broaden their perspective by taking courses at Washington - area think tanks and universities .
He declared that a new Production Evaluation Staff would aggressively review their analytical products and serve as his  junkyard dog . 
Gatess message was that the DI , which had long operated as an ivory tower for academically oriented analysts committed to an ethos of objectivity , would take on more of a corporate culture with a product designed to fit the needs of those up the ladder both inside and outside the CIA .
 Chilling 
 It was a kind of chilling speech ,  recalled Dickson .
 I remember people coming back from it who were more senior than I who went down to listen to it .
One of the things he wanted to do , he was going to shake up the DI .
He was going to read every paper that came out .
What that did was that everybody between the analyst and him had to get involved in the paper to a greater extent because their careers were going to be at stake .
He was saying he didnt trust anyone .
Hes the top guy and hes going to review all the papers .
And he made an effort to do that .
It had a chilling effect . 
A chief Casey - Gates tactic for exerting tighter control over the analytical process was to express concern about  the editorial process ,  Dickson said .
 You can jerk people around in the editorial process and hide behind your editorial mandate to intimidate people ,  Dickson said .
Gates created an increasingly layered process which wore down people .
The effect of that was a gradual process of intimidation .
It got very nasty , very Darwinian .
There was a weeding out process of people who could stand up and defend positions .
There was a grinding down of the independent mind of the analysts .
In describing this corporate - style takeover of the CIAs analytical division , Dickson compared Casey to the corporate raider , Gordon Gecko , in the movie  Wall Street ,  with Gates serving as his protégé , Bud Fox .
 People who dont know this history dont understand what happened to people who work inside the business and why the culture changed ,  Dickson said .
Though Dicksons area of expertise  nuclear proliferation  was on the fringes of the Reagan - Bush primary concerns , it ended up getting him into trouble , anyway .
In 1983 , he clashed with his superiors over his conclusion that the Soviet Union was more committed to controlling proliferation of nuclear weapons than the administration wanted to hear .
Dicksons CIA superiors didnt want to give the Soviets any credit for demonstrating caution on the nuclear technology front .
When Dickson stood by his evidence , he soon found himself facing accusations about his psychological fitness and other pressures that eventually caused him to leave the CIA .
Dickson also was among the analysts who raised alarms about Pakistans development of nuclear weapons , another sore point because the Reagan - Bush administration wanted Pakistans assistance in funneling weapons to Islamic fundamentalists fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan .
One of the effects from the exaggerated intelligence about Soviet power and intentions was to make other potential risks  such as allowing development of a nuclear bomb in the Islamic world or training Islamic fundamentalists in techniques of sabotage  pale in comparison .
While worst - case scenarios were in order for the Soviet Union and other communist enemies , best - case scenarios were the order of the day for Reagan - Bush allies , which at that time included Osama bin Laden and other Arab extremists rushing to Afghanistan to wage a holy war against European invaders , in this case , the Russians .
As for the Pakistani drive to get a nuclear bomb , the Reagan - Bush administration turned to word games to avoid triggering anti-proliferation penalties that otherwise would be imposed on Pakistan .
 There was a distinction made to say that the possession of the device is not the same as developing it ,  Dickson said in an interview .
 They got into the argument that they dont quite possess it yet because they havent turned the last screw into the warhead .
As long as they havent done that , they dont possess it yet .
So the aid could continue .
No matter how you look at that there was a subordination of intelligence to a policy to aid the Afghan rebels no matter what .
Finally , the intelligence on the Pakistan Bomb grew too strong to continue denying the reality .
But the delay in confronting Pakistan ultimately allowed the Muslim government in Islamabad to succeed in developing nuclear weapons .
Pakistani scientists also shared their know - how with other rogue states , such as North Korea and Libya .
Cooking the Books
As the Reagan - Bush administration settled in , the CIAs analytical division came under ever - increasing pressure to comply with Ronald Reagans  Evil Empire rhetoric .
In one case , the Reagan administration pressed the CIA to accept right - wing allegations that the Soviet KGB was behind the May 13 , 1981 , assassination attempt against Pope John - Paul II .
The attack had been carried out by a Turkish neo -Nazi named Mehmet Ali Agca , but Sterling and other conservative writers built the case against the KGB , in part , because Agca had traveled through Bulgaria and because the Soviet motive was supposedly the Popes symbolic value to the Polish Solidarity movement .
Standing up against the KGB - Pope - assassination conspiracy theory brought the CIA analysts in for another round of pummeling from the Right for supposedly going soft again on the Soviet Union .
Even hardliner Gates marveled at the intensity of the criticism .
 Some accused us of trying to cover up the Soviet role , though why we  and especially Casey  would do such a thing I never grasped ,  Gates wrote in his memoirs .
When conservatives continued to complain about the CIA 's supposed failure to pin the 1981 papal assassination plot on Moscow , Casey and his team decided to cook the intelligence books with a special review of the issue in 1985 , Goodman said ..
 Earlier CIA assessments  and Gates 's testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1983  had concluded that Moscow had no role in the papal plot , and senior officials of the directorate of operations informed both Casey and Gates that Moscow had stopped political assassination and that strong evidence indicated neither the Soviets nor the Bulgarians were involved ,  Goodman wrote in Foreign Policy magazine [ Summer 1997 ] .
But Casey was determined to undermine Secretary of State George Shultzs diplomatic overtures to Moscow and thus commissioned a special paper alleging a connection to the shooting of the Pope , Goodman wrote .
 Gates made sure that CIA analysts worked in camera to prevent proper vetting and coordination of the assessment ,  Goodman recalled .
 Indeed ,  Agca 's Attempt to Kill the Pope : The Case for Soviet Involvement  read like a novelist 's fantasy of communist conspiracy , but Gates 's covering note to the president and the vice - president described the report as a comprehensive examination that we feel able to present . . . with some confidence .
With the 1985 report on the papal assassination plot , Goodman wrote that the CIAs politicization of intelligence on the Soviet Union hit rock bottom .
Pressure Though Gates has consistently denied politicizing  the CIA , he acknowledged that Casey did put pressure on analysts , especially when they were working on a subject matter dear to his heart , such as the Soviet threat .
 Casey complained bitterly and often graphically when the analysis he got seemed fuzzy - minded , lacked concreteness , missed the point , or in his view was naïve about the real world , when it lacked ground truth ,  Gates wrote .
 At the same time , while he had strong views , he was willing to change his mind ( or to learn ) when presented with good evidence or a cogent argument .
However , an analyst had to be tough and have the courage of his or her convictions to challenge Casey on something he cared about and knew about .
He argued , he fought , he yelled , he grumped with the analysts in person and on paper .
He pulled no punches .
Some thrived on it .
Many were put off by his abrasiveness , his occasional bullying manner .
In the trenches at the CIA , however , Caseys bluster often was amplified by the new senior managers who had risen to power under Casey and Gates , according to several CIA analysts whom I interviewed .
Some analysts were verbally berated until they agreed to change their findings ; some faced job threats ; others experienced confrontations with supervisors who literally threw papers around the office and sometimes into the analysts ' faces .
The scars left on the CIAs tradition of objective analysis ran deep and affected later intelligence failures , the analysts said .
 The politicization that took place during the Casey - Gates era is directly responsible for the CIAs loss of its ethical compass and the erosion of its credibility ,  said Mel Goodman in his Senate testimony in 1991 .
 The fact that the CIA missed the most important historical development in its history  the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the Soviet Union itself  is due in large measure to the culture and process that Gates established in his directorate .
In Goodmans view , the failure to notice the decline and the disintegration of the Soviet Union can be traced directly to the Gates - Casey intervention in the analytical process .
 They systematically created an agency view of the Soviet Union that overemphasized the Soviet threat , ignored Soviet vulnerabilities and weaknesses ,  said Goodman , who served as a senior CIA analyst on Soviet policy from 1966 to 1986 .
The evidence of the accelerating pace of Moscows economic decline was emerging by the mid-1970s and was cited in the work of economists , such as Sweden 's Anders Aslund .
Academic analysts and businessmen who visited the Soviet Union also observed its backwardness , especially in crucial areas of technological development and production of consumer goods , but the CIA was mostly blind to these historic developments .
CIA estimates on the Soviet Union were dead wrong on the size and performance of the economy and the military burden ,  Goodman wrote .
CIA analysis described an economy that could expand and at the same time allow greater military expansion , which had a direct impact on the justification for U.S. defense spending .
In other words , the CIA did n't miss the collapse of the Soviet Union as much as its analytical division had been trained -- like Pavlovian dogs -- to avoid noticing signs of Soviet decline .
By the late 1980s , with fewer and fewer exceptions , CIA analysts had learned to respond to a harsh rewards - and - punishment system that benefited analysts who would present the scariest picture of Soviet power .
Clintons Missed Chance
The question of politicization at the CIA cropped up briefly as a national issue in 1991 when President George H.W. Bush appointed Robert Gates to be CIA director .
In a break with tradition , CIA analysts stepped out of the shadows and testified openly before the Senate Intelligence Committee against Bushs choice .
Led by Soviet specialist Goodman , the CIA dissidents fingered Gates as a key politicization culprit .
Their testimony added to doubts about Gates , who was already under a cloud for dubious testimony he had given on the Iran - Contra scandal and allegations that he had played a role in a covert scheme to assist Saddam Husseins Iraq .
But the elder George Bush lined up solid Republican backing for Gates and enough accommodating Democrats  particularly Sen.
David Boren of Oklahoma , the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman  to push Gates through .
( Borens key staff aide who helped limit the investigation of Gates was George Tenet , whose behind - the - scenes maneuvering on Gatess behalf won the personal appreciation of the senior George Bush .
Those political chits would serve Tenet well a decade later when the younger George Bush protected Tenet as his own CIA director , even after the intelligence failure of September 11 , 2001 , and revelations about faulty intelligence on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction .
Tenet would finally resign in July 2004 amid a growing scandal over the WMD evidence . )
Amid the triumphalism of the post - Cold War period in the early 1990s , however , U.S. policymakers werent inclined to demand major reforms of the CIA , despite its failure to give policymakers much warning about the collapse of the Soviet Union .
There was a brief window for reform with Bill Clintons election in 1992 .
Former CIA analyst Peter Dickson was among the CIA veterans to put the politicization issue before Clintons incoming national security team .
Dickson sent a two - page memo , dated Dec. 10 , 1992 , to Samuel  Sandy  Berger , a top Clinton national security aide .
Dickson urged Clinton to appoint a new CIA director who understood  the deeper internal problems relating to the politicization of intelligence and the festering morale problem within the CIA . 
In calling for a housecleaning , Dickson wrote ,  This problem of intellectual corruption will not disappear overnight , even with vigorous remedial action .
However , the new CIA director will be wise if he realizes from the start the dangers in relying on advice of senior CIA office managers who during the past 12 years advanced and prospered in their careers precisely because they had no qualms about suppressing intelligence or slanting analysis to suit the interest of Casey and Gates .
This is a deep systemic problem . 
But the appeals from Dickson and other CIA veterans were largely ignored by Clinton and his top aides , who were more interested in turning around the U.S. economy and enacting some modest social programs .
The Clinton didnt want to refight the battles of the 1980s ,  a senior Democrat told me .
Although Gates was removed as CIA director , Clinton appointed James Woolsey , a neoconservative Democrat who had worked closely with the Reagan - Bush administrations .
One well - placed Democratic source said the incoming Clinton team defended the choice of Woolsey as a reward to some neoconservative Democrats at the New Republic and elsewhere who had split from George H.W. Bush and lent their support to Clinton .
Under Woolsey and Clintons subsequent CIA directors , the Gates team sans Gates remained in top management positions and consolidated its bureaucratic power .
The old ideal of intelligence analysis free from political taint was never restored .
Tenets Reign Clintons last CIA director , George Tenet , earned more gratitude from the Bush family when he presided over a ceremony in 1999 to rename the CIAs headquarters the George Bush Center for Intelligence .
 This is a great day at the Central Intelligence Agency and a great day for our CIA Family ,  Tenet gushed .
 We are deeply proud that you are part of our CIA Family .
As you know , the sense of family here is very strong . 
( Some old - time CIA analysts were troubled by the decision to put such a partisan name on the CIA , which had been created by President Harry Truman to provide impartial intelligence without political taint . )
Kept on by George W. Bush in 2001 , Tenet continued to prove himself a loyal bureaucrat to the second Bush administration .
In February 2003 , when Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the United Nations Security Council about Iraqs alleged WMD program , Tenet was prominently seated behind Powell , giving the CIAs imprimatur to Powells assertions that turned out to be a mixture of unproved assertions , exaggerations and lies .
 If one goes back to that very long presentation [ by Powell ] , point by point , one finds that this was not a very honest explanation ,  said Greg Thielmann , a former senior official in the State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research , in an interview with PBS Frontline .
 I have to conclude Secretary Powell was being a loyal secretary of state , a good soldier  as it were , building the administrations case before the international community .
Though Tenets primary responsibility should have been to the integrity of the intelligence product , he was backing up Powell in helping the administration build its case before the U.N .
In one telling example of how malleable the CIA 's analysis had become , a Defense Intelligence Agency employee , assigned to CIA headquarters , discovered that his superiors spurned his objection to Powell 's citation of " first - hand " evidence from an Iraqi defector about Iraq 's possession of mobile bioweapons labs .
After reviewing a draft of Powell 's testimony a few days before the secretary 's U.N. speech , the DIA employee questioned the " validity of the information " and doubted that it should be used " as the backbone of one of our major findings for the existence of a continuing BW [ bioweapons ] program ! "
Inside the U.S. intelligence community , there had been concern about the reliability of the defector , an Iraqi engineer code - named " Curve Ball , " who was initially debriefed by the German Federal Intelligence Service in 2000 .
When questioned by the DIA official in May 2000 , the defector arrived suffering from a hangover .
Subsequently , the Germans told the DIA official that they had misgivings about the defector and could n't make him available for additional questioning .
When the DIA official restated his doubts about including the defector 's information in Powell 's U.N. speech , the deputy chief of the CIA 's Iraq task force e-mailed back : " Let 's keep in mind the fact that this war 's going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or did n't say , and that the Powers That Be probably are n't terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he 's talking about .
However , in the interest of Truth , we owe somebody a sentence or two of warning , if you honestly have reservations . "
The e-mail exchange was included in the Senate Intelligence Committee 's July 9 , 2004 , report on the Iraqi intelligence failures .
[ Washington Post , July 13 , 2004 ]
Failed Intelligence
Only after March 2003 invasion and the failure to find stockpiles of trigger - ready WMD did the Washington debate turn to who was at fault for the shoddy intelligence that had led the nation to war .
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 25 , 2003 , Army Lt. Gen. John Abizaid offered a clue when he compared the accuracy of tactical intelligence in the Iraq war versus the faulty strategic intelligence .
 Intelligence was the most accurate that I have ever seen on the tactical level , probably the best Ive ever seen on the operational level , and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to weapons of mass destruction ,  said Abizaid , head of the U.S. Central Command which was responsible for Iraq .
In other words , the intelligence handled by lower - level military intelligence personnel was excellent .
It was the intelligence that went through the CIAs analytical division and senior levels of the Bush administration that failed .
The WMD issue , therefore , came down to two questions :
Was the CIAs intelligence analysis that bad or did the White House cherry - pick the intelligence that it wanted ?
The answer appears to have been that both points were true .
A thoroughly politicized CIA slanted the intelligence in the direction that it knew Bush wanted and the White House then trimmed off caveats the CIA may have included .
The CIAs internal complaint that it was just the victim of administration ideologues was undercut by its own analytical products , including a post- invasion report claiming that two captured Iraqi trailers were labs to produce chemical or biological weapons .
That claim has since collapsed as evidence emerged showing that the labs were for making hydrogen for artillery weather balloons .
While Tenet and other CIA officials also have noted that they objected to some bogus administration claims , such as the assertion that Iraq was seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger , those protests were mostly half - hearted and made behind closed doors .
Bush was only forced to back off the yellowcake claim , which he had cited in his State of the Union address in January 2003 , after the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that the supporting documentation was " not authentic . "
In its July 9 , 2004 , report , the Senate Intelligence Committee broadly condemned the CIAs analysis of the military threat posed by Iraq , blaming analytical group think that led the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies into a pattern of errors on Iraqs WMD program and other issues .
 A series of failures , particularly in analytic trade craft , led to the mischaracterization of intelligence ,  the committee said in a 511 - page report .
 Most of the major key judgments [ in a pivotal October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate were ] either overstated , or were not supported by , the underlying intelligence reporting .
[ NYT , July 10 , 2004 ]
While the results of the CIA 's " group think " are now apparent  in the nearly 900 U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq and in the deepening anti-U.S. sentiment around the world  the start of this path that led to the CIA 's humiliation can be found in those early days of the Reagan - Bush administration when ideology became more important than fact .

M.C. Escher : More Mathematics
Than Meets the Eye
Sara Robinson
SIAM News , Number 8 , October 2002
" Print Gallery , " by M.C. Escher .
Curious about the blank spot in the middle of Escher 's 1956 lithograph , Hendrik Lenstra set out to learn whether the artist had encountered a mathematical problem he could n't solve .

As a teenager , number theorist Hendrik Lenstra was fascinated by the mathematical themes of M.C. Escher 's artwork .
A few years later , however , he lost his early enthusiasm for the Dutch artist , finding real mathematics " much more exciting . "
Today , Lenstra is once again an Escher enthusiast .
He owns more than a dozen books about the artist , two documentary videos , and an assortment of Escher ties , and is in the process of acquiring an original print of Escher 's " Print Gallery , " a wellknown work for which Lenstra now has a particular affection .
" I came to realize that there is much more mathematics in Escher 's work than first meets the eye , " says Lenstra , who holds joint positions at the University of California , Berkeley , and the Universiteit Leiden , in the Netherlands .
Using the theory of elliptic curves , Lenstra has shown that the distortion of the quayside scene depicted in " Print Gallery " can be described by a complex exponential function .
This quirky finding has been featured in The New York Times , on Dutch television , and in several Dutch newspapers .
A Mysterious Blank Patch
Lenstra 's project began two and a half years ago on a Continental Airlines flight from New Jersey to Amsterdam .
Browsing through the airline magazine , Lenstra spotted a picture of " Print Gallery " and was struck by a seeming flaw in its construction .
The lithograph depicts a view , through a row of arching windows , of a man looking at a picture on the wall of a gallery .
In the picture , a row of Mediterranean - style buildings along a quay looms larger and larger until it extends right out of the picture frame and curves around to include the gallery and the man within it .
The picture continuously expands in scale as the eye moves clockwise about the center .
At the same time , the lines of the picture curve , as if someone had reached into the center and pulled it outward with a twist of the wrist .
But the vision is incomplete : Smack in the center of the picture is a large , circular patch that Escher left blank .
Lenstra was bothered by the apparent blemish in the otherwise consistent strucure of the picture .
With many hours still to kill on his flight , he formulated two precise mathematical questions .
" First , " he says , " I wondered if , when you try to continue the arcs and lines , there is a mathematical problem you cannot solve . "
His second question was : " What is the overall mathematical structure of this picture ? "
Readers might be surprised that Lenstra would have expected Escher 's lithograph to have a simple and consistent mathematical structure .
Although fascinated by visual mathematical concepts , Escher ( 1898 - 1972 ) had only a high school education in mathematics and little interest in its formalities .
But to Lenstra , it was immediately clear that the mathematics was there .
" It 's clear when you look at " Print Gallery " that some transformation is being used , " he says .
" And transformations belong to mathematics , so it was pretty evident that at least the question of how I , as a mathematician , would make the print , made sense . "
A few days after his arrival in Holland , Lenstra took the first step toward answering his questions .
He consulted his copy of The Magic Mirror of M.C. Escher , a book by Hans de Rijk ( written under the pen name Bruno Ernst ) .
De Rijk was a friend of Escher 's and had visited him several times during the creation of " Print Gallery . "
In the book , which was authorized and corrected by Escher , de Rijk described Escher 's method in detail .
How Did Escher Do It ?
Escher 's distorted grid .
Escher imposed a straight grid on the scene to be depicted in " Print Gallery " and then transferred the picture , one grid element at a time , to the distorted grid .
© 2002 Cordon Art B.V. , Baarn , Holland .

The effect Escher was trying to achieve , de Rijk explained , was a continuous circular expansion , " a bulge in a closed ring formation , having neither beginning nor end . "
To provide a precise framework for his technique , Escher first created his expansion on a grid of lines , making the size of the squares grow by a factor of 256 as he moved along a square loop about the center ( see illustration page two , top ) .
Then , starting with an ordinary picture of a row of buildings on a quay , including the gallery , he placed a straight grid over the picture and translated the picture from the undistorted grid to the distorted one , one grid cell at a time .
Looking at Escher 's distorted grid , pictured in de Rijk 's book , Lenstra was able to imagine what the straightened grid must have looked like .
He saw that walking along a clockwise square path about the center of the distorted grid corresponds in the straight picture to walking along a square path with ever - shortening sides , moving inward to a point where everything is smaller by a factor of 256 .
Thus , Lenstra deduced , the ordinary picture Escher started with must have the property that blowing it up or shrinking it by a factor of 256 gives the same picture again .
Mathematically speaking , the straight picture is periodic with a multiplicative period of 256 .
Lenstra calls the straight picture a " Droste picture , " after the picture on the box of the Dutch Droste - brand cocoa .
The Droste box shows a rather grim looking maid in a cap and apron , holding a Droste box , on which is a copy of the maid , and so on .
The straightened Escher picture , Lenstra saw , would have the same property .
Looking at the distorted grid again , Lenstra also saw that a counterclockwise walk along a square path about the center of the " Droste picture " would become an inward spiral in the Escher picture , ending at a point rotated a little more than 180 degrees from the starting point .
This walk corresponds to moving a constant number of squares on the distorted grid ( up then left then down then right ) circling about the center .
This creates a spiral whose endpoints are the same in the Droste picture , so they must be identified in the Escher picture as well .
The Escher picture thus has the property that rotating and shrinking it substantially gives the same picture again .
In mathematical terms , the Escher picture , too , is periodic , but its period is a complex number g rather than a real number .
Stated in another way , the Droste picture can be thought of as a function f from the non-zero complex numbers to the colors black and white with the property that f( 256z ) = f( z ) .
The Escher picture , on the other hand , is given by a function g from the non-zero complex numbers to black and white with the property that g( g z ) = g(z ) .
This realization easily resolved the question of what belongs in the center : a smaller version of the same scene , rotated until it is almost upside down and containing another copy of itself , and so on , disappearing into a singularity at the origin .
But Lenstra still wanted to compute an actual value for g , the complex period of the Escher picture .
Armed with that , he would have a mathematical formula for creating such a picture .
Working toward this end , Lenstra made some crude measurements of the rotation and expansion of the grid and found that the real part of g was somewhere between - 16 and - 19 , and the imaginary part between 5 and 6 .
This seemed to be the best he could do , until he read a key sentence in de Rijk 's description .
Escher 's first attempt at the cyclic bulge , de Rijk explained , used straight lines that gradually spread apart .
Escher was unhappy with this model , however , because the buildings and windows of the picture would be overly distorted .
Escher then curved the lines in his grid so as to ensure that " the original small squares could retain their square appearance , " de Rijk wrote .
After reading that sentence , Lenstra had a flash of insight .
" I knew exactly what was happening , " he says .
" I knew that the Escher picture must be conformal . "
As a reminder to readers who last thought about conformality in the distant past ( or who missed Philip Davis 's review of Indra 's Pearls in the September issue of SIAM News ) , a conformal map is one that locally preserves angles .
Any analytic function on the complex plane is conformal at every point where its derivative is non-zero .
Once Lenstra knew that the map was conformal , he was able to bring elliptic curve theory to bear on the problem of computing g .
This is how he did it :
Because the Escher picture is periodic with period g , it lives on C*/ g z .
Similarly , the Droste picture lives on C*/ 256z .
With logarithms to transform the underlying multiplicative groups into additive ones , the first group becomes C/ Z × log g + Z × 2 p i and the second , C/ Z × log 256 + Z × 2 p i , where the 2 p i comes from the periodicity of the exponential function in the complex plane .
Each of these structures  the complex numbers modulo a lattice  is an elliptic curve .
The key sentence in de Rijk 's book implies that these two elliptic curves must be conformally isomorphic , which means that the underlying lattices must be the same modulo rotation and scaling .
This assumption , together with Lenstra 's rough measurements , enabled Lenstra to compute g precisely , just by drawing the lattices and looking at the possibilities .
" I found it amazing that there was only one answer , " says Bart de Smit , a colleague of Lenstra 's at Leiden who is managing the Escher project .
Visual Payoff
Once he had g and thus the transformation that converts the Droste picture into the Escher , Lenstra wanted to see the visual results of his efforts .
Hoping that his formula could be used to write a computer program that would generate his own version of Escher 's picture , Lenstra explained his discovery to some students and colleagues at Leiden .
De Smit , a former student of Lenstra 's , then took over .
Transformation of the " Droste picture " ( grid at bottom left ) into a distorted picture like Escher 's " Print Gallery . "
The top two grids have a tiling symmetry , and they allow the vertical shift .
The map between them is a rotation by about 41 degrees counterclockwise and scaling by about 75 % .
The vertical transformations are the exponential map on the plane of complex numbers .
Before they could apply Lenstra 's formula , the researchers had to obtain a copy of the Droste picture ; Escher 's original studies for " Print Gallery " belong to a private collector in Connecticut and were not accessible to the group .
Joost Batenburg , a student at Leiden , used a computer program he wrote and Escher 's grid to undo the distortion , square by square .
This was the most time - consuming and laborious part of the project , but the result was indeed a straightened picture ( see sequence on page four , top left ) .
In fact , Batenburg produced a series of four , each a blow - up of the center of the previous one .
As a starting point , however , these pictures were highly unsatisfactory .
One problem was that part of Escher 's blank patch , which was a little larger than the smaller copy of the picture in the center , translated into a blank cloudy spiral obscuring part of the scene .
Moreover , because Escher 's grid was n't perfectly conformal , the Droste picture had some artistic problems :
The perspective , for instance , was off .
De Smit 's solution was to recruit an artist , Hans Richter , who completely redrew the four pictures , using Batenburg 's output as a guide ( sequence on page four , top right ) .
To combine Richter 's four frames into a single picture ( page four , bottom left ) , Batenburg took logarithms and worked in the group C/Z × log 256 + Z × 2 p i .
In this way , the multiplicative periodicity of the Escher picture turns into a doubly periodic tiling symmetry , where each of the four pictures is a translate of the others .
Thus , the four frames could be pieced together side by side .
Another advantage to working in the additive world was a workaround for a difficulty with the grayscale .
Ideally , the finished picture would have the same resolution when blown up by a factor of g , which means that the grayscale needed to become continuously denser moving toward the center .
Computers do n't allow this to be done in a straightforward way ; to produce the desired effect in the final picture , the group asked another artist , Jacqueline Hofstra , to fill in the grayscale on the tiled version .
At this point , de Smit had the logarithm of the corrected grayscaled Droste picture .
To move from C/ Z × log g + Z × 2 p i to C/Z × log 256 + Z × 2 p i , they applied Lenstra 's transformation .
Between the lattices , the transformation corresponds to rotating the first lattice by about 41 degrees and scaling it by about 75 % to obtain the second .
The final step was to apply the exponential function to this last picture , and voilà !
A new and " improved " rendition of " Print Gallery , " which can be viewed in still and animated form on the Escher Project Web site ( http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/.)
The Leiden group 's version is strikingly similar to the original .
Indeed , at first glance , the only difference seems to be that the center is filled in .
Closer examination , however , shows other differences , particularly at the outer edges , where some lines curve in the opposite direction .
Moreover , lines that should be parallel in the Escher picture are not .
This is because Escher 's design was not perfectly conformal , Lenstra says .
" The more you look at Escher , the more you find that he was not beyond cheating " to make his design work , he says .
Work in progress : the Escher Project at Universiteit Leiden .
Above left , Using a computer program and Escher 's distorted grid , Joost Batenburg undid the distortion of Escher 's picture to produce the straightened version Escher had started with .
Above right , the researchers had an artist fill in the missing patch and adjust the perspective .
Left ,
Using the logarithm function to turn the multiplicative periodicity of the Escher picture into a doubly periodic tiling symmetry , the researchers made the artist 's four frames into a single picture .
Escher : A Closet Mathematician ?
By keenly confronting the enigmas that surround us , and by considering and analysing the observations that I have made , I ended up in the domain of mathematics .
Although I am absolutely without training in the exact sciences , I often seem to have more in common with mathematicians than with my fellow artists .
 M.C. Escher ( from To Infinity and Beyond , Eli Maor )
The only remaining mystery is that of Escher himself .
Did he understand what he was doing ?
Did he leave the center blank so that he would n't have to forever repeat himself , or was he unsure of what should go there ?
Because the artist died in 1972 , this part of the puzzle will forever remain a subject of speculation .
Hans de Rijk seems certain that Escher did not know that his picture was periodic , but just had some vague sense that things got smaller in the middle and he had to stop somewhere .
In his book , de Rijk quoted an amusing passage in a letter from Escher that seems to demonstrate Escher 's ignorance of the mathematics :
" Two learned gentlemen , Professor van Dantzig and Professor van Wijngaarden , once tried in vain to convince me that I had drawn a Riemann surface .
I doubt if they are right , in spite of the fact that one of the characteristics of a surface of this kind seems to be that the center remains empty .
In any case , Riemann is completely beyond me and theoretical mathematics are even more so , not to mention non-Euclidean geometry .
So far as I was concerned it was merely a question of a cyclic expansion or bulge without beginning or end . "
Lenstra finds it hard to speculate about Escher 's thought process : " I find it most useful to identify Escher with nature and myself with a physicist that tries to model nature , " he says .
After the project was featured in The New York Times , a reader sent Lenstra his own completion of the picture , in which the spiral of buildings ends neatly at the center .
Escher would have found this " dreadful , " says Lenstra , since it was not consistent with his global idea .
Although Escher did not have a deep understanding of mathematics , it seems that his artistic vision incorporated a surprising mathematical consistency .
Bart de Smit agrees : " We made our version of Escher 's grid from a formula .
There was only one way to do it and Escher modeled it very well .
It was n't completely right but it was almost right , " he says .
" I have respect for it . "
" So do I , " says Lenstra .
The Leiden group 's version of Escher 's " Print Gallery " ; the filled in blank patch is only the most noticeable difference between the two .

Via the BPS Research Digest : A recent study on the long - term benefits of the Socratic method .
In a study of 105 children , all around 10 years old , teachers spent an hour a week for 16 months teaching lessons based on philosophical inquiry .
The philosophy - based lessons encouraged a community approach to “ inquiry ” in the classroom , with children sharing their views on Socratic questions posed by the teacher .
The result ?
At the end of 16 months ,
Compared with 72 control children , the philosophy children showed significant improvements on tests of their verbal , numerical and spatial abilities
And two years later , when the philosophy children were tested again , their higher scores persisted — while the lower - scoring control group were , in some cases , declining further .
Researchers Keith Topping and Steve Trickey point out that these gains persisted even though the kids had switched schools as well , from primary to secondary , showing that the influence of philosophical inquiry works across contexts and over time .
Or in the words of Socrates , “ If this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth , my influence is ruinous indeed . ”

Ice clouds put Mars in the shade
16/01/2008 5093 views 8 likes
Until now , Mars has generally been regarded as a desert world , where a visiting astronaut would be surprised to see clouds scudding across the orange sky .
However , new results show that the arid planet possesses high - level clouds that are sufficiently dense to cast a shadow on the surface .
The results were obtained by the OMEGA Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer instrument on board ESA ’s Mars Express .
Mars is not entirely a haven for Sun worshippers .
Clouds of water ice particles do occur , for example on the flanks of the giant Martian volcanoes .
There have also been hints of much higher , wispy clouds made up of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) ice crystals .
This is not too surprising , since the thin Martian atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide , and temperatures on the fourth planet from the Sun often plunge well below the ‘ freezing point ’ of carbon dioxide .
Now , a team of French scientists has shown that such clouds of dry ice do , indeed , exist .
Furthermore , they are sometimes so large and dense that they throw quite dark shadows on the dusty surface .
Another carbon - dioxide -ice cloud on Mars “ This is the first time that carbon dioxide ice clouds on Mars have been imaged and identified from above , ” said Franck Montmessin of the Service d’Aeronomie , University of Versailles ( UVSQ ) , lead author of the paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research .
“ This is important because the images tell us not only about their shape , but also their size and density .
“ Previously , we had to rely on indirect information – for example , from the SPICAM instrument on board Mars Express - to find out what the clouds are made of .
However , it is very difficult to separate the signals coming from the clouds , the atmosphere and the surface . ”
Data from the SPICAM Ultraviolet and Infrared Atmospheric Spectrometer indicated that any high altitude clouds are not very thick and made up of much smaller particles , but the CO 2 clouds detected by OMEGA are very different .
Not only are they surprisingly high – more than 80 km above the surface – but they can be several hundred kilometres across .
They are also much thicker than expected .
Instead of looking like the wispy ice clouds seen on Earth , they resemble tall convectional clouds that grow as the result of rising columns of warm air .
Even more surprising is the fact that the CO 2 ice clouds are made of quite large particles - more than a micron ( one thousandth of a millimetre ) across – and they are sufficiently dense to noticeably dim the Sun .
Normally , particles of this size would not be expected to form in the upper atmosphere or to stay aloft for very long before falling back towards the surface .
Striking example of carbon - dioxide -ice cloud on Mars “ The clouds imaged by OMEGA can reduce the Sun ’s apparent brightness by up to 40 per cent , ” said Montmessin .
“ This means that they cast quite a dense shadow and this has a noticeable effect on the local ground temperature .
Temperatures in the shadow can be up to 10 °C cooler than their surroundings , and this in turn modifies the local weather , particularly the winds . ”
Since the CO 2 clouds are mostly seen in equatorial regions , the OMEGA team believes that the unexpected shape of the clouds and large size of their ice crystals can be explained by the extreme variations in daily temperature that occur near the equator .
“ The cold temperatures at night and relatively high day - time temperatures cause large diurnal waves in the atmosphere , ” explained Montmessin .
“ This means there is a potential for large - scale convection , particularly as the morning Sun warms the ground . ”
Bubbles of warm gas rise above the surface and when they reach high levels they become cold enough for CO 2 to condense .
This process releases latent heat , which causes the gas and the ice particles to rise even further .
What are the particles around which the CO 2 ice condenses ?
On Earth , cloud droplets form around tiny nuclei – often particles of dust or salt .
On Mars , the answer remains uncertain .
One possibility is that Martian dust is carried to high altitudes .
Another potential source of condensation nuclei is particles left behind by micrometeorites entering the upper atmosphere .
Or the nuclei may simply be tiny crystals of water ice carried aloft on the thermal updraughts .
“ This discovery is important when we come to consider the past climate of Mars , ” said Montmessin .
“ The planet seems to have been much warmer billions of years ago , and one theory suggests that Mars was then blanketed with CO 2 clouds .
We can use our studies of present - day conditions to understand the role that such high level clouds could have played in the global warming of Mars . ”
Note for editors :
The results were published in the 13 November 2007 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research in a paper entitled “ Hyperspectral imaging of convective CO 2 ice clouds in the equatorial mesosphere of Mars ” by F. Montmessin ( Service d’Aeronomie , CNRS / IPSL / Université Versailles Saint - Quentin en Yvelines , France ) , B. Gondet , J. - P. Bibring , Y. Langevin ( Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale , Orsay , France ) , P. Drossart , T. Fouchet ( Laboratoire d’Etudes Spatiales et d’Instrumentation en Astrophysique , Observatoire de Paris , France ) , and F. Forget ( Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique , CNRS / IPSL / Université Pierre et Marie Curie , Paris , France ) .

1. Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets : Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics
In Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets , Bonner and freelance journalist Lila Rajiva use literary economics to offer broader insights into mass behavior and its devastating effects on society .
Why is it , they ask , that perfectly sane and responsible individuals can get together , and by some bizarre alchemy turn into an irrational mob ?
What makes them trust charlatans and demagogues who manipulate their worst instincts ?
Why do they abandon good sense , good behavior and good taste when an empty slogan is waved in front of them .
Why is the road to hell paved with so many sterling intentions ?
Why is there a fool on every corner and a knave in every public office ?
2. A Demon of Our Own Design : Markets , Hedge Funds , and the Perils of Financial Innovation
Why do markets keep crashing and why are financial crises greater than ever before ?
As the risk manager to some of the leading firms on Wall Street–from Morgan Stanley to Salomon and Citigroup–and a member of some of the world ’s largest hedge funds , from Moore Capital to Ziff Brothers and FrontPoint Partners , Rick Bookstaber has seen the ghost inside the machine and vividly shows us a world that is even riskier than we think .
The very things done to make markets safer , have , in fact , created a world that is far more dangerous .
From the 1987 crash to Citigroup closing the Salomon Arb unit , from staggering losses at UBS to the demise of Long - Term Capital Management , Bookstaber gives readers a front row seat to the management decisions made by some of the most powerful financial figures in the world that led to catastrophe , and describes the impact of his own activities on markets and market crashes .
Much of the innovation of the last 30 years has wreaked havoc on the markets and cost trillions of dollars .
3. Poop Culture : How America Is Shaped by Its Grossest National Product
Poop Culture is an excellent book about a topic that is largely ( and unfairly ) ignored .
Perhaps the greatest asset and the greatest weakness of the book is its breadth .
The author covers many different approaches to the topic–from the psycho-social elements of poop ( i.e. shame ) to the history of the toilet to cultural symbolism to poop in art to the economic / ecologic effects of the way we as a society deal with our poop .
It ’s at once odd and heartwarming to see a diagram of the best way to poop ( squatting ) or talk of South Park in the same book that also contains theoretical musings on Jonathan Swift and Marcel Duchamp .
4. The Logic of Life : The Rational Economics of an Irrational World
I think that I have read all of the recent “ economics of everything ” ( Harford ’s phrase ) books and this one is , in my view , the best .
I also try to keep up with recent research in applied economics and found some gems in these pages that I had missed .
The author alludes to about 200 papers and books from recent economics research and presents them in the most reader - friendly way , all in about 200 pages .
I call that very efficient .
Harford ’s summary is also a useful antidote to all the “ behavioral economics ” that the popular press has picked up .
The idea that some of us depart from rational choice on occasion is hardly news .
The point of this book , that the rational choice model , has amazing power range is worth reiterating .
5 . The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable
Four hundred years ago , Francis Bacon warned that our minds are wired to deceive us .
“ Beware the fallacies into which undisciplined thinkers most easily fall–they are the real distorting prisms of human nature . ”
Chief among them : “ Assuming more order than exists in chaotic nature . ”
Now consider the typical stock market report : “ Today investors bid shares down out of concern over Iranian oil production . ”
Sigh .
We ’re still doing it .
6 . The Economic Naturalist : In Search of Explanations for Everyday Enigmas
The book indeed is like Freakonomics in that its purpose is to reveal the economic rational behind everyday matters .
It is different from Freakonomics in that it follows a “ top - down ” approach : each of the book ’s chapters corresponds to a basic economic principle ( for example supply and demand for a chapter , and signals and asymmetric information for another ) that is explained via real world examples .
So if one can say that the goal of Freakonomics was in reaching the bottom reason / motive of particular phenomena , it can also be said that the goal of The Economic Naturalist is to elicit fundamental economic principles through questions and answers .
In this sense the book is more educational .
7. Discover Your Inner Economist : Use Incentives to Fall in Love , Survive Your Next Meeting , and Motivate Your Dentist
The book is full of fascinating stories in which psychology meets economics .
The author applies the above concepts and ideas to a wide , wide variety of everyday situations , such as chess , doing the dishes , UN diplomat parking violations , bonuses in the workplace , petty crime , expercise programs , student drinking , tardiness , RSVP ’s , meetings , going to museums , buying paintings , reading , buying music , toilet seat positions ( a very , very important topic ) , gift giving , pickup lines , personal ads , marriage , being tortured , recognizing liars , gym memberships , shopping , eating and restaurants and getting the best food , “ The Seven Deadly Sins ” , sexual intercourse , beggars , charitable giving , and tipping .
WHEW !
WOW !
8. The Wisdom of Crowds
In 1906 , Francis Galton , known for his work on statistics and heredity , came across a weight - judging contest at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition .
This encounter was to challenge the foundations of his life ’s study .
An ox was on display and for six - pence fair - goers could buy a stamped and numbered ticket , fill in their names and their guesses of the animal ’s weight after it had been slaughtered and dressed .
The best guess received a prize .
Eight hundred people tried their luck .
They were diverse .
Many had no knowledge of livestock ; others were butchers and farmers .
In Galton ’s mind this was a perfect analogy for democracy .
He wanted to prove the average voter was capable of very little .
Yet to his surprise , when he averaged the guesses , the total came to 1197 pounds .
After the ox had been slaughtered , it weighted 1198 .
James Surowiecki takes Galton ’s counterintuitive notion and explores its ramification for business , government , science and the economy .
It is a book about the world as it is .
At the same time , it is a book about the world as it might be .
Most of us believe that valuable nuggets of knowledge are concentrated in few minds .
We believe the solution to our complex problems lies in finding the right person .
When all we have to do , Surowiecki demonstrates over and over , is ask the gathered crowd .
9 . The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less
Like Thoreau and the band Devo , psychology professor Schwartz provides ample evidence that we are faced with far too many choices on a daily basis , providing an illusion of a multitude of options when few honestly different ones actually exist .
The conclusions Schwartz draws will be familiar to anyone who has flipped through 900 eerily similar channels of cable television only to find that nothing good is on .
Whether choosing a health - care plan , choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans , Schwartz , drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences , shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains , ultimately restricting instead of freeing us .
We normally assume in America that more options ( ” easy fit ” or “ relaxed fit ” ? ) will make us happier , but Schwartz shows the opposite is true , arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well - being .
Part research summary , part introductory social sciences tutorial , part self - help guide , this book offers concrete steps on how to reduce stress in decision making .
Some will find Schwartz ’s conclusions too obvious , and others may disagree with his points or find them too repetitive , but to the average lay reader , Schwartz ’s accessible style and helpful tone is likely to aid the quietly desperate .
10 . Crimes Against Logic
This book deserves the widest possible exposure in America , especially so close to the election , because it an excellent primer on how to guard yourself against the faulty reasoning that governs so much modern political discourse - and avoid adopting it yourself .
I first heard about the book because one of its points was mentioned in an essay .
The point was basically that just because someone has a motive to hold a certain position does n’t necessarily mean that the position is false .
This seemed pretty obvious , but as I turned to the media I was amazed at how often politicians use this method , and how easily I had accepted their claims if they lined up with my political preferences .

Cartons of McDonald 's premium ground coffee are stacked up at the packaging line in Vernon , California March 26 , 2007 .
McDonald 's Corp is set to launch coffee bars with " baristas " serving cappuccinos and lattes , moving into direct competition with global coffee chain Starbucks Corp. , The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - McDonald 's Corp MCD.N is set to launch coffee bars with " baristas " serving cappuccinos and lattes , moving into direct competition with global coffee chain Starbucks Corp.
SBUX.O , The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday .
McDonald ’s will install coffee bars at its 14,000 U.S. stores , incorporating theatrics similar to Starbucks ’ counters , displaying espresso machines and having baristas prepare drinks , the report said .
The report , citing internal documents from 2007 , said the move will add $ 1 billion to McDonald ’s annual sales of $ 21.6 billion .
McDonald ’s will also sell smoothies and bottled beverages , it said .
A McDonald ’s representative was not immediately available for comment .
Competition between the two companies has already been brewing , with McDonald ’s expanding its coffee offerings .
Specialty coffee , along with breakfast items and lower - cost offerings have helped McDonald ’s outperform most other U.S. restaurant companies this year .

Notes :
These projections use a continuous exponential moving average with a half - life of 3 days .
This is more appropriate than using OLS , since the donation data does not seem to satisfy the assumptions of the Gauss - Markov Thm ( The best would probably be an exponential ARMA model , but I 'm not sure people wo n't look at me funny if I do that ) .
The Exponential Moving Average is the best Q4 prediction method for various mathy reasons .
The points on the rate graphs are smoothed to a normal curve with a standard deviation of 15 minutes .
Moving Average totals are at best meaningless , and at worst misleading here , since we know both the exact value and the general trend ( donations will always increase ) .
Thus all a moving average of a total would do is lag behind , and why it is omitted here .

No , this is n't going to be a discussion about the various pros and cons of drinking coffee .
We drink coffee regularly ( some say habitually ) and greatly enjoy it .
Few pleasures equal that of savoring a freshly ground , freshly brewed mug of top - quality java , with honey , molasses or a mix of raw cream and soy milk .
Still , there are times when our bodies want something else — something warming and filling , but with none of the " speed " of coffee .
Fortunately , there are many coffee alternatives .
You can drink them straight or with honey or cream or both .
Some you can buy , while others you have to make yourself .
By sampling as many of the following coffee substitutes as you can find in your area , you 'll come to know their individual flavors and aromas .
Once accustomed , you may want to try some in combination or experiment with lighter or darker roasts .
Just about everyone who makes his or her own " backwoods coffee " eventually settles on a favorite blend and recipe .
We 've no doubt you will , too .

Acorn Brew
Acorns grow worldwide , falling from oak trees ( Quercus ) in the autumn .
They tend to be most abundant during September and October .
Acorns are bitter when raw and so must be peeled and then " leached " — boiled or soaked to remove the tannic acid .
Once the bitterness is gone , your options are many .
If you want to use processed acorns in your " coffee " blend , grind it coarsely .
Roast the acorns as dark or light as you generally like your coffee .
Keep in mind , however , that in all cases , the darker roasts ( those that are nearly black ) can be borderline carcinogens , the level of risk depending on the material being roasted .
This is due to the fact that you are nearly burning the material ; excess heat causes a change in the oils that makes them detrimental — even possibly cancer - causing — if consumed .
We generally roast to a brown color , sometimes dark brown , but never let it approach black .
The US Defence Secretary , Robert Gates , appealed directly to Europeans yesterday to support the war in Afghanistan , warning that violence and terrorism would increase if Nato was defeated there .
Mr Gates said that the transatlantic alliance was under such stress over operations in Afghanistan that it risked imploding .
Speaking in Munich to an audience that included presidents , foreign and defence ministers of many EU countries , Mr Gates acknowledged serious shortcomings in Nato operations in Afghanistan .
This was because the alliance was not working properly together to share the burden , he said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I am concerned that many people on this continent may not comprehend the magnitude of the direct threat to European security , " he said .
" We must not – we can not – become a two - tiered alliance of those who are willing to fight and those who are not .
Such a development , with all its implications for collective security , would in effect destroy the alliance . "
Mr Gates 's words took to a new , and far more acute , level arguments that have become ever sharper in recent months and culminated at an ill - tempered Nato summit in Lithuania last week .
While the disputes at the Vilnius summit remained mostly behind closed doors , however , Mr Gates brought them loudly into the open at Munich .
Mr Gates was careful to name no names , but suggestions that some allies were less willing than others to sustain casualties have become a sensitive matter in Germany , where politicians are fending off calls from the Nato command either to contribute more troops to the international force as a whole , or to divert some of the troops serving under German command in northern Afghanistan to the more hostile terrain in the south .
Both the German Foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier , and the Defence minister , Franz Josef Jung , who had already addressed the Munich conference , had been at pains to set the record straight from their perspective .
They insisted that the total number of German troops had been limited by the Bundestag , and there was little chance of an increase .
They insisted , too , that northern Afghanistan was a dangerous place and Germany has taken casualties .
They also argued that if , as Nato has proposed , some German troops were redeployed in the south , this would put at risk the continued success of the operation in the north .
German ministers recognise that their unwillingness to redeploy troops or increase the number is seen in some quarters as evidence of something akin to national cowardice .
While it is possible that France will send an additional 1,000 troops to help out in the south , this will not end the argument , which is partly about the whole performance of the alliance in Afghanistan , and partly about broader issues , such as the Nato command structure and commitment of individual members .
As other speakers also noted , there was a deep gulf in public support for the operation between the US and many European countries , where it was doubted that success was even possible .
Mr Gates went out of his way to defend the Afghanistan operation as all of a piece with Nato's " core " purpose : " To defend the security interests and values of the transatlantic community " .
He presented Afghanistan as the epitome , in practice , of the threats that had been discussed by the alliance in theory during the 1990s – with the combination of an unstable state , terrorists linked by new technology ; the nexus between drugs , terrorism and organised crime , as well as a " safe haven " that would allow " Islamic extremists to turn a poisonous ideology into a global movement " .
How much fuel your headlights consume depends on how bright they are .
These halogen lamps , for instance , use more watts than LED - based ones .
Les Jorgensen / Time & Life Pictures / Getty Images
Just as there are several theories concerning the impact of DRLs in car accidents , there are different estimates of how much fuel the headlights actually use .
There 's no question they consume gasoline -- headlights require power , and the only way your car can produce power is by drawing from the gasoline in your fuel tank .
The difficulty comes in figuring out just how much of that gasoline they use and how that number would be impacted if DRLs were mandatory .
Like regular light bulbs , you can find headlights in a variety of styles and wattages .
You could get some low - beam headlights capable of 160 watts per vehicle , or you could opt for the more economical LED - based lamps that use only 16 watts per vehicle [ source : AllQuality , California Energy Commission ] .
If there were a national standard requiring all cars to use a certain lamp wattage , this daytime running lights dilemma would be a lot easier to figure out .
As it is , the actual fuel consumption is going to depend a lot on the brightness of the bulb -- you might see a noticeable difference in your car 's thirst for gas with the really bright lamps , or you may not notice any change at all .
Transport Canada estimated that DRLs could add anywhere from $ 3 to more than $ 40 each year in extra fuel costs -- which was back before fuel prices climbed to record heights in 2008 -- while other government bodies , like the United States National Highway Transportation Safety Administration , state that DRLs decrease fuel efficiency by only a " fraction of a mile per gallon " [ source : IIHS ] .
A European study adds to the confusion with its estimated fuel penalty between 0.5 and 1.5 percent [ source : California Energy Commission ] .

To figure out how much extra gasoline the United States would use if all 244 million cars on its roads were equipped with mandatory DRLs , we 'll have to make a few assumptions [ source : DOT ] .
First , we 'll assume that DRLs would average out at about 90 watts total -- roughly between the low and the high wattage capabilities , and that the fuel penalty therefore would probably be mid-range as well : about 1 percent .
With the help of a graph provided by the Federal Highway Administration , we can see that of the 7 billion miles ( 11.3 billion kilometers )
Americans drive every day , approximately 70 percent of those are driven during daylight hours , which equals about 4.9 billion miles ( 7.9 billion kilometers ) driven during the time when DRLs would be in use .
[ source : EIA , DOT ] .
Since the average consumer car in the United States gets about 20.3 miles ( 32.6 kilometers ) per gallon , that means Americans currently use about 241.4 million gallons of gas for driving during daylight hours .
To get that number , we divided the number of miles driven throughout the day by the average car 's fuel efficiency ( 4.9 billion miles divided by 20.3 mpg ) [ source : DOT ] .
Now , when we factor in the 1 percent reduction in fuel efficiency , that usage increases to 243.9 million gallons -- a difference of more than 2 million gallons .
­
At current U.S. prices ( $ 3.81 per gallon as of August 2008 ) , that would be a total of more than $ 7.62 million every day [ source : EIA ] .
Of course , when you divide that by the number of cars on the road , it 's not even a penny per car .
So if you want to contest the purpose of a DRL law , you 're going to need more up your sleeve than fuel consumption .

Sir Richard Dannatt said Harry had been fully involved in operations
This is the full text of his statement .
I am very disappointed that foreign websites have decided to run this story without consulting us .
This is in stark contrast to the highly responsible attitude that the whole of the UK print and broadcast media , along with a small number of overseas , who have entered into an understanding with us over the coverage of Prince Harry on operations .
It is perfectly possible for Prince Harry to be employed just the same as other Army officers of his rank and experience
Sir Richard Dannatt
Chief of the General Staff
After a lengthy period of discussion between the MoD and the editors of regional , national and international media , the editors took the commendable attitude to restrain their coverage .
I would like to thank them for that and I do appreciate that once the story was in the public domain , they had no choice but to follow suit .
What the last two months have shown is that it is perfectly possible for Prince Harry to be employed just the same as other Army officers of his rank and experience .
His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary .
He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battlegroup .
In common with all of his generation in the Army today , he is a credit to the nation .
In deciding to deploy him to Afghanistan , it was my judgment that with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts , the risk in doing was manageable .
Now that the story is in the public domain , the Chief of Defence Staff and I will take advice from the operational commanders about whether his deployment can continue .
I now appeal to the media to restrain from attempting to report Prince Harry 's every move and return to our understanding .

I was told today on a mailing list that some people have been justifying their coding decisions by saying things like “ but that ’s how Jamis does it ! ”
And I was mortified .
Because someday a time will come ( and likely already has ! ) when the things I ’ve written will be surpassed by a better way , and I will wilt with embarrassment if anyone uses “ that ’s how Jamis does it ” to justify continuing with the antiquated style .
I ’m learning , constantly .
Every project I undertake teaches me something new .
Every programmer I ’ve ever worked with has shown me a better way to do things .
“ How X does it ” ( for absolutely any mortal value of X ) is a moving target , and if you ’re blindly basing your designs on something I ( or anyone else ) wrote a year or two ago , then you should step cautiously .
Never . Ever. Cargo -cult .
If someone writes about something that you find clever , understand why you think it is clever .
If someone preaches a better algorithm , understand why the algorithm is better .
And if someone asks why you do something a certain way , argue it on it ’s own merits , without resorting to an appeal to someone ’s ( supposed ) authority .
If you can argue that something is better than something else solely by contrasting it ’s pros and cons against the alternative , you ’ll be taken much more seriously .
And you ’ll have a much better chance of recognizing a better way when it is presented to you .
I ’ll say it again .
Never . Ever. Cargo -cult .
Ever .
That said , I ’ve been very , very quiet lately , and I apologize .
I ’ve been rethinking some priorities and experimenting with some new interests .
Also , I ’ve been trying to finish up ( finally ) Net : : SSH v2 and Net:: SFTP v2 .
Hopefully this year I ’ll climb out of the hole I dug for myself last year and have more to blog about again .
Story Highlights • Lethal injection is most common method of execution in the U.S
• Some say injection amounts to cruel and unusual punishment
• One inmate caught in the controversy says , " I block it out "
Adjust font size :
NASHVILLE , Tennessee ( CNN ) -- Philip Workman has prepared to die three times before .
Next week , the convicted killer is prepared to face execution for a fourth time , to say goodbye to his daughter again , give away his belongings , and once again eat his final meal .
And he 'll wait to see if a court will again step in before the needle pierces his skin .
( Watch what Workman thinks of the procedure that will kill him )
Workman , 53 , has spent half his life in a death row cell in Nashville 's Riverbend Prison , ever since his conviction in 1982 for killing a Memphis police officer in a botched armed robbery at a Wendy 's restaurant .
On Sunday , Tennessee prison guards will lock him in an isolated cell with a small window overlooking the prison yard , beginning three days of " Death Watch . "
He will be fitted for the drab scrubs he 'll wear May 9 , when the state is set to inject him with a mixture of drugs that will kill him .
Workman said he does n't feel much like a person anymore .
He has become a pile of legal briefs , appeals , depositions .
And he is angry , sorry , scared and depressed .
( Watch how Workman has changed on Death Row )
Of the officer who was killed , Workman says : " Any loss of life is a tragedy . "
Too little time , too many errors
Lethal injection has become the most common method of execution in the United States .
Last year , 52 of the 53 executions in the country were by injection .
Of the 38 states that have the death penalty , 37 states allow lethal injection .
( Death by lethal injection )
Thirty years after it was developed , the practice is drawing protest as cruel and unusual punishment , a claim supported by recent medical studies that say the mixture of chemicals used may cause a slow and excruciating death .
The debate over lethal injection has led 11 states , including Tennessee , to issue temporary bans on the process pending further study .
Tennessee 's ban is set to end shortly before Workman 's scheduled execution .
" It almost makes me want to choose the electric chair , " Workman said in an interview with CNN .
" They are saying in this report that a lot [ of prisoners ] have suffered , they would n't be able to speak .
You can't move to say anything .
You 're frozen . "
Saying there were " deficiencies " in Tennessee 's lethal injection instruction manual , Gov. Phil Bredesen rescinded it in February and gave the state 's commissioner of correction 90 days to write a new one .
Bredesen , who declined CNN 's request for an interview , has stayed the executions of four death row inmates , but is allowing Workman 's to proceed .
Tennessee 's rescinded manual appeared to confuse lethal injection with electrocution .
For example , it called for an inmate 's head to be shaved , and for officials to have a fire extinguisher , electrode gel , an emergency generator and an electrician present .
( Read the recently rescinded manual )
On April 30 , the state issued a new set of lethal injection procedures , removing those protocols , but the " cocktail " of lethal drugs remains unchanged .
( Read the newly proposed procedures )
Drugs are a " failure "
Lethal injection 's three - drug cocktail was proposed in 1977 by an Oklahoma medical examiner and anesthesiologist as a cheaper and more humane alternative to the electric chair .
In a recent interview with CNN , Dr. Gary Chapman said the time has come to revisit the cocktail .
" It may be time to change it , " he said .

Until 2005 , it had not been scientifically researched .
In a study published in April by the Public Library of Science -- a nonprofit organization of scientists and doctors -- six scientists spent three years analyzing more than 50 medical examiner reports of North Carolina and California prisoners who had been injected with the short - acting anesthetic thiopental , the paralytic pancuronium bromide and the heart stopper potassium chloride .
( Read the entire 2007 study )
The study concluded the drug protocol a " failure " because the prisoners had below acceptable levels of thiopental in their systems indicating they probably suffered immense pain before they died .
" I was shocked that there had been no research on what is being used on humans , when in veterinary medicine , pancuronium is strongly discouraged , " said study author Dr. Teresa Zimmers , an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Miami School of Medicine .
She also participated in a 2005 medical review of 49 prisoner toxicology reports from Arizona , Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina that drew similar conclusions .
Health professionals are barred from participating in executions , so prison personnel without medical expertise often perform injections .
Florida has been studying its lethal injection procedures since it took 34 minutes and two rounds of injections to kill Florida prisoner Angel Diaz in December .
His executioner , a prison employee , missed his vein and witnesses described Diaz grimacing .
( Read about Diaz 's execution )
A moratorium continues in California - home to America 's largest death row with 664 inmates - after a federal judge ruled in December that prison personnel are improperly trained and the execution chamber is too dark and poorly designed .
Missouri 's lethal injection administrator was revealed in 2006 to be a dyslexic surgeon who had been sued 20 times .
The physician admitted he sometimes mixed drugs wrong .
No more visits
An affidavit shows a physician involved in the 2005 and 2007 studies reviewed child killer Robert Coe 's autopsy .
He was lethally injected in April 2000 in Tennessee .
The doctor concluded Coe " was probably awake , suffocating in silence and felt the searing pain of injection of intravenous potassium chloride . "
Workman reads over the article about the studies as if it 's some legalese he can't quite comprehend .
" I block it out , " he finally says .
He does n't want anyone to see him anymore .
On May 9 , his daughter and brother are to stay away , his lawyers , too .
He wants people to know he 's sorry for robbing that Wendy 's and that a police officer died .
Even if he gets another stay , he says he can't endure more of this .
Of his return to Death Watch , he remarks , " I do n't just want to visit this time . "

What do you do when you are President and the facts presented by the Intel community
are in contradiction with your policy ?
Well , according to the Wall Street Journal , you should just fire the analysts and replace them with people who agree with you .
In fact , and this might be the first time I 've ever heard this particular criticism , it turns out that the Bush Administration is TOO TOLERANT of dissenting voices .
We reported earlier this week that the authors of this Iran NIE include former State Department officials who have a history of hostility to Mr. Bush 's foreign policy .
But the ultimate responsibility for this fiasco lies with Mr. Bush .
Too often he has appointed , or tolerated , officials who oppose his agenda , and failed to discipline them even when they have worked against his policies .
Many have now heard rumblings of the “ amero ” , a proposed North American currency to replace the Canadian loonie , dollar and peso .
However , most of the mentions of this concept , when discussed in the mainstream media tend to focus on suggesting that talk of an “ amero ” , and in effect , the accompanying North American Union , is nothing but a conspiracy theory created by deluded xenophobes afraid of immigration and globalization .
The Boston Globe recently wrote such a story , titled , “ The Amero Conspiracy ” , which stated , “ The SPP [ Security and Prosperity Partnership ] does exist , and its tri-national task forces continue to meet , but its members consider it a way for the United States , Canada , and Mexico to collaborate on issues such as customs , environmental and safety regulations , narcotics smuggling , and terrorism .
The amero , on the other hand , appears to be purely theoretical . ”
1
However , despite being conveyed as “ purely theoretical ” , a recent article in the national Canadian newspaper , the Financial Post , referred to the amero , not as a theoretical idea or conspiracy theory , but as a potential reality .
The article entitled , Fix the Loonie , lays out the process to be undertaken before the adoption of a continental currency known as the Amero .
The article was written as a response to a previous article written in defense of Canada ’s flexible exchange rate system , to which it states , “ David Laidler 's recent defence of Canada 's flexible exchange rate system misses completely the point made by Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Mundell in his famous article on optimum currency areas .
Mundell 's article has been widely credited with providing the intellectual base for the European Monetary Union and merits attention . ”
2
The article continued elaborating on the previous point made by Mundell , stating , “ If flexible exchange rates are best for Canada on the grounds presented by Laidler , why would flexible rates not be best also for Alberta , Ontario or New Brunswick ? ”
It continued , “ Milton Friedman 's response to Mundell was that he would not advocate flexible rates for every possible region . ”
The article contends that Canada is currently suffering from what the author refers to as the ‘ Dutch Disease ’ , “ which is named after the problems that developed in the 1960s when the Netherlands sold natural gas that had been discovered on its coast .
The increases in Dutch exports of resources , like those of Canada in recent years , resulted in a strong appreciation of exchange rates , which was reinforced by interest rate policies of central banks and currency speculators . ”
It further states that , “ The disease manifests itself through the loss of domestic manufacturers ' ability to compete abroad and with imports . ”
The author then contends that , “ The disease manifests itself through the loss of domestic manufacturers ' ability to compete abroad and with imports , ” and that , “ The Bank of Canada can keep interest rates low to discourage capital inflows and thus exchange rate increases , but at the cost of fuelling inflationary pressures . ”
The author then states that there is only one true cure for Canada ’s ‘ Dutch Disease ’ , “ inoculation of the system by fixing the exchange rate at a level that allows manufacturers to be competitive , perhaps at the rate the Bank of Canada research identifies as the long - run equilibrium , around US90¢ . ”
The author goes on to explain the reasoning behind this by giving the example that , “ The Netherlands and Austria in the years before the introduction of the euro successfully operated such a system and enjoyed near perfectly stable exchange rates against the German currency .
The essential ingredient in this success was the official commitment of the central banks of these two countries to maintain the same interest rate as that of the German central bank . ”
So if Canada were to do the same in relation to the US dollar , then Canadian interest rates would be subject to the rates set by the US Federal Reserve , with our Bank of Canada lock in step .
The author goes on to say , “ An analogous commitment by the Bank of Canada with respect to U.S. interest rates may not be credible , tested by speculators and therefore ultimately doomed to failure . ”
Then the article continues , and makes a startling announcement :
“ However , there is a solution to this lack of credibility .
In Europe , it came through the creation of the euro and formal end of the ability of national central banks to set interest rates .
The analogous creation of the amero is not possible without the unlikely co-operation of the United States .
This leaves the credibility issue to be solved by the unilateral adoption of a currency board , which would ensure that international payments imbalances automatically lead to changes in Canada 's money supply and interest rates until the imbalances are ended , all without any actions by the Bank of Canada or influence by politicians .
It would be desirable to create simultaneously the currency board and a New Canadian Dollar valued at par with the U.S. dollar .
With longer - run competitiveness assured at US90¢ to the U.S. dollar .
[ Emphasis added ] . ”
In summation , what the author is proposing is to fix the Canadian loonie to the US dollar at US $ 0.90 , create a currency board , which would be an unelected , unaccountable , group of people to handle our monetary policy , creating a route around using the publicly owned Bank of Canada , to ensure the creation of a ‘ New Canadian Dollar ’ , which would be a prelude to the Amero .
The author then explains that , “ Fluctuations in global demand for natural resources will always result in competition for labour and capital among Canadian manufacturers and producers of resources .
But , at least , the firms in these sectors would no longer have to concern themselves with exchange - rate fluctuations and policies of the Bank of Canada . ”
The article finishes by stating , “ There will also always be changes in the U.S. ( and Canadian ) dollar exchange rate against the euro and other major currencies .
But these changes would have minor effects on the Canadian economy because 80 % of the country 's trade is with the United States . ”
The author of this article is Herbert Grubel , a professor of economics emeritus at Simon Fraser University , who also happens to be a Senior Fellow at the Fraser Institute , one of Canada ’s largest and most prominent pro-big business think tanks .

Other senior fellows at the Fraser Institute include Eugene Beaulieu , who sits on the Academic Advisory Council to the Deputy Minister of International Trade in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for the Government of Canada , Martin Collacott , former Canadian Ambassador , Tom Flanagan , ho is known as the “ man behind Stephen Harper ” , and is a member of what is known as the ‘ Calgary School ’ , which is an unofficial group of like minded thinkers who espouse neo-conservative views , and hold significant influence in the current Conservative government , even referring to Flanagan as the “ Godfather of Canada ’s conservative movement . ”

Flanagan also used to work for Preston Manning , who is also a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute , a former Member of Parliament , and former leader of the opposition , and other senior fellows include Gordon Gibson , a former Assistant to the Minister of Northern Affairs and later Special Assistant to the Prime Minister , Wilf Gobert , former Director and Vice Chairman of Peters & Co.

The author of the Financial Post article which mentioned the amero , Herbert Grubel , wrote a paper for the Fraser Institute in 1999 , entitled , “ The Case for the Amero : The Economic and Politics of a North American Monetary Union ” , in which he laid out the case for the creation of a regional currency for North America . 6
In this paper , Grubel wrote that , “ The plan for a North American Monetary Union presented in this study is designed to include Canada , the United States , and Mexcio , ” and that , “ The North American Central Bank , like the European Central Bank , will have a constitution making it responsible only for the maintenance of price stability and not for full employment . ”

In discussing the issue of sovereignty related to a monetary union , Grubel stated that he thinks that , “ sovereignty is not infinitely valuable .
The merit of giving up some aspects of sovereignty should be determined by the gains brought by such a sacrifice . ” 8
He continued in saying , “ It is important to note that in practice Canada has given up its economic sovereignty in many areas , the most important of which involve the World Trade Organization ( formerly the GATT ) , the North American Free Trade Agreement , ” as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .9
Despite admitting to several agreements and organizations of which strip Canadian sovereignty , Grubel suggests that losing sovereignty in these areas is still worth the benefits .
The introduction of the Amero is an integral aspect of the process of creating a North American Union , much like the European Union .
This process is being undertaken through the implementation of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) , which was signed by the leaders of the three North American governments in March of 2005 .
This agreement is orchestrating the bureaucratic “ harmonization ” among the three North American nations to pave the way for a North American Community , akin to the previous European Community , and ultimately , a North American Union .
The push for this agenda is being driven by the US - based Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , the preeminent American think tank , and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , as well as the Mexican equivalent , Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internacionales .
In May of 2005 , the three groups , as a result of their joining forces in a Task Force , released a report entitled , “ Building a North American Community , ” in which they state that , “ The Task Force offers a detailed and ambitious set of proposals that build on the recommendations adopted by the three governments at the Texas summit of March 2005 .
The Task Force ’s central recommendation is establishment by 2010 of a North American economic and security community , the boundaries of which would be defined by a common external tariff , and an outer security perimeter .
”

Thomas P. D’Aquino was the Canadian Co-Chair of the Task Force report and is also the President and CEO of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , other Canadian members of the Task Force report include Allan Gotleib , former Canadian Ambassador to the United States , Pierre Marc Johnson , former Premier of Quebec , John Manley , former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada , and after 9/11 , negotiated the Smart Border Agreement with the US Secretary for Homeland Security Tom Ridge , and Wendy Dobson , former President of the C.D. Howe Institute , another one of Canada ’s most prominent think tanks , and former Associate Deputy Minister of Finance in the Government of Canada.11
The C.D. Howe Institute has on its board of directors , individuals from Imperial Oil Canada , a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil , General Electric Canada , BMO Financial Group , TD Bank Financial Group , Nortel Networks , Manulife Financial , Bank of Nova Scotia , Enbridge Gas Distribution , EnCana Corporation , Ford Motor Company of Canada , HSBC Bank of Canada , Astral Media , Merrill Lynch Canada , CIBC World Markets , and N M Rothschild and Sons Canada.12
In 1999 , the C.D. Howe Institute published a report entitled , From Fixing to Monetary Union : Options for North American Currency Integration .13
In the paper , it is argued that , “ The easiest way to broach the notion of a NAMU [ North American Monetary Union ] is to view it as the North American equivalent of the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) and , by extension , the euro . ” 14 It continued in discussing the issue of sovereignty , stating , “ That a NAMU would mean the end of sovereignty in Canadian monetary policy is clear .
Most obviously , it would mean abandoning a made - in - Canada inflation rate for a US or NAMU inflation rate .
” 15
The concept of a North American currency has not only been the object of discussion within powerful big - business think tanks , but has , in fact , been discussed in government positions .
In May of 2007 , Canada ’s then - Governor of the Bank of Canada , David Dodge , said that , “ North America could one day embrace a euro - style single currency , ” the Globe and Mail reported .
Further , the article stated that , “ Some proponents have dubbed the single North American currency the ‘ amero ’ , ” and further , “ Answering questions from the audience after a speech in Chicago , Mr. Dodge said a single currency was ‘ possible ’ . ” 16
In November of 2007 , the Globe and Mail reported that , “ Canada should replace its dollar with a North American currency , or peg it to the U.S. greenback , to avoid the exchange rate shifts the loonie has experienced , renowned money manager Stephen Jarislowsky told a parliamentary committee yesterday , ” and quoted Jarislowsky as saying , “ I think we have to really seriously start thinking of the model of a continental currency just like Europe . ” 17 The article continued , “ Mr. Jarislowsky , a former Canfor Corp. director , said the loonie 's rise to above par with the U.S. dollar is destroying manufacturing and could devastate the forest sector , ” and that , “ Mr. Jarislowsky said Canada could either aim for a common North American currency or peg the loonie to the U.S. greenback at about 80 cents ( U.S. ) , allowing it to float within a small band . ”
Jarislowsky , a billionaire often considered to be Canada ’s Warren Buffet , is a member of several corporate boards , and is also a member of the board of directors of the C.D. Howe Institute .18
Appearing on Larry King Live recently , former Mexican President and initial signatory to the Security and Prosperity Partnership , Vicente Fox , when asked a question about whether or not it was possible to see a common currency for Latin America , responded by stating , “ Long term , very long term .
What we propose together , President Bush and myself , it 's ALCA , which is a trade union for all of the Americas .
And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came .
He decided to isolate himself .
He decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea , ” to which Larry King interjected , “ It 's going to be like the euro dollar , you mean ? ” and Fox responded , “ Well , that would be long , long term .
I think the processes to go , first step into is trading agreement .
And then further on , a new vision , like we are trying to do with NAFTA .
” 19
So clearly , there is a move on toward a regional currency for North America , in conjunction with the formation of a North American Union .
Monetary sovereignty , and especially the power to create and issue money , is perhaps more central to the idea of a free , democratic and sovereign nation than the right to vote .
If we do not have the power over the issuance of money , it does not matter whom we vote for .
It ’s the Golden Rule : he who has the gold , makes the rules .
We , as Canadians , and other peoples of their respective nations should never relinquish this sovereignty over to regional boards , private banks , or other unaccountable individuals .
It is our right , not a privilege , and giving up such a right is akin to giving up the right to vote ; it is anathema to democracy and a free society .

Eurozone nations are expected to see slower growth in 2008
The rise , which was more than expected , stemmed from higher food and oil prices and follows October 's figure of 2.6 % .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) faces a dual problem of high inflation and low growth due to slow consumer spending .
Analysts say the bank is unlikely to alter interest rates , currently at 4 % , when it meets next week .
" It all looks like a recipe for the ECB to sit on its hands for a sustained period , " said Dominic Bryant at BNP Paribas .
Slowing growth
Looking ahead , analysts say oil prices are likely to keep rising , further pushing up inflation .
" Inflation will no doubt remain well about 2 % over the next few months , " said Christoph Weil , an economist with Commerzbank .
" The base effect resulting from oil prices will only disappear next spring . "
Forecasts both in Europe and the US suggest growth will slow in last three months of 2007 and throughout 2008 as the full impact of the housing slowdown and credit squeeze feeds through .
Figures are beginning to show that consumers are tightening spending .
Earlier on Friday , retail sales in Germany - the largest economy in the eurozone - saw a significant fall for October .
Sales dropped 4.4 % on an annual basis last month , and by 2.7 % compared with September , numbers from the Bundesbank showed .
Meanwhile , separate figures from Eurostat confirmed that eurozone growth in the third quarter rebounded - at 0.7 % quarter - on - quarter compared to 0.3 % in the previous three month period .
This reinforces the view that consumer spending was robust in the three months to the end of September - when the credit crunch hit - but that in months to come it will contract when the impact kicks in .
Let 's give the devils their due .
Yeah , they 've screwed over thousands of innocent people .
But some of them had balls the size of hot air balloons and for that , we must salute them .
5 Charles Ponzi
Charles ' The Ponz ' Ponzi is , quite simply , one of the greatest swindlers in American history .
The originator and copyright holder of the piece de resistance of his career , the " Ponzi Scheme , " Ponzi also boasted old - timey movie star looks and a smirk that could charm the pants off of the Pope .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Much like Vito Corleone , Ponzi came to America as an impoverished Italian immigrant .
Also like Vito Corleone , Ponzi decided early in the game that his many talents should not be squandered working in a opium pipe - making factory , or wherever they sent the Italians to work back then .
Keep in mind that the man had already served time in Canada , hiding it from his family by telling them he had gotten a job there .
Once he was out and in the states , he created his own little plan for living the good life .
The deal was , back then you could get these coupons that could be redeemed for stamps in other countries .
Ponzi noticed that back in Italy these coupons cost way less than the stamps in America .
So , he figured it was still 1918 and there were a lot of retarded people around , and that he could buy like a billion of those coupons in Italy and then redeem them for the stamps here .
He made 400 percent profit on each transaction , and did n't produce a damned thing .

Ponzi thought , well , shit , why is n't everybody doing this ?
So this smooth operator convinced thousands of people to invest in his totally legit business , the Securities Exchange Company , and by 1920 was making $ 250,000 a day .
Audacity Factor :
Remember those coupons Ponzi was supposed to be buying with all this investor money ?
Yeah , he was n't .
There was n't even a thousandth as many of the coupons in existence as the investors had given him the money to buy .
He was basically just taking the investor 's money , piling it up and swimming around in it like Scrooge McDuck .
It was estimated that millions of dollars had passed through his hands and he had nothing to show for them but his awesome mustache .

Still , when an angry crowd of investors gathered outside his office , he walked right out there , smiled , gave them some money and offered coffee .
That 's the kind of guy he was .
He was eventually sentenced to prison , at which point he jumped bail , moved to Florida and went right back to scamming .
When the cops came for him , he changed his appearance , stowed away on a boat and tried to leave the country .
Finally , he got caught and went to jail .
The thing is , before that whole mess , Ponzi had come up with another idea .
Back in 1918 he had tried to publish this book of business listings , where the businesses would pay to get listed and then people would use the listing to decide where to shop .
Everyone told him the idea was retarded and he dropped it , plunging into a life of fraud instead .
Later , somebody else would get rich on a thing called " The Yellow Pages . "
Lynne Spears Parenting Book ON HOLD
has had several shocks to her system lately and for once it has nothing to do with daughter
This time it 's sweet sixteen year old , who has causes an avalanche of media hype with the revelation that she is pregnant by Casey Aldridge .
The kicker is that inspirational publisher Thomas Nelson has tabled her parenting book which was scheduled for release in 2008 .
We can't imagine what they were thinking when they agreed to handle her book in the first place .
Inspirational for whom ?
Talk about kicking a woman when she 's down .
She claims to be in total shock .
I 'm sure she has clung to her younger daughter as the model child .
Most kids would appear to be that if held up next to the example of Britney .
We can't help but wonder if Britney is secretly happy to have some of the spotlight on someone else in her family for just a little while .
Hopefully Jamie Lynn will know enough not to take any parenting tips from big sis .
We better not go there now - there will be plenty of time later .
A robust employment report offered investors a pleasant surprise , but an uncertain climate kept stock markets down most of the day .
The economy added 166,000 jobs in October , the fastest pace in five months , the Labor Department said this morning .
Payrolls grew more than twice what analysts had predicted , led by a sharp increase in the service sector .
The monthly jobs report is considered a bellwether of the nation ’s economic health .
But investors remained uneasy , with stocks fluctuating through today ’s session before closing slightly higher .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index ended at 1,509.65 , up 1.21 points , or 0.1 percent .
The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.2 percent , closing at 13,595,10 , up 27.23 .
Big banks and brokerage houses led the declines , as Merrill Lynch ’s stock plunged more than 8 percent to a two - year low after analysts questioned its relationship with several hedge funds .
Investors fear the bank will be forced to write down the value of assets beyond the $ 7.9 billion it wrote down in the third quarter , adding to concerns about a tightening credit market .
In a speech at Stanford yesterday , Bill Gates waxed eloquent about the openness of the Internet .
In a burst of techno - utopianism , Gates at one point told the crowd , " I do n't see any risk in the world at large that someone will restrict free content flow on the Internet .
You cannot control the Internet . "
This seemed rather a curious thing for the Microsoft chief to say , considering that his company ( along with Google , Yahoo , and others ) has cooperated with China 's censorship efforts .
The entire Chinese Internet experience , in fact , raises questions about whether Gates ' beautiful vision is true to the facts as we know them .
Certainly the country is doing a pretty decent job of " controlling the Internet . "
IDG News , which reported on Gates ' speech , also noted that he tied the openness of the ' Net to economic development .
" If your country wants to have a developed economy ... you basically have to open up the Internet , " said Gates .
It 's a self - serving argument , though this does n't mean that Gates is n't sincere about it .
The idea that countries like China will be forced to open its censorship regime as the people get richer and as more Western companies invest in the region is routinely trotted out by execs at Yahoo , Microsoft , and Google as a reason for their current compliance with the censorship regime .
Sure , they 'd rather not censor , but they 're willing to do so in the short term because the censorship will soon be lifted — and the companies ' involvement in China will be one of the reasons why things loosen up .
Hopefully it 's true , but the story of China 's rise to date has been one of economic liberalization coupled with the maintenance of an authoritarian political structure .
With China being vast enough to support a massive internal ecosystem of Internet companies and services , there 's certainly no guarantee that ordinary Chinese citizens will ever feel the need to evade the country 's Great Firewall .
And why bother ?
It 's not difficult to do , but it carries severe risks .
Censorship as nuisance
The Atlantic 's James Fallows ( who now lives in China ) has a fascinating piece in this month 's issue about the Chinese system of control and why it turns out to be surprisingly effective at getting people to self - censor .
The Chinese system relies on DNS blocking , URL keyword blocking , and page content blocking , but it 's not hard to bypass ; an ordinary VPN of the kind used by every American firm in the country will evade the authorities .
But that 's not the point .
As Fallows puts it :
What the government cares about is making the quest for information just enough of a nuisance that people generally wo n't bother .
Most Chinese people , like most Americans , are interested mainly in their own country .
All around them is more information about China and things Chinese than they could possibly take in .
The newsstands are bulging with papers and countless glossy magazines .
The bookstores are big , well stocked , and full of patrons , and so are the public libraries .
Video stores , with pirated versions of anything .
Lots of TV channels .
And of course the Internet , where sites in Chinese and about China constantly proliferate .
When this much is available inside the Great Firewall , why go to the expense and bother , or incur the possible risk , of trying to look outside ?
It 's a point that was raised by Amnesty International in a 2006 report on the subject .
Amnesty took issue with the idea that simply engaging with China will ( necessarily ) nudge the country toward openness and democracy .
The group points out that this has certainly not been the case with the Internet , which has exponentially greater levels of censorship and control than it did a decade ago when few foreign computer companies operated in the country .
Since China 's constitution ( see article 35 ) explicitly provides for freedom of speech , freedom to protest , and freedom of the press , Amnesty called on companies operating in the country to take a stand against censorship based on China 's own legal system .
If such a stand is taking place to any significant degree , it has passed largely without comment .
Some commentators expect that physically opening itself to an influx of worldwide visitors to the Beijing Olympics will force China to loosen up its controls on the Internet .
But as Fallows points out , China is already prepping a plan to unblock large swaths of IP addresses likely to be used by foreigners during the games .
Most visitors to China wo n't even notice the censorship , though this does n't mean that the situation is improving for the Chinese student who would like to use a WordPress installation to talk about a riot he just witnessed in the countryside .
Changing the system will take serious work , as Amnesty found out at the Internet Governance Forum in 2006 .
When it attempted to call China out for its censorship , a Chinese diplomat to the UN stood up and announced , " In China , we do n't have software blocking Internet sites .
Sometimes we have trouble accessing them .
But that 's a different problem ...
We do not have restrictions at all . "
The remark drew a jeering " Come on ! " from someone in the audience , but it did indicate just how much work remains to be done even to get China to admit what it 's doing to the ' Net .
Actually changing that behavior will prove even more difficult , especially in a country where promoting " social cohesion " routinely trumps freedom of speech .
While Gates may turn out to be right in the long run , his predictions could take decades to come true .
Even before Microsoft announced that open - source software collectively infringes on 235 Microsoft patents – Linux alone allegedly trespassing on 42 of them – it was clear that the U.S. patent system is broken .
A system that was created to protect invention has warped into a heavy drag on innovation in America .
With patent - reform proposals rattling around Capitol Hill , we thought our wonky readership should weigh in on the mess .
So earlier this month , Wired News asked you to suggest and rank creative ways to fix the U.S. patent system .
You responded , and Tuesday , we submitted your most popular ideas to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet , and Intellectual Property .
The committee began marking up its patent - reform legislation yesterday , and agreed to take a look at your suggestions and provide feedback .
Ever -prescient , readers voted up a plan to abolish software patents to the No. 2 spot , but plenty of other intriguing ideas are also on the table .
Readers also voted up and down a variety of proposals already in front of Congress .
Here 's the list of the top- ranking ideas ( as of 2 p.m. Wednesday ) .
We 'll keep you posted on what happens on the Hill .

Restrict Forum Shopping
In current proposed legislation
Ever heard of Marshall , Texas ?
You have if you 're a patent troll .
Plaintiffs looking for favorable court rulings in patent cases flock to towns like Marshall .
Current laws do little to stop them .
Congress wants to change that and require that any patent - related court action be brought in a district where at least one party resides , or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular business .

Abolish Software , Business Method and Gene Patents

As in many parts of Europe , patents should only be granted on tangible inventions .
Software is already protected by copyright law , innovative business ideas have the first - mover advantage , and gene information should be treated as automatically patented by the intelligent designer .

Pre-Grant Opposition Procedure
By Robert E. Novak
Patent applications are treated as trade secrets and are often kept confidential .
The purpose of the patent process is to foster innovation .
Patent applications are often submarined for a long period of time to allow a patent troll to keep their patent priority hidden until long after a market begins widespread use of the technology .
Have a fixed limit on the time between first application and publication of the application to allow better debate and input before the patent is awarded .
116-13

Limits on Infringement Awards
In current proposed legislation
Tech companies often make products based on multiple patents .
Congress proposes limiting damage awards in infringement cases to a " reasonable royalty " that reflects the value of the infringed patent , instead of the value of the entire product .
Under the current system , Microsoft could soon have to pay AT&T hundreds of millions of dollars for infringing two MP3 patents used in Windows .

Post - Grant Opposition Procedure
In current proposed legislation
To curb runaway litigation , lawmakers are considering creating a way to challenge patents after they 've been granted , without going to court .
Within 12 months after a patent 's issue – called the " first window " – a petitioner can file a complaint and initiate a review process .
The proposed Patent Reform
Act also provides for a controversial " second window , " in which a petitioner could challenge a patent at any time if he can prove significant economic harm .

Make the Government Liable for USPTO Mistakes
By Andrew
Currently it costs millions to get a bad patent invalidated by the courts , and the costs are borne by the plaintiff .
These costs should be recoverable from the federal government .
A simple reform , but one that would ensure that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was properly funded and would also make it much more careful about what patents it issues .

Use It or Lose It
By Anonymous
All patents granted must have a product demonstrably in progress within 12 months of the patent being granted .
Note :
For the inventor , a " product " might not be commercially viable , or even have been produced or licensed , but a reasonable - faith effort must have been made to progress to a product ( e.g. the inventor should be in the business , or should be shopping the invention to companies for licenses ) .
The reasoning ?
No more trolls , and no locking up of sections of knowledge .
If the inventor fails to act on their invention , they lose the rights to it .

Abolish Patents for Life Forms and DNA
By Anonymous
It is unethical and immoral to grant patents on life forms such as seeds ( which farmers can't even save lest they be sued by Monsanto ) and the building blocks of life such as DNA ( which should n't be monopolized by one person or company , as they exist in all of us already ) .
What 's next – can I patent the human foot ?

Make Inventor 's Oath Legally Binding
By Anonymous
An applicant for a patent has to declare under oath that his invention is original .
Make this declaration legally binding and enforceable through fines or punishment .
The inventor must also swear that , to the best of his ability , he has sought out and provided information on prior art .

Hired to Invent
By Luther
The courts ' " hired to invent " decisions that permit businessmen to grab both monopolistic profits and a reasonable royalty for inventors should be overturned .
It makes no sense to use the patent system as an incentive for businessmen and exclude inventors from incentives for inventing .
This is perhaps the primary cause of the decline of U.S. industry .
With little innovation , we are competing on the basis of labor cost .

Law Forbidding Obvious Patents
By Myron
How about something like this ?
" A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title , if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . "

Require a Prototype to Patent
By Patent Monkey
Back in the day you had to show your idea worked to get a patent .
That 's not a bad idea – that way you only reward people who 've actually invested the time and money to get something working .
Not just the people who sit back patenting everything , waiting for someone else to do it – so that they can then just sue !

Set More Stringent Requirements for Patent Examiners
By Patent Monkey
The biggest problem with the patent system is that examiners let " bad " patents through .
So , raise their salaries , create an incentive for reliable examiners to take the job , and up the qualification requirements .
Then ban incentive structures within the patent office that promote granting a patent over common sense .

Bring the Patent Office Into the Electronic Age
By Robert Maxwell Case
The two important dates are the filing date ( the start of the protection period ) and the issue date .
The goal is to shorten the time between the two without reducing the quality of examination .
Applications should be published to the internet upon filing to allow interested parties to assist the examiner .
The number of applications in queue and the mean average age since filing should also be published to the internet daily .

More ...
By Robert Maxwell Case
More examination emphasis on " ends " versus " means " will reduce issued patents claiming to use new technology to do ordinary things .
A specialized prior art search engine that searches worldwide patent applications as well as non-patent " published " documents should be developed either internally or externally .

Patent Holder and / or USPTO Must Refund for Invalid Patent
By Anonymous
If a patent is declared void then the patent holder and / or USPTO must refund loss for all society working in the market that ( has ) been damaged by that patent .
A patent can slow innovation , can ( shut down ) business activity , can damage a state economy ... but whoever makes the patent or grants the patent is never responsible for his mistake .

Independent Invention Should Be a Defense
By Anonymous
Patent infringement should be like copyright infringement – copying should be required for infringement .
There are too many patents that are inadvertently infringed by people of ordinary skill , and it 's impossible to find them all and avoid them all .

Movie characters from the Terminator to the Bionic Woman use bionic eyes to zoom in on far - off scenes , have useful facts pop into their field of view , or create virtual crosshairs .
Off the screen , virtual displays have been proposed for more practical purposes – visual aids to help vision - impaired people , holographic driving control panels and even as a way to surf the Web on the go .
The device to make this happen may be familiar .
Engineers at the University of Washington have for the first time used manufacturing techniques at microscopic scales to combine a flexible , biologically safe contact lens with an imprinted electronic circuit and lights .
Caption : A researcher holds one of the completed lenses .
Credit : University of Washington
“ Looking through a completed lens , you would see what the display is generating superimposed on the world outside , ” said Babak Parviz , a UW assistant professor of electrical engineering .
“ This is a very small step toward that goal , but I think it ’s extremely promising . ”
The results were presented today at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ’ international conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems by Harvey Ho , a former graduate student of Parviz ’s now working at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore , Calif .
Other co-authors are Ehsan Saeedi and Samuel Kim in the UW ’s electrical engineering department and Tueng Shen in the UW Medical Center ’s ophthalmology department .
There are many possible uses for virtual displays .
Drivers or pilots could see a vehicle ’s speed projected onto the windshield .
Video - game companies could use the contact lenses to completely immerse players in a virtual world without restricting their range of motion .
And for communications , people on the go could surf the Internet on a midair virtual display screen that only they would be able to see .
“ People may find all sorts of applications for it that we have not thought about .
Our goal is to demonstrate the basic technology and make sure it works and that it ’s safe , ” said Parviz , who heads a multi- disciplinary UW group that is developing electronics for contact lenses .
The prototype device contains an electric circuit as well as red light - emitting diodes for a display , though it does not yet light up .
The lenses were tested on rabbits for up to 20 minutes and the animals showed no adverse effects .
Ideally , installing or removing the bionic eye would be as easy as popping a contact lens in or out , and once installed the wearer would barely know the gadget was there , Parviz said .
Building the lenses was a challenge because materials that are safe for use in the body , such as the flexible organic materials used in contact lenses , are delicate .
Manufacturing electrical circuits , however , involves inorganic materials , scorching temperatures and toxic chemicals .
Researchers built the circuits from layers of metal only a few nanometers thick , about one thousandth the width of a human hair , and constructed light - emitting diodes one third of a millimeter across .
They then sprinkled the grayish powder of electrical components onto a sheet of flexible plastic .
The shape of each tiny component dictates which piece it can attach to , a microfabrication technique known as self - assembly .
Capillary forces – the same type of forces that make water move up a plant ’s roots , and that cause the edge of a glass of water to curve upward – pull the pieces into position .
The prototype contact lens does not correct the wearer ’s vision , but the technique could be used on a corrective lens , Parviz said .
And all the gadgetry wo n’t obstruct a person ’s view .

“ There is a large area outside of the transparent part of the eye that we can use for placing instrumentation , ” Parviz said .
Future improvements will add wireless communication to and from the lens .
The researchers hope to power the whole system using a combination of radio - frequency power and solar cells placed on the lens , Parviz said .
A full - fledged display wo n’t be available for a while , but a version that has a basic display with just a few pixels could be operational “ fairly quickly , ” according to Parviz .

M. genitalium has one of the smallest known genomes
An important step has been taken in the quest to create a synthetic lifeform .
A US team reports in Science magazine how it built the entire DNA code of a common bacterium in the laboratory using blocks of genetic material .
The group hopes eventually to use engineered genomes to make organisms that can produce clean fuels and take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
Publication of the research gives others the chance to scrutinise it .
Some have ethical concerns .
It sets the stage for what we hope is going to be a new approach to engineering organisms
Dr Hamilton Smith , Nobel Prize winner
Creating life in the lab
These critics have been calling for several years now for a debate on the risks of creating " artificial life " in a test tube .
But Dr Hamilton Smith , who was part of the Science study , said the team regarded its lab - made genome - a laboratory copy of the DNA used by the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium - as a step towards synthetic , rather than artificial , life .
He told BBC News : " We like to distinguish synthetic life from artificial life .
" With synthetic life , we 're re-designing the cell chromosomes ; we 're not creating a whole new artificial life system . "
Gene cassettes
The team of 17 scientists constructed the bacterial genome by chemically synthesising small blocks of DNA .
CREATING A SYNTHETIC GENOME
In 2007 , scientists put genome from one organism into cell of another , taking over cell 's machinery .
Bacterial synthetic genome was built up chemically by sewing together short DNA segments .
Synthetic genome to be put ( 1 ) into cell , reproduce and ( 2 ) create plants for biofuels and petrochemical substitutes .
BACK NEXT 1 of 3
These were grown up in a bacterium , and knitted together into bigger pieces , so - called " cassettes " of genes .
The researchers ended up with several large chunks of DNA that were joined to make the circular genome of a synthetic version of Mycoplasma genitalium .
They have named it Mycoplasma JCVI - 1.0 , after their research centre , the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , MD , US .
Dr Craig Venter , who was involved in the race to decode the human genome , believes tailor - made micro-organisms can become efficient producers of non-polluting fuels such as hydrogen .
Other synthetic bacteria could be made to take up greenhouse gases , he believes .
" It sets the stage for what we hope is going to be a new approach to engineering organisms , " said co-researcher Dr Smith .
Operating systems
To achieve this goal , the researchers must overcome a crucial , and tricky , obstacle .
They must transplant the synthetic genome into another cell so that it can use the existing machinery to " boot up " and start growing and reproducing .
STEPS TO SYNTHETIC LIFE 2002 : synthetic virus created - a lab version of polio 2007 : a genome from one cell is placed in another 2008 : publication of synthetic genome study " It 's installing the software - basically we have to boot up the genome , get it operating , " said Dr Smith , who shared a Nobel Prize in 1978 for furthering knowledge on how to cut up segments of DNA .
" We 're simply re-writing the operating software for cells - we 're not designing a genome from the bottom up - you can't drop a genome into a test tube and expect it to come to life , " he added .
This is the stage which raises the most concern among critics , and where a new lifeform could be said to be truly created .
How precisely will it behave ?
What will its impact be on other organisms and the environment ?
Some say it is a step too far , but others argue that the new field of synthetic biology is an important science .
Even bigger
The UK's Royal Society is seeking views from the public on the issue .
Adviser on synthetic biology , Dr Jason Chin , said the increasing ability to design and construct DNA sequences would , in principle , allow the construction of organisms for particular purposes , such as biofuels production .
He added : " Understanding how you construct organisms artificially is an important first step .
But scientists still need to understand what effect altering the DNA sequence of an organism - such as bacteria - will have upon their behaviour . "
Dr Drew Endy of the Department of Biological Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , US , said that re-constructing a natural bacterial genome from scratch was a great technical feat .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Such advances in science is the way ahead for humanity !
Brian Hunter
He said genomes 10 times larger than Mycoplasma JCVI - 1.0 had already been assembled from existing DNA fragments by a Japanese group .
Dr Endy added : " Given the work already done in Japan , building genomes almost 10 million base - pairs long - I would be surprised if by 2012 it were not technically possible to routinely design and construct the genomes of any bacteria or single celled eukaryote , which also means that it will be possible to construct some mammalian chromosomes . "
Dr Simon Woods , a bio-ethicist at the Policy , Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre at the University of Newcastle , UK , said scientists were acting in a regulatory vacuum .
" On the one hand it 's an amazing piece of science but the real concern is that it's another example of science delving into matters that have potentially dangerous consequences , " he said .
" It 's not necessarily going to stay in the hands of well - intentioned scientists . "

Republican popularity at its lowest level in a generation , huge study by Pew reveals .
| Composite image by POLITICO Clinton would cream Giuliani , poll finds
One year before voters go to the polls to select the next president , the Republican Party is as weak as it has been in a generation , a detailed new poll suggests .
In a hypothetical match - up between Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani , bloc after bloc of traditionally Republican voters break for Clinton :
Advertisement
She wins the South .
She polls evenly with voters who attend church at least once a week .
She splits families with a household income above $ 100,000 .
She loses rural voters and men — but only by a narrow margin .
All are constituencies Republicans have dominated for decades ; George W. Bush won each by double - digit margins .
The findings from The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press remain preliminary , considering even the primaries are still two months off .
But Pew questioned an unusually large number of voters to try to paint the most accurate picture possible of where the presidential contest stands today .
Should the race continue down its current trajectory , the poll finds Clinton defeating Giuliani by eight percentage points .
Other recent polls , however , have placed Giuliani ahead of Clinton in a head - to - head race .
But those polls predict Clinton would beat Fred Thompson , John McCain or Mitt Romney .
And Barack Obama would defeat Giuliani — though narrowly — according to at least four polls taken in October .
In fact , Democrats hold a marked advantage over Republicans in the eyes of voters .
In July 2004 , the Democratic Party had a slight lead as the party “ better able to manage the federal government ” and as the party that is “ more honest and ethical . ”
Today Democrats lead both categories by double - digit margins .
By even larger margins , Democrats are seen as the party “ more concerned about people like me ” ( by 29 percentage points ) and the party best able to bring about “ needed change ” ( by 22 percentage points ) .
Other polling has also showed that for the first time in decades Americans now see the two parties as equally qualified to face down national security threats — erasing the “ security advantage ” Republicans have long relied on .
Republican insiders dismiss the findings as “ largely irrelevant ” because they come so far before Election Day .
“ I do n’t take comfort in any of the numbers that are out there right now , but I also do n’t put much stock in them because it is so premature , ” said Rep. Adam Putnam ( Fla. ) , the number - three Republican in the House .
Pew ’s pollsters agree that as well as Democrats are positioned today , much could change in the next year .
“ It ’s very early in the race , and we would all be shocked if the South went for Clinton , ” said Michael Dimock , Pew ’s associate director of research .
One factor the poll “ reflects is the lack of focus among Republicans right now , ” he said .
That lack of focus is visible when partisans are asked to rate their own political camp .
Only 36 percent of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents say the GOP “ does an excellent or good job ” of “ standing up for traditional GOP positions ” on issues like reducing the size of government , cutting taxes , and promoting conservative social issues .
That ’s a decline of 25 points since July 2004 .
In fact , it ’s the lowest Republican rating for the GOP since Pew began tracking the issue in 2000 .
If it turns out to be a subway race between Giuliani and Clinton , Pew further found that two - thirds of Republicans say their vote for the Republican would be more accurately described as a vote “ against Clinton ” and “ not for Giuliani . ”
Yet , as Dimock notes , “ Republican enthusiasm and engagement could really turn and that ’s the big unknown at this point . ”
Democrats do not have a significantly better view of their party than Republicans do of the GOP , but Democrats have long been skeptical of their tribe .
Republicans , however , have become “ increasingly negative , ” as Pew puts it , about their party .
And they are falling behind in the party loyalty stakes , Pew interviews of some 20,000 Americans this year have found .
About a third of voters call themselves Democrats and a quarter call themselves Republicans — but when independents ’ leanings are added to the mix , roughly half of Americans lean Democratic and only 36 percent lean Republican .
That Democratic advantage in party identity is larger than at any time since tracking began in 1990 .
Bush ’s poor approval ratings are a factor .
His approval rating has dropped from around 50 percent in October 2003 to about 30 percent today .
That is roughly equal to Jimmy Carter 's ratings at the low point of the 1979 energy crisis and Richard Nixon 's in the worst days of Watergate .
Additionally , the unpopular war in Iraq , the lack of a clear Republican front - runner and dismay among some conservatives about the authenticity of leading GOP candidates all play a role in the Democrats ’ powerfully fortified position today .
Pew conducted its survey of 2,007 adults from Oct. 17 to Oct. 23 .
The sample size was nearly twice that of a normal poll .
♣ February 6th
Ron Paul has announced his clear intention to stay in this race all the way through the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul .
In a release from Ron Paul 2008 campaign headquarters moments ago , the campaign is projecting some 42 delegates as the combined result of Super Tuesday and prior primaries and caucuses .
“ While much of the focus in yesterday 's Super Tuesday contests focused on preference poll numbers , Ron Paul caucus - goers were focused on securing delegates to the national convention . ” said Jesse Benton .
“ With dedicated supporters and an organization focused purely on securing delegates , the campaign has secured more delegates to the national convention in Minneapolis - St .
Paul than caucus straw polls might otherwise suggest . ”
This is the direct news that Paul supporters have waited to hear , indicating that Dr. Paul will fight on for the cause of liberty in America .
It 's time for us to redouble our efforts in the remaining primary and caucus states to “ get out the vote ” for Ron Paul , and in states that have already voted , to continue to spread the word to friends and neighbors that America needs the ideas and programs that only Dr. Paul has had the courage to present .
“ Our goal has always been to walk into the national GOP convention with as many delegates as possible , ” said Ron Paul 2008 campaign manager Lew Moore .
“ The number of delegates we won yesterday could very well be the difference in a Convention where no one has a first - ballot majority .
With Dr. Paul 's home state of Texas coming up , we feel we can enter the convention with a substantial number of delegates . ”
The campaign further indicated that legal challenges to the Louisiana caucus results might well end up placing most of the delegates from that state at Dr. Paul 's disposal .
Some behind - the - scenes negotiations have increased the delegate count , and astute actions by dedicated supporters of the campaign will continue to bolster the number of delegates to be garnered in upcoming primaries and caucuses .
The campaign 's original press release may be read in its entirety here .
Godspeed , Dr. Paul !
Thank you for holding a steady course !

The countdown clock for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games hits the exact two year mark in downtown Vancouver , British Columbia February 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andy Clark
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - A group of Canadian sex trade workers hoping to set up a legal “ co- op ” brothel in time for the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver said on Friday they have won approval to incorporate themselves .
The provincial government ’s designation of the group as a business co-operative is the first step in what organizers say will create a safer working environment for sex trade workers in the Pacific Coast city .
“ It defines a structure for us to work together as a community , ” said Susan Davis , a development co-ordinator for what will be called the West Coast Co-operative of Sex Industry Professionals .
Brothels are illegal in Canada , but the country ’s prostitution laws have recently been challenged in the court as unconstitutional .
Prostitution itself is legal , however solicitation , procuring or living off the avails of prostitution can land you in jail .
The group hopes to win an exemption from Parliament by showing it would be safer to have prostitutes work in a single facility in Vancouver that they control , rather than plying their trade on the streets .
The Conservative federal government has warned it will oppose the effort , which critics have said will only perpetuate the idea that prostitution is acceptable .
It took the group six months to draft a business plan and bylaws for the organizations , but it had no trouble from the British Columbia provincial government getting incorporated , Davis said .
“ The very nature of a co-operative is that it will not do anything illegal , so there was no reason for them to deny us , ” Davis said , adding that getting incorporated will help show lawmakers that the group is serious .

President George W. Bush and his director of National Intelligence , Mike McConnell , are telling the American people that an unaccountable executive branch is necessary for their protection .
Without the Protect America Act , Bush and McConnell claim , the executive branch will not be able to spy on terrorists , and we will all be blown up .
Terrorists can only be stopped , Bush says , if Bush has the right to spy on everyone without any oversight by courts .
The fight over the Protect America
Act has everything to do with our safety , only not in the way that Bush and McConnell assert .
Bush says the Democrats have put " our country more in danger of an attack " by letting the Protect America Act lapse .
This claim is nonsense .
The 30 - year - old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act gives the executive branch all the power it needs to spy on terrorists .
The choice between FISA and the Protect America
Act has nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism , at least not from foreign terrorists .
Bush and his brownshirts object to FISA , because the law requires Bush to obtain warrants from a FISA court .
Warrants mean that Bush is accountable .
Bush and his brownshirts argue that accountability is an infringement on the power of the president .
To escape accountability , the Brownshirt Party came up with the Protect America Act .
This act eliminates Bush ’s accountability to judges and gives the telecom companies immunity from the felonies they committed by acquiescing in Bush ’s illegal spying .
Bush began violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) in October 2001 when he spied on Americans without obtaining warrants from the FISA court .
Bush pressured telecom companies to break the law in order to enable his illegal spying .
In court documents , Joseph P. Nacchio , former CEO of Qwest Communications International , states that his firm was approached more than six months before the September 11 , 2001 , attacks and asked to participate in a spying operation that Qwest believed to be illegal .
When Qwest refused , the Bush administration withdrew opportunities for contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
Nacchio himself was subsequently indicted for insider trading , sending the message to all telecom companies to cooperate with the Bush regime or else .
Bush has not been held accountable for the felonies he committed and for leading telecom companies into a life of crime .
As the lawmakers who gave us FISA understood , spying on people without warrants lets a political party collect dirt on its adversaries with which to blackmail them .
As Bush illegally spied a long time before word of it got out , blackmail might be the reason the Democrats have ignored their congressional election mandate and have not put a stop to Bush ’s illegal wars and unconstitutional police state measures .
Perhaps the Democrats have finally caught on that they cannot function as a political party as long as they continue to permit Bush to spy on them .
For one reason or another , they have let the Orwellian - named Protect America Act expire .
With the Protect America Act , Bush and his brownshirts are trying to establish the independence of the executive branch from statutory law and the Constitution .
The FISA law means that the president is accountable to federal judges for warrants .
Bush and the brownshirt Republicans are striving to make the president independent of all accountability .
The brownshirts insist that the leader knows best and can tolerate no interference from the law , the judiciary , the Congress , or the Constitution , and certainly not from the American people who , the brownshirts tell us , wo n’t be safe unless Bush is very powerful .
George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison saw it differently .
The American people cannot be safe unless the president is accountable and under many restraints .
Pray that the Democrats have caught on that they cannot give the executive branch unaccountable powers to spy and still have grounds on which to refuse the executive branch unaccountable powers elsewhere .
Republicans have used the " war on terror " to create an unaccountable executive .
To prevent the presidency from becoming a dictatorial office , it is crucial that Congress cease acquiescing in Bush ’s grab for powers .
As the Founding Fathers warned us , the terrorists we have to fear are the ones in power in Washington .
The al Qaeda terrorists , with whom Bush has been frightening us , have no power to destroy our liberties .
Compared to the loss of liberty , a terrorist attack is nothing .
Meanwhile , Bush , the beneficiary of two stolen elections , has urged Zimbabwe to hold a fair election .
America gets away with its hypocrisy because no one in our government has enough shame to blush .

SCEJ 's recently announced PSP rhythm game Patapon looks nothing like any rhythm game we 've seen before -- hell , it looks nothing like anything we 've seen before .
Famitsu has a few more details on this game of little fighting eyeballs marching towards the end of the world .
The player 's rhythmic accuracy is what keeps these little spear - wielding eyeballs going ; the better the beat sounds , the more fierce the fighting .
Button presses determine how the fighters react , with each acting as a command of sorts : attack , defend , advance , and so on .
After taking down baddies in battle , the fighters can return to their village with the spoils of war , making themselves more powerful for future battles .
This all sounds great , and the screenshots look fantastic , but to really understand what 's going on , this game needs to be seen in motion .
The video above is a trailer shown at this year 's E3 .
It 's jam - packed with strangeness , but it 's wonderful to look at .
Keep an eye out for the singing tree ( yep , really ) at the end .
He must be serious about singing , as he says , " Listen to my song , god damnit ! ! "
It 's surprising that we have n't heard more about this title , so here 's to hoping we do soon .
All we know so far is that a winter release date is expected in Japan , but seeing as how all the dialouge is mumble - talk and all of the text is in English , this should be pretty import - friendly .

Valerie Plame Wilson Describes Sibel Edmonds Disclosures as ‘ Stunning ’
Says She Has Been Following Recent Blockbuster Series in British Paper Concerning U.S. Nuclear Secrets Espionage , Allegations That Her Cover Company , Brewster Jennings , Was Exposed by a Former High - Ranking State Department Official as Far Back as 2001 …
Former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson says the recent disclosures in the UK ’s Sunday Times concerning the sale of U.S. nuclear secrets to the foreign black market , as aided by high - ranking government officials , are “ stunning . ”
The previously covert agent , who had worked in the agency ’s counter - proliferation division for years , monitoring traffic in the nuclear black market under the guise of a cover company named Brewster Jennings until being outed by Bush Administration officials , was asked about the recent series of explosive stories in the British paper during an interview this morning with Florida radio host Henry Raines of American AM .
Those disclosures include allegations that Brewster Jennings ’ real identity as a CIA front company was outed to Turkish officials by then Asst.

Just can't stay away from Techmeme today .
I already posted on the article they listed from Wired on Wi-Fi security .
But I had to check out the posts on the little prank Gizmodo pulled at CES .
It seems bloggers from the gadget blog called Gizmodo had set their hands on TV - B - Gone clickers from Make .
And what do you think they did with them ?
Something I would expect from one of my PRESCHOOLERS ...
Gizmodo used the TV - B - Gone to shut off a wall of TV's at CES showing product displays ...
Yes , the product displays that companies work all year to create ...
That press and bloggers come from all over the world to see ...
Even my 9 year old son has better manners ...
Oh wait , he is too YOUNG TO ATTEND CES !
But the episode did make me want a TV - B - Gone clicker , it may just be a parent 's best friend .....
And it may have ended up being good PR for Make , who I happened to have already included in my Techmama 's Holiday Gift Guide 2007 .
Note to presenters - bring black electrical tape to cover IR receivers ...
Note to parents - hide electrical tape and buy TV - B - Gone .

The smoke has cleared and it was alcohol that killed the marijuana bash .
After 12 years , the world 's largest weekly pot rally has been stubbed out because of drinking .
Victoria 's International Hempology 101 Society meetings drew up to 100 cannabis supporters , but society president Ted Smith said they will have to light up on their own .
Smith said the meetings became too dangerous when unruly beer swiggers crashed the rallies .
The gatherings moved to outside the Ministry of Health building because security guards patrol the grounds , which Smith hoped would deter drinkers from attending .
However two weeks ago , Smith 's hand was injured as he conducted a citizen 's arrest on a drunken man who punched a rally member .
The incident scared Smith enough that he decided it was time to call it quits for the group .
" It is gut wrenching to see people 's lives being ruined ( by alcohol ) , when some people would switch to cannabis ( if it were legal ) , " Smith said .
Smith says he has not had a sip of alcohol for 11 years and believes he is better off without it .
He does n't understand the logic behind society 's legalized drug choice , which has ruined thousands of lives .
After dealing with drunks , Smith said he has a better understanding of what police go through on a daily basis .
Smith noted out of the 681 rallies held , only two possession charges were laid and members were cooperative with the men in blue .
Although the meetings have had their final spark , Smith will be busy working on his free Internet marijuana lecture series .
He also hopes to roll out a cannabis test book .
On Thursday ( Nov. 15 ) , the society welcomes people to join them for an International Medical Marijuana Day rally .
The event starts at noon outside the Ministry of Health building , with a silent art auction being held at the Cannabis Buyers Clubs of Canada at 4:20 p.m .

FreeNadler4.com , Elaine Brower —
It is an odd thing when a group of anti-war , pro-impeachment activists have to pay a visit to a local Congressman who is considered the most liberal of representatives in a completely “ blue State . ”
Unfortunately , that is just what we had to do .
Congressman Jerrold Nadler ( NY - 08 ) , who is extremely progressive and has been an advocate for civil rights and civil liberties for his entire time in office , has for some reason gotten amnesia .
Last year Rep. Dennis Kucinich introduced H. Res. 333 , the impeachment of Vice President Richard Cheney .
The bill was dying a slow death , and in November , Kucinich pushed it out for a vote on the House floor .
All hell broke loose and the bill went back to committee , the House Judiciary Committee , who is chaired by Congressman John Conyers , another former civil rights and civil liberties supporter .
To make a long story short , Congressman Wexler just a few weeks ago , decided to call for impeachment hearings , specificially targeting the “ high crimes and misdemeanors ”  of Vice President Cheney .
This call for hearings was co-sponsored by 2 other legislators , and at this point Kucinich ’s bill , H. Res.333/799 , has 24 co-sponsors .
So now this impeachment movement is gaining momentum and national media attention .
Here in New York City , local activists have met with Nadler over the summer to discuss his signing - on to H.Res.333 , but to no avail .
In fact , what I heard was that he was “ downright nasty and dismissive . ” 
Those of us who were not at that specific meeting have been trying to set up another one to discuss recent developments and the push for impeachment hearings , only to be stonewalled at every phone call , and possible meeting arrangement .
So we decided to take it upon ourselves to make Nadler our target once and for all .
About 13 of us took off of work on January 2nd , the first day back for Nadler and his office staff from the holiday vacation , and we went to his Brooklyn office .
This is a small , constituent based office , located on the ground floor of housing projects located right in the heart of Coney Island .
Nice , cozy spot to try to meet with our legislator .
We came prepared with the 300 + page document that was issued by John Conyers back in 2006 “ The Constitution in Crisis ”  , which was also co-authored by Nadler and worked on for 2 years by both of their staff members .
This particular document is very damning when it comes to impeaching not only the Vice President but also the President .
It is a full investigation of all of the “ high crimes and misdeamors ”  laid out in detail .
Conyers had been “ pimping ”  this document right up until the 2006 mid-term elections , touting the fact that these criminals should be impeached .
But we all know what happened when the dems took office in 2007 , OFF THE TABLE !!!
Anyway , Nadler is complicit with OFF THE TABLE , so we want it ON THE TABLE .
We went in the office , 3 secretaries present , and we spoke with the office manager .
We asked to see whoever was in charge and out came the Community Liaison .
He asked what we were there for and we told him , flat out , we wanted to meet with Nadler .
He said he was n’t available , but would definitely relay the message to him and could possibly , maybe set up a meeting sometime in the future ( we figure it would have been when we were all dead and buried ) .
Of course , we kept our coats on , and spoke very kindly to him .
We all took our turns explaining why we were there , to get Nadler to sign on to impeachment hearings ASAP .
The community liaison explained Nadler ’s position , which we already knew .
He went into the dissertation of the democrats that “ it ’s too time consuming ”  “ it would take away from all of the other really good things they were working on ( we asked what that was ) ”  “ they did n’t have the votes ”  , and on and on , and on .
Then he made the mistake of saying that what we hear in the media is not really the way it is in Congress .
It is a very complicated political process when the legislators have to get a bill passed , or work done .
That ’s when I chimed in .
I told Mr. liaison “ Look , we came here today not as village idiots , but as well informed , well educated activists from all walks of life .
We represent those people that put the dems in power in 2006 , and you have lied to us . ” 
“ We do n’t like being fooled and Nadler is playing us .
It is time he stop .
I am a registered Democrat , and I know plenty of others who will not vote for your democratic presidential candidate in 2008 , so stop playing games with us . ” 
I went on a little bit more , but you get the gist .
Little Mr. Liaison got very quiet , very defensive , and then told us he would take the letter we delivered directly to Mr. Nadler “ tomorrow , personally . ” 
Nope , we said .
Get him on the phone now .
“ No can do , ”  was the attitude .
So we moved in lock stock and barrel .
Took our coats off , opened up our laptops , reading materials , got out our sodas , and took over the office !
We read from that paper that the 2 congressman were so nice enough to prepare for us .
The office staff was so taken aback , they did n’t know how to respond .
The head honcho was not a happy camper and continually told us we were in her way , and it was a hazard .
We ignored her .
Ludmila , a very nice woman there , invited us to sit by her desk and she conversed with us .
We helped her with the printer , gave the mail to the other secretary , all the while reading from the prepared book .
Mr. Liaison came out and told us we were disturbing the office and he would have to call the police if we did n’t stop .
I think he came out and told us that about 3 times , but we ignored him .
Time passed and a few more people came in .
The telephones were ringing constantly , which we knew were people calling about what we were doing .
We basically had the office in a small uproar , but no more warnings came our way .
We had a feeling that he made a call to the Congressman , or his henchman , Mr. Gottheim , and was told to leave us alone .
However , about 4 PM , we were told the office was closing at 5 and we would have to leave .
We ignored the comment and kept reading from impeachment cards that one of our activist friends delivered about 3:00 .
Books of cards signed by over 4,000 people around the country demanding impeachment and an end to the war .
These were also given to Pelosi on September 11th where we had a marathon reading in her office for 7 hours .
So we knew that 5 PM was our deadline .
Sure enough Mr. Gottheim conveniently showed up in the Brooklyn Office , which I believe he probably nevers visits , and told us we would have to leave at 5 , and then went into the back office and closed the door .
The NYPD showed up in full force , nice officers and a really nice Captain .
But along with them was the Chief Inspector for the Borough .
I knew him because my son is a police officer in the 72 precinct , and my husband is a retired Lieutenant , oh , and my stepson is an officer in the 110th precinct .
So I know who these people are .
I said hi to him , and asked him who he was .
He snarled and said “ nobody in particular ”  just observing .
Hah , fat chance .
He started talking to the henchman , and then the Capt . started asking us nicely to leave , of course he said he could n’t “ negotiate ”  with us , that was against the law , but he was “ nicely ”  giving us the “ opportunity ”  to leave and go home .
We had the opportunity of coming back tomorrow , he told us .
Nope , we were n’t leaving .
The NYPD practically begged us to leave , as well as henchman .
They DID NOT WANT TO ARREST US !
Bad publicity .
Oh , well .
We ca n’t always get what we want .
So 4 of us stayed and were taken away to the 60th precinct , on a very , very cold night .
We had 3 of our friends stay outside the jail and make sure we did n’t get spirited away into the night , although the arrest process took until 4 AM !
No food , no water , no bathroom usage .
But we were laughing at the comedy routine of the police department .
They are a regular sub-culture and very entertaining !
This is not over .
I have the business card of Mr. Ilyan Kayatsky , our friendly Brooklyn Community liaison and we will take him up on his offer of making that appointment with the Congressman .
We also want to make sure that the 4,000 postcards and our signed letter got into Nadler ’s hands , he will be quizzed when we meet face to face !

THE POWER ELITE'S USE OF WARS AND CRISES
By Dennis L. Cuddy , Ph.D .
January 28 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
When Congressional Reece Committee research director Norman Dodd 's legal assistant Kathryn Casey looked at the planning documents for the founding of the Carnegie Endowment , she found something quite revealing .
She found that they determined war would be helpful in furthering their objectives .
Relevant to this , Rene Wormser in FOUNDATIONS : THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE ( 1958 ) wrote that the head of the endowment , Nicholas Murray Butler , used the endowment 's funds to get the U.S. into World War I .
The year after the endowment was founded in 1910 , Robert Minor 's cartoon in the ST .
LOUIS POST - DISPATCH in 1911 depicted members of the power elite ( John D. Rockefeller , Andrew Carnegie , J.P Morgan , etc. ) welcoming Karl Marx and his " socialism " to Wall Street .
The next year Woodrow Wilson ran for president , and his " handler " for the power elite , Colonel Edward M. House , assured his bosses that Wilson would support the Federal Reserve 's establishment in 1913 .
The year after that ( 1914 ) , the power elite arranged the first World War long before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28 by members of the Narodna Odbrana ( Black Hand ) secret society .
On May 29 , Colonel House in Berlin wrote to President Wilson : " Whenever England consents , France and Russia will close in on Germany and Austria . "
The trick would be to make Germany think England would not enter the war .
This was done by British Secretary of State Sir Edward Grey misleading German Ambassador to England Prince Karl Max Lichnowsky .
Grey was close to the ( Lord Alfred ) Milner Group which was executing power elite member Cecil Rhodes ' plan for world government .
Milner was the power behind the scenes in British government .
He , not Prime Minister David Lloyd George , actually ran British foreign affairs .
Milner was favorably disposed to Marxian socialism , and pro-Bolshevist Sir Basil Zaharoff ( an armaments dealer who had sold arms to both sides in several wars ) was consulted by President Wilson and Prime Minister George before any major military operation .
This is according to author Donald McCormick , who said Zaharoff sought to divert munitions away from anti-Bolshevists .
When World War I began , Helmuth Johannes Ludwig von Moltke was head of the German General Staff .
Interestingly , he was married to Dorothy Rose - Innes , the daughter of Sir James Rose - Innes , a member of Rhodes ' Association of Helpers , as was their son Helmuth James von Moltke .
It was important for the power elite to drag the U.S. into the War , and so Lord Esher ( executive committee member of Rhodes ' secret Society of the Elect ) wrote in his diary on August 3 , 1917 : " Can there be any doubt that the war has made for progress ? "
He followed this on August 11 with " Mr. Henry Morgenthau asked me to call on him ....
He was one of the principal supporters of President Wilson ....
They are ready to sacrifice the lives of American citizens ....
Mr. Morgenthau realizes the importance ... ( of ) shedding American blood at the earliest possible moment . "
Morgenthau would be a founding member of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , which was largely funded and staffed by J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller interests .
One of the key connections to these interests was William Boyce Thompson , who in 1914 became the first full - term director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
And the WASHINGTON POST ( February 2 , 1918 ) reported : " William B. Thompson , who was in Petrograd from July until November 1917 , has made a personal contribution of $ 1,000,000 to the Bolsheviki for the purpose of spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria . "
While in Russia from July to November 1917 , Thompson was head of the Red Cross mission there .
The Red Cross was heavily dependent upon Wall Street and especially J.P. Morgan interests for donations .
Therefore , these interests were able to use the Red Cross to further their goals .
Thompson 's assistant , Cornelius Kelleher , is quoted in George Kennan 's RUSSIA LEAVES THE WAR as stating : " The Red Cross complexion of the mission was nothing but a mask . "
FDR adviser and Soviet agent in the 1940s Harry Hopkins was assistant to the general manager of the Red Cross in Washington , D.C. In December 1917 , Raymond Robins succeeded Thompson as head of the Red Cross mission in Russia , and on December 26 Robins called Morgan senior partner Henry Davison ( chairman of the War Council of the American Red Cross , whose son in 1920 would become a member of Skull & Bones ) asking him to urge President Wilson to continue intercourse with the Bolshevik Government .
Both Robins and his wife were associated with Bolshevik activities in the U.S. Robins was a protege of Colonel House and one of his heroes was Cecil Rhodes .
According to Bruce Lockhart ( sent to Russia by Lord Milner and Prime Minister George ) in BRITISH AGENT ( 1933 ) , " Robins was the only man whom Lenin was always willing to see and who ever succeeded in imposing his own personality on the unemotional Bolshevik leader . "
Lenin capitulated to Robins ' ultimatum to remove Saalkind as Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs .
Carroll Quigley in TRAGEDY AND HOPE ( 1966 ) wrote : " More than 50 years ago ( before 1916 ) the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Left - wing political movements in the United States . "
And the Morgan - controlled American International Corporation ( AIC ) was probably the primary supporter of the Bolsheviks .
On October 17 , 1917 , AIC director William Saunders ( deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ) wrote to President Wilson : " I am in sympathy with the Soviet form of government as that best suited for the Russian people . "
Other AIC directors in 1917 were Pierre du Pont , J. Peter Grace , Otto Kahn , Percy Rockefeller ( Skull & Bones member ) , Frank Vanderlip ( president of Rockefeller 's National City Bank ) , and others .
Julius Hammer ( chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation ) and his son Armand ( who was a Soviet citizen ) were also strong supporters of the Soviets .
Colonel House in 1912 authored PHILIP DRU : ADMINISTRATOR promoting " socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx . "
And one of his aides , Kenneth Durant , became assistant secretary for the Soviet Bureau in the U.S.
When the premiers of France and Italy ( Clemenceau and Orlando ) later expressed concern about the Bolsheviks and their westward expansion , Colonel House in his diary wrote that he deliberately misled them into thinking there was nothing that could be done about it .
President Wilson was simply a puppet of the power elite , manipulated by their agent Colonel House .
And on November 28 , 1917 , Wilson ordered there should be no interference with the Bolsheviks ' revolution .
Not long thereafter , the U.S. legation in Bern , Switzerland cabled Washington " asking why the president expresses support of Bolsheviki , in view of rapine , murder and anarchy of these bands " ( U.S. State Department decimal file 861.00/1305 , March 15 , 1918 ) .
What is telling about American members of the power elite supporting the Bolsheviks is the fact that even before the war ended , Soviet troops were fighting and killing American soldiers in the Archangel region !
Robert Minor , whose cartoon I mentioned earlier , was a socialist who went to Russia in March 1918 and then worked in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs .
He even prepared propaganda against American soldiers and was arrested , but Colonel House and President Wilson intervened on his behalf and he was released without going to trial ( probably because he was not doing anything different than Thompson and Robins ) .
Colonel House was managing the power elite 's plan to bring about " socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx , " and the First World War was a necessary part of that plan .
After the war , the CFR was founded largely by Colonel House 's group " the Inquiry , " and in the CFR's FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( June 1923 ) Colonel House wrote : " If war had not come in 1914 in fierce and exaggerated form , the idea of an association of nations would probably have remained dormant , for great reforms seldom materialize except during great upheavals . "
The first association of nations the power elite planned , the League of Nations , did n't materialize as the world government they desired , and therefore a Second World War had to be arranged .
In case you do n't believe World War II was planned , how else do you explain that power elite agent H.G. Wells in 1933 in his THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME said in about six years the war would begin over a German - Polish dispute , and Germany invaded Poland on September 1 , 1939 with Britain and France declaring war on Germany two days later ?
Moreover , how else do you explain power elite agent Sir Julian Huxley on December 5 , 1941 , saying he hoped America and Japan would be at war " next week , " and the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred Sunday , December 7 , 1941 , the first day of the next week ?
The power elite knew that the second " association of nations , " the U.N. , formed after World War II , would also not be their desired world government , as H.G. Wells in THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME said they would succeed on their third attempt resulting from a conference in Basra , Iraq .
This is why the current war in Iraq was planned by the power elite .
Cecil Rhodes ' and the power elite 's goal was and still is the establishment of a World Socialist Government via linking regional economic arrangements , and Lenin and Stalin were important parts of this .
In Vienna in January 1913 , Stalin had advocated national loyalties become subservient to regions .
And the year after Colonel House 's FOREIGN AFFAIRS article appeared , Stalin in April 1924 said that according to Leninism " a single world system of economy constitutes the material basis for the victory of socialism . "
It was also in this time ( 1920s ) that Jean Monnet developed his plans for the first of these economic regions , the European Union .
His lawyer was a young John J. McCloy , the successor to Colonel House in managing the power elite 's plan .
In 1936 , McCloy sat in Hitler 's box at the Berlin Olympics , and during the 1940s Secretary of War Henry Stimson ( Skull & Bones member who initiated George H.W. Bush into Skull & Bones ) questioned " whether anyone in the Administration ever acted without having a word with McCloy . "
From 1953 to 1970 , McCloy was the chairman of the CFR , during which time he swam with Soviet dictator Nikita Khrushchev in late July 1961 at the Black Sea .
In the early 1950s , Frederick Schuman in THE COMMONWEALTH OF MEN : AN INQUIRY INTO POWER POLITICS AND WORLD GOVERNMENT wrote that one way permanent peace is attainable is " through the voluntary merging of sovereignties in a global polity , with a World - State emerging out of agreement . "
Advertisement
McCloy was followed as CFR chairman by David Rockefeller from 1970 to 1985 .
During that time , Bahai leader John Ferraby in ALL THINGS MADE NEW ( 1975 ) wrote similarly to Schuman that " we have entered a new era , in which the unification of mankind can be adequately organized only by a world state . "
" World State " and " New World Order " were both terms used by H.G. Wells to refer to a world government .
This concept was adopted by a number of people , and in JOURNEYS FOR A BETTER WORLD ( 1994 ) , U.N. Secretariat official Jean Richardot declared that " a prosperous united world representing a true New World Order could only be attained step by step .
While we are still far from world government , we must first focus on essential issues that work in that direction . "
As I have written before , a single global currency is an important part of this effort to achieve a world government .
In that regard Sarah Perry ( director of VISA 's Strategic Investment Program ) is quoted in THE SINGLE GLOBAL CURRENCY ( 2006 ) as remarking in 2001 : " When VISA was founded 25 years ago , the founders saw the world as needing a Single Global Currency for exchange .
Everything we 've done from a global perspective has been about trying to put one piece in place after another to fulfill that global vision . "
And how will the single global currency be brought about ?
Nobel prize winner Robert Mundell ( known as " the Father of the Euro " ) in a speech titled " A Decade Later : Asia New Responsibilities in the International Monetary System " delivered in Seoul , South Korea , May 2 - 3 , 2007 , revealed : " International monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to a felt need and the threat of a global crisis .
The global crisis would have to involve the dollar , " and a single global currency would be " a contingency " to this global dollar crisis .
As you are aware , the dollar is currently in crisis , plummeting in value .
David Rockefeller in his MEMOIRS ( 2002 ) admitted being part of a secret cabal conspiring with others to bring about a world government .
This plan was revealed 100 years ago by Robert Hugh Benson in LORD OF THE WORLD ( 1907 ) , in which he wrote that " in 1917 ... communism really began ....
The new order began then . "
Ten years before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia , Benson foretold it .
Benson also wrote of a future European Parliament , American Socialism , and " the final scheme of Western Free Trade " occurring after 1989 .
He revealed that in the end , continent would unite with continent , the appearance of peace would deceive many , and that " the Humanity Religion was the only one . "
This final replacement of God by man as the final moral authority will characterize biblical end times .
As I mentioned in my December 31 , 2007 NewsWithViews.com column " Iraq , Iran , and Pakistan , " Ezekiel 38:5 indicates that in the prophecy regarding Gog and Magog , Persians ( Iranians ) will come against Israel .
According to Joseph Farah , recently on Israeli secular television were in - depth reports on Gog and Magog describing the forces that will be aligned against each other in Revelation 20 .
On one side will be Israel , the U.S. , Britain , France and Germany .
On the other side will be Iran , Russia , China , Syria and North Korea .
The Gog and Magog war is also mentioned in the Koran in Sura 18:94 and 21:96 , and the Iranian mullahs have also recently been referring to this .
According to the Koran , the people paid tribute to " The Conqueror " Dhu al Qarnayn , popularly understood to be Alexander the Great ( who was at the time considered Lord of the West , the East , Persia , etc. ) , to erect barriers against the wild and lawless tribes of Central Asia ( Mongols from Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , etc. ) .
However , in a prognostication of the approaching " Judgment " of the world , the tribes break through the barriers when the people degenerate morally , and the wild tribes " swiftly swarm from every hill " against the formerly protected people written about in the Koran .

Via Tim Bray , a commencement address by Bruce Eckel .
It ’s worth reading the whole thing , but I found this part especially interesting :
An even more fascinating metric is this : 5 % of programmers are 20 x more productive than the other 95 % .
If this were a science , like it claims , we could figure out how to get everyone to the same level .
Let ’s say that this follows the 80 - 20 rule .
Roughly 80 % of programmers do n’t read books , do n’t go to conferences , do n’t continue learning , do n’t do anything but what they covered in college .
Maybe they ’ve gotten a job in a big company where they can do the same thing over and over .
The other 20 % struggle with their profession : they read , try to learn things , listen to podcasts , go to user group meetings and sometimes a conference .
80 % of this 20 % are not very successful yet ; they ’re still beginning , still trying .
The other 20 % of this 20 % — that ’s about 5 % of the whole who are 20 x more productive .
The lesson here is that if you want to be a great developer , you ’ve gotta put in the extra effort that Bruce talks about .
There are no shortcuts .
In my experience , I ’ve seen that there are quite a few developers who rarely read things that pertain to their profession , never attend conferences or talks , and certainly never look into trying new approaches that are even the slightest bit different from what they already know .
Well , unless they ’re forced to , of course , via organizational changes or layoffs .
I do n’t understand why anyone would willingly choose a profession for which they ’re unwilling to invest in continuous career - long learning .
I also like what he says here :
You need to pay attention to economics and business , both of which are far - from - exact sciences .
Listen to books and lectures on tape while you commute .
Understanding the underlying business issues may allow you to detect the fortunes of the company you ’re working for and take action early .
When I first started working I looked askance at people who paid attention to business issues — that was suit stuff , not real technology .
But those people were the smart ones .
Another reason to pay attention to the business side is that it ’s actually rare that the best technology wins .
I used to struggle greatly with this , and over the years I ’ve seen many developers do the same .
Understanding how markets work and how technologies advance in the marketplace is important for every developer , so they can put their work in perspective and perhaps be a little less religious about it .
So , from these ideas , my two recommendations for 2008 are :
Learn a new programming language or new approach that takes you out of your comfort zone .
Study one or more technology - focused business books .
In both cases , you ’ll be very glad you did .
These people will not be deterred by the calamity of last week .
They are shameless .
In a month or two they will bounce back .
The ID card scheme will be relaunched and Jacqui Smith will continue with her plans to demand 53 pieces of information from people before they travel abroad .
The Children 's Index , the Children 's Assessment Framework , the National Health database , the ever - expanding police DNA database will all continue to scoop up information .
Why ?
Because the control of the masses is coded in the deepest part of Labour 's being .
So let me just say it now : the politicians we saw ranged before us on the front bench last Tuesday , like defendants in a mass trial , are dangerous , misguided and incompetent ; and they are still in a position to cause havoc .
Under a plan known by the reassuringly dull title of Transformational Government , a huge process of centralisation has taken place , creating countless opportunities for security breaches , as well as abuse by the state .
At the time , the government defined it as ' transforming public services as citizens receive them and demonstrating how technology can improve the corporate services of government so more resources can be released to deliver " front line " services ' .
Anyone emerging from this phrase with a clear meaning in their mind deserves an award , but it has resulted in the demonstration of an almost mathematical truth .
The larger the database and the more people who have access to it , the greater the lack of security .
Professor Ross Anderson , the leading British expert on this kind of engineering , believes it is impossible to go for scale , security and functionality without one suffering .
The ID card database ( cost : from £ 5.5 bn to £ 13bn ) and the NHS Spine ( cost from £ 12bn to £ 20 bn ) are the largest now planned .
We are assured that both will contain fail - safe security measures , but that is what we believed about the Revenue and Customs database .
Helen Wilkinson , who has been leading a campaign against the uploading of information from GPs ' records to the national database since she was wrongly identified in NHS records as an alcoholic , has an alarming story from last week .
A man went to visit a friend in hospital , could n't find him and asked someone for help .
The hospital worker swiped a card and suddenly a list appeared of every person in every bed in every British hospital .
Think journalists , private investigators and those thieves who want to know which homes might be empty .
Some 300,000 people will have access to the NHS database .
There are already stories about the records of a well - known patient being viewed for entertainment by 50 hospital staff in the North East .
' Imagine a doctor or professor leaving a laptop on a plane that includes the entire nation 's health records , ' said Anderson .
' It 's not impossible . '
Indeed , at the last count there had been 14 lapses in major government IT projects in the last two years .
It 's not just about patient privacy or the outrageous decision by Whitehall to override the need to gain people 's consent before their records were uploaded ; a failure of the internet or large - scale power cuts could leave hospitals without access to x-rays or medical records .
The government wo n't describe the final form of the National Identity Register , the database that will verify an ID card when it is swiped and record every important transaction in a person 's life .
However , we know that hundreds of government agencies will have access to it .
That means a very large number of people .
Abuse of the Police National Computer by officers illegally working for private inquiry agents is not unknown .
After the HMRC scandal , is it really such a stretch to imagine them gaining access to the ID database ?
Few appreciate that under the EU principle of ' availability ' ; thousands of foreign law enforcement agencies are allowed access to British databases .
Connections are being made all the time .
Prepare to welcome the policeman from Palermo into your life .
The centralisation of data in Britain has been accompanied by the language of ' protection ' and ' care ' and ' modernisation ' .
The reality may be seen in a scheme called ECCO , which is being tried out in Edinburgh and has caused great resentment among the homeless .
ECCO allows any care worker to look at the information given up by people on the street in times of stress .
The history of alcoholism , mental disturbance , child abuse and so forth is all retained indefinitely in the name of providing greater care , regardless of an individual 's wishes .
Privacy is one of the few things the homeless possess .
The most alarming symptoms of the government 's information binge have occurred in the children database , now cutely rebranded ContactPoint , which contains details of every child in Britain and the CAF database , which indefinitely holds extensive and very private profiles of children who have needed one or other special educational service .
Often these interviews are undertaken without parents ' knowledge .
There is no end to the government 's appetite .
In the New Year it is believed the Home Office will seek to make a law by statutory instrument - and therefore unscrutinised by Parliament - that gives police and security services access to details of travel within the UK .
All road traffic is being monitored by cameras .
Soon it will be every train journey and domestic flight .
It is clear we have a short time to act .
A high - profile , independent public inquiry is needed to examine the accumulation of personal data by the government , how it is stored , what it is used for and where the risks to security occur .
An important aspect is the technology .
Is it desirable for multinationals with no stake in this country 's traditions of privacy and freedom to be installing the systems that will control us ?
I very much doubt we will get such an inquiry because it would strike at the heart of Labour 's grasping and incompetent megalomania .
But it is worth the opposition pushing for it .
I receive hundreds of emails each week from people asking what they can do .
The first is to join a local group set up by No2ID , one of the best run campaigns I have seen .
Terri Dowty 's Action for Rights on Children ( Arch ) and Helen Wilkinson 's the Big Opt Out both do very good work , as does the Our Kingdom website .
We should write to our MPs - especially Labour MPs - and to local newspapers ; contribute to blogs and phone-ins .
We should talk to our friends and colleagues about what has been done by Labour 's centralisers and mainframe men , who Anderson properly identifies as Marxist controllers in another guise .
Each of us should understand that personal information is exactly that - personal - and that the government has only limited rights to demand and retain it .
The scale of its operations and the innate weakness of the systems is a very grave concern to us all .
What is needed - and here I hope someone is listening - is a mass movement on the lines of the Countryside Alliance , which goes across all parties and absorbs the skills and expertise of countless activists .
Now is the moment to create a movement in defence of our privacy , security and freedom .

There 's been a lot of buzz about a story The London Times ran this morning under the headline " Internet users could be banned over illegal downloads , " which also appeared on the BBC website under the even more alarming headline " Illegal downloaders ' face UK ban . "
Time to get a couple of things straight .
The Times says “ people who illegally download films and music will be cut off from the internet under new legislative proposals to be unveiled next week . ”
Actually , this story is complete balderdash .
But the fact that this nutty proposal is getting anywhere at all illustrates how ignorant the powers that be are about downloading .
Let ’s get a couple of things straight ,
1 . This proposal was a draft consultation green paper , defined as “ a proposal without any commitment to action . ”
The government receives many of these on a daily basis .
They are like junk mail at Number 10 Downing Street .
The Prime Minister ’s toilet paper is more important than most green papers , and both are usually filed in the same place .
2 . This proposal is totally and completely unworkable in the real world .
ISPs will not accept liability for the contents of packets ( nor should they ) , and it would be impossible for them to open and check if every single download and upload was legal or not without the entire Internet grinding to halt .
This is n’t in the best interests of the government , the ISPs or the voters .
Banning customers and exposing yourself to billions in liability is n’t a good business strategy .
Criminalizing six million citizens and inconveniencing the rest is not a vote winner .
3 . It would be impossible to tell the difference between illegal downloading and legal activities such as downloading software patches , using torrents to share stuff legally , playing online video games , using VoIP , photo sharing , telecommuting , and many others .
The resistance from the private sector would be as strong as it would from the general public .
4 . The very idea of this goes against the ruling of the European Court , which says EU member states are not obligated to disclose personal information about suspected file sharers .
It would also fly in the face of Article 10 of the European freedom of expression laws , which gives every European the “ freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . ”
5 . WiFi piggybacking and encrypted packets make it impossible to tell who is downloading what in the first place .
These techniques are only getting more sophisticated , while for the most part , the content industries collectively remain as dumb as a box of hair .
So in summary :
Insert Toilet Flushing Sound FX Here
This idea makes as much sense as trying to ban people from singing ‘ Happy Birthday ’ to each other over the telephone network , or burning down libraries to protect the publishing industry .
But what ’s frightening about such ideas is that they are still taken seriously all over the world by powerful decision makers in government and industry who have absolutely no clue about how the Internet actually works , or the damage such laws could do to democracy .
Before there is any more discussion about this , the music and film companies need to definitively prove illegal downloads cost them millions of dollars in lost revenues .
CD sales are falling because nobody uses them anymore , and Hollywood is in rude health despite the pirates .
There should be no more talk about changing laws and spending tax payer ’s money on this ‘ problem ’ until someone proves there really is one .
Furthermore , if there is a problem , tax payers should n’t have to pony up in the first place .
The content industries need to stop braying at governments to protect inefficient business models and look at the real solution that ’s been staring them in the face for ten years .
For those who are interested , my book : “ The Pirate ’s Dilemma : How Youth Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism ” is out now through Free Press , , and probably soon on a BitTorrent tracker near you ; ) .
ACCESS AND MOBILITY ISSUES FROM TWO URBAN ADVENTURERS
The utterly charming thing about the Zionist Thought Police is their apparent inability to restrain themselves , even from the very excesses that will prove to be their own undoing .
Having asked sane and rational people to believe that Jimmy Carter is a Holocaust denier simply for pointing out the obvious about the apartheid regime Israel maintains in the occupied territories , the same crew now want us to believe that Archbishop Desmond Tutu is an anti-Semite .
No jokes !
That was the reason cited for Tutu being banned from speaking at St. Thomas University in Minneapolis .
“ We had heard some things he said that some people judged to be anti-Semitic and against Israeli policy , ” explained university official Doug Hennes .
The “ anti-Semitic ” views Tutu had expressed were in his April 2002 speech “ Occupation is Oppression ” in which he likened the occupation regime in the West Bank , based on his personal experience of it , to what he had experienced as a black person in South Africa .
He recalled the role of Jews in South Africa in the struggle to end apartheid , and expressed his solidarity with us through our centuries of suffering .
But then turning to the suffering inflicted on the Palestinians , he issued an important challenge , one that might just as well have been uttered by a Jewish biblical prophet :
“ My heart aches .
I say , why are our memories so short ?
Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation ?
Have they forgotten the collective punishment , the home demolitions , in their own history so soon ?
Have they turned their backs on their profound and noble religious traditions ?
Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden ?
“ Israel will never get true security and safety through oppressing another people .
A true peace can ultimately be built only on justice .
We condemn the violence of suicide bombers , and we condemn the corruption of young minds taught hatred ; but we also condemn the violence of military incursions in the occupied lands , and the inhumanity that wo n’t let ambulances reach the injured .
“ The military action of recent days , I predict with certainty , will not provide the security and peace Israelis want ; it will only intensify the hatred .
“ Israel has three options : revert to the previous stalemated situation ; exterminate all Palestinians ; or – and I hope this will be the road taken – to strive for peace based on justice , based on withdrawal from all the occupied territories , and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state on those territories side by side with Israel , both with secure borders .
“ We in South Africa had a relatively peaceful transition .
If our madness could end as it did , it must be possible to do the same everywhere else in the world .
South Africa is a beacon of hope for the rest of the world .
If peace could come to South Africa , surely it can come to the Holy Land . ”
Tutu is absolutely right , of course , nor would those Israelis who embody the same tradition of indivisible human rights that Tutu personifies disagree with him .
Frankly , this case I think this case underlines precisely how absurd the policing of discussion about Israel in the U.S. has become .
As a South African veteran of the liberation struggle , I can testify that there are few , if any , more decent , humane , courageous and morally unimpeachable individuals in the world than Bishop Tutu .
Speaking truth to power is what he ’s always done , both to the old regime in South Africa as much as to the new , when the latter has failed to live up to the standards it professes on AIDS , crime and other issues .
He has spoken forcefully on human rights struggles around the world , and his statements about the West Bank are based on what he has seen there .
The diminutive Bish is a moral giant of our times , and the fact that he is condemning Israel for maintaining an apartheid system on the West Bank should serve as a wake - up call to liberal Americans who prefer not to think about these things .
Yes , of course Bishop Tutu makes people uncomfortable ; that ’s what he ’s always done , like a good cleric , challenging his flock to consider their own actions and omissions against the morality they profess to embrace .
Instead , thanks to the atmosphere created by the right - wing nationalists of AIPAC and the ADL etc. , many mainstream institutions would now prefer to shoot the messenger , if only to avoid incurring the wrath of those who have stripped the very term “ anti- Semitic ” of its meaning ( by using it as a bludgeon in defense of behavior utterly abhorrent in the Jewish tradition as much as anything else ) , and as such , commit a great crime against Jews and Judaism .
Not that Tutu would have been surprised by this clumsy attack on him .
As he said in that Boston speech ,
“ But you know as well as I do that , somehow , the Israeli government is placed on a pedestal [ in the U.S. ] , and to criticize it is to be immediately dubbed anti-Semitic , as if the Palestinians were not Semitic .
I am not even anti-white , despite the madness of that group .
And how did it come about that Israel was collaborating with the apartheid government on security measures ?
“ People are scared in this country [ the U.S. ] to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful – very powerful .
Well , so what ?
This is God ’s world .
For goodness sake , this is God ’s world !
We live in a moral universe .
The apartheid government was very powerful , but today it no longer exists .
Hitler , Mussolini , Stalin , Pinochet , Milosovic , and Idi Amin were all powerful , but in the end they bit the dust .
“ Injustice and oppression will never prevail .
Those who are powerful have to remember the litmus test that God gives to the powerful :
What is your treatment of the poor , the hungry , the voiceless ?
And on the basis of that , God passes judgment .
“ We should put out a clarion call to the government of the people of Israel , to the Palestinian people and say : peace is possible , peace based on justice is possible .
We will do all we can to assist you to achieve this peace , because it is God ’s dream , and you will be able to live amicably together as sisters and brothers . ”
Tutu is challenging American institutions to put morality above the power of a lobby .
( Yes , I know he called it “ the Jewish lobby ” and I do n’t think of it as that ; I think of it as a rightwing Likudnik lobby open to right - wing jingoists of every religious and ethnic stripe who share the Likudnik vision , but then again , I can understand Tutu ’s confusion here , because it ’s not as if any mainstream Jewish institutions have stepped forward and said no , these people who would suppress honest discussion of Israel speak only for themselves , not for the Jews … )
More power to him .
Postscript : Seems that even the likes of the ADL realize that when they ’re seen to be trying to gag someone like Bishop Tutu , they ’re destroying their own credibility in the eyes of many Jews .
Not least in response to the efforts of the good people of Muzzlewatch , it seems that the university has reversed itself and restored Tutu ’s invitation , with the support of even the ADL .
1. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind : Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth Eker 's claim to fame is that he took a $ 2,000 credit card loan , opened " one of the first fitness stores in North America , " turned it into a chain of 10 within two and a half years and sold it in 1987 for a cool ( but somewhat modest - seeming ) $ 1.6 million .
Now the Vancouver - based entrepreneur traverses the continent with his " Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar , " on which this debut motivational business manual is based .
What sets it apart is Eker 's focus on the way people think and feel about money and his canny , class - based analyses of broad differences among groups .
In rat - a - tat , " Let me explain " seminar - speak , Eker asks readers to think back to their childhoods and pick apart the lessons they passively absorbed from parents and others about money .
With such psychological nuggets as " Rich people focus on opportunities /
Poor people focus on obstacles , " Eker puts a positive spin on stereotypes , arguing that poverty begins , or rather , is allowed to continue , in one 's imagination first , with actual material life becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy .
To that end , Eker counsels for admiration and against resentment , for positivity , self - promotion and thinking big and against wallowing , self - abnegation and small - mindedness .
While much of the advice is self - evident , Eker 's contribution is permission to think of one 's financial foibles as a kind of mental illness — one , he says , that has a ready set of cures .
2. Life 's Missing Instruction Manual : The Guidebook You Should Have Been Given at Birth Joe Vitale 's life manual is packed with his highly personal brand of new - age wizardry and inscrutable passages from other modern day self - help philosophers .
With aphorisms , maxims and fables on ideas and subjects ranging from sex , food and forgiveness to personal finance , taxes , purpose in life and how to handle death , he proffers a broad , mixed bag of advice - some he wrote and some he anthologizes - with a touch of humor and a dash of preachiness .
Rather than presenting a singular world view or moral system , Vitale combs popular self - help best sellers , consults some sweeping religious concepts , and synthesizes their teachings with his own insight .
The resulting book is at times quite sharp and smart , and at times simplistic and sentimental .
3. Getting Rich Your Own Way : Achieve All Your Financial Goals Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible
If you go around humming , " If I were a rich man " from " Fiddler on the Roof " , it might be time to stop fiddling and go around reading instead .
If wealth is your goal , man or woman , help yourself to a serving of some vintage Brian Tracy advice .
He offers a tasty stew of maxims , aphorisms , anecdotes and general words of wisdom that will motivate you to become better at what you do , in order to become richer .
Tracy is a walking oracle of motivation .
If your desire to be wealthy seems like a pipe dream , wake up to the blend of information he has assembled .
As the master of self - help books , Tracy offers practical advice , encouragement , motivation and effective techniques for self - improvement .
In this book , he tells you how to help yourself to money .
That 's as good an invitation as we 've seen anywhere .
Now let 's see if it works .
In high hopes , we recommend Tracy 's application of upbeat philosophy to the goal of accumulating wealth .
4 .
The One Minute Millionaire : The Enlightened Way to Wealth First , this book is incredible !
Offering both non fictional and fictional material , right and left sided to stimulate your right and left brains .
I have long been a fan of Robert Allen and Mark Victor Hansen as well as Jack Canfield .
Allen and Hansen have outdone themselves with this one .
The other reason that I am impressed is only one negative review !
WOW !
Perhaps even the bashers are reading PMA and inspritional material and growing .
Now that is impressive !
Simply stated ; if you want to be a success , read this book .
It will create the right mental mindset .
5. Success Is Not an Accident : Change Your Choices ; Change Your Life I read this book about a year ago and was very happy with it .
It 's one of the few books that I have been interested enough in to stay with and finish within 2 days .
I found myself unable to put it down .
Now do n't get me wrong - the information here is nothing earth shattering .
A lot of it is tried and true principles that have been around for many hundreds of years .
What makes this book work is the delivery and writing style .
It presents goal setting in a clear , understandable and very useable fashion .
If you are into goal setting I think you 'll find yourself referring to this book again and again .
I know I have and recommend it highly .
by Shaun Boyd
I only met my brother ’s ex-girlfriend ’s family once — the year they invited our family over to share Thanksgiving dinner .
Since we were basically a group of strangers looking to make a good first impression , the table conversation was nothing more than friendly idle chitchat .
When I asked our hostess for more mashed potatoes , she took the opportunity to ask me about myself while dishing out my second helping —
“ So Shaun , what do you do for a living ? ”
Hesitantly , I responded : “ I work in computer support . ”
The transition to silence was immediate .
All eyes suddenly turned to me , raised eyebrows all around .
If you had n’t heard my response , judging from everyone ’s reaction you might think I said something outrageous like I was a male stripper or a gynecologist — but I knew the awkward silence would soon be broken by an overwhelming outpouring of computer questions .
“ Oh wow , a computer guy ! ” —
“ So you know how to remove spyware and viruses and stuff , right ? ” —
“ Our family computer is really slow , I think it has a virus . ” —
“ Do you have a business card , or can I get your number ? ”
I politely and patiently answered their questions , hoping that we ’d exhaust the subject in a matter of minutes and then move on to something else .
As it would turn out , my hopeful prediction was very wrong — the gentleman sitting next to me scooted his seat closer to me to begin an interrogation .
This man I was meeting for the first time must ’ve truly believed that I was going to help him with his problem at that very moment .
It did n’t matter how uninterested I looked or sounded , he was convinced that I must know the answer he ’s looking for and he was determined he would get it .
Situations like this one were common for me .
I ’ve had eavesdropping strangers approach me with questions about their computer while I was eating in a restaurant .
I ’ve had oblivious coworkers step in front of me in a buffet line to tell me about their computer problems while I was serving myself food .
I ’ve had neighbors who spotted me from their window rush outside to coax me into working on their home computer while I was walking to the corner market .
My knack for solving people ’s computer problems had become so well - known among my neighborhood that these circumstances were near impossible to avoid .
You might be thinking , “ So why complain ?
If your help is in high demand , why not embrace your talents and charge people for your time ? ”
I tried to for seven years .
I ’ve worked in the computer industry in various ways — help desk support , web design , consulting and sales , field technician , freelance computer specialist , and whatever other fancy name you want to give “ the computer guy . ”
I stopped enjoying it .
There were certainly times when I enjoyed myself , but most of those times were when my computer talents were still developing .
Once I stopped learning new things on the job , I would become fidgety and want to move on to something else .
From my career - hopping experiences in the computer industry , I ’ve become acquainted with the Top Ten Reasons it does n’t pay to be the computer guy :
Reason # 10 – Most Of Your Accomplishments Are Invisible
The computer guy never hears anyone tell him , “ I just want to let you know … everything is working fine ! ”
The reality is that people call the computer guy when something is wrong .
As a computer guy , if you work really hard to make everything work the way that it should , and things work fine , then people believe you do n’t do anything .
Everything you manage to get working correctly or do perfectly will forever remain unnoticed by computer users .
They ’ll only ever notice that you do anything when something is n’t working correctly , and you are called upon to fix it .
Reason # 9 – Every Conversation You Have Is Roughly The Same
When the computer guy dares to mention what he does for a living , the typical response is , “ I have a question about my home computer … ”
Or when the computer guy first hears about a widespread problem within the computer network he ’s responsible for , he can barely begin to assess the problem before a dozen other people call to report the same problem .
Or when the computer guy explains a certain process on a computer to a user who is incapable of retaining the process , he will inevitably need to reinstruct the user of this same process — indefinitely .
Reason # 8 – You ’re An Expert Of Bleeding - Edge Technology Products , Are n’t You ?
The computer guy often finds himself in situations where someone is asking him for advice on a pending investment of the technological variety .
“ I heard about ( some hardware or software product ) that can do ( something desirable ) for me .
I brought you these ( advertisements / reviews / printouts ) because I wanted your recommendation .
Which would you buy ? ”
Although the inquiring person sincerely trusts the computer guy ’s judgment over their own , in almost every instance the real objective of these meetings is to ensure their own immunity from making a risky purchase .
If it turns out to be a bad investment , and they can not get ( the hardware or software product ) to do ( anything desirable ) , then you will be their personal scapegoat —
“ But honey , the computer guy said I should buy it ! ”
Reason # 7 – Your Talents Are Forcibly Undervalued
Thanks to the constantly declining price of new computers , the computer guy cannot charge labor sums without a dispute .
If he asks to be paid what he is worth , he will likely be met with the “ why not buy new ? ” argument .
That is , desktop computers are always getting smaller , faster , and cheaper .
It ’s possible to purchase a new desktop computer for under $ 400 .
If the computer guy spends five hours fixing a computer and wants $ 100 / hour for his time , his customer will be outraged , exclaiming “ I did n’t even spend this much to BUY the computer , why should I pay this much just to FIX it ? ”
Reason # 6 – You ’re Never Allowed A Moment ’s Peace
The computer guy is so prone to interruption that he rarely finds an opportunity to work on his own problems .
This is because :
Computers never sleep .
Computer problems are n’t scheduled .
Every problem takes time to diagnose .
The computer guy can only give one problem his full attention .
Each user believes their problem deserves attention now .
Consequently , the computer guy has a 24/7 obligation to keep critical computer systems running , while simultaneously juggling everyone ’s problems .
He ’ll often need to forfeit any opportunities to tend to his own needs for the sake of others — because at any moment , of any day , he can be interrupted by someone who wants to make their problem his problem .
Reason # 5 – People Ask You To Perform Miracles
The computer guy is often mistaken for someone who possesses the combined skills of an old priest and a young priest .
I ’ll sum this up easily by example :
“ No , I really ca n’t recover any files from your thumb drive , even if you did find it after it passed through your dog . ”
Reason # 4 – Your Assumed “ All - Knowing ” Status Sets You Up To Let People Down
There is no common understanding that there are smaller divisions within the computer industry , and that the computer guy can not be an expert in all areas .
What makes things worse , is when the computer guy attempts to explain this to someone asking for help , the person will often believe that the computer guy is withholding the desired knowledge to avoid having to help .
This is somewhat related to the next reason :
Reason # 3 – You Possess Unlimited Responsibility
The computer guy is expected to solve problems .
It is difficult to determine the boundaries of that expectation .
Some of the oddest things that I ’ve been asked to do include :
Use pirated software to undelete important company files .
Create an Intranet , after explaining I did n’t know how to .
Teach someone how to hide their pornography collection .
Solving problems can range from replacing batteries in a wireless keyboard to investigating why the entire building loses power at the same time every morning .
Resolutions can necessitate weaving a 50 - foot cable through a drop ceiling , or wriggling under a house on your belly to add an electrical outlet .
Reasons # 4 and # 3 boil down to this : no matter how often you want to play the role of a hero , there will always be circumstances that test the limits of your ability to be one .
It ’s difficult to judge when helping someone means doing something immoral , and it ’s even harder to admit you are unable to solve someone ’s problem — and chances are , that someone will view you as incompetent because you were unable to help them .
Reason # 2 – A Life Of Alienation
People only talk to the computer guy when they need him to fix something .
Also , when the computer guy approaches a user , they ’ll hop up out of their chair under the presumption that he ’s there to fix something — as if it would never be expected that he only wants to strike up a conversation .
The fact that the computer guy never gets a moment ’s peace can also practically force him to withdraw into solitude .
His co-workers do n’t understand that he does n’t want to hear about their computer problems during his lunch hour — he does that every other hour of the day .
That ’s why the computer guy eats lunch alone with his door closed , or goes out to eat every day — not because he ’s unfriendly , but because he needs to escape the incessant interruptions .
Reason # 1 – You Have No Identity
It ’s an awful experience when the computer guy shows up at a neighbor ’s doorstep with a plate of Christmas cookies , only to have the child who answered the door call out , “ Mom , the computer guy is here ! ”
He begs for an identity that is not directly associated with computers , but “ the computer guy ” label walks ahead of him — it simply cannot be avoided .
I was given a name and I ’d love to be addressed by it .
Having read these reasons , you may believe that I ’m complaining .
It ’s true that I was upset with many aspects of my life as the computer guy , but I ’m past the point of complaining .
I took a good hard look at my existence and realized that things were not likely to change in the line of work I had chosen .
Instead of just complaining , I took action and began making positive changes in my life .
Working in the computer industry is n’t for everybody .
It was n’t for me .
I ’ve compiled my reasons for putting it behind me and placed them here , so that anyone who is unsatisfied with their life working in computers might recognize it ’s not for them either .

MILAN ( Reuters ) -
If pizza maker Simone Padoan saw a slab of cloned meat in his local supermarket , the Italian chef says he would be too scared to bring it into his kitchen .
Chef Heston Blumenthal blows " ideas " bubbles as part of his presentation in " The Best of Gastronomy . " , a four day conference of international chefs in San Sebastian November 20 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Vincent West
Despite statements by Europe ’s food agency and the main U.S. health agency that cloned food products are safe to eat , Padoan says he wo n’t be serving them in his pizzeria , but will instead make dough from natural ingredients and serve natural beer .
“ I would be afraid to use it .
Maybe ( milk from cloned cows ) is healthier than milk that comes from a cow born naturally ... but all this manipulation scares me , ” he said .
“ At least natural products guarantee a natural aspect -- this is how they are , this is how mother nature made them and I promote them for that . ”
Cloning has been around for years .
Dolly the cloned sheep was born in 1996 .
But the move by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month to lend its support to meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring is likely to mean it will soon enter the food supply .
Europe ’s top food safety agency has also said cloned food products are safe to eat , but has yet to give the green light to marketing cloned food products to consumers .
Chefs at a culinary forum in Milan with Padoan this week said no such products would be appearing in their menus .
“ I would n’t consider it with the knowledge I ’ve got now , ” said chef Heston Blumenthal , famed for his scientific approach to cooking .
“ We do n’t know if they ’re damaging or what damage they do not only to ourselves but also the environment . ”
SEND IN THE CLONES ?
Many consumer and religious groups strongly oppose cloning , which takes cells from an adult and fuses them with others before implanting them in a surrogate mother .
They say scientists do not know enough about its effect on nutrition and biology .
Advocates of livestock cloning say the technology will help produce more milk and lean , tender meat by creating more disease - resistant animals .
They insist it is perfectly safe .
Milan chef Carlo Cracco said he would want to know where the cloned animal had come from and how it had been raised .
“ Already we have difficulty with normal products that are controlled from start to finish .
Can you imagine with these new ones ? ” he said .
For pastry chef Frederic Bau , using cloned milk in desserts is not even a consideration : “ I do n’t dare even think about it . ”
It is believed that it will be years before cloning will be widely used and despite the official safety approvals , it may be consumers who determine how widely it is used .
The European Food Safety Authority has opened a consultation process with member states and industry until February 25 before giving its final opinion in May .
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps , fire - breathing advocate of network neutrality regulation and opponent of media consolidation , has taken a stand on AT&T's now infamous censorship of Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder 's anti-Bush remarks at Lollapalooza .
In an interview with OpenLeft.com 's Matt Stoller , Copps supported the idea that there 's a link between AT&T 's deletion of Vedder 's political comments from a webcast of the concert and the network neutrality fight that 's brewing in the halls of Congress .
" Events like this are connected to the larger issue of network neutrality , so it is very very important , " Copps said in response to a question about whether or not AT&T 's censorship of Vedder has any implications for network neutrality .
He went on to say , " So when something like the episode occurs with Pearl Jam that you 're referencing that ought to concern all of us ... because if you can do it for one group , you can do it to any group and say ' Well , it 's not intentional , ' and things like that .
But nobody should have that power to do that and then be able to exercise distributive control over the distribution and control over the content too .
In the interview , Copps followed other network neutrality supporters in seizing on the incident as a prime example of the need for government regulation of companies like AT&T , in order to prevent them from censoring political speech on the larger Internet .
This is in spite of the fact that from a purely technical standpoint , AT&T 's censorship of Vedder on its own webcast , which is technically content that AT&T " owns " and is responsible for , has little apparent connection to network neutrality .
After all , not even the most ardent net neutrality proponent would suggest that a company should n't be able to censor its own streaming webcasts — content that it funded and that it owns .
However , in spite of the lack of a real technical or even a policy - level connection between what AT&T did to Vedder and the kind of router - level traffic shaping that net neutrality 's supporters are opposed to , the censorship of Vedder 's anti-Bush speech is so germane to the political , " people vs. the powerful " side of the network neutrality debate that it is a PR gaffe of the first order .
AT&T 's trust problems
I said in a previous article on network neutrality that the efforts of some to turn net neutrality into a civil rights and free speech issue was a really bad idea , but AT&T seems bound and determined to make that connection all by themselves .
The basic stance of AT&T and other telcos in the network neutrality debates is this : trust us to carry your network traffic — your video , your emails , you web surfing , and all the other stuff that you watch , read , hear , and say to friends , family , and the world via the Internet ; trust us to handle the connections that you make online , be they personal , political , religious , frivolous , or whatever ; trust us not to use our power over the network to insert unknown third parties and agendas into those connections that you make with the world .
The tenability of this " trust us " premise was already damaged by revelations that AT&T has set up secret rooms at some of its major backbone facilities that let the NSA snoop the nation 's network traffic as it goes over the wire , but ( unfortunately ) not everyone cares so much about faceless NSA snoops picking through their e-mail .
However , this new incident , in which either the company or a party acting on the company 's behalf has censored political criticism of one of the most unpopular presidents in American history , is bound to resonate with a whole new swath of the public .
What 's more , it appears that such political censorship is a pattern for AT&T .
The Daily Swarm brings word from concertgoers , reporters , and even AT&T itself that the network has edited out the political commentary from webcasts of a whole host of concerts across the country .
The bands affected by the censorship range from The Roots to The Flaming Lips , and fan emails are still pouring into blogs and media outlets alleging as - yet unreported censorship incidents .
So this censorship scandal is still growing , and politically ( if not technically ) it strikes at the heart of the " trust us with your communications " premise that forms one of the two central pillars of the telcos ' attacks on network neutrality legislation .
( The other pillar is " Government regulation is scaaaarrryyyy ... big , scary regulations stifle the free market ... " )
If it continues to widen and gain real traction with the public , the concert censorship scandal may turn out to be the own goal that tips the net neutrality game into Copps and company 's favor .
Amid record losses , Wall Street awarded itself $ 39 billion
By Andre Damon
21 January 2008
The five largest Wall Street banks doled out a record $ 39 billion in bonuses last year , according to data collected by the Bloomberg news service .
After driving hundreds of thousands of families into foreclosure , causing a financial crisis affecting hundreds of millions , and pushing the US and world economies closer to recession , it appears Wall Street is rewarding itself for a job well done .
The banks announced record losses in the fourth quarter , wrapping up the financial industry ’s worst year since 2002 .
All in all , Wall Street wrote off more than $ 90 billion in bad debt for the year , and the five largest banks saw their profits drop more than 60 percent .
Three of the five firms posted losses in the fourth quarter .
For all that , the bankers made out like bandits .
Despite the firms ’ abysmal performance , Wall Street buffered its traders from any shocks to their incomes by increasing the ratio of compensation relative to revenues .
Typically , banks try to keep compensation below 50 percent of revenues ; in 2006 , when the five firms paid out some $ 36 billion in year - end bonuses , the figure was approximately 45 percent .
In 2007 , it jumped to more than 60 percent , according to figures released by the New York State Comptroller ’s office .
While the $ 39 billion was divided among 186,000 workers at the five firms — averaging $ 211,849 — the lion ’s share was reserved for a few thousand high - level managers , traders , and senior executives , who took in multimillion - dollar bonuses in addition to their salaries .
Rank - and - file clerical workers took home a few hundred dollars .
Bonuses for traders in subprime - related securities are reported to be about 30 percent lower this year in comparison to other sectors .
Morgan Stanley wrote down some $ 10.3 billion in bad debt in 2007 , but increased its bonus pool by 18 percent all the same .
Its CEO , John Mack , declined his bonus last year after collecting a $ 40 million bonus in 2006 .
E. Stanley O’Neal , the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch , collected a severance package worth some $ 161 million , or 3,500 times the yearly income of a typical US household , after losing his job in October .
Merrill Lynch wrote down some $ 20 billion in subprime debt during the fourth quarter of 2007 , and saw its value reduced by some 43 percent .
Charles O. Prince II , the former CEO of Citigroup , which announced similar losses , will walk away with some $ 68 million .
Lloyd C. Blankfein , the Goldman Sachs CEO , set a new record with his bonus of $ 60.7 million .
The firm put its chips on different numbers than the other banks and had a good year overall .
The firm ’s two co-presidents , Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried , each collected a stock bonus of about $ 40 million , in addition to as - yet undisclosed amounts of cash .
Ike Suri , the managing director of a Finance Executive recruitment firm , told the Los Angeles Times that “ compensation in the brokerage industry is increasingly tied to volatility — so the more volatility in the markets , the more investors are trading and the more they make . ”
He continued , “ The marked increase in volatility in the markets in 2007 really benefited the brokers . ”
Volatility , we might add , which bankers created themselves by gambling — and losing — on risky securities .
The absurdity of this standard is self - evident .
But , for all that , no major public figures have called for the leaders of these banks to be held liable for the destruction they caused , much less even called for hearings into their massive pay .
Executive compensation , we are told , is a private affair between shareholders and executives , whatever its effect may be on the rest of the population .
Outside the mass media , however , these issues are being hotly debated .
In a widely discussed Financial Times column dealing with the issue of banker pay , former IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajan writes that executive compensation practices among Wall Street firms “ probably contributed to the ongoing crisis ” in the financial sector .
Rajan goes on to explain the means by which bank managers systematically underpriced and hid risk with the intent of inflating their personal compensation .
Securities trading , according to Rajan , rests on the ability of funds managers to generate returns over and above market expectations , while minimizing overall risk .
Rajan notes that differences between a security ’s real yield and its evaluated growth potential “ are quite hard to generate since most ways of doing so depend on the investment manager possessing unique abilities — to pick stocks , identify weaknesses in management and remedy them , or undertake financial innovation .
Such abilities are rare .
How then can untalented investment managers justify their pay ?
Unfortunately , all too often it is by creating fake alpha — appearing to create excess returns but in fact taking on hidden tail risks , which produce a steady positive return most of the time as compensation for a rare , very negative , return . ”
The boom of Collateralized Debt Obligations and other risky mortgage - based securities was probably exacerbated by bankers ’ attempts to , in Rajan ’s words , “ create fake alpha , ” that is , to buy securities whose risk was nominally underrated and therefore paid disproportionately high returns .
The foreseeable prospect of the real estate market cooling down , resulting in the writing off of billions of dollars of bad debt , massive losses for shareholders , and turmoil in the wider economy , paled alongside the bankers ’ own grasping for massive amounts of compensation .
For the bank managers themselves , it made perfect sense .
Once the racket that they had been running came to light and the securities they bought rendered worthless , the managers would simply lose their jobs , collect millions in compensation , and move on to some other firm .
This is exactly what happened at Bear Stearns , Merrill Lynch , Citigroup , and others .
The more farsighted representatives of the establishment recognize — at least in part — the dangers posed by unmitigated greed to the long - term stability of the capitalist system .
Martin Wolf , the associate editor of economics at the Financial Times , recently wrote in response to Rajan ’s article : “ I now fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important — the political legitimacy of the market economy itself — across the globe . ”
Wolf proposes that the US government step in to regulate banker pay so as to prevent such discrediting spectacles as those seen on Wall Street in 2007 .
But such action would require an unimaginable sea change in the policies of the US ruling elite , which has sought for the past three decades to break any restrictions on its own blind pillaging of society .
As the Wall Street speculators raked in their bonuses , recent government statistics demonstrate that , for average working people in the US , 2007 spelled a further decline in living standards as consumer prices driven by fuel and food rose sharply and the paltry growth in wages recorded the previous year stalled .
Average weekly wages last year fell approximately 1 percent .
The combination of record bonuses for Wall Street ’s wealthiest and a drop in real wages for hundreds of millions recorded in 2007 is only the latest episode in the protracted process of transferring wealth from masses of working people to a tiny financial elite .
The outcome is a level of inequality that is politically and socially unsustainable and which makes open class struggle inevitable .
This is what is meant by the destruction of “ the political legitimacy of the market economy itself . ”
Jennifer Stoddart , the Privacy Commissioner of Canada , is wary of DRM , and she 's not afraid to tell other branches of government about her concerns .
Stoddart has just sent a public letter to Jim Prentice , the Canadian Minister of Industry , telling him that his impending copyright reform bill should not protect any DRM that gathers and transmits personal data .
Stoddart would n't care much about DRM if it " only controlled copying and use of content . "
But DRM can also collect personal information and send it back to the " copyright owner or content provider , without the consent or knowledge of the user . "
Even if users do find out ( and object ) , they would n't be able to strip the DRM or circumvent it because Prentice 's bill will reportedly contain US - style anti-circumvention provisions .
Jennifer Stoddart
Stoddart points to the Sony BMG rootkit fiasco as a real - world example of the problem .
The Windows - only content protection software included on selected CDs cloaked its presence , collected information about what discs were played , and sent the data ( and a user 's IP number ) to Sony BMG .
That made the software a privacy concern , not just something for IP lawyers to debate .
" That this occurs when individuals are engaged in a private activity in their homes or other places where they have a high expectation of privacy exacerbates the intrusiveness of the collection , " Stoddart wrote .
Her concern in the letter is narrow , but it 's heartening to see parts of the Canadian government , at least , taking issues of consumer privacy seriously .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist , who has spearheaded much of the opposition to Prentice 's bill , says that the letter " provides an important reminder that it is more than just copyright law that hangs in the balance as the government 's plans could ultimately place Canadians ' privacy at risk . "
Prentice had initially readied the bill for presentation late last year , but the media firestorm over its introduction has already delayed it for over a month , with no word on when it will be officially introduced .
Digital fire detection systems such as fire detection cameras can tremendously add to fire safety for small businesses .
You can use these systems for monitoring many places were ordinarily smoke detectors cannot work reliably , for example outdoors if you want to monitor locations such as parking lots or similar spaces .
How Does A Fire Camera Work ?
A fire camera makes use of state - of - the - art image analyzing technology to detect fire smoke from video .
This brings with it the enormous advantage that a fire camera does n’t need to be placed near the potential vicinity of a fire : they can detect fires from several hundred metres away .
In addition to that , fire cameras can also monitor a much larger area as compared to a smoke detector .
For instance , you can use a fire camera to watch an entire building complex or use it to monitor a large open area such as a warehouse or parking lot .
Most ordinary smoke detectors are rather simple devices which may work sufficiently in your own home .
Yet , most of these devices , especially the cheaper types do merely sound an alarm upon detection of a fire .
A fire camera on the other hand can not just reliably detect fires around the clock but can also alert responders once the system detects a fire smoke .
In other words , it works also if you are not present and can thus give you added peace of mind .
One other advantage of fire cameras is that they are back - compatible with ordinarily surveillance cameras .
If you happen to own a business , chances are you have already a CCTV system in place .
You can then simply replace your existing cameras with fire cameras .
The fire cameras will continue to function as ordinary cameras but will also provide you the benefit of dramatically increased fire safety .
Harvesting Waste Heat is Hot Business Concept
February 17th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
We renewable energy advocates love our silicon solar cells , but they come at a price : the process of making silicon generates massive amounts of heat and is a great , big electricity hog .
“ Quartz rocks placed in electric - arc furnaces exude oxygen as superheated gas , leaving molten silicon .
Just venting all that heat without setting something afire is a concern . ” — Jon Van , Chicago Tribune
Now a company has found a way to make money capturing and using that heat , to make steam to run electrical generators .
Illinois company Recycled Energy Development LLC , or RED , announced it has closed a deal with West Virginia Alloys , a silicon making subsidiary of Globe Metallurgical , Inc .
The deal allows West Virginia Alloys to lock in a price for its electricity for 25 years ; since that ’s their largest cost of doing business , they ’re happy .
And since West Virginia ’s electricity comes from burning coal , the state is pretty happy about having a way to help offset the millions of tons of greenhouse gases produced there .
RED is getting big money from a deal made with Denham Capital Management , a private equity firm fueled by $ 1.5 Billion from Bill Gates and Harvard University .

One of the nicest things about prototyping in Smalltalk is that you can delay the need to hook up a database during much of your development , and if you 're lucky , possibly even forever .
It 's a mistake to assume every application needs a relational database or even a proper database at all .
It 's all too common for developers to wield a relational database as a golden hammer that solves all problems , but for many applications , they introduce a level of complexity that can make development feel like wading through a pond full of molasses where you spend much of your time trying to keep the database schema and the object schema in sync .
It kills both productivity and fun , and goddammit , programming should be fun !
This is sometimes justified , but many times it 's not .
Many business applications and prototypes are built to replace manual processes using Email , Word , and Excel .
Word and Excel , by the way , are n't ACID compliant , do n't support transactions , and manage to successfully run most small businesses .
MySql became wildly popular long before it supported transactions , so it 's pretty clear a wide range of apps just do n't need that , no matter how much relational weenies say it 's required .
It should n't come as a surprise that one can take a single step up the complexity ladder and build simple applications that are n't ACID compliant , do n't support transactions , and manage to successfully run most small businesses better than Word and Excel while purposely not taking a further step and moving up to a real database which would introduce a level of complexity that might blow the budget and make the app infeasible .
No object - relational mapping layer ( not even Rails and ActiveRecord ) can match the simplicity , performance , and speed of development one can get just using plain old objects that are kept in memory all the time .
Most small office apps with no more than a handful of users can easily fit everything into memory , this is the idea behind Prevayler .
The basic idea is to use a command pattern to apply changes to your model , you can then log the commands , snapshot the model , and replay the log in case of a crash to bring the last snapshot up to date .
Nice idea , if you 're OK creating commands for every state - changing action in your application and being careful with how you use timestamps so replaying the logs works properly .
I 'm not OK with that , it introduces a level of complexity that is overkill for many apps and is likely the reason more people do n't use a Prevayler like approach .
One might attempt to use the Smalltalk image itself as a database ( and many try ) , but this is ripe with problems .
My average image is well over 30 megs , saving it takes a bit of time and saving it while processing HTTP requests risks all kinds of things going wrong as the image prepares for what is essentially a shutdown / restart cycle .
Using a ReferenceStream to serialize objects to disk Prevayler style , but ignoring the command pattern part and just treating it more like crash proof image persistence is a viable option if your app wo n't ever have that much data .
Rather than trying to minimize writes with commands , you just snapshot the entire model on every change .
This is n't as crazy as it might sound , most apps just do n't have that much data .
This blog , for example , a year and a half old , around 100 posts , 1500 comments , has a 2.1 megabyte MySql database , which would be much smaller as serialized objects .
If you 're going to have a lot of data , clearly this is a bad approach , but if you 're already thinking about how to use the image for simple persistence because you know your data will fit in ram , here 's how I do it .
It only takes a few lines of code in a single abstract class that you can subclass for each project to make a Squeak image fairly robust and crash - proof and more than capable enough to allow you just to use the image , no database necessary .
We 'll start with a class ...
Object subclass : #SMFileDatabase instanceVariableNames : '' classVariableNames : '' poolDictionaries : '' category : ' SimpleFileDb ' SMFileDatabase class instanceVariableNames : ' lock '
All the methods that follow are class side methods .
First , we 'll need a method to fetch the directory where rolling snapshots are kept .
backupDirectory ^ ( FileDirectory default directoryNamed : self name ) assureExistence .
The approach I 'm going to take is simple , a subclass will implement #repositories to return the root object that needs to be serialized , I just return an array containing the root collection of each domain class .
repositories self subclassResponsibility
The subclass will also implement #restoreRepositories : which will restore those repositories to wherever they belong in the image for the application to use them .
restoreRepositories : someRepositories self subclassResponsibility
Should the image crash for any reason , I want the last backup will be fetched from disk and restored .
So I need a method to detect the latest version of the backup file , which I 'll stick a version number in when saving .
lastBackupFile ^ self backupDirectory fileNames detectMax : [ : each | each name asInteger ]
Once I have the file name , I 'll deserialize it with a read - only reference stream ( do n't want to lock the file if I do n't plan on editing it )
lastBackup | lastBackup | lastBackup := self lastBackupFile .
lastBackup ifNil : [ ^ nil ] . ^ ReferenceStream readOnlyFileNamed : ( self backupDirectory fullNameFor : lastBackup ) do : [ : f | f next ]
This requires you to extend ReferenceStream with #readOnlyFileNamed : do : , just steal the code from FileStream so nicely provided by Avi Bryant that encapsulates the #close of the streams behind # do : .
Much nicer than having to remember to close your streams .
Now I can provide a method to restore the latest backup .
Later , I 'll make sure this happens automatically .
restoreLastBackup self lastBackup ifNotNilDo : [ : backup | self restoreRepositories : backup ]
I like to keep around the last x number of snapshots to give me a warm fuzzy feeling that I can get old versions should something crazy happen .
I 'll provide a hook for an overridable default value in case I want to adjust this for different projects .
defaultHistoryCount ^ 15
Now , a quick method to trim the older versions so I 'm not filling up the disk with data I do n't need .
trimBackups | entries versionsToKeep | versionsToKeep := self defaultHistoryCount. entries := self backupDirectory entries .
entries size < versionsToKeep ifTrue : [ ^ self ] . ( ( entries sortBy : [ : a : b | a first as Integer < b first as Integer ] ) allButLast : versionsToKeep ) do : [ : entry | self backupDirectory deleteFileNamed : entry first ]
OK , I 'm ready to serialize the data .
I do n't want multiple processes all trying to do this at the same time , so I 'll wrap the save in a critical section , # trimBackups , figure out the next version number , and serialize the data ( #newFileNamed : do : another stolen FileStream method ) , ensuring to # flush it to disk before continuing ( do n't want the OS doing any write caching ) .
saveRepository | version | lock critical : [ self trimBackups .
version := self lastBackupFile ifNil : [ 1 ] ifNotNil : [ self lastBackupFile name as Integer + 1 ] .
ReferenceStream newFileNamed : ( self backupDirectory fullPathFor : self name ) , '.' , version asString do : [ : f | f nextPut : self repositories ; flush ] ]
So far so good , let 's automate it .
I 'll add a method to schedule the subclass to be added to the start - up and shutdown sequence .
You must call this for each subclass , not for this class itself .
UPDATE : This method also initializes the lock and must be called prior to using # saveRepository , this seems cleaner .
enable Persistence lock := Semaphore forMutualExclusion .
Smalltalk addToStartUpList : self .
Smalltalk addToShutDownList : self
So on shutdown , if the image is going down , just save the current data to disk .
shutDown : isGoingDown isGoingDown ifTrue : [ self saveRepository ]
And on startup , we can #restoreLastBackup .
startUp : isComingUp isComingUp ifTrue : [ self restoreLastBackup ]
Now , if you want a little extra snappiness and you 're not worried about making the user wait for the flush to disk , I 'll add little convenience method for saving the repository on a background thread .
takeSnapshot [ self saveRepository ] forkAt : Processor systemBackgroundPriority named : ' snapshot : ' , self class name
And that 's it , half a Prevayler and a more robust easy to use method that 's a bit better than trying to shoehorn the image into being your database for those small projects where you do n't want to bother with a real database ( blogs , wikis , small apps , etc ) .
Just sprinkle a few MyFileDbSubclass saveRepository or MyFileDbSubclass takeSnapshot 's around your application whenever you feel it important , and you 're done .
Here 's a file out if you just want the code fast , SMFileDatabase.st
