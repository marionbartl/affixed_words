Europarlementariers zijn zakkenvullers
RTL Duitsland ontdekte dat MEP 's nog steeds 14.727 per maand ontvangen door vlak voor het weekend een aanwezigheidslijstje te ondertekenen .
Gelukkig geldt er nog * kuch * genoeg persvrijheid in Brussel .
NOT !
Londenio , a loyal MR reader , asks :
I wanted to ask for
survival tips in case I am unexpectedly transported to a random
location in Europe ( say for instance current France / Benelux / Germany ) in
the year 1000 AD ( plus or minus 200 years ) .
I assume that such
transportation would leave me with what I am wearing , what I know , and
nothing else .
Any advice would help .
I hope you have an expensive gold wedding band but otherwise start off by keeping your mouth shut .
Find someone who will take care of you for a few days or weeks and then look for employment in the local church .
Your marginal product is quite low , even once you have learned the local language .
You might think that knowing economics , or perhaps quantum mechanics , will do you some good but in reality people wo n’t even think your jokes are funny .
Even if you can prove Euler ’s Theorem from memory no one will understand your notation .
I hope you have a strong back and an up to date smallpox vaccination .
Readers , do you have any other tips ?
Is there any way that Londenio can leverage his knowledge of modernity ( he is , by the way , a marketing professor ) into socially valuable outputs ?
Would prattling on about sanitation and communicable diseases do him any good ?
Obama flush with cash , Clinton in debt Associated Press
Published : Monday April 21 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama began the month of April with a 5 - 1 cash advantage over a debt - saddled Hillary Rodham Clinton , setting the stage for his lopsided spending in the crucial primary state of Pennsylvania .
Financial reports filed Sunday by the Democratic presidential candidates with the Federal Election Commission show Clinton had $ 10.3 million in debts at the start of the month and only about $ 9 million cash on hand for the primaries .
Obama reported having $ 42 million for the primary .
Clinton 's red ink poses yet another obstacle to her campaign as she seeks to end the primary season with a string of victories .
She trails Obama in delegates , states won and popular votes .
And she can't dent Obama 's superior fundraising .
The March money positioned Obama to undertake an expensive April campaign in Pennsylvania , where he has spent at least twice as much as Clinton and cut into her lead .
Pennsylvania votes on Tuesday .
Clinton , who had kept pace with Obama financially throughout last year , had even less cash on hand than Republican John McCain .
McCain raised $ 15.2 million in March and had $ 11.6 million in the bank at the start of April .
It was his best fundraising performance of the campaign , coming after he had essentially secured his party 's presidential nomination .
With the Democratic contest still in full boil , McCain has been on the sidelines , saving his money and completing payments on a loan .
Nearly half of Clinton 's debt in March is money owed to the firm of her demoted former chief strategist , Mark Penn .
The report shows that the campaign owes $ 4.6 million to Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates .
The campaign has already paid the firm $ 14 million , including $ 3 million in March for polling and direct mail .
Clinton took away Penn 's role as chief adviser earlier this month after he met with Colombian officials to discuss his private work on behalf of a Colombian free trade agreement , a trade deal Clinton opposes .
Obama 's fundraising in March led all candidates , but was still lower than the mark he set in February , when he raised more than $ 55 million .
The Illinois senator has raised $ 235 million in his campaign .
Money alone has n't guaranteed Obama victories .
He spent $ 30.6 million in March to Clinton 's $ 22 million .
The month began with tough contests in Ohio and Texas .
He lost the popular vote to Clinton in both state primaries even though he outspent her , but he emerged with more delegates in Texas .
His report showed he spent $ 9 million on media advertising in March ; Clinton spent less than a third of that .
Obama spent nearly $ 5 million on telemarketing and $ 3.6 million for travel and lodging .
Clinton spent about $ 5 million on travel and about $ 2 million on phone banks .
Clinton spokesman Jay Carson said Clinton 's online fundraising is on the rise and noted that the March figures do not include the $ 2.5 million she raised last week at an Elton John concert in New York .
Carson said the event 's total sum included money from 6,000 new donors .
In January , Clinton made a $ 5 million personal loan to the campaign .
The campaign has reported no other personal loans since .
McCain 's biggest expense of the month was $ 3 million to Fidelity & Trust Bank to finish paying off a $ 4 million loan that had become the focus of a stalemate between McCain and the FEC .
Campaign finance regulators want to make sure McCain did not use the promise of public financing in the primary to secure the loan .
McCain was eligible for public financing in the primary , but his lawyers said they did not use that eligibility as collateral .
He also refunded donors about $ 3 million in contributions , most of it money he had received for the general election .
The refunds set the stage for McCain to accept about $ 84 million in public funds for the fall campaign .
Candidates who accept public financing cannot raise money from donors for the general election campaign .
In March , his operating expenses were $ 5 million , his smallest monthly expense so far this year .
McCain 's March expenses ranged from $ 758,000 for air charters to $ 151.55 to a Los Angeles florist .
The campaign reported a debt of $ 707,000 , much of it outstanding American Express billings .
McCain had his most fundraising success in California and Florida , each of which yielded more than $ 1 million .
Proving once again that the American people are far ahead of the American politicians ( side note : Dear politicians if you do n’t get your act together we are all going to fire you ) on renewable energy policy .
A vast majority of Americans , across all political parties , overwhelmingly support development and funding of solar energy .
Ninety - one percent of Republicans , 97 percent of Democrats and 98 percent of Independents agree that developing solar power is vital to the United States .
These and other findings were reported today in the SCHOTT Solar Barometer , a nationally representative survey conducted by the independent polling firm , Kelton Research .
The survey revealed that 77 percent of Americans feel that the development of solar power , and other renewable energy sources , should be a major priority of the federal government .
Independent voters felt strongest about this , compared to voters in other political parties , with 86 percent of Independents supporting the statement .
When asked which one energy source they would support if they were President , 41 percent of Americans picked solar .
Solar and wind together were favored nearly 20 times more than coal ( 3 percent ) .
“ These results are an undeniable signal to our elected leaders that Americans want job - creating solar power , now , ” said Rhone Resch , President of the Solar Energy Industries Association ( SEIA ) .
According to the survey , nearly three - quarters of Republicans ( 72 percent ) , Democrats ( 72 percent ) and Independents ( 74 percent ) favor an extension of the federal investment tax credits ( ITC ) as a way to encourage development of solar power and fund continued development of the technology .
In contrast , only 8 percent of Americans believe the ITC should not be extended .
Current federal legislation , which provides incentives to spur the growth of renewable energy , is set to expire at the end of the year .
Experts predict that without long - term renewal of the legislation , the solar energy industry will struggle to maintain its momentum .
According to independent analysis by Navigant Consulting , this would translate into the loss of 39,000 jobs , as well as the loss of nearly $ 8 billion in investments .
When wind is included , 116,000 jobs and $ 19 billion in investment are at risk , according to the report .
“ Solar development means job growth for Americans , by Americans , in an industry that will benefit America . ” said Dr. Gerald Fine , President & CEO of SCHOTT North America .
“ Rather than rely on foreign sources for fuel , the U.S. can aspire to become the world ’s leader in clean energy . ”
Extension of the tax credits continues to be in doubt as the House , Senate and Administration debate differing plans .
In May , the House Ways and Means Committee cleared H.R. 6049 , which would extend the solar investment tax credit for six years .
According to SEIA , this legislation would secure America ’s clean - energy future by closing an income tax loophole enjoyed by hedge - fund managers on their off - shore accounts .
“ The U.S. Senate has an opportunity to act decisively by passing the Renewable Energy & Job Creation Act of 2008 ( H.R. 6049 ) this month .
This is smart policy that will help solar become a powerful economic engine for the country , stabilize energy prices for consumers and businesses and improve America ’s national energy security .
A vote against this bill is a vote against what the vast majority of Americans are demanding , ” said Mr. Resch .
“ When you consider that , according to the American Solar Energy Society , nearly 7,000 gigawatts ( GW ) of solar generation capacity exists in the American Southwest , America is truly a sleeping giant , ” said Dr. Fine .
“ Americans want to wake this giant up . ”
– 98 % of Independents , 97 % of Democrats , and 91 % of Republicans support development of solar .
– 74 % of Independents , 72 % of Democrats and 72 % of Republicans favor extension of Federal tax credits for renewable technologies .
– 77 % of Americans feel Federal government should make solar power development a national priority
Key Data from the SCHOTT Solar Barometer
Question 1 : “ If you became President in 2009 and could choose to provide financial support in ONE of the following energy sources during your term in office , which would you choose ? ”
Solar was picked by 41 % of respondents compared to coal ( 3 % ) , nuclear ( 10 % ) and natural gas ( 15 % )
Renewable energy ( solar or wind ) was selected nearly 20 times more than coal .
Question 2 : “ How important do you think it is for the U.S. to develop and use solar power ? ”
More Independents ( 98 % ) than Republicans ( 91 % ) and Democrats ( 97 % ) said that developing and using solar power was important .
Americans across all major political parties voiced an overwhelming support for solar : 69 % of Independents , 65 % of Democrats and 53 % of Republicans said this was extremely important .
Question 3 : “ What do you think Congress should do ; allow solar power investment tax credits to expire , or renew and extend tax credits to encourage the development of solar power ? ”
70 % of Americans believe Congress should renew and extend the ITC .
Independent voters feel strongly about this matter , with 74 % in favor of renewal vs. 11 % in favor of expiration .
Only 8 % of Americans said Congress ought to allow the ITC to expire .
Question 4 : “ How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following statement :
The development of solar power and other renewable energy sources , including the financial support needed , should be a major priority of the federal government . ”
Nearly eight in ten ( 77 % )
Americans say the development and funding of renewable energy should be a “ major priority ” for the federal government .
More Independents ( 86 % ) than Democrats ( 84 % ) or Republicans ( 75 % ) agree that such support should be a “ major priority . ”
Only one out of ten Americans felt development of solar power should not be a major priority of the federal government .
Fact Sheet on Solar Energy ’s Economic Impact and Potential
Over 4,000 megawatts of utility - scale concentrating solar power projects under contract – enough to power about 1 million homes and provide about $ 15 billion in wages and investment – will be delayed or cancelled if the ITC is not renewed .

In case you are sick of what art museums have to offer ( I am with you ; there is only so much Monet one can take in a lifetime , ) you should try one of the truly bizarre museum options out there .
Here are a few tips from the site Atypical Events :
Mütter Museum aka “ Random body parts ” , Philadelphia : museum of historical pathology containing about 20,000 fluid - preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , models , medical instruments , and memorabilia of famous scientists and physicians ( the secret tumor of Grover Cleveland , the thorax of John Wilkes Booth and a really big 9 - foot colon , for example )
Museum Vrolik aka “ Dead babies in a jar ” , Amsterdam :
It contains more than 5,000 specimens of congenital anomalies , human and animal anatomy , embryology and pathology .
Phallological Museum aka “ Penisland ” , Húsavík , Iceland : museum completely devoted to the field of phallology , the supposed ancient study of the penis and its role in society and history .
Home to 200 penises and penile parts .
Meguro Parasitological Museum aka “ Parasites , warms and leeches ” , Tokyo .
Glass jars filled with formaldehyde preserve these pesky parasites , while terrifying photographs like that of a Japanese dude with elephantiasis of the scrotum depict the damage that they are capable of ( see photo )
Museum of Menstruation and Women ’s Health , Maryland .
The museum walls were covered in tampon and pad advertisements , while female mannequin torsos dressed in rubberized panties and menstrual belts hung from the ceiling or sat on tables in a similar fashion . .

Taj Chahal has thrown himself some great birthday bashes .
He has rented limos to take his friends to San Francisco .
He ’s flown to Vegas .
This year , for his 29th birthday , Chahal decided to do something a bit different :
He hosted a surprise party for 300 total strangers – complete with birthday cake and party favors for everyone – at Martha ’s Kitchen , a San Jose charity that serves meals to the homeless and working poor .
Most of us consider our birthdays as a time to receive , not to give .
So why would this guy celebrate his by feeding the homeless ?
It ’s all about karma , he says .
“ If you are blessed to have the things that you have , then you should share them with others . ”
Chahal has indeed been blessed .
His family moved from India to San Jose when he was 7 .
After graduating from Independence High School , he attended San Jose State University until his younger brother , entrepreneurial prodigy Gurbaksh Chahal , started his first company at age 16 .
Taj , then 19 , dropped out to work with him .
Last year the Chahal brothers sold their latest start - up , BlueLithium , an advertising technology company , to Yahoo for $ 300 million .
So Taj decided to take some time off , but he ’s not the type to veg out in front of the TV all day .
He sat down and made a to - do list :
1 . Get in terrific shape .
2 . Take flying lessons .
3 . Do something really nice for people who need help .
After checking the first two items off the list , he began researching local charities and found a video about Martha ’s Kitchen on YouTube .
“ I was very impressed with the organization .
It ’s very lean .
They really depend on the volunteers . ”
Martha ’s Kitchen , which opened in 1981 next to Sacred Heart of Jesus Church on Willow Street , serves more than 100,000 meals a year .
Everyone is welcome , no questions asked .
A lot of newly rich valleyites would have written a big check , taken the charitable deduction and headed for the spa .
But not this guy .
He called Edita Cruz , who runs Martha ’s Kitchen .
“ I thought he just wanted to volunteer , ” Cruz said .
“ So I showed him around and gave him the usual spiel . ”
Then Chahal shared his plan with her :
“ He said he wanted to buy dinner for everyone .
And he wanted it catered . ”
Cruz has seen a lot of volunteers come through her doors over the years , but this was the first time she ’d heard an offer like this one .
So on Tuesday , when the regulars arrived , they found the dining room decorated with red tablecloths , balloons and festive place mats .
Dinner included ravioli and meat balls , salad , garlic bread and , of course , birthday cake .
The tab came to around $ 8,000 .
Chahal , wearing a black T - shirt , red pants and disposable plastic gloves , walked from table to table , serving juice and accepting thank - yous graciously if a bit self - consciously .
One woman told me she asked him how much money he ’d made .
“ He smiled and said : ‘ Not enough . ’ “
Chahal shrugged off the praise , focusing on his work , breaking into a smile only occasionally .
“ I really want the people to have an experience they will remember , ” he said .
No party is complete without gift bags .
On the way out , everyone received a box lunch and a bright colored bag containing a towel , toothbrush and other useful things .
The kids each got a toy and some treats .
“ This is out of this world , ” said Nancy McCary , who has been eating at the Kitchen every week for three years .
“ I wish Taj the best of luck . ”
Chahal confided that the first time he volunteered at the soup kitchen he found it a bit overwhelming .
“ But you get used to it . ”
In a valley filled with young people who have too much money , I wondered if Chahal was trying to guilt his peers into doing something for others .
But he shrugged off that notion .
“ If someone reads about this and is inspired to do something , that ’s awesome .
But it should really come from the heart . ”
So now that he ’s checked his good deed off his to - do list , does he have plans for other charitable ventures ?
“ In the long term , I want to do something big with philanthropy – scholarships , building schools , that sort of thing , ” he said .
“ You know , when you get closer to the big 3 - 0 you start thinking a lot about your life . ”
In the meantime , he ’s already planning a product upgrade for next year ’s birthday party .
“ I ’ll definitely do this again .
I ’d like to find a way to bring more people in and make it even more special . ”
Spoken like a true entrepreneur .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich warned the House Judiciary Committee that it would be wise not to ignore the 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush last week .
If the committee does not act within a month , he plans to introduce even more articles .
The Ohio Democrat and former presidential candidate tells the Washington Post ’s Sleuth blog that he ’s not giving up his fight to kick Bush out of the White House .
Kucinich tells us he ’s giving the House Judiciary Committee 30 days to act on his resolution proposing 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush or else he ’ll raise even more hell on the House floor .
Thirty - five articles was just the tip of the iceberg .
If Judiciary does nothing , he ’ll go back to the House floor next month armed with nearly twice as many articles .
“ The minute the leadership said ‘ this is dead on arrival ’ I said that I hope they believe in life after death ; because I ’m coming back with it , ” Kucinich vowed in an interview with the Sleuth this week .
“ It ’s not gonna die .
Because I ’ll come back with more articles .
Not 35 , but perhaps 60 articles . ”
Elected on a platform of holding the president accountable , the newly Democratic Congress has nonetheless been unwilling to even consider impeachment .
A Kucinich - sponsored measure to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney was referred to the Judiciary Committee last November ; the Committee has done nothing with it .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declared impeachment “ off the table , ” and Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has been unwilling to cross her .
House Democrats simply do not believe they have enough votes to actually impeach Bush or Cheney , and they are unwilling to dwell on the issue with just a few months left in the current administrations ’ term .
Kucinich told the Sleuth that he plans to sit down with Conyers this week to try to convince the chairman to consider at least one article of impeachment , which accused Bush for waging a war “ based on lies . ”
For Kucinich , impeachment is more than simply a political windmill at which to tilt , he says .
It ’s about preserving the sanctity of the republic ’s founding document .
“ What we ’re witnessing here , ” he says , “ is the not - so - slow - moving destruction of our Constitution . ”
While key players are slugging it out over ISP content filtering , the Federal Communications Commission has released a slew of decisions and announcements about broadband .
They include a new public hearing on broadband network management practices and new rules for telecommunications services in apartment buildings .
And one of the commissioners attempted to ease concerns of the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) over the impact of net neutrality regulations .
( We covered the FCC 's latest data on high speed broadband deployment last night . )
Content filtering flap
Earlier this week , FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein told a symposium on Internet Video Policy that the various net neutrality proposals the agency is considering include " exemptions for illegal activities . "
Content Agenda's Paul Sweeting reports that Adelstein said that the Commission will be " very careful about the use of the Internet for illegal purposes , and that includes the illegal downloading of copyrighted works , which is a very serious problem . "
But , Sweeting adds , that does n't mean Adelstein approves of content filtering .
" The problem is , how can you ever tell what 's illegal ? "
Adelstein asked the gathering .
This issue , of course , flutters close to the heart of the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and MPAA , parties which have filed early and often in the FCC 's proceeding on the matter .
The MPAA 's February 28 statement asserts that " ISPs must be able to use network management techniques to address the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content taking place over their networks , for the benefit of legitimate consumers and subscribers . "
The powerful movie studio lobby filed the comment over a week before taking a public stand against net neutrality at the Showest convention in Las Vegas .
There , MPAA boss Dan Glickman declared that government regulation of the Internet " would impair the ability of broadband providers to address the serious and rampant piracy problems occurring over their networks today . "
The MPAA 's stance has provoked a less publicized but quite furious response from the Independent Film and Television Alliance , whose CEO Jean Prewitt forwarded the IFTA 's statement to the FCC 's net neutrality docket .
Prewitt 's March 14 comment disclosed that the group was " astounded to read " that the MPAA had come out against net neutrality .
Describing the Internet as the only truly open opportunity for independent filmmakers , Prewitt called that hope " threatened by the power of a small number of broadband providers to discriminate unilaterally against some categories of users or types of traffic or to accord preferential treatment to certain content providers over others , all under the ambiguous claim of ' network management ' . "
The issue , Pruitt concluded , " is not whether government should regulate the Internet but whether there will be effective oversight to prevent a handful of corporate giants from imposing their own version of private regulation to the public 's detriment . "
Pruitt denounced Comcast 's recent behavior as an excuse for " private vigilantism to the detriment of legitimate users and innovative service providers . "
Second showdown in Palo Alto
On April 17 , Stanford University will host the FCC 's next hearing on how the Commission should oversee ISP handling of peer - to - peer protocols .
Yesterday 's announcement comes a little over a week after the agency 's chair Kevin Martin spoke at the campus and told an audience that he hopes to complete his investigation of the controversy over Comcast 's ISP practices by June .
The FCC has not disclosed the key participants in the event — a follow up to the agency 's February 25 hearing at Harvard Law School .
But the press release says the Commission will hear from " expert panelists regarding broadband network management practices and Internet - related issues . "
No more telco apartment building monopolies
Meanwhile there 's some good news for broadband - seeking apartment dwellers .
Last November , the FCC banned exclusive deals for cable or satellite video services in apartment buildings .
Now the Commission has extended that policy to telecommunications services .
" Exclusive contracts have blocked access by consumers to competitive and popular ' triple - play ' offerings of voice , video and broadband , " the Commission says .
" Opening the door to competitive telecommunications services will help provide consumers with increased access to and choice of such providers . "
The move gives multiple unit tenants the same options as homeowners , although the announcement does n't say when the new rules will begin .
" Today ’s order provides regulatory parity between telecommunications and video service providers in the increasingly competitive market for bundled services , " the FCC's March 19th Order concludes .
Saturn 's Moon Rhea Also May Have Rings

PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has found evidence of material orbiting Rhea , Saturn 's second largest moon .
This is the first time rings may have been found around a moon .
A broad debris disk and at least one ring appear to have been detected by a suite of six instruments on Cassini specifically designed to study the atmospheres and particles around Saturn and its moons .
" Until now , only planets were known to have rings , but now Rhea seems to have some family ties to its ringed parent Saturn , " said Geraint Jones , a Cassini scientist and lead author on a paper that appears in the March 7 issue of the journal Science .
Jones began this work while at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research , Katlenburg - Lindau , Germany , and is now at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory , University College , London .
Rhea is roughly 1,500 kilometers ( 950 miles ) in diameter .
The apparent debris disk measures several thousand miles from end to end .
The particles that make up the disk and any embedded rings probably range from the size of small pebbles to boulders .
An additional dust cloud may extend up to 5,900 kilometers ( 3,000 miles ) from the moon 's center , almost eight times the radius of Rhea .
" Like finding planets around other stars , and moons around asteroids , these findings are opening a new field of rings around moons , " said Norbert Krupp , a scientist with Cassini's Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research .
Since the discovery , Cassini scientists have carried out numerical simulations to determine if Rhea can maintain rings .
The models show that Rhea 's gravity field , in combination with its orbit around Saturn , could allow rings that form to remain in place for a very long time .
The discovery was a result of a Cassini close flyby of Rhea in November 2005 , when instruments on the spacecraft observed the environment around the moon .
Three instruments sampled dust directly .
The existence of some debris was expected because a rain of dust constantly hits Saturn 's moons , including Rhea , knocking particles into space around them .
Other instruments ' observations showed how the moon was interacting with Saturn 's magnetosphere , and ruled out the possibility of an atmosphere .
Evidence for a debris disk in addition to this tenuous dust cloud came from a gradual drop on either side of Rhea in the number of electrons detected by two of Cassini 's instruments .
Material near Rhea appeared to be shielding Cassini from the usual rain of electrons .
Cassini's Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument detected sharp , brief drops in electrons on both sides of the moon , suggesting the presence of rings within the disk of debris .
The rings of Uranus were found in a similar fashion , by NASA 's Kuiper Airborne Observatory in 1977 , when light from a star blinked on and off as it passed behind Uranus ' rings .
" Seeing almost the same signatures on either side of Rhea was the clincher , " added Jones .
" After ruling out many other possibilities , we said these are most likely rings .
No one was expecting rings around a moon .
" One possible explanation for these rings is that they are remnants from an asteroid or comet collision in Rhea 's distant past .
Such a collision may have pitched large quantities of gas and solid particles around Rhea .
Once the gas dissipated , all that remained were the ring particles .
Other moons of Saturn , such as Mimas , show evidence of a catastrophic collision that almost tore the moon apart .
"
The diversity in our solar system never fails to amaze us , " said Candy Hansen , co-author and Cassini scientist on the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Many years ago we thought Saturn was the only planet with rings .
Now we may have a moon of Saturn that is a miniature version of its even more elaborately decorated parent .
" These ring findings make Rhea a prime candidate for further study .
Initial observations by the imaging team when Rhea was near the sun in the sky did not detect dust near the moon remotely .
Additional observations are planned to look for the larger particles .
The Cassini -Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument was designed , built and is operated by an international team led by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University , Laurel , Md. For information on the Cassini mission , visit : http://www.nasa.gov/cassini and http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov
No one was prepared for the storm when it hit .
The levees meant to protect us had long since been breached , and key officials had already left town .
The well - to - do were assured of rescue , but for everyone else trapped inside the Superdome in a fast - flooding region , there was no evacuation plan in sight .
The Bush administration , of course , claimed that it was in control and the president was already assuring his key officials that they were doing a heck of a job .
No , I ’m not talking about post - Katrina New Orleans .
That was so then .
I ’m talking about the housing and credit crunches , as well as the Bear Stearns bailout , that have given the term “ bear market ” new meaning .
Now , do n’t get me wrong  when it comes to the arcane science of economics , like most Americans , I ’d benefit from an “ Economics for Dummies ” course .
What I do know something about , though , is history , a subject that has n’t been on the Bush administration ’s course curriculum since the president turned out not to be Winston Churchill and conquered Iraq refused to morph into occupied Germany ‘ n ’ Japan 1945 .
History may not repeat itself , but the administration ’s repetitive acts these past seven years make an assessment of our economic situation possible , even if you are an economics dummy .
Just consider the record : Administration officials proved incapable of rebuilding two countries that their military occupied and damaged .
In Afghanistan and Iraq , while talking up the president ’s “ freedom agenda , ” they were the equivalent of a natural disaster , a whirlwind of destruction .
In the case of Iraq , in disbanding its military , its government , and even its economy , they were literal nation - wreckers .
On taking Baghdad , their first act of omission was to let the capital be looted .
( “ Stuff happens , ” commented Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the time . )
Soon after , the administration ’s new viceroy in Baghdad , L. Paul Bremer III , promptly plunged the country into the equivalent of the Great Depression  without a Bear Stearns bailout in sight .
In the case of Afghanistan , only a staggering boom in opiate growing  the country now supplies an estimated 93 percent of the global market in illegal opiates , bringing about $ 4 billion into the country  has slightly offset the disaster of “ liberation . ”
By just about any other measure , Afghanistan is a wreck .
In the case of New Orleans , the Bush administration not only could n’t rebuild an American city that nature ( and the Army Corps of Engineers ) damaged , but turned a natural disaster into a man-made catastrophe that has yet to end .
Despite a reputation for being the most disciplined , tough , and focused administration in memory , Bush ’s men and women could n’t even secure their fondest inside - the - Beltway dream : constructing a generation - long Pax Republicana in Washington .
In fact , it looks suspiciously as if Republicans in the House and Senate , fleeing Congress as if it were New Orleans  it ’s politely called “ retirement , ” not cutting and running  could even be swept into minority status for a generation .
And now , with a mere 10 “ lame duck ” months to go , comes the American economy
You do n’t faintly need to understand economics to grasp the immediate danger .
The people overseeing the handling of this crisis have done little these last years but hand money over to the rich , while running American power into the dirt .
Let me review our history lesson for a moment :
No to nation - rebuilding , no to city - rebuilding , no to congressional majority - building
Who dares imagine that the people who brought you Iraq , the war , could begin the rebuilding of an economy , or even successfully caulk the cracks in the levees of a system that , in its complexity , puts Iraq ’s feeble economy to shame ?
In some ways , an administration  whatever its periodic changes of personnel  can be compared to an individual .
At a certain age , its urges become predictable , its habits set , its limits largely known .
While change may be possible , you would n’t want to bet your house on it .
So what exactly has the Bush administration proven itself good at ?
The twin skills of destruction and looting would stand at the top of any list .
Perhaps that ’s because it chose to put its “ eggs ” in only two baskets  those of the U.S. military and crony corporations .
Awed by the shock - and - awe force of forces that fell into their hands , administration officials moved to transfer as many powers of civil governance as possible to the Pentagon .
From diplomacy to disaster relief , nation - building to intelligence gathering , an organization built only to destroy was designated as the go - to outfit for activities normally associated with those who have building in mind .
At the same time , the government was being staffed , top - to - bottom , with ill - prepared political pals , while a small set of crony corporations , of which Halliburton is certainly the best known , was given the nod in every rebuilding situation .
It really did n’t matter where you looked , they were the ones camped out , making money , on the landscape of destruction .
With their no -bid , cost - plus contracts , these companies ran up the hours and then tended to jump ship when the going got bad .
The same corporations that had essentially looted Iraq  it was labeled “ reconstruction ”  were the first ones called in when New Orleans went down .
( Of the initial six contracts the Bush administration offered for the reconstruction of the city , five went to companies previously involved in Iraq ’s reconstruction program . )
Unsurprisingly , the Bush administration has proved serially incapable of building anything , even  in the long run  their own machine .
And , from the Enron moment to the Bear Stearns one , whenever it looked like the Titanic might have hit an iceberg , it was a lock that those passengers assigned to the limited places in the lifeboats would n’t be from steerage ( or be weighed down with subprime mortgages ) .
So rebuilding .
No .
Saving people who are n’t already friends .
No .
Doing a heck of a job in a crisis .
No .
Now , our latest and greatest crisis is upon us , the sort that , in a matter of weeks , has sent media commentators and pundits from reluctant discussions of whether we might be heading into a recession straight to references to the “ d ” word , “ 1929 , ” and the Great Depression .
And they ’re not alone .
A recent USA Today / Gallup poll indicates that a startling 59 percent of Americans already believe we ’re heading for a long - term depression , not a recession ( and 79 percent are worried about the possibility ) .
Leave the definitional details to the experts .
Most Americans have undoubtedly assessed the Bush administration ’s proven incapacity in perilous times and drawn the logical conclusions .
Ten months is a long , long time when only their hands are near the pilot ’s wheel of the ship of state and water ’s already seeping through the hull .
It ’s an eon for an administration capable of sinking New Orleans in a matter of days , and Iraq in little more than months .
Or , thought of another way , it ’s plenty of time if your expertise happens to lie in deconstruction .
After all , barring a miracle , you ’re talking about the little administration that could n’t , no matter how hard Ben Bernanke may try .
So , even if you , like me , know next to nothing about economics , you already know enough to be afraid , very afraid .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
On any given day amidst a backdrop of buses , buildings , cars and construction sites , Richard Reynolds can be found bent over pulling weeds , planting flowers or maybe even trimming some shrubs .
Guerrilla gardeners cultivate what was once a patch of derelict land in London .
more photos »
Sometimes he does it in the morning or in the early afternoon .
Often he goes out in the middle of the night because , he says , it 's calmer then , with only him and the plants and the city lights and the stars -- and also because , in the darkness , he 's less likely to be arrested for digging up land that does n't belong to him .
" I have been stopped by the police and threatened with arrest , which was very depressing , " said Reynolds .
" They insisted I stop , which I did , but I went back an hour and a half later and finished off the job . "
Reynolds calls himself a guerrilla gardener -- a horticultural warrior who fights battles with flower bulbs instead of bombs to try to reclaim urban turf that has been neglected or altogether forgotten and beautify it back into green space for the enjoyment of all .
The first piece of land he conquered was a tiny bricked - in plot outside the entrance of his apartment building in the London Borough of Southwark .
It was filled with nothing but compacted dirt , trash and weeds .
" Presumably at one time it had been beautiful , " Reynolds told CNN .
He then moved onto bigger beds ( that also did n't belong to him ) down by the street , venturing out at 2 a.m. with fistfuls of flowers for residents to find afresh in the morning .
" I felt like Father Christmas or the Tooth Fairy , " he said .
And now , four years after Reynolds planted the first illegal seed , a grassroots guerrilla gardening movement has sprouted up around him , with thousands of revolutionaries throughout the world who are armed and ready with rakes and shovels to turn areas of urban decay into springy patches of peonies and sunflowers .
Watch Richard Reynolds and his guerrilla gardeners in action . »
In London alone , Reynolds has led dozens of covert digs with hundreds of flower - empowered followers to transform derelict dirt on street corners , roadways and roundabouts into places of rediscovered horticultural beauty -- one of his favorite projects , Reynolds says , is a lavender field planted in a once - barren median on Westminster Bridge Road .
Other avant - garde gardening clubs operate in cities like Paris , Berlin , Tokyo and New York , where the Green Guerrillas , one of the first guerrilla groups , was founded by artist Liz Christy in 1973 .
" I really think it is kind of a win - win situation , " said Reynolds .
" The authorities or whoever owns the land is getting it improved if it is neglected . "
Most of the time , the guerrilla gardeners ' gardens are gardens of peace unless , of course , landowners decide they do n't want them there , which , with the exception of an angry bar owner in east London , usually never happens -- a spokesperson for London 's Metropolitan Police Service said that while he had never heard of the seed - sowing bandits , any criminal activity -- even illicit gardening -- is discouraged and would be subject to prosecution .
Yet on increasingly common occasions , local governments and landowners have actually legitimized some of the illegal flower patches , granting their gardeners permission to plant them and thus rendering them no longer guerrilla .
This happened with Esther Jury 's moonlight gardening in abandoned beds around her tower block in the London neighborhood of Islington .
After arranging a meeting with her residents association , Jury was given the ( green ) thumbs up to continue working the land and just last year , her apartment complex was recognized by Britain 's Royal Horticultural Society for its exemplary blossoms .
See images of Esther Jury 's gardens and others . »
Reynolds has also received permission to plant tiger lilies , poppies or whatever other flower he wants in the beds below his tower block in Southwark .
" It is now an official sort of public community gardened voluntary space , " he said .
" Long may it last . "
Other covert horticulturalists have even inspired local residents to get involved in the greening .
On Andy Beauchamp 's street in the notoriously irritable south London neighborhood of Peckham , for example , almost every single doorstep is dressed with flower - filled planters and over - flowing window boxes after Beauchamp decided one day to start sticking plants in front of his neighbors ' homes .
Much to his pleasant surprise , many of his neighbors started to care for them and even began adding more .
Now the tiny residential row has garden parties and other get - togethers along with bumblebees and birds .
" It is greener and in many ways a lot safer , " said Beauchamp .
" You are unlikely to get crime in a place that looks attractive . "
A similar story has sprouted on Sean Canavan 's street near Camden Market in north London where , almost a decade ago , Canavan began planting Busy Lizzies and hollyhocks underneath all the cherry trees that line his road .
Canavan does most of his digging in the dark -- not because he 's trying to hide but because he 's almost completely blind and the sunlight hurts his eyes .
He took up gardening after losing his sight because , he says , it was the only thing he could find to do that made him feel good .
" It has given me a lot of confidence in myself and makes me feel useful and worthwhile , " he told CNN .
" It gives me a purpose and is something I enjoy . "
Now on any given day , Canavan can be found with his guide dog Khara walking up and down his street carrying water jugs to his Busy Lizzies and hollyhocks .
And sometimes on warm breezy summer afternoons like this one , he pauses to see if he can see what he has grown .
" I do n't know what color those flowers are , " he says while stopped in front of a giant hollyhock that has taken two years to grow .
" Are they yellow ?
I like the yellow ones . "

A recent poll taken by CNN found that US drivers fear the possibilities of shortages more than they fear higher prices :
A CNN / Opinion Research poll released Tuesday shows that 55 % of those surveyed are more worried about long lines at gas stations and rationing than about the high prices that drivers have paid in recent months .
The poll shows 40 % of the respondents are more concerned about the high prices .
While gas rationing is not expected at this time , it was a hallmark of the 1970s - era energy crisis , when drivers lined up outside gas stations and sales of gas were limited to certain days of the week .
However , at that time , gas was in short supply , which is not the case today .
Meanwhile , Congress has been stopped in an attempt to create the very thing that motorists fear most .
Among the things that were in the bill that has been successfully filibustered by the Republicans :
The windfall profits bill would have imposed a 25 percent tax on profits over what would be determined " reasonable " when compared to profits several years ago .
The oil companies could have avoided the tax if they invested the money in alternative energy projects or refinery expansion .
It also would have rescinded oil company tax breaks — worth $ 17 billion over the next 10 years — with the revenue to be used for tax incentives to producers of wind , solar and other alternative energy sources as well as for energy conservation .
The legislation also would : Require traders to put up more collateral in the energy futures markets and open the way for federal regulation of traders who are based in the United States but use foreign trading platforms .
The measures are designed to reduce market speculation .
Make oil and gas price gouging a federal crime , with stiff penalties of up to $ 5 million during a presidentially declared energy emergency .
Authorize the Justice Department to bring charges of price fixing against countries that belong to the OPEC oil cartel
Anyone familiar with modern politics knows that Republicans and Democrats regularly vie with each other to see who can be more economically illiterate , but it seems that with this proposed legislation , Democrats are determined to take the lead and cripple the US oil industry permanently .
It is a shame that for all the years Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House they could not come up with any decent energy - based legislation , but at least we can now be thankful for small favors that Republicans seem to have " discovered " the evils of federal regulation of oil markets .
Instead of looking at this situation squarely and putting together the obvious pieces , it seems that the political classes in this country have decided that supply and demand really do n't matter at all , and that all commodity prices are simply arbitrarily administered by people who are impervious to the desires of consumers .
Such a view permits the political classes to ride in as heroes .
However , in this story , instead of saving the town from the bad guys , the " heroes " burn it down and then claim to be liberators .
In examining the latest follies from Washington , let me emphasize again that it is not Republican versus Democrat , although that might be the assumption from the latest oil votes .
If the Republicans really believed that free markets were the best way to produce and sell oil and gasoline , then they would have pushed — and passed — legislation that would have made it easier for energy firms to produce .
They did not , and one wonders if the whole episode of the successful filibuster was just one more cynical political ploy that both parties do as a matter of course .
That being said , I still wish to fully examine the filibustered legislation to demonstrate just how destructive it would have been had it become law .
Thus , I look at each of the particulars and explain why they were so bad .
The " Windfall Profits " Tax
It is hard to believe that legislation that was a failure nearly three decades ago would be trotted out now as a " fix " for higher prices .
Legislators are angry that oil companies are making large profits during a time when gasoline prices are very high , but this has been the usual response whenever prices increase , and this situation is no exception .
I have written before on the subject of high prices and high profits .
Politicians insist that the causality chain runs from profits to prices when , in reality , it is the other way around .
Oil companies are making large profits because they purchased the factors of production at relatively low prices and are able to sell their products for more than the company managers and the factor owners projected at the time of the agreement to sell .
However , record profits also mean better opportunities for recapitalization and new exploration .
If executives are not investing many of their profits into exploration and new equipment , then it means that they do not have confidence in the future .
This would not be because oil suddenly will be unprofitable , but rather because oil executives have no confidence in the political classes .
Indeed , the prospect of a huge tax on profits — a tax that would be levied specifically at one industry on top of other taxes the oil industry pays — means that if oil companies are successful at their endeavors , Congress will single them out for special punishment .
Congress wants to do what dictators have always done : steal the property of people who cannot defend themselves against the encroachment of the state .
Thus , by threatening to confiscate the oil profits , Congress is encouraging the industry not to invest in new capital and not to increase oil supplies .
This is no idle threat .
The Mexican national oil company , PEMEX , which came from " nationalized " oil firms , is woefully undercapitalized , as oil profits have been spent on political favors and other things that have ensured that old equipment will not be replaced .
It also means that PEMEX does not have the capital to explore many of the vast oil regions of the Gulf of Mexico , which means the firm is missing out on many opportunities .
Indeed , the spate of nationalization that occurred during the 1950s and beyond has meant that oil production is lower than it could have been had private companies been left alone .
Unfortunately , in this politicized age , private production has been equated with " exploitation , " which means that socialist firms will continue to dominate the oil business .
Regulation of Futures Markets in Oil
Not surprisingly , Congress has joined the ancient chorus of " blame the speculators . "
Yes , we are supposed to believe that after years of suffering under $ 20 - a - barrel prices , the evil speculators suddenly conspired to jack up the price of oil .
Far from being " faceless " villains , the " speculators " are people purchasing future contracts for oil ( and other commodities ) to ensure that they will have supplies in the future .
They represent firms that purchase gasoline and oil contracts and they have no interest in jacking up the price for its own sake .
As economist Walter Williams has written ,
The futures market , which takes into account both the present and the future availability of goods , is a vital part of a smoothly functioning economy .
Unfortunately , that fact provides little comfort to people frustrated over the high prices of food and fuel .
As such , it provides fodder for political demagogues , charlatans and quacks who rush in with blame and prepare " solutions " for the problems they themselves have created — the high prices for food and fuel are directly linked to the policies of the White House and Congress .
Government regulation of the futures markets in oil would simply make the markets more chaotic , less predictable , and would guarantee prices that would be higher in the absence of a free - flowing market .
( Yes , yes , government regulators claim that they will make the markets more " fair " and predictable , but we know how specious those claims really are . )
Criminalizing Higher Oil and Gasoline Prices
When in doubt , Congress makes something a crime .
Keep in mind that while they are first speaking of $ 5 million fines , ultimately they will be throwing people in prison for " economic crimes , " and " speculation , " which was the hallmark of the former Soviet Union .
Furthermore , " the power to declare an economic emergency " is a nice euphemism for dictatorship .
The Congress — which claims that it really does believe in separation of powers — wants to endow the president of the United States with the power to declare " economic emergencies , " and if people afterward raise the prices of oil ( or , most likely , anything else ) , they will ultimately be fined into bankruptcy or thrown into prison .
These are draconian price controls , only a little bit below the declarations of the Roman Emperor Diocletian , who pronounced the death penalty for anyone who violated his orders on price controls .
I would suppose it is progress that the Democrats in Congress only want to imprison but not execute anyone who disobeys the president 's edicts on price controls , but somehow I do not think this is a hopeful trend .
The price controls during the 1970s were the fundamental cause of the huge gasoline shortages that consumers today are fearing .
Those of us who braved the gas lines of the 1970s also remember the horrible rhetoric that came from Congress and from President Jimmy Carter , who constantly railed against the oil companies and pushed his own " windfall profits tax " through an eager Congress .
( The tax was ultimately repealed in the 1980s , but only after doing substantial damage to the oil industry .
After the tax was repealed , oil and gasoline prices fell . )
Congress is now demanding the same conditions as were experienced in the 1970s , and when the inevitable gasoline lines appear with the inevitable shortages , they will then bring oil executives before Congress to be pilloried , attacked , and almost certainly charged with federal crimes that will land them in prison for many years .
At that point , there really will be little difference between the government of the United States and the government of the Soviet Union .
Sue OPEC
When in doubt , enrich the trial lawyers , who make up one of the most important constituencies for the Democratic Party .
One can only imagine what would happen if the US government sued OPEC nations in US federal courts .
First , they would be true kangaroo courts , as one can imagine that US juries would dutifully bring judgments against Libya , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , and other countries .
That the entire thing would be a farce is another matter .
Despite how all the Democrats and others in the political classes decry the loss of respect the US government now receives because of its global wars , one cannot imagine how badly such legal action would tarnish what is left of the US reputation .
The most important thing , of course , is that such litigation would only make oil more costly and further aggravate international resentment of US meddling .
Economic illiteracy has always been a hallmark of government , and the current set of actors in Washington , DC is no exception .
In these troubled times , one wishes that someone in political authority had even an inkling of what is needed to deal with the current situation in oil markets .
Instead , we have bluster , threats , and measure after measure that would further strangle and regulate production of oil and oil - related products .
Congress always tells us that it knows best , but once again , we see nothing but economic ignorance from Washington 's finest .
For now , they have been held back by a filibuster , but I fear that such a reprieve is only temporary — that Congress and the others in political power in this country will not be satisfied until they have fully destroyed the US economy and replaced it with something we thought would disappear when the Iron Curtain finally fell so many years ago .
AUGUST 3 , 1964 : PRESIDENT JOHNSON DISCUSSES AN INCIDENT IN THE GULF OF TONKIN WITH DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT S. McNAMARA ( IN TWO CONVERSATIONS )
On August 2 , 1964 , the American destroyer Maddox , on patrol off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , was attacked by several North Vietnamese torpedo boats .
The attack happened hours after South Vietnamese raiders struck at two targets on the North Vietnamese coast as part of a U.S. program of graduated covert pressure against the North that was known as Operations Plan ( OPLAN ) - 34A .
This marked the beginning of a series of events that has come to be called the Tonkin Gulf incident .
The Maddox was actually on an intelligence mission off the northern coast , carrying with a van of extra communications and electronics gear along with a complement of specialists from the Naval Security Group , a naval complement to the National Security Agency .
Their task was to intercept North Vietnamese communications .
The ship was in international waters when attacked , but had been inside territorial waters claimed by North Vietnam when Hanoi 's torpedo boats were sent to sea .
Vietnamese authorities have disclosed that the response was ordered by local commanders without reference to Hanoi .
The Maddox did not expect any attack - the mission commander had been briefed in Taiwan previously that there would be none - but she was also completely unaware of the provocation to North Vietnam that had occurred simultaneously in the form of the OPLAN - 34A strikes .
There was no real surprise , however .
The North Vietnamese torpedo boats ' communications were intercepted , as well as the orders sending them out , and the craft were detected as they approached the U.S. warship .
In the ensuing battle two of the three boats were sunk and the third badly damaged , with no losses to the Maddox .
The action in the Tonkin Gulf took place in the afternoon local time , which was before dawn in Washington , and by early morning in the capital there was a scramble to decide what to do about the situation .
This telephone call represents the first conversation between President Johnson and defense secretary Robert McNamara on the incident .
Johnson had already had some conversations with political advisers , and it is noteworthy that his talk with McNamara centers on handling political aspects of the incident .
It is also notable that McNamara in this conversation clearly favors explaining to Congress the link between the incident and the OPLAN - 34A activities .
McNamara would take the position in later public hearings that he was unaware of any such link and as a result would be the target of intense criticism .
LBJ himself was well aware of the connection and had explained it to an adviser in a different conversation less than an hour earlier .
The president here tells McNamara to limit discussion to key congressional figures , including Speaker of the House John McCormick , Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , and Minority Leader Everett Dirksen .
From this telephone call it appears that McNamara 's later public comments were made under instruction from Lyndon Johnson .
Clip 1 : Lyndon B. Johnson
Monday , August 3 , 1964 , 10:30 A.M. ( 3:34 )
Telephone Conversation with Robert McNamara , Secretary of Defense ,
Regarding the Gulf of Tonkin Incident (s ) Involving the Destroyer U.S.S. Maddox President Lyndon B. Johnson : Now I wonder if you do n't think it'd be wise for you and Rusk to get Mac , uh , the Speaker and Mansfield to call a group of fifteen to twenty people together eh from the Armed Services and Foreign Relations to tell them what happened .
A good many of them are saying to me
Secretary Robert McNamara : Right .
I 've been thinking about this myself , and I thought that uh
President Johnson :
They 're going to start an investigation
Secretary McNamara : Yeah .
President Johnson : if you do n't .
Secretary McNamara : Yeah .
President Johnson :
And you got Dirksen up there
Secretary McNamara : Yeah
President Johnson : and he 's saying you 've got to study it further , and say to Mansfield , " Now the President wants us , you , to get the proper people . "
And we come in and you say , " They fired at us .
We responded immediately .
And we took out one of their boats and put the other two running .
And we kept our ... , we 're puttin ' our boats right there , and we 're not running on in . "
Secretary McNamara :
And it 's hard to destroy .
President Johnson :
That 's right
Secretary McNamara : Right .
And we 're going to , and I think I should also , or we should also at that time , Mr. President , explain this Op Plan 34 - A , these covert operations .
There 's no question but what that had bearing on .
And on Friday night , as you probably know , we had four TP [ McNamara means PT ] boats from Vietnam manned by Vietnamese or other nationals , attack two is lands .
And we expended , oh , a thousand rounds of ammunition of one kind or another against them .
We probably shot up a radar station and a few other miscellaneous buildings .
And following twenty - four hours after that , with this destroyer in that same area , undoubtedly led them to connect the two events .
President Johnson :
Well say that to Dirksen .
Secretary McNamara :
That 's what I know he 'll like .
President Johnson :
You notice Dirksen says this morning , that " we got to reassess the situation , do something about it . "
I 'd tell him that we 're doing what he 's talking about .
Secretary McNamara :
Well , I , I was , I was thinking doing this myself in personal visits .
But I think your thought is better .
We 'll get the group together .
You want us to do it at the White House or would you rather do it at State or Defense ?
President Johnson : I believe it'd be better to do it uh up on the Hill .
Secretary McNamara :
All right .
President Johnson : I believe it'd be better if you say to Mansfield , " You call "
Secretary McNamara : Yup
President Johnson : Foreign Relations
Secretary McNamara : Yup , OK .
President Johnson : Armed Services
Secretary McNamara : OK .
OK .
President Johnson : and and get Speaker to do it over on his side [ i.e. , within the House of Representatives , as opposed to the Senate ] .
Secretary McNamara :
We 'll do it
President Johnson :
And just say it 's very , I 'd tell him awfully quiet , though , so they wo n't go in and be making a bunch of speeches .
And tell Rusk that a , that 's my idea .
Secretary McNamara : Great . .
President Johnson :
And he's in New York , so I do n't know whether 's he 's got back .
Secretary McNamara :
Well I just talked to George Ball a few minutes ago , and I 'll have George arrange it .
Or at least I 'll tell him that , and then I 'll call the Speaker and Mansfield himself .
President Johnson : Now I wish that uh you 'd give me some guidance on what we ought to say .
I want to leave an impression on the background in the people we talk to over here that we 're gonna be firm as hell without saying something that 's dangerous .
Now what do you think ?
Uh , uh , the people that are calling me up , I just talked to a New York banker , I just talked to a fellow in Texas , they all feel that the Navy responded wonderfully and that 's good .
But they want to be damned sure I do n't pull 'em out and run , and they want to be damned sure that we 're firm .
That 's what all the country wants because Goldwater 's raising so much hell about how he 's gonna blow 'em off the moon , and they say that we oughten to do anything that the national interest does n't require .
But we sure oughta always leave the impression that if you shoot at us , you 're going to get hit .
Secretary McNamara :
Well I think you would want to instruct George Reedy this morning at his news conference to say that you you personally have ordered the , the Navy to carry on the routine patrols uh off the coast of North Vietnam , uh to add an additional destroyer to the one that has been carrying on the patrols , to provide an air cap , and to issue instructions to the commanders to destroy any uh force that attacks our force in international waters .
President Johnson : [ speaks over McNamara ]
Bob , if you do n't mind ,
Secretary McNamara : . . .
I think that 's the way ...
President Johnson :
If you do n't mind , call Walter Jenkins and tell him
Secretary McNamara : Sure
President Johnson : that you want to dictate this to me
Secretary McNamara : I 'll do it right now
President Johnson : to give to my people or George Reedy because I 'm over at the Mansion with some folks here
Secretary McNamara : I 'll do it right now .
President Johnson : OK .
Right .

Monday , August 3 , 1964 , 1:21 P.M. ( 1:42 )
Telephone Conversation with Robert McNamara , Secretary of Defense ,
Regarding the Gulf of Tonkin Incident President Lyndon B. Johnson : Yes ?
Secretary Robert McNamara : Mr. President , I set up those meetings for this afternoon with the Senate and House leaders and I thought if it was agreeable with you , I would say to them that some months ago you asked us to be pre pared for any eventuality in the Southeast Asia area and as a result of that we have prepared and just completed in great detail target analyses of the targets of North Vietnam .
As a mailer of fact in ten minutes I 'm going over with the Chiefs [ the Joint Chiefs of Staff ] the final work on this .
We have pictures , analyses , numbers of sorties , bomb loadings , everything prepared for all the target systems of of North Vietnam , and I would describe this to the the leaders , simply indicating your desire that we be fully prepared for whatever may develop .
And furthermore we 've prepared detailed movement studies of any contingency forces required , air squadrons , et cetera .
President Johnson :
So obviously now , if you go put this in the paper ...
Secretary McNamara : Yeah , and I , I 'm going to tell 'em that
President Johnson : and your enemy reads about it then he thinks we 're already taking off and obviously you 've got us in a war .
But I 've got to be candid with you and I want to tell you the truth .
Secretary McNamara : Exactly .
I was going to start my remarks by that , but be damn sure it does n't , or try to be sure it does n't get in the paper .
President John
And uh , uh I think it 's right , and I , I will tell 'em that yesterday morning that uh , uh they reported the Maddox incident and uh during the day yesterday we sent we sent out this order and read them the statement I made this morning .
Secretary McNamara : Right , I 'll do that .
President Johnson :
And , so that Dirksen does n't think that we have to wait on him , and that we ...
Secretary McNamara : Yeah .
President Johnson : did go out when .
Secretary McNamara :
Yes , I 'll tell them the order went out yesterday and you were simply repeating it to the press this morning .
President Johnson : OK .
AUGUST 1964 : THE GULF OF TONKIN INCIDENT CONTINUES - PRESIDENT JOHNSON DISCUSSES BOMBING NORTH VIETNAM WITH ROBERT S. McNAMARA ( IN FOUR CONVERSATIONS )
Following the original incident of August 2 , the Johnson administration wanted to underline its belief that U.S. Navy warships had the freedom to pass any where in international waters , naturally including most of the Gulf of Tonkin .
Consequently President Johnson approved a move under which the destroyer Maddox was reinforced by the C. Turner Joy , and both ships entered the Gulf together .
With the American warships in a state of hyperalert , on the night of August 3/ 4 the warships recorded a series of sound ( sonar ) and electronic ( radar ) readings interpreted to be attacking torpedo boats .
Amid the confusion of that night , radio signals pertaining to the August 2 incident were read as Hanoi ordering a fresh attack , and expectant sailors on watch saw things they decided were enemy boats .
Washington was initially told the warships were under attack .
Although the commander on the scene , Captain John D. Herrick , quickly amplified the initial , excited reports with one stating he doubted the reality of the attacks , Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp nevertheless proceeded as if the attacks were genuine .
Because of the time difference between Washington and the Tonkin Gulf , and the time needed to transmit and receive messages from the remote naval forces involved , this sequence of President Johnson telephone calls on August begins at a moment when Washington was as yet unaware of the claimed second attack .
McNamara 's statement in the 9:43 AM .
conversation that " this ship is allegedly to be attacked tonight " is highly significant - it means that Washington was already operating on the basis of the radio intercepts mistakenly attributed to August 4th .
Equally important , LBJ and McNamara discuss retaliatory action against North Vietnam in spite of the fact that no attack has yet occurred .
Also of interest is President Johnson 's statement that the United States " should pull one of these things that you 've . . . been doing .
. . on one of their bridges or something . "
This is a clear reference to the OPLAN - 34A raids , confusion about which had been a factor in the initial Tonkin Gulf engagement on August 2 .
Here LBJ suggests a measure that would actually increase Hanoi 's incentives to fight .
A little over an hour later , at 10:53 AM. , McNamara has a second conversation with the president in which Johnson 's concern centers on the details of the supposed combat in the Gulf .
McNamara tells LBJ that the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga sent out aircraft to help defend the two destroyers , and he mistakenly reports that the planes have seen two unidentified vessels and three planes near the American warships ( Admiral John Stockdale , pilot of one of the Ticonderoga aircraft that night , affirms that the U.S. planes saw nothing at all ) .
McNamara goes on to tell the president that he has developed a list of targets in North Vietnam that can be struck in retaliation .
He promises to bring the list over to the White House .
Less than ten minutes later , McNamara comes back on the phone to tell President Johnson that Pacific theater commander Admiral Sharp has told him the destroyers are under torpedo attack .
Here the secretary of defense reports information now known to be false , although McNamara did not know this at the time .
LBJ responds by ordering the secretary of defense and other top officials to meet and coordinate a retaliatory bombing .
There is no tape of that meeting , but a memorandum recording the meeting of the National Security Council that day notes McNamara entering the meeting and discussing the alleged attack .
Secretary Dean Rusk comments that recommendations are being prepared but are not yet ready .
Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon warns , " There is a limit on the number of times we can be attacked by the North Vietnamese without hilling their naval bases . "
For almost two hours following the NSC meeting , LBJ lunched with McNamara , Rusk , McGeorge Bundy , the CIA 's John McCone , and Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus R. Vance .
It was at lunch , according to a Pentagon chronology of these events , that LBJ agreed to a swift retaliatory air strike and a specific set of targets .
During this lunch ( at 1:27 P.M. ) , Washington received the message from Captain Herrick on the Maddox that cast doubt on the veracity of the attack .
This report had no effect on the actions of Washington officials .
By late afternoon the comings and goings at the White House and the Pentagon had put the press on notice that something was going on , and leaks became inevitable .
Shortly after 5:00 P.M. , President Johnson talked to McNamara again .
This time they shared the news that the Associated Press and United Press wire services had both put out the story that another attack had taken place in the Tonkin Gulf .
LBJ now approved an official Pentagon statement on the supposed attack ( although as recently as twenty minutes earlier McNamara had been meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to " overcome [ the ] lack of a clear and convincing showing that an attack on the destroyers had in fact occurred " he Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a message ordering execution of the retaliatory bombing and it was sent out at 5:19 .
A follow - up NSC meeting took place an hour later .
That meeting gave pro forma consideration to the alleged North Vietnamese attack and the retaliation , again not taking into account the doubts of the on- scene destroyer commander , Captain Herrick .
The White House meeting also tabled a prospective resolution approving the use of force by Congress .
LBJ raised the matter of a resolution at a briefing of senior legislators which began at 6:45 .
The administration supplied a text as discussed by the NSC and then between LBJ and the legislators , and that draft became the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which was subsequently used to justify the entire U.S. war in Vietnam .
There was a final conversation between LBJ and McNamara at 9:15 P.M. , at which time the president was caught up in the drama of Mississippi .
Then the questions were largely ones of coordinating the actual launch of the attack with LBJ 's public statement .
President Johnson finally made the statement at 11:36 P.M. , approximately half an hour prior to the expected time of arrival of the U.S. strike aircraft over their targets in North Vietnam .
Thus the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam went forward based on the mistaken belief in a second attack in the Gulf of Tonkin .
In a certain sense , because the resolution that passed Congress was used to justify the U.S. military commitment , the entire Vietnam War can be said to have been based on a misunderstanding .
Just over a month afterward , when another pair of American warships in the Gulf of Tonkin also thought they had come under attack , LBJ began to express doubts about the reality of the August incident .
In 1997 , in Hanoi , Robert McNamara , in a conversation with Vietnamese Commander General Vo Nguyen Giap , also concluded that the August 4 , 1964 , incident had never occurred .
That is now the general consensus among historians of the Vietnam War .

Telephone Conversation with Robert McMamara , Secretary of Defense ,
Regarding the Incident in the Gulf of Tonkin with the Destroyers U.S.S .
Maddox and U.S.S. C. Turner Joy Male Voice : Yes , sir .
Off limits .
President Lyndon B. Johnson : Hello ?
Female Voice : Secretary Robert McNamara 's calling you again , sir . " 0 "
Secretary Robert McNamara : Mr. President , uh , General Wheeler and I are sitting here together .
We just received a cable from Admiral Sharp [ Ulysses S. Grant Sharp Jr. was the American commander for the Pacific ] making three recommendations with respect to our destroyer tracks and enemy action responses .
And I wanted to mention them to you with a recommendation .
I discussed this with with Dean Rusk [ secretary of state ] and he and I are in agreement on the recommendations .
Sharp recommends first that the uh , the track of the destroyer be shifted from eleven miles offshore to eight miles offshore .
This makes no sense to us ; we would recommend against it .
His purpose , by shifting the track , is simply to make clear that we we believe the twelve - mile limit is not an effective limit on us .
We do n't , we think we do that adequately by sailing at eleven miles as opposed to eight .
Secondly , Sharp recommends that we authorize the task
President Johnson :
What reason does he give for his eight ?
Secretary McNamara : Simply that it more clearly indicates our , our refusal to accept a twelve - mile restriction .
We think we 've clearly indicated our refusal to accept a twelve - mile restriction with the , the eleven - mile limit ; we see no need to change the track at this time .
President Johnson :
Why , what , what other objections do you have ?
Secretary McNamara :
It , it , uh , changes a program that that uh should n't be changed frequently .
These orders are very precise ; the tracks are laid down very clearly ; they go through the three command channels to get out there ; this ship is allegedly uh to be attacked tonight - we do n't like to see a change in operation plan of this kind at this time .
And we do n't think it achieves any any uh international purpose , so no , certainly no military purpose is served by it .
President Johnson :
All right .
Secretary McNamara : Secondly , he recommends that the task force commander be authorized to pursue the attacking vessels in the event he is attacked and destroy their bases .
In this case , it would be
President Johnson : Wait just a minute .
[ Speaking away from the telephone : I 've got a call .
I can't hear him .
I 've got a real important thing … ] .
Go ahead , Mac .
Secretary McNamara : Secondly , he recommends that the task force commander be authorized to pursue any attacker and destroy the base of the attacker .
In this instance , if he were attacked by patrol boats , it would mean that he would pursue the patrol craft into the shore line , uh identify the base of the patrol craft and destroy that base .
Now this is an action that we might well wish to consider after the second attack .
But I think it would be inappropriate , and General Wheeler agrees , and Dean Rusk agrees , inappropriate to provide the task force commander that authority .
There will be ample time for us , after a second attack , to bring this problem to your attention , and you can then decide how far you wish to pursue the attacker into his base area .
President Johnson :
What objections do you have to pursuing it ?
Secretary McNamara :
With only the objection that if we give such authority , you have , in a sense , lost control of , of the degree of our uh response to the North Vietnamese .
If you do n't op , exactly what bases will be attacked , where they are in relation to population centers , how much force will be applied to attack them , when it will occur .
I , I personally would recommend to you , after a second attack on our ships , that we do retaliate against the coast of North Vietnam some way or other .
And we 'll be prepared
President Johnson :
What I was thinking about when I was eating breakfast , but I could n't talk it - I was thinking that it looks to me like the weakness of our position is that , uh , we respond only to an action and we do n't have any of our own .
But when they , when they move on us , and they shoot at us , I think we not only ought to shoot at them , but almost simultaneously , uh , uh , pull one of these things that you 've , you 've been doing
Secretary McNamara : Right .
President Johnson : on one of their bridges or something .
Secretary McNamara : Exactly .
I , I quite agree with you , Mr. President .
And I 'm not , not sure that the response ought to be as Admiral Sharp suggests
President Johnson :
Well me not , I 'm not either , I 'm not either .
I do n't know , unless I knew what base it was
Secretary McNamara : Yes .
President Johnson : and what is compelled , but I wish we could have something that we already picked out , and uh
Secretary McNamara :
We 'll see
President John and just hit about three of them damned quick .
Right after
Secretary McNamara :
We will have that , and , and I , I 've talked to Mac Bundy [ national security adviser ] a moment ago and told him that I thought that was the most important subject we should consider today , and , and be prepared to recommend to you a response , a retaliation move against North Vietnam in the event this attack takes place within the next six to nine hours .
And we
President Johnson :
All right .
Now we better do that at lunch .
There 's some things I do n't want to go in with these other , I want to keep this as close as I can .
So let 's just try to keep it to the two .
Secretary McNamara : I , I
President Johnson : three …
Secretary McNamara : I will be prepared to do so at lunch .
President Johnson :
All right .
Secretary McNamara : Now , thirdly , Sharp recommends that , that , uh , the , uh , task force commander be authorized to engage in hot pursuit beyond the eleven - mile limit in as far as the three - mile limit , which we [ i.e. , the United States ] accept as the definition of territorial waters .
At present the instructions to the commander are : do not pursue an attacker , uh , closer to shore than eleven miles .
Uh , Sharp recommends that that eleven mile limit be shifted to three miles .
I 've talked to Dean about this ; he agrees , uh , as far as air pursuit is concerned .
Pursue by air as close as three miles to shore .
Do not pursue by sea closer than eleven miles .
Uh , his reason for differentiating sea from air is that we can always argue that the , uh , the uh , air , uh , uh , was further out than three miles and he is concerned about taking the ships in as close as three miles to shore .
I 'm willing to accept his , his point for a different reason , how ever .
I do n't think ship pursuit uh , between eleven miles and three miles , would be effective anyhow because our ships travel at about twenty - seven knots , and these patrol boats travel at fifty knots , and the possibility of a ship being effective in that eleven to three mile area is not very great .
The air power is likely the most effective power anyhow .
And I would , therefore , recommend that we accept Sharp 's recommendation but limit it to air .
President Johnson :
All right .
OK .
Secretary McNamara : Fine .

President Johnson : I 'm trying to take this call .
Second Woman 's Voice : Thank you .
Yes .
I 'm sorry .
Secretary McNamara .
Secretary Robert McNamara : Hello ?
President Johnson : Yeah .
Secretary McNamara : Mr. President , we had , just had a report from the commander of that task force out there that they have sighted two unidentified vessels , uh , and three unidentified prop aircraft ; and therefore the , uh , carrier launched , uh , two F - 8s , two A - 4Ds and four A - is , which are prop
President Johnson :
Go back over those again .
What , what did we launch ?
Secretary McNamara :
We launched two F - 8 fighter aircraft , two A - which are jet attack aircraft , and four A - 1Hs , which are prop - driven aircraft .
So we have launched eight aircraft from the carrier to , uh , uh , examine what 's in the vicinity of the destroyers and to protect the destroyers .
The report is that they have observed , and we do n't know by what means , whether this is radar or otherwise - I suspect it 's radar - two unidentified vessels and three unidentified prop aircraft in the vicinity of the destroyers .
President Johnson :
What else do we have out there ?
Secretary McNamara :
We have the , only the Ticonderoga , with its aircraft , uh , and a protective destroyer screen .
I think there are three destroyers with the Ticonderoga .
We have the Constellation [ an aircraft carrier ] , which is moving out of Hong Kong , and which I uh sent orders to about an hour or two ago to move down towards South Vietnam .
We do n't know exactly how long it 'll take ; we guess about 30 hours .
We have ample forces to respond not only to these attacks on the destroyers but also to retaliate should you wish to do so against targets on the land .
And when I come over at noontime , I 'll bring you a list of alternative target systems .
We can mine the Swatow [ a type of North Vietnamese patrol vessel ] bases , we can - and I just issued ordered to Subic Bay and the Philippines to fly the mines out to the carrier , so we 'll be prepared to do it if you want to do it .
We can destroy the Swatow craft by bombing .
There
Is a petroleum system that is concentrated , uh , uh ,
Very faint whisper : seventy - two
Secretary McNamara : Seventy percent of the petroleum supply of North Vietnam we believe is concentrated in three , uh , dumps , and we can bomb those , bomb or strafe those dumps and destroy the petroleum system , which would be the petroleum for the patrol craft .
In addition , there are certain prestige targets that we 've been working on the last several months , and we have target folders prepared on those .
For example , there is one bridge that is the key bridge on the rail line south out of , uh , out of Hanoi , and we could destroy that .
And there are other prestige targets of that kind .
President Johnson :
All right .
Uh , good .
Can I , I told , I told Rivers [ Representative L. Mendel Rivers ] the other day and I told him what 's going to be in Charleston .
He can announce that , ca n't he ?
Secretary McNamara :
Oh , surely , surely .
President Johnson : OK .
Secretary McNamara : Surely .

Woman 's Voice : Secretary McNamara . Line " 0 . "
President Johnson :
Thanks a lot .
Secretary Robert McNamara : Mr. President , we just had word by telephone from Admiral Sharp that the destroyer is under torpedo attack .
Secretary McNamara : I think I might get , uh , Dean Rusk and Mac Bundy and have 'em come over here and we 'll go over these retaliatory actions .
And then we ought to
President Johnson : I sure think you ought to agree with that , yeah .
Secretary McNamara :
And I 've got a category here .
I 'll call the two of them .
President Johnson :
Now where are these torpedoes coming from ?
Secretary McNamara :
Well , we do n't know .
Presumably from these unidentified craft that I mentioned to you a moment ago .
We thought that the unidentified craft might include one , uh , one PT boat , which has torpedo capability and two Swatow boats which we do n't credit with torpedo capability , although they may have it .
President Johnson :
What are these planes of ours doing around while they 're being attacked ?
Secretary McNamara :
Well , presumably , the planes are attacking the , the ships .
We do n't have any , uh , word from , from Sharp on that .
The planes would be in the area at the present time .
All , all eight of them .
President Johnson : OK .
Secretary McNamara :
Thank you .

You get them over there and then you come over here as soon as you can .

Regarding the Gulf of Tonkin Incident Secretary Robert McNamara : Bob , Mr. President .
The story has broken on the AP and the UP [ Associated Press and United Press , news wire services ] .
President Lyndon B. Johnson : Yeah , I see it .
Secretary McNamara : And , uh , uh , we tried to track it down .
Jim Greenfield talked to the AP , I understand , and was told that it came from a source close to the Pentagon ; it was alleged to be a chairman of a Congressional committee .
I do n't know what the source is .
But , anyhow , it 's broken .
And uh , it seems to me , State and we and , and , George Reedy ought to agree now on a statement that could be made by one of the departments , I presume the Pentagon .
But before doing that I wanted to ask your permission to do so .
The statement that we would make , I would propose it simply say that during the night hours , the , the two destroyers were attacked by , uh , patrol boats ; the attack was driven off no casualties or damage to the destroyers ; we believe , uh , uh , several of the patrol boats were sunk ; details wo n't be available until daylight .
President Johnson : That 's OK .
Secretary McNamara :
All right .
I 'll take
President Johnson : I 'd just go on and put that out .
Secretary McNamara :
All right .
I 'll take care of it
President Johnson : Uh , anything else ?
Secretary McNamara : No , I talked to Dillon [ C. Douglas Dillon , secretary of the treasury ] and he fully agrees with the action .
I could n't get hold of Bobby [ F. Kennedy , attorney general ] ; he 's nowhere that he can be found .
But I 'll keep a call in for him .
AUGUST 1964 : THE GULF OF TONKIN INCIDENT CONTINUES - PRESIDENT JOHNSON DISCUSSES U.S. RETALIATION WITH DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT S. McNAMARA
With decisions made regarding bombing of North Vietnam , the evening conversation between LBJ and Robert McNamara focuses on the timing of the president 's announcement of the attacks and the wording of his announcement .
Johnson also discusses whether he should call opposition presidential candidate Barry Goldwater to inform him of the action .
LBJ indeed made that call ( not included in the present collection ) , and Goldwater expressed complete support for the president 's decision .
As already recounted , LBJ made his announcement late that evening .
Many of President Johnson 's later Vietnam decisions , including the initiation of a regular bombing campaign against North Vietnam in February 1965 and his commitment of ground troops to a major war in South Vietnam that summer , showed this same careful attention to the public relations aspects of the issues .
The methods of making and articulating a decision Johnson displayed regarding the Gulf of Tonkin express his standard operating procedure .
The short time LBJ had to make his decision in August 1964 led to extensive use of the telephone , and thus assists our effort to illustrate his methods .

Tuesday , August 4 , 1964 , 9:15 P.M. ( 5:34 )
Telephone Conversation with Robert McNamara , Secretary of Defense ,
Regarding the Gulf of Tonkin Incident (s ) Secretary Robert McNamara : Bob McNamara , Mr. President .
President Lyndon B. Johnson : Yeah .
Secretary McNamara : I just talked to , uh , Admiral Sharp again .
He 's been in contact with the carriers ; they have not been able to launch yet .
They wo n't launch for another , about forty - five minutes .
They should launch at 10:00 P.M.
I have this suggestion to make to you .
That you make your statement at approximately 10:00 P.M. and that you leave out one sentence .
It is the sentence that states ' Air action is now in execution against gun boats and supporting facilities in and near four ports of North Vietnam . "
Without that sentence , you do n't disclose the targets but you do disclose that action is presently underway .
President Johnson : Now , let me see where it's ; what , what
Secretary McNamara :
It 's in the , it 's in the fourth paragraph on the first page .
President Johnson : Yeah , I see .
" … but repeat acts of violence against the armed forces .
. . .
Air action is now . .
Secretary McNamara :
No , you would s- , you would read it , " But repeated acts of war against the armed forces must be met not only with alert defense but with a positive reply .
That reply is now being given as I speak to you . "
Period .
Then take out the next sentence .
President John
Well , does that , uh , make it too indefinite ?
Secretary McNamara :
No , sir , I do n't believe so .
I think it 's perfectly appropriate that while the action 's underway , you not describe , uh , the specific targets or , or the type of action .
President Johnson :
What do you think about , I do n't see why we bring Gold water in on this .
Why do n't we just say I felt it appropriate just to communicate my decision to the Republican candidate for president .
Secretary McNamara : Uh
President Johnson :
And I 'll say he 's assured me of his
Secretary McNamara : Yeah
President Johnson : full support .
I think it makes us sound like we 're very much together and buddies and agreein ' on bombing everybody .
Secretary McNamara :
Well , in that case , I 'd leave out the paragraph .
President Johnson :
You would n't even say you 'd communicated .
Secretary McNamara : I would n't say I communicated it .
President Johnson :
Well , what do you think ?
Secretary McNamara : I , I would , well , have you been able to talk to him ?
President Johnson : No. Not yet
Secretary McNamara : I 'd , I 'd leave the paragraph out .
You 've talked up above about the leaders of both parties , and it seems to me that 's the strong point .
President Johnson : Yeah .
The trouble is , he 's going to be calling in about 9:30
Secretary McNamara :
Well , I 'd keep talking to him , trying to talk to him all right , but , but I do n't think I 'd refer to it and say
President Johnson :
What would you do , just wait until after , talk , talk to him until he 's out on a [ boat ?
slurred word ] and they 've gone to get him .
Or would you talk to him as soon as he gets in and tell him I 'm going to make a statement and I want him to know about it and then not refer to it .
Secretary McNamara :
That 's exactly what I 'd do , Mr. President .
I 'd try to talk to him before I made it , but I would n't refer to having talked to him .
And , and the purpose of talking to him would be to stop any opposition from him .
And if you did that , I think you 've accomplished your purpose .
You do n't have to tie him into your statement .
President Johnson : I think it 's better not to , do n't you ?
Secretary McNamara : Yes .
President Johnson :
And what 's delayed them so ?
Secretary McNamara : Just the , the limitations of lime , Mr. President .
We ask an awful lot of them .
They said initially they could do it .
But , uh , it 's proven now they could n't ; they had to brief the crews and load the aircraft with specific types of weapons for these particular targets and it took more time than they anticipated .
President Johnson :
And when they leave the carrier at l0:00 , how long does it take them to get over the target ?
Secretary McNamara :
The last time , over the target , will be two hours from then , we believe .
President Johnson : Twelve .
Secretary McNamara :
Which would be about u o'clock , our time .
The first planes over the
President John
Well , do we want to give them two hours notice ?
Secretary McNamara : I do n't believe there 's any reason not to , Mr. President .
I do n't think there 's any serious problem in that .
President Johnson : Better check that , Bob .
Secretary McNamara : I did .
I just talked to Admiral Sharp about it .
He , he did not want this particular sentence read , the one I 'm suggesting be taken out , uh , prior to the time they get over the targets .
President Johnson :
Well , wo n't they get there simultaneously , almost ?
Secretary McNamara :
They 'll get the , the , uh , statement simultaneously , but they wo n't know what targets are being attacked .
President Johnson :
Well , it looks like they'd think that they 're liable to hit where those boats are coming from .
Looks like they might get out there with some anti-aircraft guns .
I 'd sure as hell hate to have some mother say , " you announced it and my boy got killed . "
Secretary McNamara : I do n't think there 's much damage , uh , uh , much danger of that , Mr. President .
How late would you be willing to hold the statement ?
President Johnson : I just , uh , I guess we could hold it till [ the ] 11 o'clock news .
I do n't know .
We do n't have to make it , do we ?
Secretary McNamara :
Oh , I think , uh , I think you need to make some kind of a statement at this lime .
Because tomorrow morning will be too late .
Something will have to be on the news tomorrow morning .
It ought to come from you .
President Johnson :
Well let 's see how it goes along , uh
Secretary McNamara :
All right
President Johnson :
He 's told you that he 's going to launch them at 10:00 ?
Secretary McNamara :
That 's right .
President Johnson : And [ it ] takes them two hours to get over the target ?
Secretary McNamara :
Well , the launch will take place over a period of time , and the last aircraft launched is estimated to be over the target at two hours after
President Johnson : Launch
Secretary McNamara : Launch .
President Johnson :
Well , what do you think the first one will be ?
Secretary McNamara :
The first one ought to be over the target within an hour after launch , but the radar of the North Vietnamese should pick up the first aircraft , uh , a few minutes after launch .
Say 10:30 our time , the North Vietnamese would be aware of , uh , attacking aircraft coming in .
President Johnson :
So that would be all right then .
Secretary McNamara : I would think so then , and [ if ] you did it at 10:30 , you could make the 11 o'clock news .
President Johnson : OK .
And thank you .
Secretary McNamara : Right - oh .
Barack Obama is poised to run the first privately financed general - election presidential campaign since Watergate , giving him more control over his own operations than any candidate since 1972 .
Buoyed by record - setting fund raising , the Democratic front - runner already has laid the groundwork , through seeking a Federal Election Commission ruling , to reject traditional taxpayer funding for a contest this fall against Republican John McCain .
If ...
Both Republican and Democratic candidates have asked the state of New Hampshire to conduct a hand recount of all primary ballots statewide , citing internet rumors about vote discrepancies and voting machine fraud in the primary results .
Democratic presidential nominee candidate Kucinich was the first to make headlines in calling for a statewide recount of the Democratic primary results in response to the internet fury around a post made by a woman named Lori Price that someone made online that compares votes counted by optical scan machines made by Diebold Election Systems ( now re-named Premier Election Solutions ) to votes counted by hand .
[ Thanks to the reader below who wrote in to say that Price did n't create the site where the results appear . ]
Today the New Hampshire secretary of state 's office announced that Republican presidential nominee candidate Albert Howard also asked for a statewide recount of the Republican primary results .
The last time New Hampshire conducted a statewide recount of a presidential primary was in 1980 .
Ellen Dube , elections assistant at the New Hampshire Secretary of State 's office , told me that the Republican recount will begin next Wednesday ( January 16 ) .
She said her office had not yet received a formal request from Kucinich .
She said the recounts would likely take at least two weeks to complete and would cost several thousand dollars each , since the state will have to pay all workers involved in the recount , including state troopers who will transport the ballots .
I should emphasize here that , contrary to some reports in the blogosphere , the controversy is not about electronic voting machines ( i.e. , paperless touch - screen voting machines ) , since New Hampshire does n't use such machines .
New Hampshire passed a law back in 1994 requiring all voting machines to produce a paper trail , a decade before the controversy over paperless touch - screen machines even became an issue .
Instead of touch - screen machines , New Hampshire uses only old - style paper ballots and optical - scan ballots .
In the case of the latter , voters mark a paper ballot with a pen before officials scan it through an electronic reader and tabulate the results via computer .
The controversy began when Lori Price someone posted results showing that Barack Obama received more votes than Clinton in precincts where the ballots were counted by hand than in precincts where they were counted by optical - scan machines .
Some activists have seized the information as " proof " of voter fraud , though Price the person who posted the information cautioned against drawing such conclusions , writing that " They simply show that some things stand out as being odd and worthy of further investigation . "
At least one blogger has found an alternative explanation for the differences in the vote results .
The difference between the machine - counted precincts and the hand - counted precincts , writes blogger Ed Morrissey , " is that the former tend to be in the bigger cities such as Nashua and Manchester where Hillary had significant polling leads before the primary .
The hand - counted precincts were in areas known to be Obama territory . "
Deputy Secretary of State David Scanlan told the Associated Press that the state will be happy to conduct a recount but Kucinich , who won only two percent of his party 's vote and has the least to gain from the recount , will have to pay the full cost for it since he did not lose in a close race .
Howard will also have to pay the entire cost of the Republican recount .
( New Hampshire law allows candidates who lose a race by a margin of less than 3 percent to demand a recount at a cost of only $ 2,000 .
Candidates who lose by more than this have to pay the full cost of a recount . )
'' Perhaps the best thing that could happen for us is to have a recount , " Scanlan said , " to show the people that ... the votes that were cast on election day were accurately reflected in the results .
And I have every confidence that will be the case . ''

Much thanks to my dear friends Randy and Josh .
Randy for always putting Josh in the middle of our political discussions and Josh for his willingness to ruffle his dad ’s feathers by helping me find the facts .
OX to both of you .
Last week I got an email from my friend , Josh , that said this : “ my dad wanted you to see this . ”
I scrolled down to the forwarded portion that declared “ Obama plans to disarm America . ”
I thought , “ Super !
And since he is taking away all of our guns too , how are we going to fight the terrorists ? ! ”
Of course I was rolling my eyes .
But I clicked on the link any way and I watched the video and read some of the comments that were posted .
Then I wrote back to my friend and said , “ I do n’t see a problem with what Obama is saying . ”
He wrote back , “ well , you could email my dad with your thoughts ... see what he says . :) ”
I responded , “ Oh , I will . ”
But instead of just emailing my thoughts , I thought I would share them with all of you .
Here is the video .
" >
So now that you 've watched it , let ’s break this little clip down .
We all know Barack Obama opposed the Iraq war , so we ’ll skip that .
Instead , let ’s get to the meaty part :
Second , I will cut 10s of billions of dollars in wasteful spending .
I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems .
I will not weaponize space .
I will slow our development of future combat systems , and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending .
First of all , nowhere in this statement are the words “ I am going to disarm America . ”
Veiled or not , the words are n’t there .
The words that are there however , say this : “ we waste too much money on things that do n’t work or that should n’t cost that much and I am going to make sure we stop that .
It is your hard earned money that the government takes and spends and I am going to make sure we spend it right . ”
That might be the wordy version of the first two sentences , but apparently it needed to be explained .
Considering how much of our hard earned tax dollars have been bilked by huge corporations like Kellogg Brown & Root Services , a.k.a.
KBR , subsidiary of Halliburton , in 2004 alone , one might think that having an “ independent defense priorities board ” is a good idea .
In an audit from the Defense Contract Audit Agency , focused on Kellogg Brown & Root ’s Cost Plus Award Fee task order in 2004 , we see that KBR billed the US government $ 875,255,894 ( remember that ’s your hard earned tax dollars ) .
Of that $ 875,255,894 in “ costs ” $ 108 , 409,622 are questionable and $ 1,255 , 333 were unresolved .
Only $ 108 million questionable and $ 1 million unresolved , that ’s not too shabby , it ’s hard to keep track of that money , right ?
WRONG !
Let me just highlight this gem from that report :
4. KBR proposed Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) purchased from Kuwait at $ 82,100 for material ( fuel ) costs and $ 27,514,833 in LPG subcontract ( transportation ) costs .
It is illogical that it would cost $ 27,514,833 to deliver $ 82,100 in LPG fuel .
Refer to note 5 c ( 2 ) , page 3 for further details .
There are numerous other examples .
My research assistant , Josh , found that document by starting his search with the terms " war profiteering toilet seat . "
You can find plenty more examples for yourself .
Search away , friends , or just read this or this .
Second , cutting investments in unproven missile defense systems and weaponizing space :
If it does n’t work , and we ca n’t prove that it will , even after trying , why are we paying for it ?
Enough said .
Back to the Obama speech :
Third , I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons .
To seek that goal , I will not develop new nuclear weapons .
I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material , and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair trigger alert and achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals .
It is one thing to be aware of your surroundings and to be prepared for the worst , but it is another to think that everyone is out to get you .
What Obama is saying in this part of his speech is that we have to work and negotiate for multilateral disarmament .
He is not saying we are giving up our defenses to leave us unprotected .
Now , I understand , not having the largest stash of destructive gear seems a bit scary .
Additionally , it may seem scary to negotiate with people , especially with those that we do n’t always find agreement with .
Instead of freaking out , however , let us consider these wise words :
Disarmament , with mutual honor and confidence , is a continuing imperative .
Together we must learn how to compose differences , not with arms , but with intellect and decent purpose .
Because this need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment .
As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war -- as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years -- I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight . ”
- Dwight D Eisenhower
Also , keep in mind , the very recent news about North Korea .
North Korea is being removed from the United State ’s list of nations that support terrorists , a.k.a.
The Axis of Evil .
Why is this happening ?
Well , if you click on that link in the paragraph before this , the first sentence you would read is this :
“ The Bush administration hailed North Korea 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with South Korea , China , Japan and Russia . ”
See the words , “ multilateral diplomacy ” ?
When Barack Obama talks about negotiating with other countries , and setting goals of achieving a world with fewer weapons or no weapons , this is the type of accomplishment he seeks .
This was also the goal President Eisenhower called for in his final speech as Commander in Chief ( see above quote or read the full speech ) .
In case you do n’t have time to check out President Eisenhower ’s complete speech , here is how he closed :
To all the peoples of the world , I once more give expression to America 's prayerful and continuing aspiration :
We pray that peoples of all faiths , all races , all nations , may have their great human needs satisfied ; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full ; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings ; that those who have freedom will understand , also , its heavy responsibilities ; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity ; that the scourges of poverty , disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth , and that , in the goodness of time , all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love .
Peace be with you .

SANTA FE , N.M. - A New Mexico appeals court on Friday ruled against a Los Alamos man who wanted to change his name to a phrase containing a popular four - letter obscenity .
The man appealed after a state district judge in Bernalillo County refused his request to change his name to " F--- Censorship ! "
Judge Nan Nash ruled that the proposed name change was " obscene , offensive and would not comport with common decency . "
The man - whose current legal name is Variable - argued on appeal that it was improper government censorship to deny him the name change .
" We do not believe that the district court 's action infringes on petitioner 's right to free speech , " a three - judge panel of the Court of Appeals said in its ruling .
The man has the right to call himself whatever he wants , unless there 's fraud or misrepresentation involved , the judges said .
But once he seeks court approval for a name change , the court has the authority to turn him down on several grounds , including if the name is offensive to common decency and good taste , the judges ruled .
That law was clarified in a 2004 case in the same court that apparently involved the same petitioner .
In that case , an Albuquerque man whose name was Snaphappy Fishsuit Mokiligon got the go - ahead from the appeals court to change his name to Variable .

Obama takes Oregon , Clinton wins Kentucky
Democratic primary rivals Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split big wins tonight in two states .
Obama headed for victory over Clinton in the Oregon primary .
News networks called the race not long after polls closed .
Obama led Clinton 58 % - 42 % with over 60 percent of the state 's precincts reporting .
The vote was done by mail - in ballot .
Clinton won the earlier Kentucky primary by an even wider margin than Obama 's in Oregon .
News organizations projected her victory shortly after all polls in the state closed at 7 PM Eastern .
The New York senator won by more than a 2 - to - 1 margin over Obama .
The lead steadily widened over the course of the evening .
Three percent of those voting , chose " Uncommitted . "
Exit polls from Kentucky indicate that race played a " decisive role , " as the Associated Press reports , with white voters backing Clinton " strongly . "
MSNBC primary coverage follows ...
The story of Hans Reiser , the eccentric file system programmer , is a tragic one .
The author of the ReiserFS was arrested under suspicion of the murder of his wife Nina Reiser in 2006 , and was declared guilty in April 2008 .
Some still placed doubts about the conviction , stating that he might be innocent .
It now seems that all doubt has been quelled , since Alameda County District Attorney Thomas Orloff has revealed that Hans Reiser will disclose the location of Nina ’s body for a reduced sentence .
The deal is not yet finalised , though .
“ There ’s been some overtures , ” Orloff said , “ But everything is in its preliminary stage . ”
The deal would reduce his conviction from first degree to second degree murder .
In addition , an anonymous source close with the situation said that “ the only real leverage he has is if he can provide a body .
He really does n’t have any options left .
Even if he won a retrial somehow , he ’d likely be convicted . ”
The sad thing is that more people have worked on ReiserFS than just Hans ; the ReiserFS file system is now being discredited solely by the actions of Hans , even though this , of course , in a professional way has no influence on the code or the possible technical excellence of the file system itself .
I find that to be a very sad state of affairs , since art ( which code pretty much is ) should never be discredited on the basis of its maker .
As my teacher in Dutch Literature always used to say : “ Most Dutch writers are assholes , but that does n’t discredit their contributions to the world of literature in any way . ”
Wow .
It 's tough to be CEO of a multi-billion dollar software company these days , what with it being so difficult to extend desktop monopoly to the web and getting egged during speeches ....
Yes , egged .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer was egged by a protester during a speech he gave at a Hungarian University .
As this video shows , the protester rose to his feet to challenge Microsoft for stealing billions in Hungarian taxpayer money , then started hurling eggs at Ballmer , who was forced to take cover behind a desk .
Who said it was easy to make billions ?
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) announces his withdrawal from the Democratic presidential nomination in Cleveland , Ohio January 25 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Aaron Josefczyk
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich defied his party leadership on Monday by calling for the impeachment of U.S. President George W. Bush for launching the Iraq war -- but his move was not expected to go anywhere .
The Ohio representative outlined his intention to propose more than two dozen charges against Bush on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives .
Kucinich , a former presidential candidate , accused Bush executing a “ calculated and wide - ranging strategy ” to deceive citizens and Congress into believing that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said she opposes trying to remove the Republican president who leaves office next January because such an attempt would be divisive and most likely unsuccessful .
Kucinich , an outspoken Iraq war critic who has consistently voted against funding the war and led anti-war efforts in Congress , offered a resolution to impeach Vice president Dick Cheney in April 2007 .
That also failed to move forward .
Many Democrats and civil liberties groups have accused the Bush administration of providing misleading information before the 2003 Iraq invasion as well as violating the rights of U.S. citizens with its warrantless surveillance program .
The White House denies the charges .
Tonight my son ate a sweet potato .
And a few pieces of pasta .
And a sauteed mushroom .
And some watermelon .
And a few kidney and Garbanzo beans .
Oh and a few bites of chocolate and vanilla ice cream .
It was a good eating day .
Some ( read between the lines : most ) days sitting down to eat looks more like a game of throw your food on the floor than it does anything else .
And then there are the days that he does n’t throw his food but he only wants to eat one certain thing … a whole lot of cantaloupe or crackers or , my attempt at a somewhat healthy snack , an organic , no - sugar added fruit roll - up thing .
Usually those are the days that I do n’t have a lot of that one certain food he wants .
Of course .
But my frustration with food does not stop there .
Just deciding what food to even try to get him to eat is a source of endless frustration .
My criteria list is so long and exhaustive that sometimes I just want to ignore the whole food issue altogether .
I mean by the time I ’ve found food that is :
Fresh — more nutrients
— more nutrients Fairly produced — want others to make a living
— want others to make a living Local — better for the environment and supposedly keeps more nutrients
— better for the environment and supposedly keeps more nutrients Cruelty free — do n’t want antibiotic - filled milk or caged chicken eggs
— do n’t want antibiotic - filled milk or caged chicken eggs Affordable — $ 8.00 for a pound of strawberries is a bit much
— $ 8.00 for a pound of strawberries is a bit much Accessible — going to 7 different stores each week is n’t possible
— going to 7 different stores each week is n’t possible Somewhat kid-friendly — turnips are n’t going to be an easy sale
I ’m tired .
And since I ’m not quite sure Baby is even going to eat the food and since there is a good chance that a bit of it will end up on my mop … well , you the issue is clear .
Probably the most frustrating thing to me is all the contrary advice and information I hear .
I know that many people feel this same way ; it ’s the whole eggs are good for you one day , bad for you the next , and then good for you again .
Along with the changing information are the reports about how a good food may be bad depending on the pesticides used ( Do the nutrients in grapes cancel out the chemical traces we ’re eating ? ) or the container it is stored and shipped in ( So is bottled water bad ? ) .
And then Wendy Moore ’s article , Food , injurious food , dropped in my lap .
The article is mainly about all the fillers and gross “ ingredients ” a 19th century London doctor discovered when he started studying food under his microscope .
Ahhhh ; what a breath of fresh air !
I know ; that sounds odd .
But for some reason it felt good knowing that there have always been issues surrounding the safety and quality of food .
It makes me feel the same way I do about war or violence … it has always been around .
So , although I ’m still not sure how to best feed my babe , I can at least rest in the knowledge that few others do either .

Most of those inside the mosque were young boys and girls , local media said
At least 12 people have been killed and 160 wounded in an explosion at a mosque in southern Iran , local media reported .
Authorities in the city of Shiraz were investigating the blast , which some early reports had blamed on a bomb .
But a local police chief told Fars news agency that he had ruled out sabotage , and that " negligence " involving old war munitions might be the cause .
The explosion occurred at about 2100 ( 1630 GMT ) on Saturday and was heard a mile ( 1.5 km ) away , the agency reported .
" The incident could have happened as a result of negligence .
A while ago at this site there was an exhibition commemorating the [ 1980 - 1988 ]
Iran - Iraq war , " Commander Ali Moayeri , police chief of Fars province , told Fars news agency .
" The munitions left at the site could have the been the reason for this explosion , " he added .
The agency said he ruled out any act of sabotage .
Weekly meeting Most of those inside the Hoseyniyeh Shohada mosque when the explosion took place were young boys and girls affiliated to the Rahpoyan-e Vesal Association , which " holds weekly meetings every Saturday regarding misguided groups , including Wahhabis and Bahais " , Fars said .
The Irna news agency said the blast broke the windows of many nearby houses .
Television channels urged people in Shiraz to donate blood for the injured Members of the Law Enforcement Force and the Basij militia placed a cordon around the mosque , while ambulance and fire crews worked to help the victims .
Television channels urged people in Shiraz to donate blood for the injured , adding that all nurses in the city had been called in on duty .
Shiraz , about 900 km ( 560 miles ) south of the capital Tehran , is a major tourist destination because of its closeness to a number of important ancient sites .
It has not been a target of the isolated bomb attacks which have occurred in Iran in recent years .
The last major bombing , in the south - eastern city of Zahedan in February last year , is believed to have been carried out by the Sunni Baluchi militant group , Jundallah .
Thirteen members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed when a car bomb exploded next to the bus in which they were travelling .
The south - western city of Ahwaz , close to the Iraqi border , has seen sporadic anti-government violence since 2005 , allegedly by its ethnic minority Arab population .

What are these ?
The devil of identity theft is in the details that follow : Russ Jones tells a tale of woe that is n't particularly dramatic -- or rare -- and yet it 's exactly the kind of story that worries me enough to ignore my better judgment and buy identity - theft protection from my insurance provider .
Jones sent me an e-mail after reading this post about the theft of a laptop containing personal information -- including payroll and bonuses -- belonging to an untold number of AT&T employees .
AT&T insists there is no reason to believe that the information has been used for nefarious purposes , but Jones is of the opinion that such assurances should be of little comfort to those victimized .
That 's because he 's been there .
Here 's what Jones had to say :
I have a lost laptop horror story for you .
I used to work for Boeing in Wichita .
Boeing sold the Wichita division and all of the workers , including me , to another company .
We still did the same work , but Boeing was just one customer of several .
Nearly a year after the sale , someone at Boeing lost a laptop that had the names , addresses and Social Security numbers of nearly all of the 12,000 Wichita ex-employees on it .
They waited an unknown period of time before telling anyone , then another couple of weeks before they offered to pay for credit reporting subscriptions for us .
They offered no compensation for people that had been actual identity - theft victims and they would n't pay for identity - theft insurance .
Almost immediately after the laptop went missing , someone used my SSN to apply for credit cards all over the country .
The name they used was always close , but not exactly a match to my name / address .
They used addresses of those private mail drop places .
Since I 'd lived at my house for nearly 20 years at the time , all these bogus addresses made the credit card companies reject the applications , but those rejections showed up on my credit reports and lowered my rating .
The credit bureaus ( I had to deal with all three of them separately ) could n't just remove those rejections ; they said that the credit card companies that made the requests had to retract them .
The bogus addresses also appeared on my credit report as alternate addresses for me , and I had to convince the credit agencies that I 'd never lived in Minneapolis or Boca Raton or wherever .
I spent untold frustrating hours on the phone being transferred from one credit card company customer service representative to the next , listening to crappy on - hold music , often being disconnected , and having to tell my story over and over .
It took several months to finally get everything cleared up , and I now have a fraud alert on my credit rating so nobody can request a report without my explicit permission .
That 's really a double - edged sword .
I recently tried to open a new bank account and when the bank found out that there was a fraud alert on my account , they assumed that I was a criminal .
I eventually went to a different bank , one that did n't need a credit report to open a checking account .
There have also been credit report requests in the last two or three years since the original laptop loss that did n't originate with anything I 'd done .
They were rejected , but there 's someone out there that 's still trying .
Like AT&T , Boeing was n't particularly apologetic .
They insisted that the information " probably had n't been compromised , " and they could n't explain why someone was running around with the social security numbers of a bunch of people that did n't even work for Boeing .
You can read a news story about the Boeing incident here .
You can read about similar incidents pretty much every day of the week , or so it seems .
Security guru Bruce Schneier had an interesting post recently that included the contention that identity theft is n't necessarily the financial drain or pain in the ass that worrywarts such as yours truly might fear .
He was n't saying it 's a picnic , just not the catastrophe one might imagine ... and it's not worth paying any significant insurance premium to mitigate .
He 's probably right , but as with so much surrounding the purchase of insurance , this is n't entirely a decision based on logic alone .
Here 's my bottom line : Aside from the really serious worries in life -- health , kids , job security , etc. -- having to go through what Russ Jones went through is way up there on my list of fears .
It would drive me absolutely bonkers to have to spend so much time -- time I do n't have to spare -- undoing the damage to my financial reputation .
Especially since the exposure to that damage was someone else 's fault .

Laptop Losers Hall of Shame :
The 10 worst security breaches of all time from unencrypted data
10 of the worst moments in network security history
By Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent , BBC News website
The banner was said to have been the Navy 's idea President Bush did not say " Mission Accomplished " on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln off San Diego on 1 May five years ago .
But the banner above him did .
And the picture of those two words said more than the 1,829 words of his speech .
What the president said , among a lot of other things , was : " Major combat operations in Iraq have ended .
In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed .
And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country . "
But the message from the banner said it simpler - mission accomplished .
It was all over .
It was n't .
Guerrilla war followed , and this has produced more US casualties than the " major combat operations " did .
The phrase " mission accomplished " has lost that distinctive military ring of finality that it once had .
It has become an irony .
Navy 's desire
It turned out that the sign was the US Navy 's idea , to celebrate the return of the Abraham Lincoln from the war on Iraq , after an operational tour of 290 days .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Bush explained this in October 2003 and was supported by Navy spokesman Commander Conrad Chun , who told CNN : " The banner was a Navy idea , the ship 's idea .
The banner signified the successful completion of the ship 's deployment . "
However , it was not quite that simple .
According to news reports , the banner was made by a private contractor , with the help of White House staff .
And there can be little doubt that those White House staff ensured that the banner was correctly placed for the cameras .
Update : I have had an e-mail from a navy veteran who says he was on the flight deck that day : " After 10 months at sea , the ship 's mission was accomplished , and we were going home .
That was our banner .
The President was there to visit us , our banner happened to be in the cameras view .
I am sure that it made a great back drop , but the whole scandal of this banner that was belonging to my shipmates is ridiculous to those of us who were there .
It was our banner and our day . "
Further update : the veteran has now sent me an e-mail from one of the wives involved .
She says : " We had a huge homecoming committee ...
We had meetings with the Mayor of Everett and other high profile people .
We mentioned to them we wanted to do it , the City and many other key people helped make it happen .
As you can imagine a banner to be read from land on an aircraft carrier is huge !!!!!
" At one of the many meetings someone said " Mission Accomplished " and that is what it said .
The Lincoln had accomplished its mission , in a huge way !
We had it made and sent it to the ship . "
So much about that visit was planned for effect - the location , the president dressed in combat gear , landing in the co-pilot 's seat of a Navy S - 3 when he could have used a helicopter , the television cameras .
Rumsfeld intervention
The banner destroyed the care that the administration had taken over the speech .
The Defence Secretary at the time , Donald Rumsfeld , told journalist Bob Woodward in an interview in 2006 that he had edited the speech 's draft , which had included the contentious phrase .
President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific
Dana Perino
White House press secretary " I took ' mission accomplished ' out , " he said .
" I was in Baghdad , and I was given a draft of that thing to look at .
And I just died , and I said ' my God , it 's too conclusive ' .
And I fixed it and sent it back ... and they fixed the speech , but not the sign . "
Mr Bush did in fact use the phrase himself a month later , telling American troops in Qatar : " America sent you on a mission to remove a grave threat and to liberate an oppressed people , and that mission has been accomplished . "
Afghanistan , too And Mr Rumsfeld himself said , on the same day as the Abraham Lincoln event , that major combat in Afghanistan had also ended .
He declared in Kabul : " We 're at a point where we clearly have moved from major combat activity to a period of stability and stabilisation and reconstruction activities .
The bulk of this country today is permissive , it 's secure . "
There is not much optimism about Iraq these days
The story of the banner would have made a good episode of the US television series The West Wing .
One can imagine the excited planning and then the gradual realisation over the following months that it was not yet mission accomplished .
The face of the White House director of communications , Toby , would have turned even sourer than usual .
Chief of staff Leo would have grunted .
The White House , five years on , acknowledges that it was not well thought out .
Press secretary Dana Perino said : " President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said ' mission accomplished ' for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission .
And we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner . "
The speech And the speech itself ?
What is interesting about that is how much optimism ( and determination ) it displayed , not just about Iraq , but about other areas of combat that are still at issue .
" In the battle of Afghanistan , we destroyed the Taleban ... " " From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa , we are hunting down al - Qaeda killers . "
" The war on terror is not over ; yet it is not endless .
We do not know the day of final victory , but we have seen the turning of the tide . "

Javascript やPHPの配列や関数などで 配列の最初の要素がary [ 0 ] に… - 人力検索はてな
Ｃ言語、Ruby、Lispなど多くの言語では配列は0起点である。つまり、先頭の要素のインデックスは0である。
なぜそうなっているか‥それは実装上の都合であったり歴史的理由だったりする。
Ｃ言語の配列は 「 連続したメモリ空間の、先頭アドレス」で表現している。そして、オフセットを進めることでそれぞれの要素にアクセスしている。だから配列の最初の要素を「0番目」とすることでアドレス計算が楽になるわけだ。
多くの言語はＣ言語の文法を拝借しているし、Ｃ言語は十分普及しているから、「Ｃ言語にあわせて配列は0起点でいいや」となっていると推測している。コンピュータの世界じゃ歴史的理由ってのがけっこう多い。
そういうわけでプログラマが配列の要素を数えるとき、勝手に「0番目 」 →「 1番目 」 →「2番目」と数えている。新しい言語でも0起点とするのは、プログラマにとって自然だ。
しかし、日本語の観点では「0番目」というのはいささか気持ち悪い。「日本語」では、順番に並んでいるものの先頭は「1番目」として数えるからだ。
気持ち悪いのは確かなんだが、こうは考えられないか？「N番目」という言葉は、プログラミングの文脈では「インデックスがN番目」という意味にオーバーライドされていると考えるのだ！言葉なんて文脈によって意味が異なるじゃん。「鯖」という言葉をとってみても、一般的な意味では魚のサバだが、インターネットの文脈ではserverを意味する*1。
それでもいささか気持ち悪いのは、（0起点の）「N番目」という言葉は、通常の日本語の意味の（1起点の）「N番目」という言葉で表現できてしまうからだろう。Rubyなどのオブジェクト指向プログラミング言語でいえば「super」だ。
この「N番目」という言葉はかなりの曲者で、プログラミングの解説の文脈でも0起点だったり、1起点だったりするのだ！
たとえば解説でインデックスが「+1」されていれば普通の日本語の「N番目」という意味だ。
ary = [ : foo , : bar , : baz ] ary .each_index do |i| puts " #{i+1}番目の要素は#{ary [i].inspect}です。 " end # >>
1番目の要素は:fooです。 # >> 2番目の要素は : barです。 # >> 3番目の要素は:bazです。
一方 、Array#［］の解説では「 N番目の要素を得る」と書いてある。これは0起点の「N番目」が使われている。Array#［］の解説で「N+1番目の要素を得る」と書かれているのはほとんど見かけない。これは…理解のしやすさ、文章のすっきり度なんだろうね。
こんな感じでプログラミング解説で「N番目」という言葉が出てきたら、プログラマは脳内で無意識に「0起点かな、1起点かな」と考えさせられる。脳味噌のCPUタイムの無駄である（笑）それでも、経験的にプログラミング解説では0起点の「N番目」が使われていることが多いようだ。
どうしても気持ち悪いのが抜けないならば、いっそのこと新しい表現を使えばいいじゃないか。（0から数えて）「N番目の要素」という表現を「インデックスがNの要素」と言い換えてみる。それなら間違いなく0起点なんだからね。

Heathrow 's terminal 5 descended into chaos again yesterday as fresh problems with its controversial baggage system caused flight cancellations and delays on what should have been its first day of normal operation .
As passengers arrived for school holiday getaways , the computer system which sorts bags before they are loaded on to flights crashed .
Staff were forced to sort them manually as 24 British Airways flights were cancelled and the departures board registered delays of up to three hours on some others .
The airline described the situation as ' incredibly disappointing ' and said it was urging airport operator BAA to resolve the problems as quickly as possible .
BAA said it was a software problem in the baggage system .
' We know what the problem is .
We have a potential solution and we are having to carefully consider how and when we apply this to avoid further problems , ' said a spokeswoman .
BA had hoped to operate a ' full flying schedule ' yesterday for the first time since the terminal 's opening debacle 10 days ago .
Then , glitches with the new baggage handling system led to almost 250 flights being cancelled in the first four days , and a luggage mountain of 28,000 bags that missed flights .
At least 9,000 bags have still not been reunited with their owners .
The problems are estimated to have cost the airline about £ 16 m so far .
Staff had been optimistic that yesterday would see the first day of smooth operation .
It was thought that less heavy weekend traffic would enable BA to prepare for a full weekday service for the first time from tomorrow .
BA said that the terminal had run very well on Friday and that there was no fall - off in bookings .
It said yesterday 's failure had been in the ' baggage reconciliation system ' which ensured bags were not loaded on to the aircraft when the passenger was not travelling .
' We are now having to manually reconcile bags for each flight , which takes considerably more time than using the automated system . '
One passenger , who asked not to be named , had come from the Midlands to catch a 2.45 pm flight to Basel , Switzerland , only to be told that he would now have to catch another flight leaving after 7 pm .
' It 's frustrating .
I just wish we could have had this information earlier , because I could then have flown from City Airport .
I thought things were meant to be getting better at Terminal 5 .
It really has been a PR disaster , promising so much but , so far , delivering very little , ' he said .
Americans Jan and Philip Sorensen had already checked in for their 12.15 pm Berlin flight when BA told them it was cancelled and they should go to an information booth .
' We were told to follow someone and were left with the impression we were being looked after .
But then we were brought out into the arrivals area and deserted .
No one was around to tell us what to do , ' said Mrs Sorensen .
Eventually they were transferred to a 6 pm flight .
Passengers on some of the country 's busiest railway routes also suffered .
A signalling problem at London 's Waterloo station led to delays and cancellations of South West Trains ' services , while trains between London and Portsmouth were badly disrupted after a freight train broke down near Haslemere in Surrey on Friday .
Suspicious profits sit uncollected / Airline investors seem to be lying low

Investors have yet to collect more than $ 2.5 million in profits they made trading options in the stock of United Airlines before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , according to a source familiar with the trades and market data .
The uncollected money raises suspicions that the investors -- whose identities and nationalities have not been made public -- had advance knowledge of the strikes .
" Usually , if someone has a windfall like that , you take the money and run , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" Whoever did this thought the exchange would not be closed for four days .
" This smells real bad . "
The source and others in the financial industry speculate that the purchaser or purchasers -- having initially assumed the money could be picked up without detection -- now fear exposure , or that the account has been frozen .
The markets were closed for four days after the attack , giving investigators time to notice the anomalous trades .
Securities regulators and law - enforcement agents throughout the United States and Europe are investigating unusual patterns in short sales and the purchase of " put " options , both of which are financial - market bets that the price of a given stock will fall .
Authorities here and abroad have not publicly disclosed any conclusions they have reached and refuse to discuss the case .
There was an unusually large jump in purchases of put options on the stocks of UAL Corp. and AMR Corp. in the three business days before the attack on major options exchanges in the United States .
On one day , UAL put option purchases were 25 times greater than the year - to - date average .
In the month before the attacks , short sales jumped by 40 percent for UAL and 20 percent for American .
A put option gives the buyer a right to sell the underlying security at a certain price on a certain date ; the purchaser profits when the share price drops lower than the agreed sale price .
In a short sale , an investor borrows stock from a broker and sells it , hoping to buy it back at a lower price .
October series options for UAL Corp. were purchased in highly unusual volumes three trading days before the terrorist attacks for a total outlay of $ 2,070 ; investors bought the option contracts , each representing 100 shares , for 90 cents each .
Those options are now selling at more than $ 12 each .
There are still 2,313 so - called " put " options outstanding , according to the Options Clearinghouse Corp .
Other financial professionals have told The Chronicle that an estimated $ 5 million to $ 10 million in all could have been made on the trades , including trading on other days and purchases of options on the parent company of American , AMR Corp .
Four United and American aircraft crashed in the attacks .
BIN LADEN'S FINANCES
Meanwhile , in Herzliya , Israel , a group headed by former Israeli intelligence officials -- the Interdisciplinary Center , a counter - terrorism think tank -- has issued a report on Osama bin Laden 's finances ( " Black Tuesday : The World 's Largest Insider Trading Scam ? " ) saying insiders profited by nearly $ 16 million .
The money was made on Sept. 6 , 7 and 10 in transactions involving United , American , Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. , the center said .
Morgan Stanley occupied 22 floors of the World Trade Center ; Merrill Lynch 's headquarters offices were nearby .
The figure excluded other unusual trades involving insurance companies with significant exposure to damage claims resulting from the attacks .
These include Munich Re of Germany , which expects to pay out more than $ 1.5 billion , and the AXA Group , a French firm , which could be on the hook for $ 550 million .
A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on a New York Times report yesterday that the SEC had found " benign " explanations for the trading activity .
But the spokesman , John Heine , said the commission stands by a statement made eight days after the attack by Stephen M. Cutler , acting SEC enforcement director .
The statement -- reiterated in substance Wednesday by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt -- said the commission was " pursuing all credible leads . "
SHORT - SELLING OF INSURANCE
Spokesmen for British securities regulators and the AXA Group also confirmed yesterday that investigations are continuing .
The source familiar with the United trades identified Deutsche Banc Alex .
Brown , the American investment banking arm of German giant Deutsche Bank , as the investment bank used to purchase at least some of the options .
Rohini Pragasam , a bank spokeswoman , declined comment .
Investigators ' attentions previously had been drawn to Germany because of the residence there earlier in the year of some of the principal suspects in the Sept. 11 attacks and unusual patterns in the short - selling of insurance , airline and other financial company stocks there prior to the attacks .
Last weekend , German central bank president Ernst Welteke said a study pointed to " terrorism insider trading " in those stocks .
There are many reasons the bets against United and American could have been innocent , in view of the tough time the airline industry has had this year and heavy losses experienced by both airlines in particular .
But the trades were not replicated in the stocks or options of any of the airlines ' competitors .
CANDIDATES LIVE IN ARAB NATIONS
While the identities of possible beneficiaries of advance knowledge of the attacks were not known publicly , experts were quick to point to possible candidates -- all presumed to be affluent residents of Arab nations .
The former chairman of the State Department 's National Commission on Terrorism , L. Paul Bremer , said he obtained classified government analyses early last year of bin Laden 's finances confirming the assistance of affluent Middle Easterners .
Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan Together Again
It looks likeandhave worked out their differences and rekindled their romance .
The two have been seen leaving each others homes recently .
Although we will probably never know the real reason the two had ended their relationship , the word is that Jemima was unhappy with Hugh 's lack of commitment .
Another possibility could have been his close relationship with his ex girlfriend , Elizabeth Hurley .
It seems like Hugh is heading down the same path as George Clooney .
Do you think he will he ever get married ?
It was fascinating to watch the unveiling of Firefox 3 last week .
I ’m pleased that , in some small way , my contributions helped to bring this browser out the door .
First 24 hours : 8.3 million downloads , 69 downloads / second , 20 Gb/s Peak Transfer
While I generally focus on issues tangential to JavaScript code , at Mozilla – like testing , performance analysis , specifications , standards , bug hunting , speaking , demos , and blogging – some of my code is live within the browser , and that makes me quite happy .
One of my first tasks at Mozilla was to , with Mark Finkle , develop a JavaScript API for performing common interactions typically desired by extension developers , called : FUEL .
This is a pure - JavaScript implementation that sits as a proxy inbetween the developer and the various , traditional , XPCOM - style ways of performing actions .
If you ’re interested in learning more about FUEL I ’ve collected a number of links and examples :
The Development of FUEL
FUEL was created over the course of a couple months , in early 2007 , by Mark Finkle and I .
Mark had much - better knowledge of Mozilla ’s APIs and I had good knowledge of JavaScript and API design – the match worked out nicely .
I ’ve written a couple blog posts on FUEL and so has Mark .
You can also see the features and code that went into FUEL 0.1 and FUEL 0.2 in Bugzilla .
FUEL , Today
Today FUEL lives in Firefox 3 ( meaning that you can use it to develop Firefox extensions ) and is part of the core Mozilla platform ( meaning that portions of the API will be available in any Mozilla - based application that is built ) .
For example you can even use a FUEL - like API in Thunderbird ( called ‘ STEEL ‘ ) .
Here are some of the best resources for getting started with FUEL in Firefox 3 :
Here are some of my favorite example of FUEL in action .
It was very important to me that the most - common actions take no more than a single line of code to perform – with even complex actions keeping nice and trim .
Open , and activate , a new tab pointing to Google.com
Application.browser.open ( " http://google.com/ " ) .active = true ;
Close the active browser tab
Application.browser.activeTab.close ( ) ;
Close all tabs that mention Google
Application.browser.tabs.forEach(function(tab ) { if ( tab.url.match(/google / ) ) tab.remove( ) ; } ) ;
Add a new bookmark pointing to Mozilla
Application.bookmarks.add ( " Mozilla " , " http://mozilla.org/ " ) ;
Remove all bookmarks pointing to Google.com
Application.bookmarks.all.forEach(function(cur ) { if ( cur.url.match(/google.com / ) ) cur.remove( ) ; } ) ;
FUEL , Future
Development is still going strong on FUEL .
There ’s a Google Summer of Code student working on extending the API and porting it to more parts of the platform ( along with backwards support for Firefox 2 ! ) .
We ’ll probably end up seeing this in Firefox 3.1 ( the next version of Firefox , due out later this year ) .
If you have any questions concerning how to use FUEL , or to develop Firefox extensions in general , your best bet would probably be to join the #extdev IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org .
Lots of knowledgeable people hang out there and will be more - than - capable of answering any questions that you might have .
Once again , I ’m terribly excited by the final release of Firefox 3 – here ’s hoping to many more excellent releases to come !
BRUSSELS  Northern
Rock may be getting government aid for longer than necessary , according to an official European Commission document that suggests that the nationalization of the troubled British lender faces tough scrutiny from regulators .
Opening an inquiry into whether the bailout broke European Union rules on state aid , the commission listed a series of reservations about the deal that shored up the mortgage lender .
Northern Rock was the worst victim in Britain of the tight credit market , which was set off by the subprime mortgage crisis that began in the United States last year .
After an unsuccessful search for a buyer for Northern Rock , the British government nationalized the bank in February .
Earlier this week , another big British mortgage lender , Bradford & Bingley , had to seek emergency help from investors and cut the price of a planned share sale .
June 18 , 2008  -- A 16 - year - old boy whose family relies on faith rather than medical treatment has died after suffering from stomach pain and shortness of breath , police said .
Gladstone , Ore. , police said the boy 's relatives , members of the Followers of Christ Church , told police that he had refused medical treatment after becoming ill a week ago .
Under state law , anyone over 14 has the right to refuse treatment .
The 16 - year - old , Neil Beagley , suffered from an inflammation in his urethra , a tube leading from his bladder , which made him unable to urinate , Deputy State Medical Examiner Dr. Clifford Nelson told ABC News affiliate KATU - TV in Portland .
Beagley filled up with urine , and that eventually ruined his bladder , kidneys and heart , said Nelson .
He called it " an absolutely horrible way to die . "
The teen 's condition could have been treated with the use of a catheter , however , Nelson said .
Sgt. Lynne Benton said the case was referred to the district attorney 's office but did not expect charges to be filed .
" They said he declined medical attention , " she said .
" That 's the story that the family told us during the investigation .
I do n't think we 're going to be able to disprove that statement . "
The Clackamas County district attorney 's office declined to comment .
Benton said officers and a medical examiner were called to the Beagley home about an hour after his death late Tuesday afternoon , after church members called the medical examiner .
Family members told police that the boy had become ill about a week earlier , Benton said .
A phone message left at the Beagley residence was not returned .
The boy is the uncle of Ava Worthington , a 15 - month - old girl who died after her parents did not seek medical treatment for her .
Her parents , Carl and Raylene Worthington , also members of the Followers of Christ Church , were indicted in March on criminal mistreatment and manslaughter charges and are awaiting trial .
The British media were right , on balance , not to republish the Danish cartoons that millions of furious Muslims protested against in violent and terrible destruction around the world .
Reprinting would very likely have meant more people killed and more property destroyed .
It would have caused many British Muslims great pain because they would have been told that the publication was intended to show contempt for their religion , and though that perception would have been inaccurate and unjustified the pain would nevertheless have been genuine .
True , readers and viewers who have been following the story might well have wanted to judge the cartoons ' impact , humour and offensiveness for themselves , and the media might therefore have felt some responsibility to provide that opportunity .
But the public does not have a right to read or see whatever it wants no matter what the cost , and the cartoons are in any case widely available on the internet .
Sometimes the media 's self - censorship means the loss of significant information , argument , literature or art , but not in this case .
Not publishing may seem to give a victory to the fanatics who instigated the violence and therefore incite them to similar tactics in the future .
But there is some evidence that the wave of rioting and destruction - suddenly , four months after the cartoons were first published - was orchestrated from the Middle East for larger political reasons .
If that analysis is correct , then keeping the issue boiling by fresh republications would actually serve the interests of those responsible and reward their strategies of terror .
There is a real danger , however , that the decision of British media not to publish , though wise , will be wrongly taken as an endorsement of the widely held opinion that freedom of speech has limits , that it must be balanced against the virtues of multiculturalism , and that the government was right after all to propose that it be made a crime to publish anything " abusive or insulting " to a religious group .
Freedom of speech is not just a special and distinctive emblem of western culture that might be generously abridged or qualified as a measure of respect for other cultures that reject it , the way a crescent or menorah might be added to a Christian religious display .
Free speech is a condition of legitimate government .
Laws and policies are not legitimate unless they have been adopted through a democratic process , and a process is not democratic if government has prevented anyone from expressing his convictions about what those laws and policies should be .
Ridicule is a distinct kind of expression ; its substance cannot be repackaged in a less offensive rhetorical form without expressing something very different from what was intended .
That is why cartoons and other forms of ridicule have for centuries , even when illegal , been among the most important weapons of both noble and wicked political movements .
So in a democracy no one , however powerful or impotent , can have a right not to be insulted or offended .
That principle is of particular importance in a nation that strives for racial and ethnic fairness .
If weak or unpopular minorities wish to be protected from economic or legal discrimination by law - if they wish laws enacted that prohibit discrimination against them in employment , for instance - then they must be willing to tolerate whatever insults or ridicule people who oppose such legislation wish to offer to their fellow voters , because only a community that permits such insult may legitimately adopt such laws .
If we expect bigots to accept the verdict of the majority once the majority has spoken , then we must permit them to express their bigotry in the process whose verdict we ask them to respect .
Whatever multiculturalism means - whatever it means to call for increased " respect " for all citizens and groups - these virtues would be self - defeating if they were thought to justify official censorship .
Muslims who are outraged by the Danish cartoons point out that in several European countries it is a crime publicly to deny , as the president of Iran has denied , that the Holocaust ever took place .
They say that western concern for free speech is therefore only self - serving hypocrisy , and they have a point .
But of course the remedy is not to make the compromise of democratic legitimacy even greater than it already is but to work toward a new understanding of the European convention on human rights that would strike down the Holocaust - denial law and similar laws across Europe for what they are : violations of the freedom of speech that that convention demands .
It is often said that religion is special , because people 's religious convictions are so central to their personalities that they should not be asked to tolerate ridicule in that dimension , and because they might feel a religious duty to strike back at what they take to be sacrilege .
Britain has apparently embraced that view because it retains the crime of blasphemy , though only for insults to Christianity .
But we cannot make an exception for religious insult if we want to use law to protect the free exercise of religion in other ways .
If we want to forbid the police from profiling people who look or dress like Muslims for special searches , for example , we cannot also forbid people from opposing that policy by claiming , in cartoons or otherwise , that Islam is committed to terrorism , however silly we think that opinion is .
Religion must be tailored to democracy , not the other way around .
No religion can be permitted to legislate for everyone about what can or cannot be drawn any more than it can legislate about what may or may not be eaten .
No one 's religious convictions can be thought to trump the freedom that makes democracy possible .

In December , we wrote about researcher Bob Briscoe 's problems with TCP 's fairness in handling different protocols .
Specifically , unattended peer - to - peer bulk data transfer applications ( e.g. , BitTorrent ) use bandwidth 24/7 rather than intermittently and open up hundreds of connections , while interactive applications , such as web browsers , are less bandwidth - and connection - intensive ; but the costs of both types of connections are equal to users .
It turns out that Briscoe has even less love for TCP 's congestion control than he let on in the previously cited Internet Draft .
In another one , he pretty much wipes the floor with the current state of the art in congestion control :
The outstanding barrier to realistic resource allocation for the Internet is purely religious .
In much of the networking community , you have to put fairness in terms of flow rates , otherwise your work is ' obviously ' irrelevant .
At minimum , you are an outcast , if not a heretic .
But actually basing fairness on flow rates is a false god — it has no grounding in philosophy , science , or for that matter ' commercial reality ' .
In 1964 , an engineer named Paul Baran wrote a series of memoranda proposing a network where locations were connected through redundant links and where information was exchanged in packets .
If a link between two locations were to go down , the packets would be rerouted through another location .
Only a few years earlier , the digital T1 phone trunk had been invented , where the bits of 24 different phone calls were carefully assigned a fixed place in a hierarchy to emulate a switched connection .
This packet switching network of Baran 's could never work , according to Ma Bell 's engineers of the day .
There 's congestion , and how you handle congestion
Maybe Ma Bell really did know what they were talking about , and 40 years later , the chickens have come home to roost .
Again .
In the mid-1980s , the ARPANET — or Internet , there was n't much of a difference back then — suffered from massive congestion for about a year .
Congestion is the situation where the network receives more traffic from its users than it can transport to where it needs to go .
Internet routers deal with congestion by simply removing ( dropping ) the excess packets .
In the original design of the TCP / IP protocols , the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) just retransmitted the lost packets at a fixed rate without reacting to the congestion .
This did n't help matters .
This was fixed by implementing four congestion control algorithms in TCP that make sure it does n't start to send packets too fast , too soon and that it slows down when it thinks there is congestion .
These algorithms take lost packets as an indication of congestion in the network .
Since the late 1980s , they have been refined , but not drastically changed .
The dynamics of TCP congestion control algorithms are such that every session gets roughly equal bandwidth .
That 's fair for applications that behave the same way , but not so much when you compare a web user to a BitTorrent user .
( See the article from December for details . )
Basically , TCP scales back its transmission rate until it reaches a certain balance in bandwidth use and packet loss .
More sessions means higher packet loss , which means that the loss / speed equilibrium happens at a lower speed , which is common to all TCP sessions ( if some other variables are also the same ) .
Briscoe argues that the current way of doing things is n't working : peer - to - peer applications eat up an inordinate amount of bandwidth .
This creates counterproductive incentives for ISPs : if they install extra bandwidth , most users do n't gain much speed , so doing this can be seen as a waste of money .
Instead , ISPs opt to install bandwidth management products .
This of course irks heavy peer - to - peer users and net neutrality proponents alike .
It also wo n't help when ( if ? ) the time comes that people start dropping their cable TV subscriptions the same way they 've been dropping their landline subscriptions , and millions of people start downloading the latest episode of Lost as soon as it's put up on the iTunes Store .
The underlying bandwidth requirements are n't going away .
Bits of different value
Earlier this week , ZDNet 's George
Ou wrote a lengthy article on Briscoe 's efforts and on the ridiculousness of a model where users pay metered bandwidth charges ( he cited steep metered broadband plans in Australia ) .
However , it looks like the two are strongly related .
An important underlying principle in congestion control and network optimization is that every user has a " utility function . "
A little bandwidth is worth a lot per bit .
An SMS text message can easily cost 0.01 cents per bit , and is obviously worth more to the user , or he would n't be sending them .
Nobody would be pirating DVDs at this price , though , as this is almost $ 1,000,000 per GB .
So the " utility " of extra bits decreases as you get more of them .
The trouble is , the core of the Internet has no idea whether any particular packet holds those expensive SMS bits or those throw - away DVD pirating bits .
The ability to see this difference is exactly the thing that Bellhead engineers have been putting in their protocols for the past 40 years .
An X.25 , Frame Relay , or ATM network has no problem giving every user exactly the quality of service ( QoS ) that he or she paid for — no more , no less .
Unfortunately , these protocols also have enormous overhead and could n't be made to scale to the Internet 's current size , or even its size a decade ago .
The " Nethead " engineers over at the IETF have n't been sitting on their hands all this time , either .
They invented some QoS mechanisms of their own .
Hopefully , this research in addition to that of Briscoe and others , will help with the development of QoS products that give interactive users their fair share of the bandwidth when they need it , while unused capacity can be used to its fullest by peer - to - peer users .
But in order to be able to do that , there must be some incentive for peer - to - peer users to allow their downloads a lesser priority — when the mechanisms to do so become available .

A Venezuelan National Guard sergeant looks across the Táchira River that marks the Venezuelan - Colombian border .
On the other shore , a man on a bicycle is shaking his fist and shouting : " You are going to kill us all from hunger .
Let us work ! "
The sergeant shrugs and returns to his border outpost under a shade tree .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has ordered the National Guard to crack down on the smuggling from Venezuela to Colombia where food and fuel fetch prices at least twice as high .
Thousands of people along the 1,300 - mile border live off the illegal trade .
But the anger expressed by the man on the bicycle reflects a broader tension building between Bogotá and Caracas that some analysts say is being stoked by Mr. Chávez to deflect attention from problems at home .
This past Friday , Chávez said that Colombia and the United States are plotting a military " aggression . "
He cited recent visits to Colombia by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ; US Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; and the head of the US Southern Command , Adm. James Stavridis .
" I accuse the government of Colombia of designing a conspiracy , a war provocation against Venezuela , following orders from the US ... that could spark a war , " Chávez said .
But Colombians say it is Chávez who wants to spark a conflict .
Over the weekend , Chávez called on Cuba , Bolivia , and Nicaragua to form a military alliance against attacks by the US .
A day later Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused Colombia of stepping up military operations around Colombian islands in the western Caribbean claimed by Nicaragua .
The Colombian foreign ministry issued a statement Monday saying : " Colombia has never been , nor will it be , an aggressor country . "
Colombian defense analyst Alfredo Rangel says that what he calls Chávez 's " verbal incontinence " is just an attempt to deflect attention from an increasingly critical economic situation in Venezuela and recent setbacks suffered by Chávez .
" You can't confuse a temper tantrum with a war , " he says .
Venezuela 's inflation soared to 22.5 percent last year , the highest rate in Latin America , while at the same time food staples have become scarce .
Government price controls on basic goods such as milk , sugar , cooking oil , and toilet paper that began in 2003 have discouraged production and encouraged speculation .
To avoid selling at a loss , many Venezuelan firms smuggle products to neighboring countries .
Last week , Chávez ordered the redeployment of 1,200 National Guard troops already on the border to engage in " Operation Sovereign Homeland , " an anticontraband mission .
Chávez warned that if the National Guard could n't do the job , he 'd send in the Army .
The pragmatic friendship that had ruled relations between the leftist Chávez and Colombia 's conservative , pro-US president , Alvaro Uribe , broke down in November .
Mr. Uribe withdrew his support of the Venezuelan leader 's mediation efforts with the FARC , the leftist rebels who are holding some 44 hostages , including three Americans ..
Tensions further rose when , after brokering the release of two hostages held by the FARC , Chávez called publicly on Colombia and Europe to grant Colombia 's largest insurgent militia the status of a legitimate force and not a terrorist group .
Chávez 's accusations last week of a Colombia - US plot against him came as some 3,000 Venezuelan troops participate in a series of military exercises called Operation Caribe 01 .
Venezuela has been building up its military in recent years , signing contracts with Russia to buy 53 Mi-24 armored helicopter gunships and Sukhoi 30 fighter planes .
" To the degree that those capabilities come into theater , they certainly are of great concern not just to Colombia ... but to the region and in fact very much to the United States , " Admiral Mullen told reporters in Bogotá this month .
But Thomas Shannon , US assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere , who accompanied Ms. Rice on her Colombia visit , told Colombian radio that a conflict was unlikely .
" We do n't see at the moment the possibility of any conflict between the two countries .
On the contrary , I think that the two countries have such profound and important ties that their governments will look for a way to manage and control these kinds of problems , " he said .
Colombia and Venezuela are each others ' second - largest trading partners with bilateral commerce reaching about $ 5.5 billion last year .
Even through the recent friction , trade has continued normally .
The mutual need is what makes many border residents feel at ease amid the acrimony coming from the two capitals .
" What happens in Caracas and Bogotá has nothing to do with us here , " says Gustavo Gómez , a Venezuelan mechanic , who , like most people on the border , has extensive family ties with Colombia .
" We are brothers ; we could never fight . "

Inflation
It has become one of most concerning issues of world .
It is becoming the reason of a high price level in the consumer market .
So the demand and supply of the commodities are badly affected .
Strategic Business
Impact on consumer demands
The prices of commodities such as wheat , sugar , salt , spices , bread , vegetables , fruits , meat etc increased at such a huge level that has diminished the demands of the consumers .
On the other hand it is the compulsion of the people to buy groceries for their survival .
Increasing oil prices cause inflation
The economic analysts are saying regarding the dilemma of inflation that it is occurred due to the increase in oil prices in United States .
One barrel of oil is reached up to $ 126 a few days ago , which has become the major concern of sustaining the US economy .
Furthermore both the political parties of democrat and republican have failed to control upon the inflation and most of the people blamed to US regime .
War against Iraq caused inflation
America has wasted billions of dollars during the recent war against Iraq which has affected the demand and supply in the country .
The prices of the every day commodities increased so much that the people have come to the road and motto against the government .
So we could say that local people are demolishing in the grind of inflation .
Declining stock market
Meanwhile the stock market of world is facing the perils of inflation due to increase in oil prices and sudden disasters .
For example the current earthquake in China has affected the stock market of Asian and Western countries .
Astounding boom in stock market
Yester it was the booming trend when the prices of stock market had increased .
That is the inflation which shows us the fluctuating trend of the stock markets .
Sometimes it seems to be the boom of stock market and often it looks like a recession of stock market .
Transfer of stock in foreign countries
One of the amazing aspects is deposits .
Millions of people around the world are not feeling secure about money .
For example the majority of the people of Pakistan are transferring their stocks and money to the accounts of foreign nations such as UAE , Unites States , Canada , and United Kingdom etc. it is just because of heavy inflation .
Inflations causes ’ famine
Today there are many countries which are facing the alarms of famine due to inflation and poverty .
It is estimated that within next five years , most of the Asian regions such as Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , Indonesia , Sri Lanka , and Afghanistan will be demolished due to the sudden disasters such as hurricanes , tsunamis , storms , famine , earthquakes etc .
The regimes of these countries are absolutely careless and they are not taking some serious actions to avoid of the famine dangers .

CINCINNATI , Ohio ( CNN ) --
" Would you rather just sit there and cower underneath a desk when someone executes you or would you rather have a chance to defend your life ?
That 's what it really boils down to . "
Michael Flitcraft says students should be allowed to protect themselves from potential killers .
Michael Flitcraft , a 23 - year - old sophomore at the University of Cincinnati , has become a leading advocate for college students to carry weapons on campus .
He 's an organizer for Students for Concealed Carry on Campus , a grass - roots organization that was formed after last year 's Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 college students and professors dead .
The group boasts more than 25,000 members .
Standing on the Cincinnati campus , Flitcraft calmly explained he is licensed to carry a weapon in Ohio .
He wants to carry his gun on campus to defend himself from potential killers , but by law he can't .
" To me it makes no sense that I can defend myself legally over there , " he said , pointing to the city streets .
" But I am a felon if I step on the grass over here . "
Watch a growing movement for guns on campus »
The issue of guns on campuses has intensified over the last year in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings and picked up again after the more recent killings at Northern Illinois University .
Lawmakers in at least nine states are considering legislation to allow guns on campus .
Other states have struck down legislation .
Utah is the only state to allow weapons at all public universities .
Colorado allows students at universities to carry weapons , except the main university campus in Boulder .
In Virginia , Blue Ridge Community College allows students with a proper concealed - weapons permit to be armed .
See the status of guns on campus »
For many , allowing college students to carry a gun is a tricky and complex issue .
" I do n't think the answer to bullets flying is to send more bullets flying , " said Gene Ferrara , the police chief at the University of Cincinnati .
" My belief is we ought to be focusing on what we do to prevent the shooting from starting . "
Ferrara was a Cincinnati cop for more than a dozen years before he became chief of police at the university .
He also said that there are practical concerns from a law enforcement perspective :
If you 're responding to the scene of a shooting , how do you sort out who is the bad guy and who is the heroic student with a permit ?
" The other side of that , I shoot everybody with a gun who does n't have a uniform on and I then I end up shooting somebody who was a citizen with a carry permit , " Ferrara said .
He says education and outreach are key and that providing students with safe and anonymous ways to report suspicious behavior can go a long way in preventing violence .
" All of the research shows someone knew before the shooting started that the shooting was going to happen . "
At the University of Cincinnati , most of the students who spoke to CNN said the idea of guns on campus scares them .
" I think that it is completely absurd , " said senior Jacob Metz .
Freshman Lauren Reams added , " It shocks me . "
Security officials insist that young adults are safer on campus than just about anywhere else .
Since the so - called Texas Tower shootings at the University of Texas in 1966 when 17 people were killed , there have been about a dozen shootings at colleges or universities .
At Weber State University in Utah where students can carry concealed weapons , professor Ron Holt said a weapon provides added protection from potential gunmen .
" I see carrying a concealed firearm as a kind of life insurance policy ; 99.99 times you will never need it , " he said .
Flitcraft and other students across the nation who support gun rights say they wo n't give up .
Students for Concealed Carry on Campus has established a page on the social network site Facebook .
They do n't want all students to be armed ; what they 're pushing for is for students 21 and older who are licensed gun owners to have the right to carry guns on campus .
The group is busy planning a protest for later this month in which students who support guns on campus will come to school wearing empty holsters .
" What is a better situation : Someone coming in and shooting in a classroom [ or ] someone in that classroom having a chance to defend their life and take out that threat ? "
Flitcraft said .

Bush Replays Iraq Games on Iran Stop !
Please .
Get beneath the hype over former White House press secretary Scott McClellan ’s book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
Do n’t miss forest for trees .

Not since John Dean told the truth about President Richard Nixon ’s crimes have we had an account by a very close aide to a sitting president charging him with crimes of the most serious kind .
McClellan writes that George W. Bush abandoned “ candor and honesty ” to wage a “ political campaign ” that led the nation into an “ unnecessary war . ”
The chief U.S. prosecutor of senior Nazi officials at the post - World War II Nuremberg Trials , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson , labeled such action – more correctly termed a war of aggression – the “ supreme international crime . ”
In other words , President Bush used propaganda and deception to lead the United States into what an earlier generation of American leaders judged not just a war crime , but the “ supreme ” war crime .
And , in all this , Bush had an eager cast aiding and abetting – from careerists in the U.S. intelligence community to the fawning corporate media ( FCM ) whom McClellan referred to as “ deferential , complicit enablers . ”
As for the role of intelligence , McClellan tells of “ shading the truth . ”
In the effort to convince the world that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , the president used “ innuendo and implication ” and intentional ignoring of intelligence to the contrary . ”
Water over the dam , you say ?
No way .
White House spinners are at it again – “ fixing ” the intelligence around the policy , this time on Iran .
The fixing is obvious , but do n’t expect to hear about it from the FCM .
An exception is MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann .
His antiquated approach is to ask relevant questions – like , for example , will the White House do an encore in preparing us for an attack on Iran ?
Interviewing McClellan Thursday evening , Olbermann earmarked time to discuss Iran and asked , “ So knowing what you know , if [ White House spokeswoman ]
Dana Perino starts making noises similar to what you heard from Ari Fleischer in 2002 … would you be suspicious ? ”
“ I would be , ” McClellan said .
Wait .
Before taking this with a blasé shrug , consider the source .
Fixing In Fits and Starts
The worst kept secret in Washington is that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are looking for a pretext to order air and missile attacks on Iran .
But when and how will Dana Perino and the rest of the propaganda machine market this one ?
When to sell ?
If former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card ’s dictum regarding “ marketing ” the war on Iraq holds sway – i.e .
“ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August ” – the administration has only two months , unless it opts for an “ October Surprise ” as a more effective way to help achieve a Republican victory in November .
But a smooth rolling out of war on Iran has proven more troublesome – no thanks , by the way , to the FCM , most of them still claiming they did just fine before the war on Iraq .
Part of the problem has been the new marketers .
With Andy Card , Karl Rove , Dan Bartlett and Tony Snow gone , it is amateur hour for White House spinners as they start - stop and rotate rationales for striking Iran .
And how to sell ?
Less than a year ago the focus was two - fold : ( 1 ) What President Bush on Aug. 28 called “ Tehran ’s murderous activities ” against our troops , including “ 240 - millimeter rockets that have been manufactured in Iran and that had been provided to Iraqi extremist groups by Iranian agents ; ” and ( 2 ) His ad - lib on Oct. 17 : “ We ’ve got a leader in Iran who has announced he wants to destroy Israel … I take the threat of a nuclear Iran very seriously . ”
Oops …
But where are those 240 - millimeter rocket shells ?
For some reason , Gen. David Petraeus cannot deliver the goods .
As recently as April 25 , his nominal boss , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Adm .
Mike Mullen , invited the press to what was supposed to be a well - oiled Show - and - Tell exercise “ in a couple of weeks , ” to display a multitude of captured weapons from Iran .
But the show did not go on ; it had to be cancelled when the weapons that had been found proved not to be of Iranian origin .
Ironically , one major hurdle would be getting senior Iraqi officials to go along with a hyped - up demonstration of weaponry from Iran .
Shortly after Mullen offered his invitation , the Iraqis announced that Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki had formed his own Cabinet committee to investigate U.S. claims about Iranian weapons , and to attempt to “ find tangible information and not information based on speculation . ”
The other pretext is the hyped - up danger from Iran ’s nuclear program .
Here , the administration suffered acute embarrassment when a vestigial group of honest intelligence analysts and supervisors had the temerity to serve up an un-fixed intelligence National Intelligence Estimate last fall that showed that Bush had been knowingly exaggerating the nuclear threat from Iran .
The declassified key findings of the NIE were released on Dec. 3 .
They included : -- “ We judge with high confidence that in the fall of 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program ; we also assess with moderate to high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons . ”
-- “ We assess with moderate confidence Tehran has not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007 , but we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . ”
-- “ Tehran ’s decision to halt its nuclear weapons program suggests it is less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 .
Our assessment that the program probably was halted primarily in response to international pressure suggests Iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . ”
To Bush and Cheney ’s dismay , the findings had been shared with Congress and could not be suppressed .
What followed was the ineffably inept performance one has come to expect from national security adviser Stephen Hadley , who claimed the Estimate “ confirms we were right to be worried about Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons [ which ] remains a very serious problem . ”
And before leaving for his early January 2008 trip to the Middle East , the president said part of his purpose was to make it “ abundantly clear … that we view Iran as a threat , and that the NIE in no way lessens that threat , but in fact clarifies the threat . ”
Got that ?
Threat .
According to Newsweek ’s well - connected reporter Michael Hirsh , Bush all but disowned the NIE in conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
According to a senior U.S. official accompanying the president , Bush told the Israelis that he could n’t control what the intelligence community says , but that the Estimate ’s key judgments do not reflect his own views .
Bush reportedly had briefed Olmert in November on the Estimate ’s findings , and seemed almost apologetic about the findings .
After Bush departed Israel in January , a Newsweek reporter asked Olmert if he felt reassured ; to which Olmert replied , “ I am very happy . ” A Flexible Director of National Intelligence Malleable Mike McConnell showed his true colors shortly after the president got back from Israel .
Unable to withstand withering criticism from the likes of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and the irrepressible former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton , McConnell backpedaled .
In testimony to the Senate on Feb . 5 he confessed to careless wording in the NIE due to time constraints , and even indicated he “ probably would have changed a thing or two . ”
He would now say , for example , that “ maybe even the least significant portion [ of the Iranian nuclear program ] was halted and there are other parts that continue . ”
Next at bat was the president himself in an interview on March 19 with the U.S. government - run Radio Farda broadcasting to Iran in Farsi .
Bush asserted that Iran has “ declared it wants a nuclear weapon to destroy people ” and that it could be hiding a secret program .
A White House clean - up team conceded that Bush ’s statement about what Iran has “ declared ” was inaccurate .
It was Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’s turn in April .
Speaking at West Point , Gates said he believes Iran is “ hell bent ” on acquiring nuclear weapons .
( Does it strike anyone that abandoning their weapons program in 2003 seems a strange way of going about it ? )
Gates added that he favored keeping the military option against Iran on the table .
The NY Times Jumps In And on May 27 , the New York Times misquoted one of the key judgments of the NIE .
More than a subtle distinction , the Times indicated that the Estimate stated , “ It was uncertain whether the weapons work had resumed . ”
Speaking to the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) two days later , McConnell ’s deputy , Donald Kerr , took the same line , emphasizing that “ since the halted activities were part of an unannounced secret program Iran attempted to hide , we do not know if it has been restarted . ” ( Emphasis in original )
This is the spin that the president , senior officials – and the New York Times – have been putting on the NIE .
As noted above , the relevant NIE key judgment reads : “ We assess with moderate confidence Tehran has not restarted its nuclear weapons program as of mid-2007 … ” ( Incidentally , that Kerr , as deputy to McConnell , would give a major address to WINEP moves the intelligence community much too close to a partisanship with this group , at least for this veteran intelligence officer ’s taste .
Martin Indyk , erstwhile research director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , America ’s self - described “ pro-Israel lobby , ” founded the institute .
AIPAC is listed as its parent organization . )
Rather than shadowboxing , making confessions when it seems opportune and introducing subtle changes of emphasis aimed at making the Estimate ’s judgments more politically palatable , McConnell and Kerr should do their duty .
And that is to follow the long established intelligence community procedure for updating an important NIE by ordering preparation of what is called a “ Memorandum to Holders ” – in this case , holders of last fall ’s NIE on Iran .
This is an orderly , time - tested way to get the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that prepared the NIE on Iran to revisit it in a deliberate and rigorous way and to indicate what , if anything , they believe needs to be changed .
At the release of the unclassified version of the NIE on Iran on Dec. 3 , 2007 , Kerr issued a written statement explaining why the key judgments were being made public .
“ Since our understanding of Iran ’s capabilities has changed , we felt it was important to release this information to ensure that an accurate presentation is available , ” he said .
Exactly right .
So if the NIE ’s judgments are being challenged and / or are in need of update , let Kerr or McConnell give the task to the dedicated professionals responsible for drafting the NIE late last year .
And if McConnell should decide – or be told by the White House – not to , the congressional oversight committees should awake from their stupor and require a Memorandum for Holders .
It is certainly their prerogative , their duty , to do so .
Someone apparently needs to tell Director McConnell that it is not required that the Israelis – or Kissinger , or Schlesinger , or Bolton – agree with the Estimate ’s conclusions , however much the president would like all to be in sync with the preferred line .
And , given the stakes , the new findings should not be rushed or done on the cheap .
Learning Curve Still Steep McConnell ( and Kerr , for that matter ) are still new to substantive intelligence analysis , and McConnell has admitted having difficulty with the rigorous demands of the job .
Frankly , I find it unsettling that one of them briefs the president six mornings a week .
McConnell ’s lack of experience on issues other than technical intelligence collection showed through in an especially troubling way on Feb. 27 , 2007 , as he briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , asked McConnell why the Israelis sometimes have a different view on Iran ’s nuclear program .
McConnell appeared quite puzzled , noting the closeness of the U.S. - Israeli intelligence relationship and how U.S. intelligence officers discussed these things with the Israelis .
As I watched , I could not help feeling sorry for the Director of National Intelligence – and for the rest of us , as well .
A pity that his predecessor , the more seasoned John Negroponte , did not take time to tell McConnell what he told NPR ’s Robert Siegel before Negroponte quit to go back to the State Department .
Asked by Siegel to explain why the Israelis have suggested a much shorter timeline for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon , Negroponte stated the obvious with bluntness uncommon for a diplomat : “ I think that sometimes what the Israelis will do [ is ] give you the worst - case assessment . ”

Clinton camp converging on New York Tuesday , and shedding staff
Members of Hillary Clinton 's advance staff received calls and emails this evening from headquarters summoning them to New York City Tuesday night , and telling them their roles on the campaign are ending , two Clinton staffers tell my colleague Amie Parnes .
The advance staffers — most of them now in Puerto Rico , South Dakota , and Montana — are being given the options of going to New York for a final day Tuesday , or going home , the aides said .
The move is a sign that the campaign is beginning to shed — at least — some of its staff .
The advance staff is responsible for arranging the candidate 's events around the country .
With the future of her campaign in doubt , Clinton has n't announced her plans for the final election night of the primary cycle or beyond , but the aides said she would stage her election night event in New York City .
Her entourage is currently expected to wake up Tuesday in New York and to arrive in Washington , D.C. Tuesday night .
Clinton 's senior aides did n't respond to requests for comment on her Tuesday night plans .
UPDATE : Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee says the advance staffers have n't been let go or told to find other jobs , just sent home .
They are n't typically paid for off days .
" We just have n't figured out our schedule past Tuesday , " he said .
The United States military has thousands of troops deployed around the world on a variety of missions , including peacekeeping , security and military training .
Here is a breakdown of some of the major deployments of U.S. military personnel .

There is an often circulated myth that once you have taken LSD , it remains in your body forever .
One thing that keeps these rumors circulating the is fact that some people ( though very few ) experience " flashbacks " ( generally within a few months after a hallucinogenic experience ) .
It is universally accepted , however , that these flashbacks are not the result of LSD remaining in the system .
LSD is almost entirely metabolized within a day after ingestion .
Since the half - life of LSD is only a few hours , only a very small amount of LSD remains even at the end of the trip , and this is excreted in the urine .
All traces are undetectable after several days and are certainly gone entirely within a couple of weeks .
As detection technology improves and thresholds drop ( it is now possible to detect picograms reliably ) , the time that incredibly small amounts of it could be detected will extend .
It has long been reported that LSD is fully metabolized almost immediately after ingestion .
This was based on research done in the 50's and 60s which used instruments not sensitive enough to detect the extremely small amounts of the chemical .
Occasionally , people claim that LSD has been found in spinal fluid years after the last time LSD was taken .
There is no support for this claim .
If anyone knows of a research article that has looked at spinal fluid of LSD users for LSD , please let us know .
Although research in the 1960s found the half - life of LSD was around 3 hours , more recent research shows that LSD 's metabolism takes several hours and its peak plasma levels occur at around 3 - 5 hours after ingestion .
It is important to note that such research is highly dependent on the individuals who were used for the research , with metabolism of many drugs varying by up to 2 - 3 times , larger numbers of research subjects reduces the likelihood of having a skewed range .
Wednesday on Live with Dan Abrams , MSNBC analyst Pat Buchanan was on the set with Democratic strategist Keli Goff and Air America 's Rachel Maddow to discuss the Geraldine Ferraro controversy .
Buchanan has gotten a lot of face time on MSNBC during the primary season and it's quite obvious after watching this clip that he 's in dire need of a vacation .

Buchanan , who took Ferraro 's side , reiterated the ridiculous claim that Barack Obama 's race is whats propelling his campaign and that the only reason he was allowed to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention was because he was black .
Goff took exception to that statement and as she was calling him out for it , things turned nasty and Buchanan lost his cool -- and paid a heavy price for it .
I ’ll give you a hint : it ’s not from the rebate checks .
Let me put it this way : from now on , I am going to exercise at least twice a week .
I ’m going to post the remaining Quantum Computing Since Democritus lectures .
I ’m going to finish writing up several papers that I ’ve been procrastinating on for years .
I ’m going to get involved in more non -work - or - blog - related social activities .
And I ’m going to do all of these things ( and have friends and family members vouch for it ) because if I do n’t , then money I ’ve already placed in escrow will be donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Library , as well as to the National Rifle Association .
Yeah , I signed up for the “ commitment contract ” service stickK.com , which was started in January by Yale economics professors Dean Karlan and Ian Ayres and student Jordan Goldberg .
You get to choose the “ anti- charities ” to which your money gets donated if you do n’t achieve your stated goals ; surprisingly , stickK itself does n’t take a cut ( it seems to get all its money from ad revenue ) .
The idea is obvious in retrospect ; what ’s amazing is that it took this long for anyone to build a company around it .
So far it seems to be working .
For example , I jogged on Tuesday and went swimming this morning , despite not having exercised for the previous six months .
What remains to be seen is whether W. can inspire me to new heights of research productivity .
An enormous hat tip to Michael Nielsen .
“ To this day , I still ca n’t understand how they can get away with it , ” Jean said .
“ You work for a company for 10 years and you give 150 percent .
I used to go above and beyond .
And then I get sick , something totally out of my control .
And then to get fired . ”
Her voice dropped off , then tears streamed down her cheeks .

Just inside the door of the men ’s room was a rack that held sweaty biking shirts , damp bathing suits and clammy running shoes .
The aroma seemed to belong more to a high school locker room than to a corporate headquarters .
But this was the house of Patagonia , the apparel company that prides itself on letting its employees take their play every bit as seriously as they take their work .
At lunchtime many days , Patagonia employees go surfing for two hours , while a half - dozen others take a 100 - minute , 27 - mile bike loop in the hills overlooking the Pacific .
One of the sweaty biking shirts belonged to Andy Welling , a sales manager at Patagonia ’s headquarters in Ventura , Calif .
At 41 , Welling is a fiend about staying in shape  he bikes several days a week at lunchtime , and joins Patagonia ’s weekly pick - up soccer game .
He often makes up for his lunchtime cycling by working a few hours at home in the evening .
Patagonia is so mellow about flextime that the receptionist at headquarters , an 11 - time world Frisbee champion , is allowed to take three months off each summer to run a surfing school .
“ I could make quite a bit more money working somewhere else , ” Welling said .
“ But to have the quality of life and to remain physically fit , by cycling or going surfing , you ca n’t put a dollar amount on it . ”
Welling has taken advantage of another Patagonia offering : the child care center at headquarters .
He drops off his two boys , 5 and 3 , at 9 and often has lunch with them .
“ Being able to have my kids a few feet away from me all the time is fantastic , ” Welling said .
“ It is a bonding relationship I never would have had if I were working somewhere else . ”
Patagonia is not like anywhere else .
With 1,300 workers and $ 275 million a year in sales , it donates 1 percent of its annual sales to environmental groups .
Four days a week at lunchtime , the company offers yoga and Pilates sessions ; there are also occasional classes on fly fishing .
Each year Patagonia lets 40 employees take paid two - month internships with an environmental group .
The best spots in the parking lot are reserved for the most fuel - efficient cars , and above dozens of parking spots are solar panels that supply all the power for one of Patagonia ’s administration buildings .

Ohio Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich spent some 290 minutes on the House floor Monday , reading Articles of Impeachment against President George Bush .
Not that you would notice , as there was a virtual media blackout on the story , but Keith Olbermann ran with it right out of the gate on Tuesday 's Countdown .
Constitutional Law Professor Jonathan Turley joined Keith to commend Kucinich and his impeachment bill , which is now co-sponsored by Rep. Robert Wexler .
While Turley says there are numerous crimes for which Bush could easily be impeached , the President 's greatest ally has been the Democratic Congress who have skirted their constitutional duties and consistently given him a pass rather than practice any oversight .
It 's clear impeachment will remain off the table for the remainder of Bush 's term , but as Keith put it , problems like this will never be solved if people like Kucinich and Wexler do n't stand up and say something .
Olbermann : " I 've often argued here , that even if you do n't think the words are n't lead to any actions , say the words anyway , simply to get them on the record for history and simply because , nothing has ever changed from bad to good in this country without somebody first saying , this is bad .
Assess the importance of what Dennis Kucinich did last night . "
Turley : " You know , it is very important .
The fact is , that this is not supposed to happen the way it 's happened in the last seven years .
The framers , I think , would have been astonished by the absolute passivity , if not the collusion of the Democrats in protecting President Bush from impeachment .
I mean , they created a system that was essentially idiot - proof , and God knows we 've put that to the test in the past few years , but I do n't think they anticipated that so many members of the opposition would stand quietly in the face of clear presidential crimes . "
On a side note , major kudos go out to Keith and Countdown for beating BillO for the week in the crucial 25 - 45 demo !
Still , Democrats were stunned one Saturday in late March when , by their account , John Weaver , Mr. McCain ’s longtime political strategist , reached out to Thomas J. Downey , a former Democratic congressman from Long Island who had become a lobbyist with powerful connections on Capitol Hill .
In Mr. Downey ’s telling , Mr. Weaver posed a question to him over lunch that left him stunned .
“ He says , ‘ John McCain is wondering why nobody ’s ever approached him about switching parties , or becoming an independent and allying himself with the Democrats , ’ ” Mr. Downey said in a recent interview .
“ My reaction was , ‘ When I leave this lunch , your boss will be called by anybody you want him to be called by in the United States Senate . ’ ”
Mr. Weaver recalls the conversation differently .
He said that Mr. Downey had told him that Democrats , eager to find a Republican who would switch sides and give them control of the evenly divided Senate , had approached some Republican senators about making the jump .
“ I stated they could n’t be so desperate as they had n’t reached out to McCain , ” Mr. Weaver said in an e-mail message last week .
Whatever transpired , Mr. Downey raced home and immediately called Mr. Daschle .
It was the first step in what became weeks of conversations that April between Mr. McCain and the leading Democrats , among them Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and John Edwards , then a senator from North Carolina , about the possibility of Mr. McCain ’s leaving his party .
One factor driving Mr. McCain , Mr. Downey said , was his bad relations with the Republican caucus .
“ They had booed him once when he came in , ” Mr. Downey said .
“ It was bad stuff in the caucus .
He did n’t see his future with these guys . ”
Mark Salter , one of Mr. McCain ’s closest advisers , said that Mr. McCain , although flattered , never took the idea of leaving the party seriously .
The topic was in any case overtaken in May when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont abandoned the Republicans and changed the balance of power .
By June , when Mr. Daschle spent a long - planned weekend with Mr. McCain at Mr. McCain ’s Arizona ranch , the question of changing parties was moot .
But less than three years later , Mr. McCain was once again in talks with the Democrats , this time over whether he would be Mr. Kerry ’s running mate .
In an interview with a blog last year , Mr. Kerry said that the initial idea had come from Mr. McCain ’s side , as had happened in 2001 .
How To Produce A Linux Screencast
Date : 27 February 2008 Tags : computing
Learning how to create Linux screencasts has been the most frustrating technical challenge that I have tackled for a very long time .
I should have been worried when a search for “ Linux video editing ” returned , as its top hit , a bare and completely unstyled web page from 2002 which concludes that “ video editing on Linux has n't really arrived yet . ”
My efforts were , in the end , successful , and you can see the result — my first two screencasts — in my previous blog entry , which I posted earlier this week .
In the hope that my toil can benefit others , let me outline the details of the process that I have worked out for creating , editing , and posting Linux screencasts .
For the impatient , here are the three most important things I learned :
Linux tools have great difficulty keeping audio and video from gradually going out of sync over several minutes .
To avoid problems , always run recordmydesktop with its “ on - the - fly encoding ” option , and never let “ ffmpeg ” anywhere near your audio !
This not only means that you have to use “ mencoder ” instead when converting between video formats , but even within mencoder you must avoid the “ lavc ” audio module , since its code seems to have the same problems .
Do not attempt to directly edit the resulting Ogg / Theora video !
Instead , convert first to the Digial Video ( DV ) format , and perform your editing there .
Be prepared for the fact that DV files are enormous , and that DV pixels are not square .
Finally , convert to something like AVI for submission to Google Video .
Avoid submitting a raw Ogg / Theora file , since even though Google can decode it , their decoders will waste valuable screen space by placing an empty border around the result .
For those interested in more details , I have more to share .

Recording the screencast
In order to record a screencast using Linux , use recordmydesktop .
I can't tell you how to get your sound card working with it , because — much to my surprise — when I plugged my old 1990s - vintage sound card microphone into my sound card , it simply worked and my voice was right there in the recording .
So I was at least spared an epic battle with my audio configuration .
The recordmydesktop tool produces video in the open Ogg / Theora format , and the results look very sharp .
It names its first output file out.ogv and , if you run it again , next uses the names out .
ogv.1 , out .ogv.2 , and so forth .
This makes it easy to sort through the clips that you have produced after making several attempts at a particular scene .
There are four options that I found helpful when using recordmydesktop :
Ask for the video to be encoded during recording , rather than at the end : recordmydesktop -- on - the - fly - encoding
Ask for a full screen - shot to be made every frame : -- full - shots Impressive , uses OpenGL to produce extremely smooth transitions between my PDF slides , and only full screen - shots capture the contents of OpenGL accelerated windows .
( If you 're curious : I created my presentation slides with OpenOffice Impress , and then exported to PDF . )

( If you 're curious : I created my presentation slides with OpenOffice Impress , and then exported to PDF . )
Choose a recording area and frame rate appropriate for the Digital Video format we will use for editing : - fps 29.97 - width 720 - height 528 Jukka

Aho 's guide to video resolution , without which this aspect ratio problem might have left me very confused .
Finally , I ask for the recording area to be offset a bit from the upper - left corner of the screen : - x 20 - y 40
I noticed that recordmydesktop often does not record exactly the area that I specify .
Instead , it seems to have a fondness for rounding the height and width to multiples of 16 .
But all that matters is that the recording area is close to the right size , since , again , I use the handy border that it draws around the area — and not the exact numbers I have specified — to position the windows I 'm recording .
To make positioning windows in the recorded area easier , I tend to make their content slightly oversized .
When running KeyJnote , for example , I use :
keyjnote - f - g 724 x532 python - before - eggs .
pdf
This gives me a few pixels of leeway within which to position the window without its inner edges showing in the recording .
Similarly , I create my xterms with quite wide margins using the - b option , then drag the corners around until I like how much text is showing in the presentation area .
xterm - fa inconsolata - fs 16 - b 32
The fact that I only record an area 720 pixels wide leaves some space available toward the right side of my monitor , where I can place things like a narrow text editor with notes about what I want to say , which tends to make my screencast smoother than if I am making up words as I go along .
Editing the presentation
After recording my first presentation , I tried every single movie editor that I could find for Linux , and finally concluded that none of them could edit Ogg / Theora videos .
They either failed to recognize the file format , or would crash during editing , or produce garbled output .
The format does seem to be rather obscure outside the Free Software world , so I tried converting my video to more popular formats before editing it — and found that many of the same problems still arose !
I have concluded that the movie editors available under Linux are simply not prepared for the challenges of editing highly compressed video formats .
When dealing with compressed video , merely displaying a given frame when the user clicks on it can be a lot of work — one must first rewind to the most recent keyframe , then apply the series of changes encoded in the subsequent frames .
Obviously , even the simplest editing can make complete hash of the existing sequence of keyframes and updates .
After doing even simple edits , I found that I could no longer even click somewhere on my recording and have a coherent image come up in the movie editor .
After hours of experimentation and research , I have adopted the Digital Video ( DV ) format for all of my editing .
The DV format was designed with editing in mind : each frame is independently compressed .
This makes it a very easy format for a program to handle as you select frames , cut out segments of video , and paste them back in somewhere else .
Although the DV format can only support a few fixed screen sizes , whose dimensions and aspect ratios were determined by the ancient properties of broadcast television , its NTSC size of 720×480 is plenty large enough to capture the detail in a typical screencast — particularly if you are going to be mixing it down to the size supported by a video - sharing site like YouTube or Google Video .
As I mentioned at the beginning of this article , always use mencoder from the MPlayer project for converting video .
To create an editable DV file from the out.ogv produced by recordmydesktop , I use the command :
mencoder out .
ogv - ovc libdv - oac pcm \ - vf scale = 720 : 480 - o editme .
dv
This command also goes ahead and converts the square pixels off of your screen into pixels with the proper shape for the DV format .
Do be prepared for the fact that the DV format results in recordings that are absolutely enormous .
Plan on the file consuming about a gigabyte for every four minutes of video , and simply consider this the cost of having every single frame randomly accessible during the editing process .
Which video editor should you use ?
I lack the time to produce a full review of each option .
Instead , I will heartily recommend that you use Cinelerra , for three reasons :
Cinelerra is a “ non-linear ” video editor , which means that it shows you a time - line picture of your presentation , including your audio track .
It 's the audio track that 's especially important !
Each of your words shows up as a visible bump in the volume , which makes it really easy to put sentences back together again if , while recording , you made a mistake , paused , and then repeated the last few words again to get them correct .
Cinelerra does not actually alter your source video file .
Each time you save your project , it just saves a tiny project.xml file listing the pieces of video and audio that you 've clipped together on its timeline .
This means that it's not wasting effort trying to modify your multi-gigabyte DV file ; instead , it 's just remembering which frames of the DV file should be rendered after all of your cutting and pasting are complete .
file listing the pieces of video and audio that you 've clipped together on its timeline .
This means that it's not wasting effort trying to modify your multi-gigabyte DV file ; instead , it 's just remembering which frames of the DV file should be rendered after all of your cutting and pasting are complete .
Because Cinelerra does n't save any information inside of your video file , you can actually just delete the DV file when you 're done using Cinelerra !
If you want the ability to do more editing in the future , just keep around your original Ogg / Theora file and the project.xml generated from Cinelerra , and you can always re-generate the DV file ( with the command given above ) and then re-run Cinelerra .
One hint : when Cinelerra starts , not only will its timeline window appear , but also a window for recording video off of a live camera .
Close the recording window , which wo n't help you during editing , and use the “ Windows ” pull - down menu to open a “ Compositor ” window instead .
It is the Compositor window that will let you see your presentation 's video as you edit .
When you are done editing and are ready to have Cinelerra “ render ” the result to a new movie file , you are given a choice of output formats .
I found that saving to yet another Ogg / Theora file gave the best results .
Mixing back down
Finally , before you submit your screencast to Google Video , or YouTube , or wherever , there are three final goals to be accomplished :
Convert it into a popular format that the hosting service will appreciate .
Though Google Video can now process Ogg / Theora files , it seems to put ugly margins around them .
I found that submitting the same data as an AVI file produced much more attractive results .
( Not that Google Video has terribly good image quality either way ! )
Adjust the resolution .
Typically , you will want to reduce it from 720 pixels across to something more modest .
Finally , in my case the volume always needs to be adjusted ; my microphone is very quiet .
So , I ask for the volume to be increased so that my voice hovers around half of full volume .
Listen to your result , and change this number to suit your own taste .
All three of these final goals are accomplished with a single command line :
mencoder cinelerra .
ogg - vf scale = 640 : 480 \ - af volnorm = 1 : 0.5 - ovc lavc - oac twolame \ - o final .
avi
The final .avi file is now ready to be posted on the Web !
I hope this helps someone through the frustrations of preparing a screencast themselves .
I myself will be looking for more screencast topics in the near future , so that I can use all of this advice again myself .
Good luck !

A few days ago , we talked about the Inbox by Gmail update that will allow users to receive notifications only for high - priority emails .
This update was welcomed with open arms by a lot of users , but many tech experts are wondering : is it really worth your while to choose the high - priority notification setting ?
This is a difficult question to answer since different people have different preferences .
But , before you turn on this setting , you ’ll want to consider the following :
PROS
It helps you stay focused —
Since you ’ll receive fewer notifications , your attention wo n’t be constantly interrupted by a blinking and vibrating phone and you ’ll get to focus on your tasks .
It helps you save time —
Getting only high - priority notifications means that you ’ll check your phone only when you have important emails .
You wo n’t have to waste your time opening your email app only to find that the new emails you ’ve received are n’t that urgent .
It helps keep your phone uncluttered —
Nobody loves having a phone that has a laundry list of notifications for the owner to check .
With the new feature , you ’ll keep your phone less cluttered and ensure that you ’ll see only notifications for important emails .
CONS
It might not be that accurate — Gmail ( and Google as a whole ) is pretty accurate at determining which emails can be classified as urgent .
However , since the feature is still in its infancy , there ’s a small chance that Inbox by Gmail might mistakenly tag an urgent email as non-urgent — and vice versa .
On the plus side , it ’s safe to assume that this wo n’t be a long - term problem as the app becomes more intelligent in identifying important messages .
It might make you complacent —
With the new feature in place , you ’ll naturally be confident that you ’ll receive notifications for all your important emails .
But what about those that are n’t urgent but still require you to take action within a certain amount of time ?
If these emails are n’t considered as “ high priority ” , and if you do n’t manually check your inbox on a regular basis , you might miss these messages and lose the chance to take action on them .
These are the pros and cons of the new high - priority notification setting in Inbox by Google .
Weigh the advantages and disadvantages before turning on this feature to ensure you ’re getting the better part of the bargain !
The Vikings buried on the Danish island of Funen may very well have sailed all the way to Constantinople or Baghdad or Moscow , looting and pillaging with lusty ferocity .
And now we 've got their DNA .
In a study published today in Public Library of Science ONE , Danish scientists describe the retrieval of genetic material from ten Viking skeletons found in an ancient burial site near the city of Odense .
The remains date to 1000 AD , the twilight of Viking civilization .
The scientific team was led by the Institute of Forensic Medicine 's Jorgen Dissing , who previously showed that the last Viking king was buried with his daughter - in - law , not his mom .
The discovery of the DNA is not in itself extraordinary ( though it certainly is cool to have Viking DNA samples ) .
The significance instead lies in the steps the researchers took to keep the DNA free from contamination .
Recovering ancient DNA is a notoriously tricky task .
First scientists must find a decently preserved sample .
Then they have to keep it from becoming tainted by other genetic material .
This is n't easy .
Stray DNA is to researchers what dust is to regular people : inevitable and nearly escapable .
That 's what spoiled Cretaceous - era dinosaur DNA and Neolithic remains found in Spain .
Academic literature is full of reports on promising samples gone bad , or parsing the techniques needed to be sure that ancient DNA does n't actually come from a stray flake of lab technician skin .
To recover the Viking samples , the researchers took extra-special care .
Before removing the last layer of dirt from the skeletons , they donned full - body biohazard gear – and this was merely the first step through a gauntlet of sterility that might have been invented by a demented Mr. Clean .
Afterwards they compared the recovered DNA to a database of present - day DNA
types , just to make sure it did n't come from anyone born this side of the Dark Ages – and it did n't .
Finally , to quantify what sort of contamination is produced by standard operating procedures , they had eight samples taken according to current ( less stringent ) handling practices .
Four of these picked up stray DNA , underscoring the importance of cleanliness in studying ancient genetic material .
Beyond keeping clean , what else did they learn ?
In population genetics terms , not much .
A few of the samples ' genetic signatures do n't show up in modern Scandinavians , which is mildly interesting but not terribly surprising .
A few others show up throughout western and central Europe – hardly surprising , given the Vikings ' longboat - borne migrations .
There is , however , a seriously cool entertainment possibility in the research : just take this story , add the ability to revive ancient DNA , toss in some embryonic genetic modification and – voila !
– a ready - made Hollywood schlockbuster plot .
I can just see the pitch session now : " It 's like Boys From Brazil , but with Harald
Hardrade . "
Not that I 'm advocating this in reality , nor are the scientists , nor is it scientifically possible .
Or is it ?
Recall some famous advice , coincidentally also set in Denmark :
There are more things in heaven and Earth , Horatio , then are dreamt of in your PubMed abstracts ....

In older games we separated the notion of “ logical ” or “ game ” coordinates from “ physical ” or “ pixel ” coordinates .
Tiles for example were addressed in logical coordinates , and we had coordinate transformations to go between tile and pixel space .
There ’s also the notion of physical “ world ” coordinates and “ screen ” coordinates , with transforms between the two .
I wanted to explore the idea of having logical coordinates that did n’t correspond to tiles or pixels .
This game idea is that you are playing the role of a tiny ship inside a giant creature .
As you traverse the blood vessels and shoot the white blood cells of the immune system , the creature becomes more agitated .
As its heart beats faster , ripples run down the arteries , and the entire creature may start moving about .
The game becomes more difficult not because the enemies are tougher , but because the world itself is changing and becoming somewhat disorienting .
The demo shows a randomly generated corridor ( blood vessel ) , along with a yellow circle that represents the player .
You can click on any location in the corridor to make the player move there , but you have to turn on the animation before you see any movement .
( This is a screen shot of the Flash demo , because your browser does not show Flash . )
Coordinate System
If you turn on debug mode , you will see the black line which represents the “ spine ” of the corridor .
I chose to use the position along the spine as the primary coordinate , and the distance from the spine as the secondary coordinate .
( However , I have n’t implemented the secondary coordinate for this demo . )
As the map moves around , the player moves with it .
You can also generate a new corridor and see that the player is still positioned within the corridor ( on the spine , since I do n’t have the secondary coordinate ) .
In some random maps you can see the points bunching up together , which is a sign the constraints are preventing further rotation .
Occasionally this causes the animation to be jerky , as a constraint causes further changes up the corridor .
Corridor Generation
I also played with random corridor generation ( random world / map / dungeon generation is one of my interests ) .
With debug information on , you can see that the corridor is many segments .
Each segment has an angle that ’s randomly offset from the previous segment ’s angle .
The left ( violet ) and right ( purple ) points constrain the angle ; they ca n’t cross back behind the previous segment ’s edges .
The distance from the spine to the edges is also random .
During the animation , the distance from the spine to each edge varies with a sine wave ( the left and right are not in sync ) , and the change in angle from segment to segment also varies with a sine wave .
Source
The source code is available , but it ’s not very well documented , and there are several things I did n’t bother implementing ( such as the second coordinate ) .
A community in Canada has an unusual form of solar power that can provide over 90 % of the annual heating and hot water needs for the homes , despite being situated in a cold Alberta location where winter temperatures can reach - 33 degrees C ( - 27 F ) .
The Drake Landing Solar Community collects solar energy in a heat storage fluid through an array of solar panels on the roof of each home and covering all of the garages at the back of each home .
The heated fluid is transferred to a neighborhood energy center , and then into the ground beneath an insulated layer , where the heat is stored in the earth .
Combined together , the 52 home community is able to collect and store enough energy from the sun during the summer that the ground storage temperatures reach 80 degrees C ( 176 F ) .
This heat is sufficiently insulated beneath the ground that it can be drawn from throughout the winter to provide heat and hot water .
The homes in the community are moderately sized , ranging from 1,492 to 1,664 square feet , and are insulated to a level 30 % higher than the average home in Canada in order to keep the energy needs low enough to work with the system .
The homes are also closely located to one another .
This provides a more walkable neighborhood , as well as reducing the lengths that the fluid for the solar heating system needs to travel .
Entire Neighborhood Has Shared Solar Heating
The system works in part due to the scale of the project utilizing the combined capacity of the entire community .
A similar system scaled down to a single family home version would not work as efficiently simply because too much heat would be lost .
But the scale of a system for 52 households makes this a feasible project .
While the technology is similar to a ground source heat pump , which relies on a relatively stable , constant temperature of the ground , the Drake Landing Community is actually storing heat throughout the summer and then relying on that banked heat during the winter .
Solar heating is a more exciting prospect than solar generation of electricity because heating is a much larger percentage of a home ’s total energy use ( 60 % for space heating , 20 % for water heating , and 20 % for appliances , lights , and other electrical loads ) .

HONJO , Japan ( Reuters ) - Thinking of throwing out your old cell phone ?
Think again .
Maybe you should mine it first for gold , silver , copper and a host of other metals embedded in the electronics -- many of which are enjoying near - record prices .
Printed circuit boards , collected from discarded electronic items , are piled up at Dowa Holdings Co's Eco - System Recycling Co , a recycling plant , in Honjo , north of Tokyo March 28 , 2008 .
Thinking of throwing out your old cell phone ?
Think again .
Maybe you should mine it first for gold , silver , copper and a host of other metals embedded in the electronics -- many of which are enjoying near - record prices .

It ’s called “ urban mining ” , scavenging through the scrap metal in old electronic products in search of such gems as iridium and gold , and it is a growth industry around the world as metal prices skyrocket .
The materials recovered are reused in new electronics parts and the gold and other precious metals are melted down and sold as ingots to jewellers and investors as well as back to manufacturers who use gold in the circuit boards of mobile phones because gold conducts electricity even better than copper .
“ It can be precious or minor metals , we want to recycle whatever we can , ” said Tadahiko Sekigawa , president of Eco - System Recycling Co which is owned by Dowa Holdings Co Ltd .
A tonne of ore from a gold mine produces just 5 grams ( 0.18 ounce ) of gold on average , whereas a tonne of discarded mobile phones can yield 150 grams ( 5.3 ounce ) or more , according to a study by Yokohama Metal Co Ltd , another recycling firm .
The same volume of discarded mobile phones also contains around 100 kg ( 220 lb ) of copper and 3 kg ( 6.6 lb ) of silver , among other metals .
Recycling has gained in importance as metals prices hit record highs .
Gold is trading at around $ 890 ( 449 pounds ) an ounce , after hitting a historic high of $ 1,030.80 in March .
Copper and tin are also around record highs and silver prices are well above long term averages .
RECYCLING METALS
Recycling electronics makes sense for Japan which has few natural resources to feed its billion dollar electronics industry but does have tens of millions of old cell phones and other obsolete consumer electronic gadgets thrown away every year .
“ To some it ’s just a mountain of garbage , but for others it ’s a gold mine , ” said Nozomu Yamanaka , manager of the Eco - Systems recycling plant where mounds of discarded cell phones and other electronics gadgets are taken apart for their metal value .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
At the factory in Honjo , 80 km ( 50 miles ) southwest of Tokyo , 34 - year - old Susumu Arai harvests some of that bounty .
A ribbon of molten gold flows into a mould where it sizzles and spits fire for a few minutes before solidifying into a dull yellow slab , on its way to becoming a 3 kg ( 6.6 lb ) gold bar , worth around $ 90,000 at current prices .
Wearing plastic goggles to protect his eyes while he works , Arai said he was awestruck when he started his job two years ago .
“ Now I find it fun being able to recover not just gold , but all sorts of metals , ” he said .
The scrap electronics and other industrial waste is first sorted and dismantled by hand .
It is then immersed in chemicals to dissolve unwanted materials and the remaining metal is refined .
Eco -System , established 20 years ago near Tokyo , typically produces about 200-300 kg ( 440 -660 lb ) of gold bars a month with a 99.99 percent purity , worth about $ 5.9 million to $ 8.8 million .
That ’s about the same output as a small gold mine .
Eco -System also recovers metals from old memory chips , cables and even black ink which contain silver and palladium .
RECYCLING CELL PHONES
But despite growing interest in the environment and recycling , the industry struggles to get enough old mobile phones to feed its recycling plants .
Japan ’s 128 million population uses their cell phones for an average of two years and eight months .
That ’s a lot of cell phone phones discarded every year , yet only 10 - 20 percent are recycled as people often opt to store them in their cupboards due to concerns about the personal data on their phones , said Yoshinori Yajima , a director at Japan ’s Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry .
Just 558 tonnes of old phones were collected for recycling in the year to March 2007 , down a third from three years earlier , industry figures show .
As metals prices rise , the Japanese industry faces growing competition for scrap , which is pushing up prices .
“ We are seeing more competition from Chinese firms , and naturally the goods go where the money is , ” Dowa ’s Takashi Morise said .
In response , Japanese firms are importing used circuit boards from Singapore and Indonesia , as they also contain valuable minor metals that Japan is particularly eager to recover .
These minor metals such as indium , a vital component in the production of flat panel televisions and computer screens , antimony and bismuth are indispensable for producing many high - tech products .
However , they are often not easy to acquire as China has tightened export controls , making it harder for Japanese manufacturers to buy these metals .
That ’s where the “ urban miners ” step in .
“ Our wish is to be able to help Japanese manufacturers that need these metals , ” Eco -System President Sekigawa said .

Memory in honeybees :
What the right and left antenna tell the left and right brain
It is widely known that the right and left hemispheres of the brain perform different tasks .
Lesions to the left hemisphere typically bring impairments in language production and comprehension , while lesions to the right hemisphere give rise to deficits in the visual - spatial perception , such as the inability to recognize familiar faces .
In the last few years , we have become used to the idea that functional asymmetry between the left and right sides of the nervous system is not unique to humans : fishes , amphibians , birds and mammals have functional and anatomical asymmetries .
So , the idea that all vertebrate species , even non-human ones without any linguistic skills , have an asymmetric brain seems to be finally accepted .
Now , this process of extension among species is going on and brain lateralization has been extended beyond the class Vertebrata .
Insects , with their nervous system so different from that of vertebrates , are also " lateralized " , as shown in a paper published in PLoS ONE by Lesley J. Rogers of the Centre for Neuroscience and Animal Behaviour , University of New England ( Australia ) , and Giorgio Vallortigara , of the Centre for Mind / Brain Sciences , University of Trento ( Italy ) .
The authors studied memory in bees using a widely tested procedure , known as proboscis extension reflex ( PER ) .
When presented with a droplet of sugar solution , the honeybee extends its proboscis to get it .
If an odour stimulus , such as lemon scent , is present shortly before the droplet , after very short training , animals learn to extend their proboscis when the odour alone is presented .
The honeybee can learn to discriminate between different odours , extending its proboscis to lemon and not to vanilla , keeping memory of the correct scent for a long period .
The odour is perceived by the two antennae that honeybees have on their heads .
After the bees had been trained using both antennae , Rogers and Vallortigara tested their recall ability , by coating either the left or right antenna with a harmless latex - based substance and thus rendering one antenna incapable of detecting odour .
The authors observed that , one hour after training , honeybees recognized the correct odour when the right antenna was in use and did n't when using the left antenna .
However , 24 hours after training , the pattern reversed : correct responses were significantly higher when the left antenna was in use .
The " lateralization " appears to be linked to memory consolidation .
Testing animals using lateral presentation ( the odour was presented to the left or right side of the bee ) and no coating of the antennae ( both antennae in use ) , the authors found that bees showed better recall of the task when they were tested at one hour after training using the right antenna , an effect that disappeared three hours after training .
However , by 6 hours after training , a lateral shift had occurred and the memory could be recalled mainly when the left antenna was in use .
The left antenna took over on the long period ( after 6 hours and remained so at 24 hours ) .
It would seem that the right antenna and the associated neural structures form the basis for a short term and relatively temporary memory , and left antenna supports long term learning , taking place from about 3 hours after training on .
It is not clear at present whether learning via the right antenna is sufficient to trigger shorter - term encoding on the right side of the brain and longer - term encoding on the left side of the brain .
An alternative hypothesis would be that the memory encoding is the same on both sides of the brain but only the right antenna has access for shorter - term recall and only the left antenna has access for longer - term recall .
What could the ecological reason for that be ?
Perhaps the shift from one antenna to the other allows use of the right antenna to learn about new odours without interference from odour memories in long - term stores .
It is known that bees visit different flowers at different times of the day , as nectar becomes available , and this would require the formation of different odour associations during the course of the day , a process that might be aided if recall of earlier odour memories is avoided on the learning side of the brain .

CIA Child Trafficking & MK - ULTRA Mind Control
by FIONA BARNETT ( August 2 , 2018 ) Connections Between CIA Child Trafficking , Ritual Abuse & MK - ULTRA Mind Control
Child trafficking is run as a single , integrated world operation .
This operation is coordinated by the CIA in collaboration with British and Australian intelligence services .
Retired NYPD
Detective James Rothstein was appointed to the first US taskforce to investigate this child trafficking operation which , he found , went all the way up to the Whitehouse .
Detective Rothstein found that the CIA were behind a blackmail operation in which child prostitutes were used to honey - trap and compromise politicians , military brass , top businessmen , and key government officials .
Rothstein , who arrested the key Watergate perpetrator , said Watergate solely concerned this human compromise racket , and specifically was an attempt to obtain a list of compromised pedophile VIPs and their proclivities that was held at the Democratic National Headquarters .
I spoke with Rothstein who said he knew of an identical VIP pedophile ring that existed here in Australia , and that an Australian intelligence officer named Peter Osborne knew the details of this .

The Australian wing of this child trafficking operation is coordinated by ASIO ( Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ) .
During the 1970s and 80s , Labour Party politician Kim Beazley Snr headed ASIO ’s child trafficking operation .
Under Kim Beazley ’s administration , I was prostituted , at age 6 years , to a pedophile orgy at Parliament House in Canberra , where I was raped by then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam , Attorney - General Lionel Murphy , and Governor - General John Kerr .
During this same excursion , future Prime Minister Bob Hawke raped me in a suburban backyard near Canberra , and former President Richard Nixon raped me in the back of a US / CIA military plane at Fairbairn , Australia ’s main military airport where Airforce One lands when it visits .
After this , I was child sex trafficked from Sydney airport to California , USA , in a cargo plane .
I was gassed and stuffed in a wooden crate like an animal .
During this trip , I was raped by media founder Ted Turner at a pedophile party held at Disneyland , and I was trafficked to the annual summer camp at Bohemian Grove attended by notable politicians , businessmen and other VIPs .
I was raped by Reverend Billy Graham in a pink bubble themed cabin at Bohemian Grove .
Billy Graham told me his good buddy Richard Nixon had recommended me to him .
At Bohemian Grove , I was one of a group of children dressed as teddy bears and hunted for sport by men in the forest , to the theme song Teddy Bears Picnic .
I also witnessed the ritual murder of a woman by male guests dressed in black Luciferian robes .
I will now lay the foundations for explaining the relationship between pedophilia , child trafficking , ritual abuse , mind control practises , and the CIA ’s Project MK - ULTRA .
I was handed over to the CIA child trafficking network by my paternal grandparents , Helen and Peter Holowczak , who resided at 14 McAlister Ave , Engadine , a suburb located in the Sutherland Shire , south of Sydney .
I was 15 years old when our family discovered that Peter Holowczak was not my blood relative .
This news was well - received , since Peter Holowczak was a sadistic pedophile who violently abused me from my earliest memory .
Peter Holowczak also abused my father and my brothers .
My father , who has complex PTSD and DID , once told my relatives : “ Everything Fiona says about the Satanists is true , but we just do n’t tell her , for her own good . ”
Peter and Helen Holowczak were amongst the large number of Slavic Nazi war criminals granted asylum by the Australian government through the International Refugee Organisation .
The wave of Slavic Nazis offered asylum in Australia was documented in Mark Aaron ’s book War Criminals Welcome : Australia , a Sanctuary for War Criminals Since 1945 .
During a 2001 episode of the television show Lateline , Aaron explained : Most of the war criminals who settled in Australia were not Germans or Austrians .
They were people from Central and Eastern Europe , from the Ukraine , the Baltic States , the central European countries of Czechoslovakia , Croatia and Serbia …
These people had done deals with western intelligence organisations , having given them intelligence were then secreted or allowed to go to third countries like Australia …
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre has a classification system whereby they rate ( from A to F ) how cooperative a country is with the process of locating , investigating and trying Nazi war criminals .
Australia is ranked F – the least cooperative .
Numerous Nazi war criminals settled in an area south of Sydney which ran from the Sutherland Shire to Wollongong .
These people worked and orgied together , just as they had done back in Nazi Europe .
They carried Slavic , Germanic , or Anglicised versions of their former , surnames .
The Holowczaks sought refuge from retaliation from the Allies for their collaboration with the Nazis .
From when I was 6 years old , Peter Holowczak bragged to me about killing Jews for a living in the Nazi death camp located in Lublin , Poland .
Helen was pursued by the Russians for her role in the Gestapo .
Her father spent two years in a Siberian work camp for refusing to disclose her whereabouts to the Russians .
Polish people tend to name things after literal life events .
The Holowczaks named their Australian house ‘ Lublin ’ and painted this title in folk art on a sign hung at the front entrance of their Engadine home .
Peter named his Doberman dog ‘ Satan ’ and trained him to hunt and rape children .
Helen , who regularly attended orgies with her Slavic refugee community , had three sons to three different men , none of whom were Peter Holowczak .
Helen almost named her youngest son ‘ Romance ’ until an Aussie neighbour told her we do n’t do that sort of thing in Australia .
Peter obtained his Doberman dog from another Slavic Nazi war criminal who was granted asylum in Australia .
This man supplied dogs to the NSW Police force .
He was also involved in the clean up and disposal of bodies following Luciferian ritual crimes .
What people must appreciate is that the Nazis were Luciferians .
During their height of power , the Nazis conducted Luciferian rituals in broad daylight in the streets of Germany .
Luciferianism is a secret , multi- generational religion with its roots in ancient Babylon and Egypt .
Luciferians worship various ancient pagan gods including Lucifer , Molech , Baal , Dagon , Imhotep , Horus , Isis , Anubis , and Seth .
Nazism drew out and promoted those Slavics who secretly practised Luciferianism .
My grandparents and the other Slavic war criminals who were granted asylum in Australia , congregated to covertly practise their brand of Nazi Luciferianism here in Australia .
Over time , the descendants of these Luciferian pedophile refugees collaborated with existing Luciferian dynasties such as the Kidmans , Conlons , Overtons , Huxleys , Cardens , and Cumpstons , and infiltrated Australian government and influenced law and policy .
This explains why right is being confused with wrong , why the government bodies support the perpetrator instead of the victim of crime , and why our legislation is increasingly reflecting Luciferian pedophile doctrine .
This explains , for prime example , why the Australian Human Rights Commission recently defended a pedophile who lied on his job application about his conviction and fined the employee for refusing to hire the pedophile .
The president of the AHRC , who made that decision , is one of my Luciferian pedophile rapists .
Leonas Petrauskas was a close associate of my Lithuanian grandmother Helen Holowczak .
Like the Holowczaks , Petrauskas was granted asylum through the International Refugee Organisation .
In fact , the IRO employed him as a medic for a period in Europe .
Petrauskas was educated in a Jesuit school .
The Jesuits are Luciferians who practise ritual murder and child rape .
An increasing number of Australian politicians who hold power are Jesuits .
Owing to his Jesuit training , Leonas Petrauskas assumed the role of head Luciferian priest within the Sutherland Shire Catholic diocese .
Roman Catholicism stems from Mithraism , the ancient Luciferian cult in which male priests were married to boy brides ( altar boys ) , and temple prostitutes ( nuns ) bore children to the priests for ritual murder on key ritual dates .
The Latin mass is a whitewashed version of the high Luciferian black mass in which a new - born baby is ritually murdered , and its blood and flesh eaten .
This is the ritual that occurred at Bathurst City Hall in 1985 , presided over by the AHRC President .
Most of my perpetrators were raised Catholic , and many associated with the Catholic colleges located at Sydney University , particularly Patricia Ann Conlon who lived at Sancta Sophia College at Sydney University .
Patricia Ann Conlon ( nee Carden ) was the Grande Dame of the Sydney area .
As Jesuit high priest , Leonas Petrauskas presided over Luciferian rituals committed in the following Catholic Churches : Regina Coli Church , Beverly Hills , Sutherland Shire ( which was gifted by , and closely associated with , the US military ) , BoysTown chapels located at Engadine , Sutherland Shire , St John Bosco church located opposite Engadine BoysTown Other key Catholic sites of Luciferian ritual were : St James chapel located on Sydney University campus , St Mary ’s Cathedral , Sydney City .
Luciferianism is arranged according to a hierarchical structure which vaguely resembles a caste system .
At the very top sit 13 family dynasties including the Rothschilds and the British Royal Family .
These are recognised by the cult as demi-gods .
Below these sit approximately 300 Luciferian bloodlines who are generally high IQ , although this tends to have been watered down in some families due to intermarriage .
Below this group sit the commoners who can never attain higher status because they lack the desired bloodline .
These are your random covens based on nationality ( e.g. , there ’s a strong Scottish coven in Bundaberg ) , sexual orientation ( e.g. , Bond University has a lesbian coven ) , gang membership ( bikie gangs ) , or self - styled , whatever goes these days .
It is from these lines that the cult obtains ‘ breeders ’ – women who are forced to breed unregistered babies for sacrifice and sex trafficking .
We refer to these bottom feeders as ‘ coven scum ’ .
Their behaviour is usually barbaric and requires constant management to stop them exposing the cult , and they show no respect for those in the caste above them .
There is much jealousy and animosity directed by these lower members toward the blood - liners .
I stem from one of the 300 bloodlines via my biological paternal grandparents – not the Holowczaks who had the IQ of a toilet block and so resented my heritage and status within the cult .
I question whether Helen Holowczak is my biological grandmother , and whether she used my father as just another prop to escape Europe .
Helen lied to the European immigration authorities by saying Peter Holowczak was her husband and the father of my father .
Peter and Helen were married in Bathurst Australia in the early 1950’s .
We located my real paternal grandfather in Jelenia Gora , Poland .
I met him , and to my delight he was everything Peter Holowczak was not : intelligent , attractive , highly respected , and ethical .
When I was 14 years old , Grande Dame Patricia Ann Conlon chose me to succeed her .
With Sydney being the capitol of Luciferianism , this effectively made Conlon the highest ranking female Luciferian in Australia .
I was selected based on my Aryan appearance , IQ level , bloodline , flawless body , strength , skills and teachability .
Women with blonde or red hair were candidates , and this related to the appearance of the Aryans / Pleiadians that ( as the history well books document ) the Nazis aspired to .
Blood - liners are encouraged to marry within their caste .
The father of my children is of the Gardiner Luciferian bloodline .
He is the blood relative of Tony Gardiner , the mother of the current King of Jordan who converted to Islam and changed her name to Muna .
Therefore , my daughters are double targets of this Luciferian cult .
I have striven to protect my kids from the cult ’s kidnapping and luring attempts .
Cult members who serve in the NSW Police force attempted to kidnap my 10 - year - old child , in 2015 .
My efforts to fight this resulted in the NSW police apologising to my daughter and giving her a police showbag .
Child rape , torture , and murder are routinely practised within Luciferianism for various reasons :
These acts are established traditions thought to appease their god Lucifer .
Some members get off on raping and murdering kids , but not all .
The ones who like it were conditioned to be sexually aroused by it through being abused and exposed to such practises as children .
It is believed to bestow power on the practitioner .
Sodomy is called the ‘ fountain of youth ’ and is thought to transfer the child ’s youth to the abusing adult .
Luciferianism is a cult .
Cult indoctrination alone is a strong enough influence on human behaviour .
But the impact of indoctrination is reinforced by fear of the consequences of betraying or exposing the cult .
The number one rule of Luciferianism is – there is no such thing as Luciferianism .
At age 6 years , I was well taught this lesson .
I was taken into a national park .
There I witnessed a man ( who was a traitor ) have each of his 4 limbs tied to 4 different vehicles which drove at high speed in opposite directions .
That incident taught me not to talk about the Luciferian cult I was raised in .
Mind control is a Luciferian tradition stemming back thousands of years .
Luciferian offspring are trained in witchcraft , astral projection , and psychic manipulation of the physical elements .
Children are tested at age 3 for whether they should be raised with conscious or dissociated awareness of their cult involvement .
Children with a strong ethical objection to cult practises are never made aware of their involvement .
These children are forced to dissociate through trauma , and their minds fragmented .
My husband and I were two such children .
My memory of my involvement in these cult activities were mostly dissociated from my everyday thinking .
Some awareness slipped through , such as when at age 12 years , the mother of my best friend Fiona LeCornu - Levett , came to collect me from my step - grandfather ’s house , to take me to her Macquarie Fields home for a visit .
Jan Levett overheard me screaming at Peter Holowczak that he was never to touch me again , by order of the Sutherland Shire high Luciferian priest Leonas Petrauskas .
As we drove off in her car , Jan asked me what on earth that was all about .
I diverted the conversation .
But I forever recalled the incident in my conscious mind .
I also remember the time at age 11 years , when I tried to tell my mother about my child abuse .
I started the conversation by saying I was special .
My clueless mother told me I was telling fibs , and so I abandoned this attempt .
When I was 8 years old , my mother , brother and I painted a mural on my bedroom wall .
I drew what I described as a Dr Who time tunnel , after the image seen during the opening credits of the British TV series .
I was trying to tell my mother that I had just been suffocated during an Egyptian rebirth ritual in which I was placed in a grave over a decomposed body , while the Book of the Dead was chanted .
I died , was revived , and awoke in Sutherland hospital , surrounded by concerned medical staff .
I had a near death experience while I was unconscious and saw a tunnel that resembled the one shown at the start of Dr Who .
I was trying to tell my mother what the cult did to me .
My memories of Luciferianism immediately flooded my conscious mind in the form of sudden onset vertigo and PTSD flashbacks , after Peter Holowczak was found hanged to death at Easter , 1991 .
My memories did not emerge due to therapeutic intervention , hypnosis , or the like .
The coroner ’s report ruled the death suicide .
However , Helen told my mother that a group of men arrived at her house that day and ordered her to go shopping .
On her return , Helen found Peter hanging from his chook shed .
“ You killed him ! ”
Helen screamed at me when I visited her with my mother and husband , to confront her about Peter ’s sexual abuse of me .
My Uncle John pointed out that I was not even in Sydney when Peter died .
What Helen meant was – the cult killed Peter as punishment for mistreating me and driving me far away from Sydney .
Peter Holowczak was not solely to blame for my leaving the cult .
Antony Kidman ( Nicole Kidman ’s father ) and Rosalind Frances Croucher ( current president of Australian Human Rights commission ) were to blame .
I was selected as Grande Dame by my predecessor , Patricia Anne Conlon .
Rosalind Croucher was ambitious , jealous , and wanted the position for herself ; Consequently , after Patricia Anne Conlon ’s death , Rosalind Croucher sought revenge by organising the Bathurst City Hall birthday gathering in 1985 , in which I was raped on an alter by B - grade actor Bruce Spence in front of a room full of Luciferian pedophiles including multiple NSW Police and Catholic priests .
Rosalind Croucher presided over this violation of my human rights , alongside NSW Police commissioner John Avery , Australian cricket captain Richie Benaud , and ASIO officer and federal politician Kim Beazley Snr .
During the ritual , a fully pregnant breeder and her unborn baby , plus a group of approximately 10 children , were ritually murdered on stage .
The whole sordid event ended in a pedophile orgy in which I was gang raped by a group including Rosalind Croucher who urinated in my mouth .
Rosalind Croucher , AHRC President The Bathurst City Hall crime gave me grounds for leaving the cult .
I had just turned 16 when I was summoned before the Luciferian Grand Council that met in Sydney University ’s MacLaurin Hall .
Sydney University hosts the Australian headquarters of the OTO ( Ordo Templis Orientis ) which Antony Kidman and my other key perpetrators were members of .
When I was aged 9 years , I witnessed Antony Kidman preside over the ritual murder of a young boy in Sydney University ’s Great Hall .
Nicole Kidman was 11 years old and present , sitting in the front row , during this murder .
This was an OTO themed ritual murder , with Kidman and four others dressed in rather camp , theatrical coloured robes based on the Eastern Star pentagram which dominates the Alistair Crowley Thelema offshoots including Freemasonry and the OTO .
Eastern Star Pentagram
I bring your attention to a document titled , Ordo Templis Orientis , INTERNATIONAL CAMP , OASIS AND LODGE MASTER’S HANDBOOK , Revised Spring Equinox , 2002 .
Page 33 of this document lists the name Kylie McKiernan as treasurer of the OTO .
Kylie was in a senior administrative position within the ABC broadcasting network in 2015 , when the ABC TV show Media Watch publicly attacked me for speaking to a press conference about my child trafficking experiences .
The presenter of this show is British Intelligence .
Page 22 of this handbook states :
Do n’t sacrifice animals or perform any other actions or practices which might adversely affect the Order ’s reputation or legal standing , including … explicit sexual acts at official or public - access events .
That ’s something you would n’t read in your local football club handbook .
So why do the OTO feel it necessary to warn their members not to publicly perform ritual blood sacrifice ?
The Freemasons were also involved in my abuse .
I was subjected to Luciferian pedophile rituals at various Masonic Temples , including Antony Kidman ’s home lodge at 317 Pacific highway , North Sydney .
My leaving the Sydney based Luciferian cult left them in a pickle .
A Grande Dame assumes the position by drawing in the dying breath of the previous Grande Dame .
During my Grande Council hearing , Antony Kidman warned me I would amount to nothing without the cult ’s backing .
True to Kidman ’s word , my ability in , and pursuit of , every one of my interest areas has been thwarted by cult members to this day .
I will give you an example .
20 years ago , I worked as a parole officer .
I was appointed to the Corrective Services office at Burleigh Heads .
A woman named Catherine Hand wanted the job of boss of Bulreligh Heads office .
So , her mate Rod who was regional director of Corrective Services seconded the current boss of Burleigh Heads office , against his will , to work at an office one hour ’s drive north of his Burleigh home .
John had been boss of a fully functioning Burleigh Heads office for 20 years .
Catherine Hand who had a diploma in art and zero experience as a parole officer , took over and systematically bullied out the existing Burleigh Heads staff and replaced them with young inexperienced women like me .
On one occasion , she pinned a , 18 - year - old parole officer named Chris up against the wall .
She screamed at him the he was a “ fucking idiot ! ” in front of the convicted criminals who were present in the office .
Chris was a brilliant young employee who went on to work for the Federal police .
One day , Catherine Hand took me aside for a little chat .
“ Fiona , have you seen my ring ? ” she asked me .
She showed off her ring which was an Eastern Star pentagram with coloured gemstones .
“ This is my coven ring , ” she explained .
“ Every two years , the women in my coven meet up , no matter where we are in the world .
Fiona , if you play your cards right , you will go far in management . ”
Catherine Hand informed me that a pottery lecturer from the Queensland College of Art ( where she and I had both graduated from ) was also a member of her “ coven . ”
I had only been at the office 3 months and was disgusted by Catherine Hand ’s mistreatment of existing staff ; so , I declined her offer by saying , “ I ’m not management material . ”
The following day , I lodged a formal complaint against Catherine Hand for her mistreatment of staff .
Catherine then physically assaulted me by pinning me to a wall and sticking her face in mine .
She gave me 10 minutes to vacate my desk .
The Department of Corrective Services then sent me a letter to say that I had done nothing wrong but that I was being let go because I had been filling in for a woman on maternity leave ( that was the first I had heard of this ) .
I lodged a complaint with WorkCover .
The government then hired a private detective to harass and film me at taxpayers ’ expense .
The second in charge of the Corrective Services Department told my barrister that she could “ Do whatever the fuck we like ” to me .
Eastern Star ring
The latest workplace at which I was targeted by Luciferians was Bond University .
My Bond University supervisor , Norm Barling , a former Bond University lecturer , contemptuously called my Forensic Psychology lecturers , Katarina Fritzon and Rebecca Doley “ lesbian witches ” after these women lied to the Australian health board about me and so destroyed my psychology career , despite my excellent academic record .
Their attack came after I rejected Katarina Fritzon ’s sexual advances which included two sexual assaults , objected in class to pro-pedophile lecture content , and exposed Bond University ’s coverup of a child sex trafficking ring that involved the Queensland state Department of Children ’s Services ( DOCS ) .
This was linked to a South - East Queensland DOCS pedophile ring that police raided in the year 2000 .
DOCS staff were intentionally placing foster children with pedophiles who were prostituting the kids out .
These child trafficking DOCS staff had passed working with children safety checks .
My adhering to mandatory reporting legislation was supported by the head of the Queensland Children ’s Commission , despite Bond University having withdrawn my complaint without consulting me , determined there were grounds for investigating my complaint .
I was somewhat vindicated when Bond University forensic psychology and criminology lecturer Paul Wilson was convicted and imprisoned in 2016 for pedophilia .
Paul Wilson published pro-pedophilia articles on the Bond University website , in which he claimed children were willing participants in pedophilia and not harmed by it .
In the 1980s , Paul Wilson organised a pro-pedophilia conference at University of Queensland , and in class he accidentally showed the end of kiddie porn snuff film .
Paul Wilson ’s wife Robyn Lincoln , also a Bond University lecturer , was on the advisory board of Bravehearts , a fake child abuse victim advocacy group which targets victims of VIP child abuse for silencing .
For example , see the biography of Sarah Monahan , the child TV star who was sexually abused by actor Robert Hughes on the set of the Hey Dad ! TV show .
Bravehearts tried to destroy Sarah ’s case .
‘ Sexual Experiences Between Men & Boys ’ by convicted pedophile Bond University Professor Paul Wilson After Paul Wilson was publicly exposed as a pedophile , Terry Goldsworthy , a Queensland Police officer , took over Paul Wilson ’s position as head of criminology at Bond University plus Robyn Lincoln ’s advisory board role at Bravehearts .
Terry Goldsworthy , whom I ’ve never met , misused his position as a Queensland police detective to communicate with the NSW Police regarding the complaint I made in 2008 about the 1985 Bathurst City Hall ritual crimes .
I came forward to Bathurst police detectives after Tor Nielsen reported to police that he saw 60 children ritually raped in the same hall by NSW Police and Catholic priests who worked at nearby St Stanislaus College .
Multiple St Stanislaus College pedophiles have since been charged and convicted for the ritual abuse crimes Tor Nielsen reported .
Terry Goldsworthy lied by omission when he failed include my age during this 1985 ritual and reported me as an adult perpetrator instead of a 15 - year - old victim of child abuse , to the Queensland Psychology Board .
He said NSW Police had confirmed this allegation and that I was the subject of a police investigation .
I wrote to police commissioners in both Queensland and NSW who sent me letters confirming Terry Goldsworthy had lied to the Queensland Psychology Board and to the Queensland AHPRA office .
I complained to the Queensland Police about Terry Goldsworthy using his role as a police officer to access , twist and misuse my private file , but they supported the perpetrator instead of me .
Terry Goldsworthy Bond University ’s criminal behaviour was the final straw which prompted me to go public about my child abuse .
The corrupt Queensland Psychology Board ’s support of UK sexual predator Katarina Fritzon ’s false and vexatious notification against me , prompted me to lodge my own complaint against Sydney registered psychologist Antony Kidman to the NSW Psychology Board and NSW AHPRA office .
Kidman was dead within weeks of my notification against him .
Nicole Kidman ’s personal security team informed Sydney Paparazzi that Antony Kidman was placed on immediate suicide watch following my notification against him .
You see , I was not the first to complain to the health board about Antony Kidman .
I have since been contacted by other Antony Kidman victims of rape , torture and unethical hypnosis .
Many of these victims were child sex trafficked through Hillsong church .
So , I found a strong link between Antony Kidman and Hillsong church .
Hillsong church was founded by pedophile Frank Houston for the sole purpose of procuring child trafficking victims and produce kiddie porn snuff films .
Hillsong ritually abused children .
The Luciferian pedophiles have infiltrated all areas of Australian government , education , health and human services .
They have control over the police , media , universities , defence forces , parliament , schools , health services , churches of all denominations , psychiatric hospitals , and fake child abuse advocacy organisations like Bravehearts .
You can not possibly understand their pervasiveness unless you were raised in their world .
I will now explain the link between Luciferianism and the CIA ’s Project MK - ULTRA , demonstrate the existence of Project MK - ULTRA in Australia , and identify key MK - ULTRA perpetrators and MK - ULTRA abuse locations in Australia .
MK - ULTRA sub - projects were conducted in most Australian hospitals , universities and research facilities throughout the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
MK - ULTRA ’s presence in Australia stemmed from a 1951 security military agreement between our country and the USA .
This agreement led to the establishment of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in 1952 , and the construction by the same US company , of two multi-story underground CIA research facilities , one at Lucas Heights ( in 1958 ) and Pine Gap ( in 1967 ) .
Pine Gap served as the endpoint for data collected all over Australia .
Sydney University was the centre of Australian MK - ULTRA research .
MK - ULTRA university - based research was kicked off in Australia by CIA psychiatrist and hypnosis expert Martin Orne .
In 1960 , Orne conducted MK - ULTRA Subproject 84 under the title ‘ Attitude Formation , Decision Matrices ’ at Sydney University during a two - month lectureship .
Subproject 84 was funded by the US Airforce Office of Scientific Research under Grant Number AF - AFOSR -88 -63 .
A further $ 30,000 was provided by the Human Ecology Fund , ‘ To study the nature of the hypnosis process as it may relate to induction of a changed motivational state . ’
Martin Orne ’s visit to Sydney University was sponsored by USEFA ( United States Educational Foundation in Australia ) and the Australian branch of the Fulbright Scholarship and Lectureship Program .
The Fulbright program was a CIA scheme for recruiting and training MK - ULTRA scientists and spreading MK - ULTRA know how .
Months prior to his Sydney University visit , Martin Orne presented a paper , ‘ Antisocial Behavior and Hypnosis ’ at Colgate University , at the invitation of Psychology professor George Estabrooks .
A hypnosis expert and self - confessed CIA operative , George Estabrooks once boasted :
The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man ’s personality , or creating multi-personality , with the aid of hypnotism …
This is not science fiction …
I have done it .
Sub -project 84 aimed at determining whether hypnotised people would commit dangerous and harmful acts they would n’t otherwise .
The resultant article , ‘ Social Control in the Psychological Experiment : Antisocial Behaviour & Hypnosis , ’ was co-authored by Martin Orne and Frederick Evans , a Sydney University psychology student .
Their article , published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology ( 1965 [ 1 ] , pp 189-200 ) featured the following abstract : Rowland and Young found that hypnotized subjects were willing to carry out such apparently antisocial actions as grasping a dangerous reptile , plunging their hand into concentrated acid , and throwing the acid at an assistant .
This publication also notes : “ We wish to thank A. G. Hammer , then acting Head of the Department of Psychology , for his cooperation with the use of departmental facilities . ”
Beginning with Subproject 84 , the University of Sydney became a major centre for MK - ULTRA hypnosis research during the early 1960s .
Psychology professor John Sutcliffe led a research group that included fellow psychology professor Alfred Gordon Hammer and psychology students Frederick Evans , Peter Sheehan , Campbell Perry , and Wendy Walker .
These researchers all went on to make significant contributions to MK - ULTRA hypnosis research .
Most of them also went on to serve on the False Memory Foundation Board , a CIA entity founded by MK - ULTRA perpetrators and pedophiles to discredit the victim accounts of CIA child trafficking , ritual abuse , and MK - ULTRA mind control .
In November 1962 , John Sutcliffe published an article titled , ‘ Personal identity , multiple personality , and hypnosis ’ in the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis [ Vol. 10 ( 4 ) , pp 231-69 ] .
Sutcliffe ’s study considered whether multiple personality disorder stems from hypnotic suggestion , and if “ degrees of proneness to multiple personality are predictive of degrees of hypnotisability . ”
MK - ULTRA mind control involved using unethical hypnosis to dissociate the mind and result in multiple personality disorder or DID .
In 1963 , Frederick Evans was granted a CIA Fulbright Scholarship to continue hypnosis research with Martin Orne at Harvard .
In 1966 , Evans and Orne assumed positions at the University of Pennsylvania when it was a hive of MK - ULTRA hypnosis experimentation .
Students Peter Sheehan and Campbell Perry joined them .
Alfred Hammer likewise spent two sabbaticals in Martin Orne ’s USA laboratories during the 1960s and 70s .
In 1961 , Wendy Thorn received a post - graduate research scholarship at the Australian national University ( ANU ) for studies on the placebo effect , after completing her thesis in 1960 at Sydney University , on posthypnotic amnesia .
In the same year , she presented a paper to the APS on , ‘ Hypnosis and Suggestibility . ’
Thorn notes in her 1962 ANU thesis that , “ This study would have also lacked a great deal without the information , advice and materials supplied by Professor H. J Eysenck . ”
Hans Eysenck was then director of MK - ULTRA Subproject 111 .
In 1963 - 4 , Wendy Thorn was involved in hypnosis research with MK - ULTRA Subproject 84 Dr Frederick Evans .
She was currently receiving CIA funding via the Studies in Hypnosis Project that was directed by Martin Orne .
Frederick Evans received a Fulbright Scholarship to work with Martin Orne at Harvard in 1963 .
Wendy Thorn later continued to work with Frederick Evans and Hans Eysenck .
During the 1950s and 60s , most leading Australian universities had professors and students in the CIA ’s MK - ULTRA program , including Australian National University , La Trobe , and the University of Western Australia .
Most chairs of the Australian Psychological Society ( APS ) , the body that certifies our psychologists , were involved in unethical MK - ULTRA research .
These included Alfred Hammer who chaired the APS in the 60s when MK - ULTRA began , and Bond University ’s first professor of psychology Bob Montgomery who conducted unethical experiments at LaTrobe University in Melbourne in the 1970s , which left participants permanently traumatised .
LaTrobe University lecturer Gary Dorsett wrote an article entitled , ‘ Boiled Lollies and Band- aids : Gay men and Kids , ’ in Gay Information Quarterly Journal ( Spring , 1982 ) in which he advocated for the legalisation of pedophilia .
Bob Montgomery also lectured at ANU .
Leonard G. H. Huxley served as Vice - Chancellor of ANU from 1960 to 1967 .
Leonard George Holden Huxley was on the board of USEFA at the time it oversaw the Fulbright Lectureship being granted to Martin Orne .
Huxley was appointed to the board for the 1960 period and was also on the board of the CSIRO ( Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation , which also conducted MK - ULTRA research ) , with Richard Casey as the Executive .
Richard Casey helped establish ASIO and ASIS and helped secure funding for USEFA in 1959 .
I have provided a short introduction to the documented , irrefutable presence of Project MK - ULTRA in Australia .
My researcher Steve McMurray has uncovered much more that I do n’t have time to share here .
I was subjected to MK - ULTRA procedures on the campus of Sydney University .
These acts of crime were perpetrated by Sydney University staff from the faculties of Chemistry , Medicine , Dentistry and Psychology , and alumni who maintained lifetime association with their University .
Other , international perpetrators visited and used Sydney University facilities to abuse me .
Most of my key perpetrators attended Sydney University together , at a time when Sydney University was both the centre of MK - ULTRA research plus the national headquarters of the OTO ( Ordo Templis Orientis ) .
Dr Leonas Petrauskas graduated with a diploma in Tropical Medicine in 1957 , while Dr Antony Kidman was enrolled .
Kidman and Telford Conlon graduated second year Chemistry together in December 1959 , the same year Conlon ’s future wife Patricia Anne Carden passed third year English .
Holsworthy military consultant anaesthetist Colonel John Overton ( who was Antony Kidman ’s next - door neighbour ) , and celebrated heart transplant surgeon Dr Victor Chang graduated in the same medicine class together in 1962 .
Actor John Bell ( who gang raped me with Kidman ) also graduated from Sydney University in 1962 .
Rosalind Croucher studied at Sydney University also .
My recruitment as a MK - ULTRA lab rat began with my abuser Leonas Petrausaks who was an expert in sea creature poisons and published papers on this in PNG .
Petrauskas attended the Australian School of Pacific Administration ( ASOPA ) which emerged from Sydney University ’s Department of Anthropology .
ASOPA was a cover for MK - ULTRA activity , weaponised anthropology , and MK - NAOMI bio-weapons research conducted in Papua New Guinea .
MK - NAOMI received CIA funding through MK - ULTRA Subprojects 13 , 30 and 50 .
Documents show , in PNG , Petrauskas worked alongside notable MK - ULTRA recruits including Margaret Mead , and Hitler ’s chief bio-weapons scientist , Erich Traub .
ASOPA was founded by Labor party connected Alfred Conlon , who worked for British Intelligence .
Alfred Conlon recruited anthropologist Camilla Wedgewood to ASOPA .
Camilla Wedgewood had ties with British Intelligence and she worked at Sydney University .
Alfred Conlon also appointed CIA agent John Kerr ( also my rapist ) as principal of ASOPA .
Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam ( another of my rapists ) appointed his friend John Kerr as Governor General of Australia .
After Whitlam threatened to expose Australia ’s CIA agents , and shut down the CIA underground facility at Pine Gap , the CIA orchestrated a coup against Whitlam .
The CIA employed ‘ their man ’ John Kerr to enact archaic legislation to dismiss Whitlam on behalf of the British Monarchy .
Bob Hawke ( also my rapist ) who also worked for the CIA , played a role in ousting Whitlam .
Whitlam was forced into compliance since the CIA had him compromised as a pedophile .
Alfred Conlon ’s son Telford not only studied with Antony Kidman at Sydney University , but they later published research papers together .
Telford Conlon married Patricia Anne Carden .
Patricia Anne Conlon ’s National Archive file is currently sealed for reasons of national security .
This indicates
Ann ’s association with intelligence agencies , and her role in the CIA ’s Project MK - ULTRA .
As Luciferian Grande Dame , Patricia Anne Conlon ’s role was to supervise the selection and training of children .
This training included esoteric knowledge and skills and employed trauma - based mind control techniques .
Patricia Ann Conlon easily transitioned to work for the CIA where she assisted in the selection and training of MK - ULTRA child victims .
Grande Dame , Patricia Ann Conlon Patricia Anne Conlon was publicly recognised as a pioneering feminist and communist who worked for Labour Party pedophile Neville Wran .
Patricia
Anne trained in MK - ULTRA techniques while undertaking a postgraduate scholarship in 1964 - 65 at the University of Saskatchewan , Canada .
MK - ULTRA was rampant at the University of Seskatchewan when Patricia Anne was on a social sciences scholarship there .
Professors Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer were the two biggest MK - ULTRA perpetrator names after Aldous Huxley .
The Rockerfeller association funded Osmond and Hoffer ’s research into adrenochrome .
Adrenochrone is a chemical created from oxidised adrenaline .
It occurs in the blood of traumatised ritual murder victims .
When drunk , it gives the blood drinker a drug induced high and sexually arouses them .
This is what occurred during the Luciferian black mass conducted at Bathurst City Hall .
Antony Kidman and Leonas Petrauskas were close associates of Dr Harry Bailey who was trained in deep sleep methods by MK - ULTRA perpetrator Ewan Cameron .
The CIA funded Bailey ’s MK - ULTRA deep sleep project at the notorious Chelmsford Private Hospital in Sydney .
I was subjected to MK - ULTRA procedures by Harry Bailey , in the presence of Kidman and Petrauskas , at Chelmsford .
Antony Kidman was a psychology student at Sydney University during Martin Orne ’s experiment and lectureship .
He later studied at the University of Pennsylvania with famous clinical psychologist Aaron Tim Beck ( another False Memory Syndrome Foundation board member ) .
At the University of Pennsylvania , Kidman became a long - time colleague of Martin Seligman , whose Learned Helplessness research formed the core of the CIA ’s torture program .
Antony Kidman returned to Australia in 1972 after years of work at St. Elizabeth ’s Hospital , Washington DC , in the Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology , which was involved with LSD research and served as a hub of the Scottish Rite Schizophrenia Research Program .
Both Jacqueline Goodnow and John W. Gittinger had performed research at this hospital and it was one of the major centres for MK - ULTRA research .
John Gittinger was the CIA ’s head psychologist .
He developed the test battery ( PAS ) used to assess potential CIA case managers and agents .
Gittinger trained Antony Kidman in MK - ULTRA mind control methods and directly supervised the MK - ULTRA techniques perpetrated against me .
These techniques included torture , physical assault , sexual assault , drugging , electrocution , and unethical hypnosis .
The mind control aspects of my abuse mainly occurred at laboratories in Sydney University , Holsworthy Army Base , Lucas Heights nuclear reactor , and Pine Gap .
Holsworthy is Australia ’s oldest military base .
It is located south of Sydney near my grandparents ’ Engadine home .
Holsworthy Army Base sits adjacent to Lucas Heights nuclear reactor , now called ANSTOW ( Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ) .
Lucas Heights nuclear reactor is a 20 - story underground research facility that was connected via underground tunnel to another ( 7 - story ) underground research facility at Holsworthy Army Base .
Data and material collected from these labs were delivered to Australia ’s main CIA / US Military underground facility at Pine Gap .
Holsworthy and Lucas heights both featured underground rooms dedicated to Luciferian ritual and the worship of their ancient deity Dagon .
All top Australian military brass were Luciferians .
Most Sydney University staff were Luciferians .
MK - ULTRA experiments and end - goal procedures were conducted using children as lab rats .
These child victims were sourced from Luciferian covens , various cults , BoysTown homes , Daruk Boys Home , government and church run juvenile detention centres , child protective services , foster care , police lock - up , Catholic churches , child prostitution brothels , blackmailed pedophile parents , and Hillsong church ( founded by pedophile Frank Houston ) .
Some children were kidnapped off the streets .
Other children were specifically bred to serve as human lab rats , their births not registered .
Children were imprisoned in cages beneath Holsworthy and never saw daylight .
Children were tortured , raped and murdered in the name of national security , with the full knowledge and blessing of the Australian and United States governments .
As George White wrote Sydney Gottlieb in 1971 : … it was fun , fun , fun .
Where else could a red - blooded American boy lie , kill , cheat , steal , rape , and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All - Highest ?
There were two main categories of CIA child trafficking victims :
Those considered dispensable and destined for murder , and Those deemed useful on a long - term basis ( a fate worse than death ) .
I was in the latter group .
At age 5 years , I was presented before a panel in the loungeroom of Leonas Petrauskas ’ Engadine home .
This panel included John Gittinger , Antony Kidman , and Grande Dame Patricia Anne Conlon .
There Gittinger asked me if I like to be special , and he promised to make me special .
Immediately afterwards , Gittinger subjected me to a battery of tests at Holsworthy , including a full physical exam , endurance testing , IQ testing , and multiple brain scans .
Gittinger then accepted me into the MK - ULTRA program based on my high IQ , creativity , physical strength and endurance , blue - eyed blonde features , bloodline , and intuition .
John Gittinger particularly sought my visual - spatial cognitive ability , or right hemispheric strength .
The Nazis recognised Luciferian based esoteric knowledge and techniques as a power source that they sought to weaponise .
That is why they travelled the globe collecting esoteric knowledge and dissociation techniques from the pedophile Dali Lama and other Nazi collaborators .
The end goal of MK - ULTRA was to create super soldiers .
They used child soldiers for this purpose .
I was one of those children recruited into Delta Special Operations .
Delta is comprised of MK - ULTRA victims .
I recently spoke with a former member of Delta and asked him about what I recalled .
He told me he only heard rumours of a super soldier program with children being employed as soldiers , to keep up with the Russians .
Saw nothing himself .
But as I pressed for info , this person dissociated , became indecipherable , and began stuttering references to MK - ULTRA programming cues .
So , I ’d say all Delta Special Ops soldiers have dissociated from their knowledge of the CIA super soldier program .
I knew this as the Jason Project .
casino online south africa I was put through full military training at age 6 years and assigned to a small unit of all male soldiers .
My basic soldier training was supervised by Colonel Victor Change at Holsworthy Army Base .
Chang was a CIA asset with training in brainwashing and torture techniques .
The Australian public knew Chang as a famous heart transplant surgeon who was gunned down in a gutter in a manner befitting his true criminal nature .
Chang ’s assassination was rumoured by mainstream media to be in connection with black market organ trafficking .
My training was completed in the USA at age 14 years by Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino in a special laboratory established at Dulce underground base .
Delta training included the weaponization of psychic ability , or psychic warfare training .
During the 1950s , the CIA funded John Lilly ’s development of the sensory deprivation tank , and his research into brain waves and altered states of consciousness .
In his book , Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer , Lilly explained how children can be programmed MK - ULTRA fashion using LSD and his sensory deprivation tank .
Indeed , the most fundamental MK - ULTRA programming levels ( i.e. , Alpha , Beta , Delta , Omega and Theta ) are laid via LSD trips in a sensory deprivation tank .
The brain naturally splits into five dissociative states , which is why there are five basic compartments .
My five basic splits were organised according to an Eastern Star pentagram shape , with a gatekeeper placed in the pentagon which sat in the middle of five doors .
During the 1950s , the CIA simultaneously funded Robert Monroe ’s development of what is called the Gateway Experience , or Hemispheric Synchronization .
This is commonly known as astral projection .
Newspapers and army documents record that the US Army sent soldiers to Monroe for training in the Gateway Process .
In the UK , standard military police training 25 years ago consisted of remote viewing which enabled MPs to patrol UK bases located in foreign territories .
casino online I bring your attention to a US military document approved for release by the CIA in 2010 .
The document dated 9 June 1983 is addressed to the Commander of US Army Operational Group at Fort Meade , by Lieutenant Colonel Wayne M. McDonnell .
The subject heading reads , ‘ Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process . ’
This document describes the physics behind interdimensional astral projection as engaged in by the military .
Gateway Process , US Army document I bring your attention to a January 14 , 1953 memo entitled ‘ Interrogation techniques ’ which states :
If the services of Major Louis J. West , USAF ( MC ) , a trained hypnotist , can be obtained and another man well - grounded in conventional psychological interrogation and polygraph techniques , and the services of Lieutenant Colonel [ DELETED ] , a well - balanced interrogation research centre could be established in an especially selected location .
Major Louis J. West coordinated MK - ULTRA experiments at UCLA .
Documented in mainstream newspapers and magazines , including Psychology Today ( 1974 ) , these experiments involved behavioural conditioning of autistic children using cattle prods , physical violence , and electrocution via an electrified metal floor .
West hired Ivar Lovaas to conduct the experiments , who in turn regularly consulted the father of operant conditioning , B. F. Skinner .
I know the names of the two men whose names are omitted in this document .
They were John Gittinger and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino .
I know the location of the research centre .
It was built at the underground military base located near Dulce , New Mexico .
A circa 1956 untitled document describes the “ research centre ” or “ laboratory ” which the CIA constructed at Dulce : casino online italia
This laboratory will include a special chamber , in which all psychologically significant aspects of the environment can be controlled .
This chamber will contain , among other things , a broad - spectrum polygraph for simultaneous recordings of a variety of psycho-physiological reactions of the individual being studied .
In this setting the various hypnotic , pharmacologic , and sensory - environmental variables will be manipulated in a controlled fashion , and quantitative continuous recordings of the reactions of the experimental subjects will be made .
The “ chamber ” at Dulce was an upright version of John C. Lilly ’s sensory deprivation tank .
Lilly ’s sensory deprivation chamber was combined with the Gateway Process to develop MK - ULTRA victims ’ psychic abilities , and to engage in the extreme interdimensional astral travel which included contacting and communicating with interdimensional entities , as described in the Fort Meade document released by the CIA in 2010 .
‘ The Mind Manipulators ’ contains FOI released MK - ULTRA documents referred to here .
According to US military documents , candidates for the Gateway Process required high intelligence , imagination and creativity – the very characteristics CIA psychologist John Gittinger assessed me for .
Gittinger was particularly interested in right hemispheric functioning .
High IQ children have a visual - spatial learning preference .
When they perform cognitive tasks , both brain hemispheres are activated , as compared to individuals of average intelligence whose left hemisphere only lights up .
High visual - spatial processing ability was essential for visualisation during MK - ULTRA training , and for the Gateway Process .
That is why Gittinger tested me at age 5 years using the Stanford Binet LM and the Block Design subtest of the Weschler series , the best measures of visual - spatial IQ .
scommesse sportive Following training , my unit and I were deployed to South America where the CIA were conducting operations against so - called communist governments .
When I was a child , the CIA said our enemy was communism .
Today , the CIA says our enemy is terrorism .
The CIA continue to make money out of child trafficking by laundering it through banks and funnelling it into CIA terror organisations that have decimated Syria and other nations .
In 2016 , Syria ’s representative to the United Nations publicly stated twice that ISIS forces were armed with genetically modified super soldiers produced and supplied by the USA .
In 2015 , 7 - foot tall genetically modified engineered soldiers were filmed beheading 21 Christians in Egypt during the CIA - orchestrated Arab fundamentalist uprising .
These super soldiers are described as Caucasian not Arabic in appearance .
They resemble the super soldiers developed at Pine Gap and Dulce 45 years ago .
Putin recently said Russia are developing super soldiers that are “ worse than nuclear bombs . ”
I know exactly what he meant .
Australia ’s Commonwealth Bank was recently fined 700 million dollars for 54,000 breaches of anti-money - laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws .
Nicole Rose , head of AUSTRAC , the organisation investigating money laundering by banks , said it involves organised crime , child exploitation and drug importation .
The Commonwealth Bank laundered money obtained from child sex trafficking and funnelled that money into international terrorist activities .
I reiterate : Child trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation .
This operation is coordinated by the CIA .
カジノ オンライ ン I bring your attention to a 1978 book entitled ‘ Dope Inc . ’
The latest edition was published in 2010 , but I highly recommend the 1978 copy which is available free online .
This book revolutionised the way drug law enforcement officers consider drug crime .
It led to the HSBC bank losing its licence to operate in the USA .
Dope Inc authors found that drug trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation , from your cartels down to the person who sells drugs to junkies on the street corner .
This operation started with the Opium Wars where the British Monarchy forced China to accept heroin produced in India .
Two well recognised organisations stemmed from this operation : P&O ; cruise ship line was established to transport the heroin ; and the Hong - Kong - Shanghai Banking Corporation ( HSBC bank ) was established to launder the drug money .
The court Jews that served the British Monarchy , including the Rothschilds , managed the money made from this heroin trafficking operation .
Dope
Inc then explains how the drug trafficking and related money laundering operation established in the Opium Wars , is the exact same operation in existence today .
In fact , HSBC was in recent years fined by USA authorities for still engaging in drug money laundering .
If you follow the money trail , it still leads back to the British Monarchy .
This is the same British Monarchy that I witnessed engage in Luciferian ritual crimes in 1980 at St James Anglican church in Sydney City .
The book Dope Inc devotes a chapter to explaining the British aristocracy ’s involvement in an ancient Egyptian cult , how Britain started the drug / rock n’ roll counter culture in the USA with the help of the CIA , and the links between Egyptian cult practises , the counter culture , and the CIA which was established by British Intelligence .
Dope Inc explains how and why the CIA run modern drug trafficking and money laundering as a single integrated world operation .
The 1978 classic ‘ Dope Inc . ’
When you read Dope Inc , if you cross out the word ‘ drugs ’ and insert the word ‘ kids ’ – then you have a picture of the CIA child trafficking organisation that violated my human rights .
casino online brasil I fought to make police witness statements about the crimes I witnessed and was a victim of .
I completed four days of witness statements , and police commenced an investigation which included door knocking around Engadine and raiding the home of my deceased grandparents .
Police had promised to take another 5 days of statements .
But suddenly everything was shut down .
I later received a cold call from a lawyer who said that the Sutherland police detective in charge of my case was herself a child trafficker and member of the pedophile network she was supposed to be investigating .
The attacks on my family by NSW police , ASIO and other institutions have been relentless .
I have documented these , and even obtained photos of the military looking thug who chased me about Sydney when I tried to make police witness statements .
It ’s not paranoia – when you have photos .
The way I have been treated for daring to speak up about my child abuse , and for taking a pro-victim stance against Luciferian pedophiles , has been far worse than my original abuse .
The authorities who are supposed to support victims have done nothing but sabotage my case .
They have engaged in what I have learnt from interacting with other victims , as tactics typically used to discredit and silence victims .
The current Australian Child Abuse Royal Commission is yet another damage control and information gathering exercise .
VIP child trafficking victims who testified to the Royal Commission have ended up being targeted for silence .
casino på nätet Since I appeared before the Royal Commission several years ago , I have been contacted by hundreds and hundreds of child abuse victims .
A considerable number of these are victims of what I endured – CIA child trafficking , ritual abuse , and CIA mind control .
From what these victims have shared with me , I now have a very clear picture of child sex trafficking in Australia .
I will give you an example of what I have learnt from victims :
The NSW Police were the subject of a 1990s Royal Commission conducted by Judge James Wood .
This investigation stemmed from allegations of child sex trafficking in Sydney involving the same Luciferians and pedophiles who trafficked and abused me .
The Wood Royal Commission was a white wash .
Commissioner James
Wood covered up reports of child sex trafficking involving Hillsong church , Antony Kidman , Daruk Boys home , Costellos boy brothel in Kings Cross , judges , lawyers , Catholic churches , day care centres , and NSW police officers .
Multiple victims named Kings Cross underbelly boss police officer Roger Rogerson .
Rogerson was responsible for the murder of Sally Ann Huckstep , who died after she wrote a story on child prostitution at Kings Cross for a porn magazine , in the days when porn magazines published pedophilia material .
The clean cop who refused to report Sally Anne ’s murder as suicide , had his career destroyed and life threatened by NSW Police after he testified to the Royal Commission against his corrupt colleagues .
That police officer is still in hiding in a state of trauma .
Roger Rogerson never brought to justice .
In 2016 , Roger Rogerson was imprisoned for a 2014 murder .
casino portugal Another notable perpetrator named to the Wood Royal Commission was Bob Carr .
Bob Carr served as an ABC journalist , Premiere of NSW , and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Australian Federal government .
In 2012 , Bob Carr and Kim Beazley Jnr ( son of ASIO agent Kim Beazley Snr who trafficked me to Bohemian Grove ) , attended Bohemian Grove pedophile summer camp at Australian tax payers ’ expense .
Commissioner James
Wood covered up all reports of VIP child sex trafficking , ritual abuse , and mind control .
This is not surprising , considering James Wood was named by victim Dean Henry and others to the current federal Child Abuse Royal Commission as a member of the very pedophile ring he was employed to investigate .
I will now mention the two most abhorrent and famous criminal cases in Australian history .
One is the backpacker murders committed by serial killer Ivan Milat .
The other is the murder of a beautiful young nurse named Anita Cobby , committed by a gang of young men including Les Murphy .
Ivan Milat murdered victims in a Luciferian ritual manner , so did Les Murphy .
The details of both murders have not been released to the public .
I discovered what was done to Anita Cobby through two people who read her case file ; a lawyer who worked on her case , and a prison guard who read Les Murphy ’s file .
What the public were never told is : Les Murphy and his killer gang made deep lacerations in Anita Cobby ’s body and had sex with those wounds .
That sort of crime can only be learnt , and it is the sort of crime taught to child victims of ritual abuse .
site de apostas Both Ivan Milat and Les Murphy were abused and taught to commit Luciferian style rape , torture and murder during their incarceration at boys ’ homes .
Les Murphy attended Daruk Boys
Home where boys were prostituted by staff to VIP pedophiles and used for MK - ULTRA experiments including Subproject 74 : the psychological effects of circumcision .
I saw the botched circumcision of one Daruk victim who had his penis cut off make international mainstream news headlines .
Daruk ’s use as a source of MK - ULTRA child lab rats explains why many victims ’ files were destroyed .
Ivan Milat attended Engadine BoysTown at age 13 , the same place where my father , brothers and I were abused , and where victims were recruited for MK - ULTRA experiments .
Ivan Milat was in the Luciferian cult that abused me , and the Milats associated with the Holowczaks .
Ivan Milat sought victims to be used in Luciferian rituals and helped dispose of bodies afterwards .
He closely associated with the Slavic dog breeder .
Ivan Milat procured boy victims for abuse by VIP pedophiles at Costellos boy brothel .
Les Murphy worked behind the bar at Costellos boy brothel when he was 16 years old .
My final point is this : site de apostas ALL major crime within Australia stems from the single integrated world trafficking operation that I have described .
If you disband this operation , you will virtually eliminate the trafficking of children , drugs , and guns in our society – and perhaps worldwide .
Demonising Islam , ‘ Copyleft ’ by Carlos Latuff
I have spoken to a number of Palestinians over the past few days about the humiliation and torture suffered by my dear friend and Brother Mohammed Omer .
He had his clothing forcibly removed by Israeli soldiers upon returning to Israel on his way home to Gaza .
They proceeded to torture him which resulted in unconsciousness and hospitalisation .
He was treated like a captured criminal rather than the esteemed journalist that he is .
His crime ?
He is a Palestinian .
Many reactions that I got were “ the same was done to me when I returned from abroad . ” ( not including the torture ) Exposure of a naked body is strictly forbidden in Islam , so when the situation is forced it goes unspoken , much like the case of many rape victims .
Has the demonisation of Islam become accepted by the world , including the silent Muslims themselves ?
To someone like myself , having lived in the West , any violation of one ’s personal dignity is a crime that must not be hidden from the public eye .
The rapist will seek out another victim if he knows silence follows his actions .
The same with the Israeli soldier , their dehumanisation tactics used against innocent Palestinian civilians continues because of that same silence .
Why is it that the victim is the one that feels the shame ?
There appears to be an obsessive feeling that when certain things happen to a person it is their own fault .
Abed was strip searched at Ben Gurion Airport because he is a Palestinian .
Mahmoud was delayed at security at Ben Gurion resulting in him missing his flight , because he is a Palestinian .
And I might add was not compensated for lost monies that resulted in changing tickets .
Mona was denied entry to Israel where she planned to study for the summer , because she is of Palestinian decent ….
traveling with a United States Passport .
Deported upon arrival , also without financial compensation …. and with not a word of protest from the U.S. State Department .
A family was not allowed to leave Israel last summer because of a bureaucratic hassle at the airport , forcing half of the family to remain in the occupied West Bank for the summer while the other half was allowed to return home to the US .
All of the above are actual cases of the humiliation I spoke of .
The only one that was publicised was the last one .
Is there a shame associated with being Palestinian ?
Why were the other cases not publicised ?
Has it become an accepted fact that if a Palestinian or other Muslim suffers an indignity it is alright ?
Have the events of 9/11 destroyed the minds of every person on this planet ?
Events , which I must add , were not orchestrated by Palestinians or Muslims .
Taking all of what I wrote above into account , is this the reason the incidents involving Mohammed Omer are not publicised in any major newspaper , including ones that he has written for in the past ?
The crimes were committed in Israel .
There has not been one word printed in the Israeli press , including HaAretz , which claims to be at the left of the other newspapers .
( Letter to the BBC
Is it just to be accepted that Mohammed was tortured and beaten simply because he is a Palestinian , which makes it all OK ?
What has become of the human race ?
Where is the outrage ?
Have we all truly become a race of Sheeple ?
A remote drilling rig high in the Mackenzie Delta has become the site of a breakthrough that could one day revolutionize the world 's energy supply .
For the first time , Canadian and Japanese researchers have managed to efficiently produce a constant stream of natural gas from ice - like gas hydrates that , worldwide , dwarf all known fossil fuel deposits combined .
" We were able to sustain flow , " said Scott Dallimore , the Geological Survey of Canada researcher in charge of the remote Mallik drilling program .
" It worked . "
For a decade now , Dallimore and scientists from a half - dozen other countries have been returning to a site on Richards Island on the very northwestern tip of the Northwest Territories to study methane gas hydrates .
A hydrate is created when a molecule of gas – in this case , methane or natural gas – is trapped by high pressures and low temperatures inside a cage of water molecules .
The result is almost – but not quite – ice .
It 's more like a dry , white slush suffusing the sand and gravel 1,000 metres beneath the Mallik rig .
Heat or unsqueeze the hydrate and gas is released .
Hold a core sample to your ear and it hisses .
More significant is the fact that gas hydrates concentrate 164 times the energy of the same amount of natural gas .
And gas hydrate fields are found in abundance under the coastal waters of every continent .
Calculations suggest there 's more energy in gas hydrates than in coal , oil and conventional gas combined .
Getting that energy to flow consistently and predictably , however , has been the problem .
Using heat to release the gas works , but requires too much energy to be useful .
Researchers have also been trying to release the methane by reducing the pressure on it .
Last month , the Mallik team became the first to use that method to get a steady , consistent flow .
" That went really well , " said Dallimore .
" We definitely demonstrated that these hydrates are responsive enough that you can sustain flow .
" We were able to take conventional technologies , modify them , and produce .
That 's a big step forward . "
Although countries including India , China , Japan and the United States have undertaken major programs to identify gas hydrate fields , it 's the first step in years toward making them productive .
The Mallik well produced fire from ice for six days at a rate lower than conventional gas but about equivalent to a coalbed methane well , Dallimore said .
This year 's results prove the basic idea works , he said .
The next step is a full - scale pilot project with every consideration that goes into a commercial production rig , including safety and environmental concerns , and questions regarding how much water and sediment are produced per unit of gas .
Dallimore suggests that as conventional natural gas prices increase and supplies diminish , gas hydrates could offer an alternative .
They also emit less greenhouse gas than oil or coal .
So far , no Canadian agency is planning a full gas hydrate pilot project .
But Japan is planning one using data from the Mallik project .
The United States Geological Survey is trying to start one with other agencies and energy companies .
" Everybody agrees this is what we need to do .
It 's just ( a question of ) where , " said Brenda Pierce of the U.S. survey .
" We 're trying to look at doing this on the north slope of Alaska . "
Commercial production of natural gas from hydrates is still a few years off , said Dallimore – but perhaps not too far off .

British holidaymaker wins compensation because his hotel was full of Germans
Compensation : David Barnish took
Thomson to the small claims court because his hotel was full of Germans
When businessman David Barnish treated his family to a holiday at a luxury resort , he was soon dismayed to find their hotel dominated by Germans .
But it was n't an abundance of beach towels on the sunbeds by breakfast time which was to spoil the family 's fun - rather that the sports activities and entertainment were only offered in German .
Yesterday Mr Barnish told of his delight after a judge awarded him £ 750 compensation from tour operator Thomson after agreeing that the firm 's brochure had mislead him by failing to make clear that the hotel on the Greek island of Kos catered for a mainly German clientele .
The self - employed finance broker had paid almost £ 4,000 to take wife Karen , 36 , and daughters Molly , aged 12 , Gemma , 19 , and 21 - year - old Kim , on a week - long holiday to the Grecotel Park Royal in Marmari last August .
But he took Thomson to Stoke - on - Trent county court claiming the all - inclusive holiday was spoilt because the family could not understand German and were unable to join in events .
Mr Barnish , 47 , told the Daily Mail : ' My youngest daughter wanted to take part in activities with the kids club , but its timetable was only published in German .
' There was a treasure hunt which she liked the look off , but again , the clues were only given in German and she could n't understand it .
' We tried to join a windsurfing lesson and yoga classes but all the instructions were in German so we gave up .
" Even the advertised satellite TV was all in German except for one channel - the BBC World News .
' I feel we were cheated by Thomson because at no stage did they warn us that this hotel was geared up to catering for Germans , not English people .
' I am not a racist , but when I pay so much money for a holiday , I expect to be able to make use of the facilities and activities we are paying for . '
Mr Barnish said that when he complained to the holiday firm half - way through the break , he was advised to take his family to the cinema in Kos because it screened English films .
Mr Barnish , from Madeley , Stoke - on - Trent , said that the only entertainment that was not tailored to the Germans was the evening cabaret , which he said consisted mainly of Greek dancing .
Grecotel Park Royal :
The 700 - bedroom hotel - which had just 25 Brits - catered for a mainly German clientele
After a small claims hearing , Deputy District Judge Naish awarded the family £ 750 - or 20 per cent of the week - long holiday 's cost - in damages from Thomson to compensate for problems created by the language barrier .
Judge Naish said : ' The customer travelling abroad in these circumstances , going to a hotel which features in an English brochure , does n't expect to have to press the hotel and providers of activities to be accessible by them in their own language - so I do take the view that the brochure is significantly misleading in failing to make that clear . '
Mr Barnish , who represented himself at the hearing , claimed he would n't have chosen the hotel - part of the firm 's upmarket Beach Club range - if he had known it catered for a mainly German clientele .
Out of 700 holidaymakers only 25 were English .
He added : ' I have no problem with the hotel itself - the food , service , location and facilities were all excellent .
It is the fact that we could not make the most of it because everything was in German that I am angry about . '
Nathan Smith , the barrister acting for Thomson , told the court the brochure did not ' specifically promise ' all the TV channels or the activities would be in English and said the Barnish 's did not tell hotel staff that they were English and needed help with the language .
A Thomson spokesman said : ' We are sorry that Mr Barnish did not feel the entertainment on his holiday was what he expected . '
On its website , Thomson describes the Royal Park as a ' superb hotel with a first - class service , all the comforts of home and an international atmosphere . '
Why is it called " agile " project management ?
Could it be called " agile project " management .
This is the endless discussion , that has no resolution .
Or at least no resolution that has any value .
So what 's next ?
How about a simple approach to putting agility back into conventional project management ?
There are two fundamental elements of projects and the management of projects :
Activities - the effort of people , machines , systems , business and any other " resource " working on the project .
Activities like : tasks , process steps , processes themselves , actions on the action items list .
Outcomes - the results of these activities .
The " thing " delivered as a result of the activities .
Things like : deliverables , features , products , services , work packages , control accounts , WBS elements .
When activities and outcomes get mixed up , the project usually suffers .
While the conventional project management methods do n't explicitly state " let 's mix these two things up and screw up the project , " there is no specific , explicit guidance on how to separate them in places like PMBOK .
Now this is not PMBOK 's fault .
Far from it .
PMBOK is " A " guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge .
It is not " THE " guide , nor " THE " Body of Knowledge , nor even a very good approach to the processes of managing a project .
This is as it shoudl be .
Since project management is a set of process that must rapidly adapt to an emerging set of circumstances , putting such advice down in a book that takes several years to get to the next edition is pretty much a waste of time .
But back to the problem .
I am convinced that those looking in from the outside , those not well practiced in the art and science of project management , and generally those that confuse managing projects with building software do n't understand the separation between ACTIVITIES and OUTCOMES .
This is where " agile " comes in .
Agile Software Development Methods - stuff like Scrum , XP , Crystal , DSDM - all are focused on Outcomes .
Delivering value to the stakeholders on some periodic basis .
Forgetting for the moment that the units of measure of value are not defined by these folks , the other parts make sense in terms of " outcomes . "
In some agile software development process , the activities are well defined .
Well sorta well defined .
But in many many conventional projects - projects that keep us busy doing the " project recovery " work , these activities are not very well defined .
Poorly defined actually in many cases .
So what 's the real problem in project management .
Following processes that are hard to follow means you do n't follow them
Not focusing on outcomes means you do n't know what done looks like , how fast you 're getting there , and what time you 're going to arrive and how much it will cost when you arrive
Now some people have figured out how to combine Outcomes with Activities and now calling it Agile .
IMP / IMS is one of those .
But IMP / IMS is not directly applicable to all projects .
It could be , but first you have to get over the notion that the US DoD is the source of IMP / IMS .
Then the notion of " deliverables based planning , " " assessment of increasing maturity of the product or service , " and the measure of physical percent complete in some units meaningful to the stakeholders - dollars is a good measure .
So what comes first .
Well in the IMP / IMS world Outcomes come first .
Only then can you define the activities needed to provide those outcomes .
This is call Planning .
A Plan is the Strategy for the successful completion of the project .
Next comes the Schedule .
This is the list of activities , their durations and order ; necessary to produce the Outcomes .
It 's that simple .
Tell what you are going to do - Outcomes
Tell how you are going to do it - Activities
and add
Tell how you are going to measure that physical progress is being made .
When we speak of agile , agile starts with the Outcomes .
Just like the Covey book says - start with the end in mind .
Start with the outcomes .
They do n't emerge ( for the most part ) , they do n't appear by using " magic beans , " they do n't change too often .
What does change are the activities , the sequence of activities , the duration of those activities - along the way to DONE .
DONE is the ultimate OUTCOME .

Please Note : Active Development on STLFilt has ended .
The author sincerely hopes the C++ Standards Committee adopts " Concepts " sooner rather than later , rendering tools such as STLFilt unnecessary ...
STLFilt simplifies and / or reformats long - winded C++ error and warning messages , with a focus on STL - related diagnostics ( and for MSVC 6 , it fully eliminates C4786 warnings and their detritus ) .
The result renders many of even the most cryptic diagnostics comprehensible .
The active ingredient in each distribution is a Perl script , so you 'll need a Perl interpreter installed ; ActivePerl works best , and it 's free .
The downloads follow , organized by platform :
Microsoft Visual C++ 6/7/8/9 : stlfilt.zip ( 484 K , updated 10/22/2007 ) .
Includes the " Proxy " CL compiler , multi-platform - aware STLTask tray - resident control utility ( screen shot ) , and support for long type - name wrapping ( see the gcc section below ) .
Demo runs : VC6 VC7 + long type - names .
Supports both the IDE and command line environments , in conjunction with any or all of the following C++ libraries : Native MSVC 6 Native MSVC 7.x , 8.x , 9.x ( IDE - based Decryption within VS2005 / 2008 now WORKS .
See README -VC.txt ) STLport 4.x Dinkum 3.08 Dinkum Unabridged Library
) .
Includes the " Proxy " CL compiler , multi-platform - aware STLTask tray - resident control utility ( screen shot ) , and support for long type - name wrapping ( see the gcc section below ) .
Demo runs : VC6 VC7 + long type - names .
Supports both the IDE command line environments , in conjunction with any or all of the following C++ libraries : gcc 2.9x/3.x/4.x ( tested under MinGW up to 4.1.1 , and under TDM gcc 4.2.2 ) For Windows : gstlfilt.zip ( 409 K , updated 6/16/2008 ) .
For Unix , Linux , etc. : gstlfilt.tar ( 180 K , updated 2/3/2008 ) .
Demo Run .
Supports intelligent wrapping of very long type - names ( such as those that arise in template metaprogramming applications ) with a set of customizable rules suggested by David Abrahams ( Demo ) .
The Windows - based gcc Decryptor distribution now includes a Proxy c++ compiler ( provides Dev- C + + compatibility , and also makes up for the Win9X command prompt 's lack of stderr redirection ) and multi-platform - aware STLTask utility .

If a commodity is in " backwardization " , that is , if futures prices are lower than current prices , does that imply that futures markets are discouraging storage ( encouraging disgorgement ) ?
Paul Krugman makes the case , here and here .
I 'm going to challenge him with a low - down , dastardly kind of argument .
The gentleman keeps asking for evidence , evidence , and in response I 'm going to offer an unfalsifiable hypothesis .
Krugman says that futures prices are too low to cause people to withhold physical oil and sell forward , as required to affect spot prices .
But whatever forward price curve he shows me , I can posit an invisible " convenience yield " large enough to make hoarding oil worthwhile .
I do n't even have to be unreasonable about it .
Extrapolating from historical data , we see that gently " backwardized " futures prices might be quite sufficient to encourage storage when convenience yields are taken into account .
Despite all of this , I agree with Krugman that futures markets can't explain the recent skyrocketing oil prices .
Not unusually , he 's been a voice of sanity and reason .
But just as speculation in futures need not affect spot prices ( if it is balanced long and short ) , speculative withdrawal of physical supply need not affect the shape of the future price curve .
Futures market " signatures " can't be relied upon to distinguish speculative from fundamental demand , and inventory may be unmeasurable , especially if it is offshore or takes the form of withheld production .
Further , both futures in contango and measured inventory build can signify known fundamental demand as well as speculation .
( Suppose entrepreneurs are planning to fire up many new factories over the next few months .
If they buy forward to hedge their exposure to energy prices , that would push futures into contango and promote storage with no one speculating on anything . )
But this is n't about that .
This is a disquisition , and ode , a homage and a tribute to the marvelous , mysterious , misunderstood and maligned convenience yield :
The bedrock principle of futures markets is " no arbitrage " , that is prices should be set such that there is no investment strategy that yields a risk - free profit higher than the risk - free rate of interest .
For a physical commodity , this seems to imply that the forward price should equal the present price plus the risk - free rate of interest and any storage costs .
Interest rates are never negative , and storing stuff always costs something , so you 'd expect future prices of storable commodities to always be higher than current ( " spot " ) prices .
But check out the following graph of the four month " forward yield " of crude oil .
( Data courtesy of the EIA , hat tip Krugman , calculations and errors are mine , click for a bigger version ) .
The " forward yield " is just the percentage by which the future price is higher than the spot price .
I 'm using four month futures , but I 've converted the yield an annual rate .
If the forward yield is 10 % and the interest rate is 4 % , an oil man would profit from buying oil now and selling it forward , as long as his storage costs are less than 6 % per year .
Tycoons would start buying spot and selling forward until yield dropped to interest + storage .
But did n't we say future prices should be higher than spot prices ?
Look at the average ( the yellow line in the graph ) .
It at - 3.4 % , well below zero !
The yield is negative more often than it is positive .
Whenever the yield is anything less than interest + storage , you 'd expect oilmen to sell crude from storage and buy it back forward .
He earns interest on his cash and saves the storage costs that way , which is better than the profit he'd make storing and selling forward .
When the forward yield is negative , Texans should be selling physical and buying forward like mad .
By doing so , they earn interest on cash , save storage costs , and lock - in an easy profit buying back their oil for less than than what they sold it for .
Very quickly , all the selling should create a glut of physical oil , driving down spot prices , while the buying forward drives up future prices , until the yield is positive and sanity is restored .
But negative forward yields for oil have persisted , sometimes for years at a time !
We must be missing something .
Hmmm ...
Suppose someone offered to buy your vacuum cleaner today for $ 100 , and sell it back to you next week for $ 80 , with no risk of wear or breakage .
Would you ?
It would depend how much you value the use of your snorter .
If you refuse , we might infer that a week 's access to the pleasures of vacuuming is worth 20 bucks to you .
We call that value of temporary use a " convenience yield " .
It 's as if having the vacuum cleaner around pays you $ 20 , even if no cash changes hands .
Maybe we observe negative forward yields on oil because the smell of oil in the morning is priceless to guys in cowboy hats .
( Or not ... see below for a more plausible account of oil 's " convenience yield " . )
Let 's eliminate wandering interest rates , and take a look at the storage cost / convenience yield of oil historically .
Below is a graph of a three - month forward yield ( calculated from the first to the fourth month forward , because futures prices are more trustworthy than spot ) with the concurrent 3 - month T - bill rate backed out of it , leaving only storage costs .
When storage costs are negative , that reflects , by definition , a convenience yield .
( Again EIA monthly data , T - bill rates courtesy of FRED , my calculations )
From Jan 1986 through May 2008 , oil futures have reflected a convenience yield of 8 % per year on average .
( This is in rough agreement with the overall mean of 0.021 % per day calculated here by Milonas and Henker , see Table 3 . )
Suppose that the current convenience yield is about 8 % and three month interest rates are about 2 % .
Then a one - year futures contract should be about 6 % cheaper than spot , and a four - month - out contract should be about 1.4 % cheaper than a one - month - out contract ( reflecting 3 months of storage ) .
At the end of May , the 4 - month - out contract was in " backwardation " , but was only 0.5 % cheaper than the 1 - month , still too expensive given the convenience yield .
Oil dudes could have earned ( on an annualized basis ) about 3.6 % more than the risk free rate ( about 5.6 % overall ) buying high and selling low , but enjoying the privilege of storage .
Now that oil is in gentle contango ( as of June 17 , the 4 month contract costs about 1 % more than the 1 month ) , buying forward and storing looks like a really fantastic deal .
What is this " convenience yield " ?
Is it real ?
It seems like it must be , the economics of an 8 % return are n't subtle in the data .
But when I first encountered this idea , it baffled me .
So instead of talking oil , let 's talk hotels .
Suppose you have a hotel , it 's morning , and you 've got a room that is n't yet booked for tonight .
Empty rooms end up costing you about $ 10 a night , considering your rent , maintenance , utilities , etc .
But , you estimate there 's about a 50 % chance that a weary last - minute traveler will come by and pay your walk - in rate of $ 150 for the room .
So , the risk - neutral expected value of your empty room is $ 65 [ ( 150 ÷ 2 ) - 10 ] .
You 're risk - averse , not risk neutral , though .
You 'd accept a certain $ 60 rather than a 50 - 50 chance of losing $ 10 or earning $ 140 .
That $ 60 is the " convenience yield " on your empty room , it 's what having a room empty , in case opportunity strikes , is worth to you .
Oil is a " spiky " commodity .
Every once in a while , someone really needs it , now , and will pay a premium for immediacy .
The market for oil in Cushing , Oklahoma might be reasonably efficient , but what happens when someone in Peoria needs oil today ?
Opportunity !
Instead of running a hotel , you build an oil tank in Peoria .
Suppose that every month , there 's a 10 % chance a desperate client will offer a 5 % premium for immediate delivery of all your oil , and that interest and storage cost you 0.2 % per month .
Then on average , you 'd earn 0.5 % ( 10 % x 5 % ) each month from desperate clients , and pay 0.2 % in expenses .
You do n't want to bear the risk of fluctuating oil prices , so you sell your oil forward .
If you were risk neutral , you'd be willing to sell it for a discount of up to 0.3 % less than you bought it for at the beginning of the month , at which price you 'd just break even .
But you 're not risk - neutral :
You attach a " certainty - equivalent " value of only 0.4 % to the unpredictable income from needy customers , and would offer no more than a 0.2 % discount on month - forward oil sales .
In the end , you earn a risk - adjusted 0.4 % per month " convenience yield " from desperate polluters , and pay 0.2 % in interest and expenses , and 0.2 % in hedging costs .
If one - month oil futures pay more than 0.2 % - less - than - spot , or ( golden days ! ) if they are in contango , you 'd buy as much oil as you could and sell it all forward , because every new barrel that you promise to buy high and sell not - so - low represents certain ( well , " certainty equivalent " ) profit .
Putting aside Peoria and our artificial needy customer , sometimes oil spikes even on the wider market , so that anybody with physical oil can sell at a high price and while locking in low - priced near future purchases to replenish their stock quickly enough to meet any other contractual obligation to sell .
If you estimate the profit you'd to earn from these occasional opportunities , and subtract a bit to come up with a " certainty - equivalent " value for this uncertain income stream , you 'll have determined a convenience yield .
It should n't be surprising that convenience yields are especially high for volatile commodities subject to frequent shortages and price spikes .
When futures markets are well - arbitraged ( which might not always be the case ! ) , the future price of a storable commodity is determined by the spot price plus the total cost of storage , defined as foregone interest , plus storage costs , minus any benefit of temporary ownership &mdash the convenience yield !
When a storable commodity like oil is in backwardation , that does n't mean that the markets are predicting that its price will fall .
It means there is a convenience yield .
And in order to decide whether futures markets are creating incentives to store or to sell physical stuff , you have to estimate the convenience yield .
Postscript : While I was writing ...
Mark Thoma offers a nice extension of Krugman 's model , showing how monetary policy , by affecting interest rates , would be expected to affect storage .
Yves Smith offers very pointed commentary on futures markets , speculation , and inventory ( here and here ) .
If policymakers want to " do something " about commodity speculation , they should really start investigating passivity on the short side of the market rather than enthusiasm on the long .
Given what 's before them , I hope they ignore Michael Masters ( ugh ! ) and Thomas Palley ( whom I often like , but yuk ) , and go with Dean Baker 's suggestion of a Tobin Tax ( ht Mark Thoma ) .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Democratic - controlled Congress on Thursday adopted a $ 3 trillion U.S. budget for next year as the House of Representatives put the finishing touches on a measure to eliminate deficits by 2012 while spending more than President George W. Bush wanted for domestic programs .
By a partisan vote of 214- 210 , the House approved the nonbinding Democratic budget that sketches out spending priorities for the next five years -- through a new president ’s term .
The Senate approved an identical measure on Wednesday , embracing Bush ’s continuation of a military buildup that sets aside more than $ 500 billion for national defense next year .
It will be up to the new president -- most likely Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama -- and the next Congress to tackle the huge problems this budget mostly ignores : long - term tax policy and controlling the growing costs of health and retirement benefits for the elderly .
Robert Bixby , executive director of the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan group that advocates balanced budgets , applauded Congress for passing a budget , which has become a rarity during election years .
But he called it “ a holding action basically ... the general consensus is all the big fights are going to come later . ”
The Social Security retirement program and Medicare , the government - run health insurance program for the elderly , will explode in size in coming years , threatening huge , long - term budget deficits unless cost savings are found .
Over the next 25 years , the number of Americans aged 65 and over will grow to 20 percent of the population from about 12 percent now , as aging baby boomers strain the budget .
House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt , a South Carolina Democrat , said the budget “ charts a new course .
It returns the budget to balance , reaching a budget surplus of $ 22 billion in the year 2012 and staying in surplus through 2013 . ”
He added it also began “ undoing the damages done by the president ’s budget ” by adding money for child health care and rejecting cuts to domestic programs such as law enforcement , education and energy aid to low - income families .
Without Medicare and Social Security reforms , those future surpluses will likely evaporate .
‘ CRUSHING BURDEN ’
Besides setting broad goals for federal spending and taxes , this budget also would raise the government ’s debt limit to $ 10.615 trillion from the current ceiling of $ 9.815 trillion .
Interest payments on the debt will cost taxpayers about $ 234 billion just this year .
Republicans , who voted against the budget , said the Democratic plan added significantly to the federal debt after years of Democrats chastising Republicans for doing so .
“ We , with this budget , are going faster down the pathway of sending a crushing burden of debt and taxes on the next generation , ” said Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the senior Republican on the budget panel .
“ Both parties have been responsible for not addressing these problems . ”
Earlier this year , the House and Senate passed slightly different budget blueprints for fiscal 2009 that starts October 1 .
This compromise measure sketches out about $ 21 billion more in non-defense domestic spending than Bush requested for next year .
It would result in a budget deficit of about $ 340 billion in fiscal 2009 .
That does not include the full costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Some economists speculate this year ’s budget deficit could be more than $ 400 billion , largely because of war costs and the fallout from a poorly performing economy .
The budget blueprint is not signed into law .
It gives guidance for lawmakers as they weigh a series of spending bills later in the year .
Actually , string theorist John Schwarz now occupies Richard Feynman 's old office at Caltech .
But ... I got Feynman 's desk .
Caltech has a room devoted to Feynman memorabilia , and they really want this desk .
( Feynman - worship is quite the industry here ; the bookstore has a section labeled " Feynman " in the same way an ordinary bookstore would have sections labeled " Physics " or " Women 's Studies . " )
But Helen Tuck , who was Feynman 's secretary and still occasionally visits , insists that the desk be used by a working physicist .
My impression is that the desk is given to the most senior person in the theory group who is not sufficiently senior to get all brand - new fancy furniture ; at the moment , that person is I .
( In the background , one can discern the winner of the ultimate showdown . )
I looked for little diagrams carved into the wood , but have n't found any yet .
Twenty years ago , when I started out as a writer , the problems of mass prosperity were the ones that intrigued me most .
America was then , as I thought it would always remain , the great middle - class nation .
And in the permanent affluent society , questions of taste and waste and marketing and alienation were what really mattered , now and forever .
When moved to consider workplace issues in those days , I instinctively placed them in the category of brutal - things - settled - long - ago :
Without even thinking about it , I connected the word " labor " to the word " history . "
It 's not a mistake anyone can make any longer , whether they are pondering the voting patterns of working - class Hoosiers or the driest statistics in the record book .
Median " nonelderly " household income , we find , fell consistently through the first half of this decade , despite the solid economic growth enjoyed by the country as a whole .
Some nonmedian folks did just fine , of course :
The top 20 % of households earned more , after taxes , than the rest of the country combined in 2005 , while the topmost 1 % of the population took home more than the bottom 40 % .
The top - earning hedge fund manager of 2007 , in fact , made about as much last year in nominal dollars ( $ 3.7 billion ) as J. Paul Getty , one of the richest men in the world , was worth in the mid-1970s .
Real hourly wages for most workers , on the other hand , have risen only 1 % since 1979 , even as those workers ' productivity has increased by 60 % .
What 's more , American workers now clock more hours per year than their counterparts in virtually every other advanced economy , even Japan .
And unless you have n't read a newspaper for 15 years , you already know what 's happened to workers ' health insurance and pension plans .
I confess that I am fascinated by the mechanics of this huge social reconfiguration – in the same sense that I am fascinated by the industrial procedures of a slaughterhouse , or by the strategies that enabled small Confederate armies to win victories for slavery over much larger Union forces .
How the big change was brought off is the subject of Steven Greenhouse 's important new book , " The Big Squeeze , " which is also my source for many of the statistics in the preceding paragraphs .
Aside from the outsourcing , offshoring , and firing - at - will that make up the best - known weapons in the corporate arsenal , Mr. Greenhouse reveals how managers extract unpaid work through an array of ingenious tricks , from eliminating bathroom breaks to electronically erasing hours from workers ' records .

Kris and I went grocery shopping this weekend .
We stopped at Bob 's Red Mill — a local health - food store — to use some “ buy one , get one free ” coupons .
“ You can get anything you want , ” Kris told me , “ except hot cereal . ”
“ Why can't I get hot cereal ? ” I asked .
“ I love hot cereal . ”
“ I know , ” Kris said .
“ But you buy it all the time .
You buy it faster than you eat it .
Just last week , you bought another box of that blueberry oatmeal from Trader Joe's .
You never remember what we have at home .
You need to shop with a list . ”
She has a point .
A shopping list is a useful way to remind yourself what you do and do not need to purchase .
But most frugality experts emphasize shopping with a list because it prevents impulse purchases .
Impulse purchases wreck grocery budgets .
In Why We Buy : The Science of Shopping , Paco Underhill writes :
Supermarkets are places of high impulse buying for both sexes — fully 60 to 70 percent of purchases there were unplanned , grocery industry studies have shown us .
More than half of all grocery purchases are unplanned !
No wonder creating and sticking to a list can bring down grocery costs .
But that 's not the only way to save money at the supermarket .
Over the past two years , I 've published a lot of tips for saving money on your grocery bill .
Some of these have been obvious — others less so .
All of them can help you save at the supermarket .
Here are some of the best :
Make a List — and Stick to It .
This is the cardinal rule of shopping .
The list represents your grocery needs : the staples you 're out of , and the food you need for upcoming meals .
When you stray from the list , you 're buying on impulse , and that 's how shopping trips get out of control .
Sure , a magazine only costs $ 5 , but if you spend an extra $ 5 every time you make a trip to the supermarket , you waste a lot of money .
Compare Unit Pricing .
The biggest package is n't always the most cost - effective .
Stores know that consumers want to buy in bulk , and so they mix it up : sometimes the bulk item is cheaper , sometimes it 's more expensive .
The only way you can be sure is to take a calculator .
Our grocery store posts unit pricing for most items , which makes comparisons easy .
Ditch the Basket or Cart .
If you 're dashing into the supermarket to pick up milk and bread , do n't use a basket .
Baskets induce people to buy more .
If you 're limited to what you can carry , you 're more likely to avoid impulse purchases .
Only use a basket ( or shopping cart ) if it 's absolutely necessary .
Do n't Examine Things You Don't Need .
The more you interact with something , the more likely you are to buy it , says Paco Underhill in Why We Buy : “ Virtually all unplanned purchases … come as a result of the shopper seeing , touching , smelling , or tasting something that promises pleasure , if not total fulfillment . ”
Do you know why grocery stores place those displays in the aisles ?
To intentionally block traffic .
They want to force you to stop , if only for a moment .
It only takes a few seconds of idly staring at the Chips Ahoy ! to convince you to buy them .
Stay focused .
Live on the Edge .
Health - conscious shoppers know that the perimeter of the store is where the good stuff is .
The baked goods , dairy products , fresh meats , and fruits and vegetables are generally placed along the outside edge of the supermarket , while the processed stuff can be found up and down the aisles .
But shopping the edges is n't just healthier — it 's cheaper too .
Stock up on the fresh food first , then venture to the middle of the store .
Discard Brand Loyalties .
Be willing to experiment .
You may have a favorite brand of diced tomatoes , for example , but does it really matter ?
Go with what 's on sale for the lowest unit price .
You may find you like the less expensive product just as well .
If you try a cheaper brand and are disappointed , it 's okay to return to your regular brand .
Choose Generic .
Better yet , try the store brand .
Generic and store brand products are cheaper than their name - brand equivalents and are usually of similar quality .
But do you know why you 're reluctant to try generics ?
The power of marketing .
Most generics have unappealing packaging .
If they cost less and taste the same , who cares ?
Use Coupons Wisely .
Coupons really can save you money .
But you have to know how to use them .
Clip coupons only the things you need — staple foods and ingredients — not for processed junk food .
Learn to use special coupons .
Once each month , one local store sends us a “ $ 10 off a $ 50 purchase coupon ” .
We know it 's coming , so we plan our trips around it .
Make One Large Trip Instead of Several Small Ones .
Each time you enter the grocery store is another chance to spend .
By reducing the frequency of your trips , you 're not only avoiding temptation , but you 're also saving money on overhead ( time and fuel ) .
Buy From the Bulk Bins .
Some stores offer bulk bins filled with baking ingredients , cereal , and spices .
When you buy in bulk , you get just the amount you need , and you pay less .
Much less .
( One GRS reader recently shared how he saved over $ 150 by buying spices in bulk . )
Check Your Receipt .
Make sure your prices are scanned correctly .
Make sure your coupons are scanned correctly .
Sale items , especially , have a tendency to be in the computer wrong , and yet few people ever challenge the price at the register .
You do n't need to hold up the line : simply watch the price of each item as it's scanned .
If you suspect an error , step to the side and check the receipt as the clerk begins the next order .
If there 's a problem , politely point it out .
It 's your money .
Ask for it .
Shop Alone .
In Why We Buy , the author notes that people tend to buy more when shopping in groups than when shopping alone .
“ But men are especially suggestible to the entreaties of children as well as eye - catching displays . ”
Kris complains that we always spend more on food when we shop together .
She 's right .
If possible , shop alone .
Use a Grocery Price Book .
A grocery price book is an ongoing list of the items you most commonly purchase and how much you paid for them .
This list allows you to detect price cycles , spot bargains , and plan your shopping trips for maximum savings .
A price book allows you to practice strike - point shopping .
Shop on a Full Stomach .
Studies show that folks who shop when they 're hungry buy more .
This is certainly true for me :
If I go to the store for milk on a Sunday morning without eating breakfast , I 'm likely to come home with donuts and orange juice and Lucky Charms , too .
Walk or Bike .
In our recent discussion about how to pay yourself first , Ross Williams suggested another way to reduce impulse purchases .
By walking or biking to the store , you can automatically limit your spending .
“ It 's amazing how focused you can be when you are limited to one shopping bag full of groceries , ” he writes .
“ Once you are very conscious of each purchase , it seems to carry over even to the small items where space is n't really an issue . ”
Any of these tips can help a savvy shopper save money at the supermarket .
But when combined to create a cohesive shopping philosophy , they have the power to slash your grocery budget significantly .
I 'm not promising that you 'll be able to feed yourself for $ 15 a week , but you might be able to save enough money pay down your debt or to jump - start your savings !

Few writers are as good as Morris at making financial arcana understandable and even fascinating .
Confronted with a report by British regulators warning of a “ financial stability level event , ” he explains that the language is “ civil - service speak for a credit - market Chernobyl . ”
One of the most important aspects of the financial architecture that is now collapsing was the way it allowed investors to believe they could make perfectly safe investments when they financed very risky loans .
Or , as Morris puts it , “ Highly rated bonds magically materialize out of a witches ’ soup of very smoky stuff . ”
He adds , “ Very big , very complex , very opaque structures built on extremely rickety foundations are a recipe for collapse . ”
The collapse is now under way .
In recent years Wall Street profits were built on leverage and on taking risks that were obscure both to regulators and even to the top managements of the banks themselves .
Every three months now , we see banks disclosing huge losses from risks that they had never admitted they were taking .
No one  not investors , not managers , not regulators  is sure when this process will end .
And that uncertainty has created a credit freeze , with lenders reluctant to lend both because they do not know whom they can trust and because they fear they may need the money to cover losses that are yet to materialize .
As the recession gathers steam , there are likely to be more corporate failures than there need to be , because credit has gone from virtually free to all but unavailable .
In recent years , Wall Streeters have often been seen as “ responsible guardians of the public trust , ” wealthy men who could be relied upon to act in the national interest , as J. P. Morgan did in halting the Panic of 1907 when the government seemed powerless to do so .
Former chairmen of Goldman Sachs served as Treasury secretary for both of the occupants of the White House in this century .
As Fraser shows , there has been another view , one that may come to the fore if the recession lingers and millions lose their jobs or homes , while those who brought on the disaster remain wealthy beyond any dream available to normal people .
“ By the time of the American Revolution there was already a robust plebeian resentment of the aristocrat as parasite , a privileged nonproducer living off the hard labor of those he lorded over , ” Fraser writes .
It has not helped that the financial lords have not always been subtle about their superiority , as when Jay Gould , the robber baron who ran railroads in the late 19th century , boasted he could hire one half of the working class to kill the other half .
It is one thing to be seen as venal but brilliant , and another to be seen as both greedy and stupid .
That is the risk Wall Street now faces .
As Fraser says in writing about the aftermath of the 1929 crash , “ Wall Street had proved itself not only ethically challenged and dangerously omnipotent but , more damning than that , omni-incompetent . ”
And he continues : “ During the boom years of the 1920s , the white - shoe world of J. P. Morgan had accepted credit for the nation ’s good fortune and been portrayed as a conclave of wise men .
Now , under the new circumstances of economic ruination , that same world was treated as criminally irresponsible , pathetic even , an object not only of censure but of mockery .
And there is perhaps nothing more fatal for the life expectancy of an elite than to be viewed as ridiculous . ”

Thanks Alan , I wanted to add a bit to my comment about election integrity in the 42nd in particular .
I 'm not worried mainly because in the past the 42nd has not been a contested district so I 'm comfortable that even though it 's unverifiable there 's not much motivation for someone to set up an infrastructure of fraud .
Having said that I will be sending a message to Debra Bowen asking for some help in understanding when the issue will be dealt with .
As I said in the interview I do n't want to have to trust that our votes will be accurately and completely counted .
Thanks for bringing it to my attention , Alan .

Ron -
Thanks for dropping by and for taking the article in the spirit in which it was intended .
A couple of points in response to your comment : I 'm not worried mainly because in the past the 42nd has not been a contested district so I 'm comfortable that even though it 's unverifiable there 's not much motivation for someone to set up an infrastructure of fraud .
You should be concerned in that every vote deserves to be counted accurately , and verifiably .
There is no way that any single vote , for any candidate or initiative on the ballot , ever cast on one of Orange County 's DREs , during any election can be verified as accurately recorded as per the voter intent .
Orange has had some famously close elections ( in ' 06 , one was decided by 6 votes as I recall , after a " recount " where only the paper ballots were counted , and the DRE results were simply re-printed from the memory cards ) .
Aside from that , votes cast in Orange for state elections similarly effect the rest of the state .
If there 's a close vote for a state candidate or an initiative , a swell way to effect the outcome of that race or initiative is to change the unverifiable numbers in Orange County any way that one pleases .
As I said in the interview I do n't want to have to trust that our votes will be accurately and completely counted .
As long as voters in Orange County are voting on DREs , you will have no choice but to do exactly that .
You might wish to encourage voters to ask for the paper ballot they are entitled to vote on in California ( though they may have to know to ask about that in Orange , since they wo n't go out of their way to tell voters ) .
And then you 'll just have to cross your fingers and count on your lucky stars that whatever you are told are the results of your election , actually are accurate .
Since there will be no way for you to determine that afterwards .
Hope that 's helpful .
Feel free to drop me a line if I can help you with any more questions / concerns .

Here 's the thing about our elections systems nationwide .
They 're all potentially problematic .
This makes it possible for party / fraudulent election operatives to pick where they want fraud to occur for every single election , and in those designated spots , what kind of fraud will be launched .
It 's just incredibly dumb for America to keep waiting after every single election to see where it happened the last time , and then spend years prosecuting those spots .
While we 're trying to go after whoever it was that rigged the last election , they 're putting in place the mechanisms to rig the next one .
Meanwhile , the right - wing conservative agenda is working , through its Supreme Court appointees , to make it illegal for all Americans to vote .
That Indiana voter ID law is just the beginning .
Progressives need to get just as smart about getting clean elections up and running all across the country , as the right - wing conservatives are about stopping targeted Democrats from voting .

" Election " IS a fraud .
SEEING FOX ENGAGED IN HILLARY'S DAMAGE CONTROL THIS WEEKEND IS YET FURTHER EVIDENCE OF HOW DESPERATE THE ROCKEFELLER GLOBALISTS ARE TO STAY " ON - SCRIPT . "
Hillary is the designated loser to the McCain / Lieberman / Israel ticket .
Obama was used as a tool to split - off the black vote from the Hillary vote , to enable the Fascist Dictatorship 's continuation , under the guise of a Republic with " free and fair " elections .
The scam is failing and they are freaking out .
Hillary 's comments and those of others are only foretelling the dark secrets they 've been told .
Keeping such secrets about such evil is difficult .
They have a tendency of coming out , despite one 's efforts to hold them inside .
Sort of like when GW Bush admitted TWICE that he had seen the first plane hit the first WTC tower on 9/11 - LIVE - prior to going into the Booker Elementary School ( on closed circuit TV in his limo ) .
Keeping secrets about such evil is tough , is n't it Hillary ?
We 'll blame you if it happens ... count on that .

Well seems to me Ron has his heart in the right place & certainly sounds sincere .
However he is quite naive and uninformed at least about election fraud .
The 2000 election was clearly stolen and when it appeared that Florida was going to do the right thing and actually recount ALL the votes the SCOTUS stepped in and ILLEGALLY stopped the recount and anointed Dubya when they had no legal precedent , or right to intervene at all .
The 2004 S-election was blatantly stolen and with the help of the clearly complicit Mainstream Media .
Even in 2006 when Democrats gained so many seats it was quite clear that Rove 's " Math " was that he could just steal about 14 - 16 seats and still remain in the majority , in fact he needed to steal about 30 , that is where his math was wrong .
What we have today is a corrupt duopoly , we basically have ONE corporate fascist party with 2 Right ( D ) / Reich ( R ) wings .
If Ron wants to uphold the Constitution then first and foremost IMPEACHMENT must be back on the table .
These criminals infesting the White House right now have committed no less than 25 Impeachable offense and counting , spanning from TREASON , to War crimes , Crimes against humanity etc .
The key to all the crimes committed in the past 8 years is the False Flag attack of 9/11 .
9/11 truth is the key to regaining any resemblance of dignity this country used to have in the world .
The perpetrators of this crime MUST be held accountable .
Until that happens expect nothing to change , expect more fraudulent elections , more war , as this country sinks ever lower into a full blown Totalitarian Police State run by Fascist .
This may not be what you " want " to hear but reality is a bitch .

Philadelphia
IN 1894 , Baron Pierre de Coubertin , having refused the military and political careers typical of a French aristocrat , settled upon the revival of the Olympic Games as his life ’s work .
He saw sport as a higher calling , a religion .
And he saw the Olympics as an event that would enhance and heighten moral virtue : “ May joy and good fellowship reign , and in this manner , may the Olympic torch pursue its way through ages , increasing friendly understanding among nations , for the good of a humanity always more enthusiastic , more courageous and more pure . ”
He is considered by many the father of the modern Games , first held in 1896 in Athens .
But if he were alive today and witness to the Olympics over the past 40 years , he would almost surely come to the conclusion that his grand idea had failed , that idealism is no match for the troika of politics , money and sports .
The Summer Games in Beijing are four months away and already a predictable mess .
The running of the Olympic torch resulted in arrests and nasty confrontations with the police last week in London and Paris amid protests against China ’s recent crackdown in Tibet and other human rights abuses .
In San Francisco , the only North American stop , the torch - bearers played literal hide - and - seek with protesters when the route was suddenly changed for security reasons .
There have been repeated calls for heads of state to boycott the opening ceremonies .
But protests and boycotts are no longer effective remedies .
There is only one way left to improve the Olympics : to permanently end them .
True , in the world of sports , any plan that puts morality over money is unlikely to happen .
Commissions are formed only once the problem is over ( see Major League Baseball ) and the cheaters will always find another angle  you can bet that some lab somewhere is working on the design of a new steroid undetectable to testing ( see every professional sport and many “ amateur ” ones ) .
The loftier the rose - colored rhetoric , which in the Olympics has become an Olympian growth industry , the worse the underlying stink .
And this is an institution that is rotted in so many different ways .

2008 April 11
At first , he could n't see the Moon
Credit & Copyright : Laurent Laveder ( PixHeaven.net / TWAN )
Explanation :
At first , he could n't see it , but searching with binoculars along a cloudy western horizon near sunset , photographer Laurent Laveder finally spotted a delicate lunar crescent .
Captured in this dramatic picture on April 6th from Bretagne , France , the Moon was only 15 hours and 38 minutes old .
Its slight , irregular , sunlit arc opens upward just above the dark cloud bank near picture center .
Of course , a crescent Moon in the early evening sky is a lovely sight often enjoyed by many .
But finding the Moon when its slim crescent is still less than about 24 hours past the New Moon phase requires careful timing and planning , a challenging project even for experienced observers .
In this sighting , only about 0.8 percent of the Moon 's disk appears illuminated .
Laveder notes that this is the youngest Moon he has spotted in twenty years of skygazing and also offers this animation ( Flash or gif ) based on his images of the tantalizing celestial scene .
Amazon has introduced a new $ 400 ebook reader , aggressively named the Kindle .
( So funny , of course , to bring the idea of burning together with the idea of books . )
The Kindle is called a “ wireless reading device ” : I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve been able to read without needing wires since I was very small .
Anyway , we gadgetophiles must bravely acknowledge that the Kindle is certain to fail , since ( among other reasons ) it is stupidly expensive and relies , as John Gruber points out , on a proprietary file format with insane restrictions on use .
But please do n’t imagine that I ’m one of those muttering diehards who exhibit an irrational fetish for the book - as - object .
Instead , in the hope of hastening the exciting ebook revolution , I here propose a minimal list of features that any really successful ebook device must eventually have .
Feature parity with physical books , after all , is surely a reasonable baseline demand .
So here is what the electronic book of the future will be like .
1 It will have an inexhaustible source of energy and never need recharging .
2 It will have resolution as good as print .
( No , Amazon , really as good as print . )
3 It will be able to survive coffee and wine spills , days of intense sunlight , dropping in the ocean , light charring , and falling completely into two or more pieces , while still remaining perfectly readable afterwards .
4 It will allow me to scribble notes and / or doodles in the margins , with my choice of mechanical pencil or fine Muji fibre - tip pen ( black ) .
( Note , typing in the margins with a crappy thumb keyboard is not an acceptable alternative . )
5 It will allow me to riffle through it and thus get a quick , intuitive look at the book ’s argumentative or narrative structure .
6 It will allow me to tear off the corner of a page to write down my phone number ( or someone else ’s ) .
7 It will display to other people in coffee shops and on public transport the title of what I am reading , so as to advertise my erudition or quirky sense of humour .
8 It will be physically handsome , not drop - dead fugly .
( Note to Amazon : for pity ’s sake , next time , head - hunt people from Sony or Apple . )
9 Indeed , the books on it will still be designed , by typesetters and graphic artists , so as to feed our aesthetic pleasure .
10 I will still be able to lend or give books to friends , or swap books in and out of the honour library of much - read novels in a Mediterranean seaside bar .
11 I will be able to use the ebook as a reliable flat surface for rolling cigarettes or other leaf - based refreshments , without worrying about debris shorting the motherboard .
12 When I receive the updated edition of the Oxford Companion to Philosophy , I will be able to press the previous edition into service as a stand for the left - hand music speaker on my desk .
13 The ebook will function , morever , as both bug - crusher and discretionary hat .
Placed on my face , it will make a soft roof against the sun on the beach .
14 I will still be able to hurl a fatuous tome such as Jeff Gomez ’s Print Is Dead across the room without thereby destroying my ability to read any other books .
There .
Only 14 features to go before we can all abandon paper .
Not too much to ask , is it ?
Update : via Gruber again , I see that some chucklemeister at BusinessWeek has the horn for the Kindle :
But the digerati do n’t get it and do n’t like it and that creates a compelling investment opportunity to buy Amazon shares now .
The stock market does n’t appreciate this game changer .
Kindle will be the iPod of books — you read it here first .
Ah , the iPod of books .
Indeed .
How many times have you been sitting on a train or at a café table with a book , and wished to high heaven that instead of a single measly book , you had a playlist — perhaps comprising 2 pages of Schopenhauer , 3 pages of Dan Brown , a paragraph of Cormac McCarthy , a scene of Pinter , and a single brilliantly chosen sentence of Martin Amis ?
Yes , me too .
I ’m ready to bet that setting up and deleting remote branches is something you do rarely enough that you always find yourself looking up the documentation .
Or maybe it ’s just me .
Due to its roots ,
Git supports a wide array of usage scenarios for interacting with remote repositories , and we love it that way .
It ’s a big factor in the flexibility and power of the tool .
However in simple scenarios , there ’s still a bunch of commands you must run to accomplish simple tasks .
I believe the commands for the simple scenario can be simpler .
Last January , Carl Mercier created git-remote - branch .
I ’ve found this script very useful and , with his permission , I ’ve decided to keep moving it forward and add a few features to it .
git_remote_branch
The first purpose of git_remote_branch is to encapsulate all the commands that need to be run to interact with remote branches in simple scenarios .
Its second purpose is to be a learning tool .
git_remote_branch does two things to help you learn these commands :
It clearly displays the commands it runs on your behalf , in a beautiful shade of red ;
It has an ‘ explain ’ meta - command that will simply display the list of commands instead of running them for you .
Examples
Help
Let ’s start with the simplest of all :
$ grb
or
$ grb help git_remote_branch version 0.2.2 Usage : grb create branch_name [ origin_server ] grb delete branch_name [ origin_server ] grb track branch_name [ origin_server ]
If origin_server is not specified , the name ' origin ' is assumed ( git 's default )
The explain meta -command : you can also prepend any command with the keyword ' explain ' .
Instead of executing the command , git_remote_branch will simply output the list of commands you need to run to accomplish that goal .
Example : grb explain create grb explain create my_branch github
All commands also have aliases : create : create , new delete : delete , destroy , kill , remove track : track , follow , grab , fetch
As you can see , the syntax for all commands is very regular : action , branch_name and optionally , origin_server .
To facilitate learning even more , aliases are also provided .
So to take an example ,
$ grb track his_branch
and
$ grb fetch his_branch
are perfectly equivalent .
create
Create lets you create a new branch both remotely and locally .
Note that it ’s not made to share an existing branch ( that feature ’s coming ) .
So what it does is to push your current branch as a new remote branch , then create it locally and track it , for easier pulling afterwards .
$ grb create some_branch git_remote_branch version 0.2.2 git push origin master : refs / heads / some_branch Total 0 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) To / path / to / repo/ * [ new branch ] master -> some_branch git fetch origin git branch −−track some_branch origin / some_branch git checkout some_branch Switched to branch " some_branch "
delete
Presenting features with names that are too self - evident is boring .
Let ’s get to the point , already .
$ grb delete some_branch git_remote_branch version 0.2.2 git push origin :refs/heads/some_branch To / path/ to/repo/ - [ deleted ] some_branch git checkout master Switched to branch " master " git branch -d some_branch
track
Track lets you easily track the changes that are made to an existing remote branch you ’re not tracking already .
Each time you pull from the remote repository , the local branch will be automatically merged with the remote branch .
$ grb track his_branch git_remote_branch version 0.2.2 git fetch origin From / path / to / repo/ * [ new branch ] his_branch -> origin / his_branch git branch −−track his_branch origin/ his_branch
explain
Explain will spew out all commands necessary to accomplish one of the previous actions .
There are two ways of using it .
The simplest will give you dummy commands :
$ grb explain create git_remote_branch version 0.2.2
List of operations to do to create a new remote branch and track it locally : git push origin master : refs / heads / branch_to_create git fetch origin git branch −−track branch_to_create origin / branch_to_create git checkout branch_to_create
Or you can have steps that are tailor - made for what you want to accomplish .
$ grb explain create my_branch github_origin git_remote_branch version 0.2.2
List of operations to do to create a new remote branch and track it locally : git push github_origin master : refs / heads / my_branch git fetch github_origin git branch −−track my_branch github_origin / my_branch git checkout my_branch
get git_remote_branch
( Hey , this title has a nice ring to it )
sudo gem install webmat- git_remote_branch −−source=http://gems.github.com
Now with rubygems 1.2.0 out ( do n’t do it with a prior version ) , you can also add GitHub as a permanent source for your gems :
sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
Now and ever after , you will be able to get anything from GitHub with a simple
sudo gem install webmat - git_remote_branch
If in your eagerness you ’ve added github as a source before running
sudo gem update −−system

Look ma , no tests !
Uhhhh , yeah , I know …
This tool is still extremely early in its life and - dare I say it - it ’s only hand - tested for now .
I ’ve been using it personally for a while and it ’s working very well for me , if that means anything :-)
So this is still a quick script , only now it has lipstick .
This software should be considered an early version of a pre-alpha .
You ’ve been warned !
If this makes you queasy , there ’s always the ‘ explain ’ command that can act as your cheat sheet without actually having grb run the commands on your behalf .
For the extra queasy , well you can find the commands very easily without running grb .
Just point your favorite editor to lib/ git_remote_branch.rb .
All commands are there , at the beginning of the file .
For the brave , try it out and tell me what you think .
Improvements , bug reports and contributions are all welcome .
And remember , in case of an emergency , you can always refer to my illustrated guide to recovering lost commits with Git ;-)
Here ’s what ’s to come :
Intelligence community did n't vet Bush , Cheney 's opening arguments for war : report Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 5 , 2008
|
Print This Email This When President Bush and Vice President Cheney began building their case for the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq , they did so in high profile speeches that received no vetting or approval from US intelligence agencies that were gathering information about Saddam Hussein 's regime , according to a new Senate report .
It turned out that most of their assertions were wrong .
In a sweeping , 200 - plus page review of the administration 's pre-war case for invasion , the Senate Intelligence Committee found that the American public was being fed information at odds with prevailing views , and officials were ignoring contemporary disagreements in the Intelligence Community .
 In making the case for war , the Administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted , or even non-existent .
As a result , the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed ,  Intelligence Committee Chairman John Rockefeller ( D - WV ) said in a press release announcing the new report .
 It is my belief that the Bush Administration was fixated on Iraq , and used the 9/11 attacks by al Qaida as justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein .
To accomplish this , top Administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked Iraq and al Qaida as a single threat and insinuated that Iraq played a role in 9/11 .
Sadly , the Bush Administration led the nation into war under false pretenses . "
The full report is available as two large .pdf files here and here .
Rockefeller summarized its findings as follows :
The Committees report cites several conclusions in which the Administrations public statements were NOT supported by the intelligence .
They include :
 Statements and implications by the President and Secretary of State suggesting that Iraq and al - Qaida had a partnership , or that Iraq had provided al - Qaida with weapons training , were not substantiated by the intelligence .
 Statements by the President and the Vice President indicating that Saddam Hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the United States were contradicted by available intelligence information .
 Statements by President Bush and Vice President Cheney regarding the postwar situation in Iraq , in terms of the political , security , and economic , did not reflect the concerns and uncertainties expressed in the intelligence products .
 Statements by the President and Vice President prior to the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing .
 The Secretary of Defenses statement that the Iraqi government operated underground WMD facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information .
 The Intelligence Community did not confirm that Muhammad Atta met an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in 2001 as the Vice President repeatedly claimed .
The report analyzed five of the most prominent speeches from administration officials laying out the case for war , beginning with Vice President Dick Cheney 's address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention on Aug. 26 , 2002 , through then - Secretary of State Colin Powell 's now - infamous presentation to the United Nations in February 2003 , just six weeks before the invasion began .
Cheney 's speech and President Bush 's address to the United Nations on Sept. 12 , 2002 , were not reviewed in advance by the Intelligence Community , according to the report .
That the administration misused and misread intelligence to fit their needs is hardly news at this point .
With the 20/20 hindsight available more than five years after the Iraq invasion , the case has been made plenty of times before .
Indeed , former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan earned himself plenty of ink last week when he went public with his belief that Bush used " propaganda " to push the war .
The Intelligence Committee 's latest report is the last phase in an effort , which began four years ago , to conclusively and comprehensively document what went wrong in the run-up to Iraq .
It takes the hard look at the intelligence flaws and failures that few were willing to take less than a year after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
 This report again demonstrates how President Bush , Vice President Cheney and others made repeated assertions about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein that were not supported by , and at times outright contradicted , the intelligence available at the time , " said Sen .
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , an Intelligence Committee member .
" The administration made the case for war in Iraq by convincing the American people that Saddam Hussein had , or was on the verge of obtaining , a nuclear weapon and that he had a relationship with al Qaeda and would provide it with weapons of mass destruction to attack the United States .
The administration used the 9/11 attacks to justify a war that has not only been waged in a country that had no connection to the attacks , but has seriously damaged our ability to fight al Qaeda .
Sadly , after years of misconduct , these findings come as no surprise .
This country is more than ready for a new administration that will be truthful with the American people .

COLERAIN TOWNSHIP , Ohio -
A southwest Ohio man who planned to be buried next his mother has found someone else already in his grave .
David L. Bingham says someone who shares his name has taken over his would - be final resting place .
He says he had n't visited his mother 's grave since 2005 and was surprised to find someone had been buried next to her in 2006 .
Bingham says the cemetery admitted its error and offered to move his mother or the other body .
The cemetery also said it would have Bingham 's cremated ashes buried in his mother 's grave .
He says none of those options works for him .
The two David Binghams are not related .
Colerain Township is about 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati .

John McCain 's longstanding political reputation is that of a political maverick , an unconventional Republican who is willing to lean across the party aisle to achieve a public policy goal .
It seems that his campaign team is trying to extend that approach online .
The McCain campaign in late May launched a new blogger outreach section on its website that encourages supporters to lobby for their candidate across 94 blogs that range in political bent from far left to far right .
The campaign arms the blog - raiders with one of McCain 's speeches on the need to transcend partisan politics to deal with the problems that the nation faces .
The strategy reinforces the central role that blogs have come to play in shaping and framing the issues in the 2008 presidential election .
The question is whether sending supporters to do grassroots lobbying in the comments section of activist blogs like DailyKos , whose membership is dedicated to defeating the Republicans in the general election , will really benefit McCain 's campaign .
" I find it hilarious that McCain 's campaign thinks that some astroturf copy - and - paste comments would do anything more than spark some vicious mocking , " says Markos Moulitsas , founder of DailyKos , which is currently highlighted as one of three " featured blogs " on McCain 's site .
On Memorial Day weekend for example , someone named " Jerry A " posted a news story in an open thread on DailyKos about McCain inviting Barack Obama to visit " post surge " Iraq .
At the time ,
Republicans had launched a publicity campaign criticizing Obama for formulating Iraq policy without having visited the country for two years .
Four minutes later , " Cultural Worker " responded : " Thank you for sharing McCain 's talking points of the day .
Again . "
Jerry tried to explain that he was just innocently posting a news article , but then another Kos user weighed in and asked why Jerry had received 23 troll ratings out of his 25 postings at the site .
Several comments later , Jerry was outed .
" Jerry A is one of the newly - recruited McCain trolls , " wrote " Sarah Lee . "
Moulitsas , DailyKos ' founder , says that Jerry is a rarity – Moulitsas has n't seen many posts lobbying for McCain on his site .
" I can't believe someone actually wasted time and donor money putting together a ' feature ' that is so guaranteed to be useless that even his supporters are ignoring it , " he says .
" Of course , it would help if their daily talking points were updated , you know , daily .
So far , this page has been up for a couple of weeks , and the talking points have n't been changed once . "
But David All , a Republican Web 2.0 consultant , and co-founder of
Slatecard , an online political action committee , defended the strategy .
He calls it " smart " and
" unique . "
" He 's got the most comprehensive blogger outreach strategy , and this is just an evolution of that , " he argues .

BEND , Ore. – Senator Barack Obama said today that a scandal from Senator John McCain ’s past – the Keating Five – was just as relevant to the presidential campaign as questions about who Mr. Obama has associated with over the years .
In a news conference here , Mr. Obama was asked whether his campaign intended to raise the banking scandal from the 1980s , which Mr. McCain has apologized for .
Every piece of every candidate ’s public record , Mr. Obama said , is “ germane to the presidency . ”
“ I was just asked previously about a whole host of issues and associations that are a lot more flimsy than John McCain ’s relationship to Keating Five , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ What I said , I ca n’t quarrel with the American people wanting to know more about that and me having to answer questions about it . ”
Mr. Obama ’s background , ranging from his longtime pastor to his friendship with former radicals from the 1960s , has been widely debated during the Democratic nominating fight .
He said he expected the same level of scrutiny would be applied to Mr. McCain .
The topic was raised briefly during a 20 - minute news conference here today .
It drew sharp criticism from the McCain campaign , with a spokesman saying : “ Apparently , Obama ’s lively calls for new politics ended today . ”
“ If Barack Obama does n’t have the strength to stand up to his own standards , how is he going to stand up for hardworking Americans ? ” said Tucker Bounds , a spokesman for Mr. McCain .
While the Democratic presidential primary is May 20 in Oregon – Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned here yesterday , former President Bill Clinton arrives tomorrow – Mr. Obama ’s two - day campaign swing here carried the feel of the opening volley of a general election campaign in a battleground state .
Mr. McCain is set to make his first trip on Monday to Oregon , a state that is being targeted by both campaigns .
As he spoke to reporters , with the Cascade Mountains in the distance , Mr. Obama sought to clarify a remark he made the other day when he suggested Mr. McCain was “ losing his bearings . ”
Was that a veiled reference to age ?
No , Mr. Obama said today .
“ His team somehow took this as an ageist comment , ” he said .
“ How that was interpreted in that fashion still is not clear to me . ”
Then , he added : “ Last I checked , people lose their bearings at every age . ”
Perhaps .
Yet it was an interesting moment , particularly considering Mr. Obama was not asked here about “ losing his bearings ” – or age .
Mr. Obama raised both topics on his own accord .

Ah , the mystery of the lie detector .
Can it really be beaten ?
George Constanza said trying to learn would be like asking Pavarotti to teach you his tricks .
Well , grab your microphone and get ready .
It ’s time for you to hit the stage .
The basics
To beat a polygraph , you first have to understand how it works .
The machine basically just monitors your body for changes .
You wear devices that measure your heart rate , blood pressure , and breathing .
An administrator asks you a series of questions , starting with “ controls . ”
These are used to figure your body ’s baseline reaction when you are n’t hiding anything .
He ’ll mix these in with the “ relevants , ” or questions related to the actual investigation .
Understanding the difference is the most important step in learning to beat the machine .
Controlling the controls
A control will ask you something general that ’s unrelated to the matter at hand .
It ’ll be broadly focused and often about a subject that causes discomfort .
For example , have you ever lied to a loved one ?
Have you ever cheated on an exam , or stolen from an employer ?
The real key to beating the lie detector is controlling your reaction to these controls .
You need to produce a stronger physiological response to these questions than to the actual relevant ones .
Here ’s how :
Maintain a calm and regular breathing rate .
You want to be hitting about 15 to 30 shallow breaths in and out per minute , so about three seconds per inhale or exhale .
When you recognize a control , immediately change that rate .
The easiest way is to hold your breath once , for five seconds , after exhaling .
At the same time , increase your heart rate and blood pressure .
You can do this by performing mental arithmetic — doing complex division in your head , trying to count backwards by sevens — or by biting slowly on the side of your tongue , hard enough to produce moderate pain .
Either will work , but make sure you ’ve practiced plenty so it ’s not noticeable .
Relaxing on the relevants
The second part of the equation happens with the relevant questions — the ones actually going after the information they need .
All you have to do when faced with these is maintain the calm and regular breathing rate you learned , and remember that you are in control .
Even if your body produces a slight nervous response , it wo n’t be nearly as high as the excited response you created .
Passing the other tests
So you ’ve mastered the polygraph itself .
Now you just to make sure you pass the other subtle tests that start the minute you walk in the door .
Your administrator will be watching your every move , and it ’s not just the machine that can lead you to trouble .
Make no admissions .
Regardless of what the polygraph shows , everything you say is being recorded .
Do n’t say anything you ’ll regret .
Keep your answers short .
Administrators are trained to watch for extra words and rambling replies .
Stick to simple yes - no answers as often as possible .
When answering questions , stay still .
Do n’t change positions or shake your head , and do n’t hesitate before speaking .
Remember that you ’re always being watched .
Do n’t do anything that could raise suspicion .
Even if you ’re in a room alone — bathroom included — odds are they ’re taking notes .
George Costanza said it best :
It ’s not a lie if you believe it .
Take these tips to heart and practice them until they become second nature .
Then you too will have what it takes to beat a lie detector .
This chart shows the Case Shiller home price index in US Dollars and in grams of gold .
Both indices use the price of a home in January , 2000 as 100 .
Prices in gold and dollars tracked pretty well until 2001 , when the dollar began to collapse , taking the true value of homes down with it .
At first , the drop in the dollar simply offset the apparent rise in home prices , and prices in gold worked sideways until 2006 .
But when home prices began to fall in dollar terms , and dollars were themselves falling in value , the double - whammy pushed true home prices down to levels not seen since the late 1980s .
In fact , they set a new record , the lowest level since the index was first published .
This means that most homes purchased in the last 20 years are now worth less than the original purchase price , even if they show gains of 100 % , 200 % , or more , in dollar terms .
You should also notice that the most recent uptick in dollar prices is more than offset by the decline in the value of the dollar , the unavoidable side - effect of government bailouts and interest rate price fixing by the Fed .
The next chart shows a synthetic index built from several different sets of home price data complied by Shiller for his book Irrational Exuberance .
Looking back to 1890 , we can see that home prices today are similar to those of the Great Depression , and not far above their all - time lows .
The final chart shows the median price of a new home in the US , both in dollars and gold grams .
This is a log chart , necessary to encompass the huge increase in USD prices since the 1960s .
Prices today ( in gold ) are about the same as they were in the 1980s , and far below their peaks in the 1960s and early 2000s .

Appeals court allows extension of Wisconsin 's absentee ballot deadlines
An appeals court allowed extended deadlines for absentee ballots to go into effect Wednesday , finding Republicans did n't have the authority to challenge them .

BBC News , Johannesburg
" Stu " escaped from Zimbabwe in January , crossing the border for the sanctuary of South Africa .
Alexandra township has seen a spate of attacks on migrants Now - fearing for his life - he 's trying to flee back , after a wave of xenophobic violence targeting immigrants in townships around Johannesburg .
" I ran away from the situation in Zimbabwe to try to support my family , " says the 24 - year old , who is too afraid to give his full name .
" But it 's better to starve at home than to die here .
At least , if I 'm back in Zimbabwe , my parents can bury me and see my grave . "
The mob came for him in the sprawling Johannesburg township of Alexandra on Monday night .
" They forced their way into my home with weapons , hammers and bricks .
And they took everything I 've got .
The only things I have left are the clothes that I 'm wearing .
I do n't even know how I 'll get home . "
" Stu " and hundreds of other foreigners - Zimbabweans , Mozambicans and Malawians - are now sheltering in tents provided for them by the Red Cross on the grounds of Alexandra 's police station .
It was at 21.30 on Wednesday night when a group of people attacked Arlindo Nhantumbo , a Mozambican who has lived happily in South Africa for 12 years .
" Ten of them came , with guns , and told me to leave the country .
I do n't know what to do , because I have married a South African and we have a five - month - old baby boy , " he says .
" I am desperate . "
A flood of refugees
No one has exact figures of the number of immigrants now living in South Africa , but the Institute of Race Relations believes that there are between 3 and 5 million - equivalent to the country 's entire white population .
And they have become scapegoats for many of South Africa 's social ills - high levels of unemployment , a shortage of housing and one of the worst crime rates in the world .
Remember the horror from which we come from
Nelson Mandela
In pictures : S Africa 's xenophobia Migrants tell of township tensions
There has been a spate of xenophobic attacks over the past few years .
In 2005 and 2006 , Somalis living in the Eastern and Western Cape were targeted .
But the latest wave of anti-foreigner attacks has caused growing concern in the " rainbow nation " which still bears the scars of apartheid , and where some of the country 's poor are worse off than they were before the transition to majority rule .
" Violence is not a solution , " says Mbuto Mthembu of the Red Cross , which is providing blankets , clothing and food to the refugees .
" We have seen it before in this country and we know just how ugly it is .
We do n't want to see that again . "
' Sorry '
And fears of the trouble spreading have prompted intervention from Nelson Mandela .
" Remember the horror from which we come from " he urged South Africans this week .
" Never forget the greatness of a nation that has overcome its divisions .
Let us never descend into destructive divisiveness . "
Many South Africans are ashamed at the treatment of migrants
His former wife , Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , has also apologised to the victims , during a visit to Alexandra by senior ANC and government officials .
" We are sorry , " she said .
" It is not South African to do this . "
And in the narrow dusty paths between Alexandra 's corrugated - roof shacks - where competition for jobs and housing is fierce - there is sympathy , among many , for the immigrants .
" We are ashamed , " says 71 - year old Sonny Mokoena .
" I was born here and have lived in Alexandra all my life and have never seen anything like this .
These people , who fled violence in their countries , are now fleeing again - some with small kids .
It 's not right . "
But the violence has already spread .
' Appalling '
On Wednesday , immigrants who escaped Alexandra to stay with friends and relatives in the township of Diepsloot , near Pretoria , were attacked again and their homes looted .
By Thursday , police had sealed off parts of Diepsloot to try to restore order , using armoured personnel carriers - a reminder of policing in the darkest days of apartheid .
The anti-foreigner violence has spread to Diepsloot " It started with attacks on the people who fled Alexandra , " says John Makola , chairperson of the Diepsloot Community Police Forum .
" But today they are chasing every foreigner here , accusing them of being criminals or stealing their jobs .
It 's appalling . "
Papi , 29 , standing near barricades blocking the road on the edge of Diepsloot , also condemned the violence .
But he , like many other South Africans , blames immigrants for compounding the country 's crime problem .
" There are so many robberies and rapes here and people suspect the immigrants , " he says .
" So people do n't feel safe in their own country . "
Ntokozo Msebeni , who came to South Africa from Zimbabwe in 2006 , does not feel safe anywhere now .
" A mob came and beat us up and stole our ID cards and our money , " she says .
" I have a small child and I have nothing left and do n't know what to do . "

A map of the 100 explosions observed since late 2005 .
Not so long ago , anyone claiming to see flashes of light on the Moon would be viewed with deep suspicion by professional astronomers .
Such reports were filed under " L " ... for lunatic .
Not anymore .
Over the past two and a half years , NASA astronomers have observed the Moon flashing at them not just once but one hundred times .
" They 're explosions caused by meteoroids hitting the Moon , " explains Bill Cooke , head of NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) .
" A typical blast is about as powerful as a few hundred pounds of TNT and can be photographed easily using a backyard telescope . "
As an example , he offers this video of an impact near crater Gauss on January 4 , 2008 .
The impactor was a tiny fragment of extinct comet 2003 EH1 .
Every year in early January , the Earth - Moon system passes through a stream of debris from that comet , producing the well - known Quadrantid meteor shower .
Here on Earth , Quadrantids disintegrate as flashes of light in the atmosphere ; on the airless Moon they hit the ground and explode .
" We started our monitoring program in late 2005 after NASA announced plans to return astronauts to the Moon , " says team leader Rob Suggs of the MSFC .
If people were going to be walking around up there , " it seemed like a good idea to measure how often the Moon was getting hit . "
" Almost immediately , we detected a flash . "
That first detection — " I 'll never forget it , " he says -- came on Nov. 7 , 2005 , when a piece of Comet Encke about the size of a baseball hit Mare Imbrium .
The resulting explosion produced a 7th magnitude flash , too dim for the naked eye but an easy target for the team 's 10 - inch telescope .
A common question , says Cooke , is " how can something explode on the Moon ?
There 's no oxygen up there . "
These explosions do n't require oxygen or combustion .
Meteoroids hit the moon with tremendous kinetic energy , traveling 30,000 mph or faster .
" At that speed , even a pebble can blast a crater several feet wide .
The impact heats up rocks and soil on the lunar surface hot enough to glow like molten lava -- hence the flash . "
During meteor showers such as the Quadrantids or Perseids , when the Moon passes through dense streams of cometary debris , the rate of lunar flashes can go as high as one per hour .
Impacts subside when the Moon exits the stream , but curiously the rate never goes to zero .
" Even when no meteor shower is active , we still see flashes , " says Cooke .
These " off - shower " impacts come from a vast swarm of natural space junk littering the inner solar system .
Bits of stray comet dust and chips off old asteroids pepper the Moon in small but ultimately significant numbers .
Earth gets hit , too , which is why on any given night you can stand under a dark sky and see a few meteors per hour glide overhead — no meteor shower required .
Over the course of a year , these random or " sporadic " impacts outnumber impacts from organized meteor showers by a ratio of approximately 2:1 .
" That 's an important finding , " says Suggs .
" It means there 's no time of year when the Moon is impact - free . "
Fortunately , says Cooke , astronauts are in little danger .
" The odds of a direct hit are negligible .
If , however , we start building big lunar outposts with lots of surface area , we 'll have to carefully consider these statistics and bear in mind the odds of a structure getting hit . "
Secondary impacts are the greater concern .
When meteoroids strike the Moon , debris goes flying in all directions .
A single meteoroid produces a spray consisting of thousands of " secondary " particles all traveling at bullet - like velocities .
This could be a problem because , while the odds of a direct hit are low , the odds of a secondary hit may be significantly greater .
" Secondary particles smaller than a millimeter could pierce a spacesuit , " notes Cooke .
At present , no one knows how far and wide secondary particles travel .
To get a handle on the problem , Cooke , Suggs and colleagues are shooting artificial meteoroids at simulated moon dust and measuring the spray .
This work is being done at the Vertical Gun Range at NASA 's Ames Research Center in Mountain View , CA .
Meanwhile , back at the observatory , the team has upgraded their original 10 - inch ( 25 cm ) telescope to a pair of telescopes , one 14 - inch ( 36 cm ) and one 20 - inch ( 51 cm ) , located at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
They 've also established a new observing site in Georgia with a 14 - inch telescope .
Multiple telescopes allow double - and triple - checking of faint flashes and improve the statistical underpinnings of the survey .
" The Moon is still flashing , " says Suggs .
Indeed , during the writing of this story , three more impacts were detected .

Beef Up a Little PC
Turn the dirt - cheap , hardcover - size Eee PC into a speedy beast that can run any program or OS
The BBC has unveiled a new - look BBC iPlayer which fully integrates radio and TV in one interface .
The new - look service , which launches in beta tomorrow ( 26 June ) , will “ dual run ” alongside the existing iPlayer for the next few weeks .
Erik Huggers , the BBC ’s group controller for future media and technology , explains : “ The next generation of BBC iPlayer allows UK licence fee payers to catch up on their favourite BBC TV and radio programmes in one place – a completely unique on - demand service ” .
“ Audiences are now able to experience the full range of BBC content – some 250 TV programmes currently available each week as well as all the BBC radio networks – in a new and more accessible way , and all for free .
“ On - demand radio from the BBC has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched in 2002 , with around 600 million hours listened to via streaming or the ‘ listen again ’ function . ”
“ The full integration with iPlayer is a natural evolution for the audio service and an exciting step for audiences . ”
i Player users can now choose to either listen again to BBC Radio from the last 7 days or listen live – while the option of a pop - out player allows users to continue listening as they browse other web pages .
The Listen again tool also allows users to rewind and fast forward in the same way that they can for TV programmes .
Other key enhancements include combined TV and radio categories such as comedy and drama , a larger playback screen to watch TV programmes and a TV schedule that allows users to plan their viewing over the coming days .
The new - look BBC iPlayer will be available on other platforms for TV catch - up , including the Apple iPhone and iPod touch , and the Nintendo Wii .
Relatives ' fury as BBC pays expenses to Holocaust denier who ' pestered bereaved families after the 7/7 bombing '
Conspiracy theorist : Nicholas Kollerstrom , who believes 7/7 was a set - up by the intelligence services , was interviewed for a BBC programme
The BBC was under attack last night for paying expenses to a disgraced academic who says the 7/7 London bombings may have been an intelligence agency conspiracy .
Families of victims denounced the move as appalling .
As part of his ' research ' , Nicholas Kollerstrom rang one father to discuss whether his daughter 's body had been planted at the site of the Tavistock Square bus bombing .
Dr Kollerstrom , 61 , who also denies the Holocaust , is due to appear in a programme in the BBC's Conspiracy Files series .
His theory is that the Al - Qaeda inspired bombers were ' innocent patsies ' , set up by elements of the Israeli , British and U.S. security agencies .
The BBC has admitted paying Dr Kollerstrom expenses , including the fare from London to Luton , where bombers Mohammed Sidique Khan , Shehzad Tanweer , Jermaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain caught a train to King 's Cross before the 2005 attacks which killed 52 innocent people .
The corporation 's move has astonished the families of those who died or were injured .
' For the BBC to actually fund somebody like this is totally disgraceful , ' said John Taylor , whose 24 - year - old daughter Carrie was one of seven killed by Tanweer .
' He is helping the terrorists more than anything and I am not happy with the BBC giving him a platform . '
Sean Cassidy , whose son Ciaran , 22 , died in the Russell Square blast , said : ' It is appalling .
The families are aware of this man and are trying to avoid him .
He has caused a lot of upset . '

The scene at Tavistock Square after the bus exploded .
Mr Kollestrom believes the bombing was a conspiracy
Last month Dr Kollerstorm , an astronomer and historian , was stripped of an honorary research fellowship at University College London after it emerged he had written a paper entitled The Auschwitz ' Gas Chamber ' Illusion on a Far - Right website .
He claimed the Nazi concentration camp was like a holiday complex where inmates could sunbathe beside a swimming pool and watch water polo matches .
The BBC defended its use of Dr Kollerstrom and stressed it only paid expenses such as the £ 8 train fare to Luton , where he filmed an interview for the programme .
A spokesman said : ' The Conspiracy Files series investigates whether there is any truth to the many conspiracy theories which have grown up around terrorist attacks .
' Nick Kollerstrom has advanced a number of theories which will be investigated in detail by the BBC .
His view of the Holocaust will be scrutinised in the programme .
He has not been paid by the BBC . '
Dr Kollerstrom admitted phoning the family of one victim but said he had not wished to cause offence .
He said he was researching ' anomalies ' highlighted in a newspaper article which suggested the father believed his daughter 's body had been planted .
He added : ' The last thing I want to do is cause grief to a family .
But they did go public and I thought they would n't mind someone querying them about public statements they made . '
THE 2008 HURRICANE SEASON THE 2008 HURRICANE SEASON
Storm names , dates : 2008 tropical storms and hurricanes Federal forecasters expect busy Atlantic hurricane season Colorado State forecasters predict ' pretty active ' hurricane season Hurricane high - risk areas have lost residents
After decades of breakneck growth in high - risk areas , the summer hurricane season is starting with fewer Americans in harm 's way .
The number of people who live in coastal areas that are most vulnerable to wind and water has fallen slightly since 2000 , reversing a boom that brought tens of thousands of homes and high - rises to low - lying regions from Texas to Georgia , a USA TODAY analysis shows .
About 2.1 million people live full - time in those areas , down less than 1 % over the past eight years .
That does n't mean Americans are thinking twice about living in vulnerable spots , says Robert Hartwig , president of the Insurance Information Institute .
Instead , he says , the slowdown is more likely a result of a housing market crunch that 's left some homes vacant — and others half - built — in once fast - growing parts of the South .
" Memories are short , and when the economy does recover , you 'll see people snap up those properties in coastal areas again , " Hartwig says .
The steepest population losses were in the coastal parishes of Louisiana , flattened nearly three years ago by Hurricane Katrina .
In St. Bernard Parish , La. , a flat expanse outside New Orleans surrounded by swamps and the sea , the number of residents in the highest - risk neighborhoods dropped by two - thirds since 2000 .
Part of the reason may be that it is simply more difficult to move to those areas .
Across the Gulf Coast , the areas most vulnerable to hurricanes also suffered the worst damage in the 2005 storms .
As a result , rebuilding there has been a longer , more complex task than in other places , says Greg Rigamer , head of the New Orleans planning firm GCR & Associates , which has tracked the region 's recovery .
Other parts of the coast , including stretches of Texas and the Florida Keys , also lost full - time residents over that period , though the declines were not as big .
" Saying building on the coast is inherently bad is oversimplifying , but you have to manage the risks , " says Florida Emergency Management Director Craig Fugate .
" I think we 're realizing now that the way we had been doing things is n't really sustainable . "
Those high - risk areas — often coveted spots close to the beach — boomed during the 1990s and previous decades as a flood of Americans headed south and developers rushed to build homes to accommodate them .
But that rapid growth slowed , and in some places reversed , over the past eight years .
Even excluding places hit by Katrina , high - risk areas grew only about 6 % , about half the rate of safer places farther inland , the analysis found .
USA TODAY based its analysis on an assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the danger coastal areas would face from wind , flooding and storm surge if a hurricane hits .
Mid-Atlantic states , also at risk , were not included .
A government forecast predicted that this summer 's storm season , which begins Sunday , is likely to be more active than normal , producing as many as nine hurricanes in the Atlantic basin .
The forecasters did not say how many of those storms might strike the U.S. coast , which has not faced a significant hurricane since an onslaught of storms hit Florida and the Gulf Coast in 2004 and 2005 .
Despite the slowdown , some vulnerable areas still grew rapidly .
In Lee County , around Fort Myers , Fla. , more than 42,000 people moved to areas at the highest risk from hurricanes .
The county has tried to limit building in some of those places , but it has not been able to overcome the tug of ocean views that brought so many people there in the first place , says the county 's public safety director , John Wilson .
So many people have moved in that getting them out in an emergency " is going to be a challenge , " Wilson says .
" We 're looking at different options .
And we 're recognizing that we may not be able to get everybody out of harm 's way . "
Enlarge By Michael Madrid , USA TODAY Fetid floodwaters surround a home in St. Bernard 's Parish , La. , a week after Hurricane Katrina devastated the area .
In this eastern Louisiana parish , the number of people living in the highest - risk neighborhoods has dropped by two - thirds since 2000 .

Street Fighter 4 Footage Has 4 Minutes of Gameplay
Nearly four minutes of in - game Street Fighter IV footage , complete with awesome voice - over work , should more than make up for yesterday 's gameplay - less " art trailer . "
Simply amazing .
Yet another moron has come out of the woodwork to jump on the " games are evil " train and share his myopic , frightened views with the world .
The real kicker here is that he suggests having a " game burning " without the slightest trace of irony .
Rev. Richard Patrick had this to say , blaming entertainment for crime , rather than , y'know , criminals :
We are considering having something similar to a rally where parents and children can bring CDs and video games that they consider are destructive to the mind set of our youth and have a burning , just like they had a gun buyback last year ...
Young people are being influenced by what they see and what they hear .
They are being influenced by television ... television and videos are telling young people a vision but something that 's not reality ... [ Violent media ] has a tremendous influence on young people and violence .
That 's basically all they see .
Most of them try to emulate what they see , when in reality , the people they see do n't even live in those communities .
Some of the rappers they see on TV portraying crime do n't live in the urban areas — they live in the suburbs somewhere .
It 's all a facade .
Preach on , Reverend !
I 'll be sure to hold my tongue when you convince children to burn their videogames because they 're being " influenced " by them , not that you'd be doing anything like that , right ?
Hypocrite .
It 's just scary that the word " burning " can be casually tossed around like that , as if it 's completely natural and not at all mental .
Society really has n't traveled far from the days when books were scary to crowds of clucking morons , no matter how much we think we 've evolved as a species .
Last year , Facebook itself began facilitating professional networking with the introduction of “ pages ” ( profiles for businesses or professionals that other Facebook users can become “ fans ” of and receive updates about ) .
“ When somebody joins your group on Facebook , they ’re much more likely to be receptive to your message , ” said Dustin Luther of Calabasas , Calif. , who leads real estate seminars for sales agents and is the founder of the popular Seattle blog RainCityGuide.com .
“ My last seminar , a group of us all went out to dinner and we were able to post photos and videos .
It kind of keeps everybody engaged in what you ’re doing in an informal way . ”
Yes , plenty of people think social - networking sites are incompatible with the formality of the workplace .
Those who professionally network on Facebook and MySpace respond that all business is personal , and that it ’s the informality of the social sites that makes them useful .
Leila Hebden , who said that when she began her career in music management she could not have lived without networking on MySpace , likes the site ’s casualness and lack of hierarchy .
Music industry executives have long seen the advantage of scouring social - networking sites to find new talent , make professional connections and promote their work .
One could argue that most other industries are simply coming late to the party .
Still , Ms. Hebden said , if she were in serious economic trouble , MySpace would not be a life raft .
“ In the face of ‘ upheaval , ’ ” she said in an e-mail message , “ I still think 9 out of 10 people would drag their contacts list out of their Outlook work e-mail than turn to their MySpace community . ”
Or not .
When Ryan Kuder , 34 , of San Jose , Calif. , was among the hundreds of people laid off from Yahoo in February , he gave a real - time play - by - play of what it was like by using Twitter , a service that enables subscribers to electronically ( and almost instantaneously ) broadcast what they ’re doing .
“ The H.R. guy is on his way over to confiscate my laptop , ” Mr. Kuder wrote .
To network with other Yahoos , as employees call themselves , he also created a Facebook group : “ I Worked at Yahoo ! Until Today . ”
Pi is mysterious .
Sure , you “ know ” it ’s about 3.14159 because you read it in some book .
But what if you had no textbooks , no computers , and no calculus ( egads ! ) — just your brain and a piece of paper .
Could you find pi ?
Archimedes found pi to 99.9 % accuracy 2000 years ago — without decimal points or even the number zero !
Even better , he devised techniques that became the foundations of calculus .
I wish I learned his discovery of pi in school — it helps us understand what makes calculus tick .
How do we find pi ?
Pi is the circumference of a circle with diameter 1 .
How do we get that number ?
Say pi = 3 and call it a day .
Draw a circle with a steady hand , wrap it with string , and measure with your finest ruler .
Use door # 3
What ’s behind door # 3 ?
Math !
How did Archimedes do it ?
Archimedes did n’t know the circumference of a circle .
But he did n’t fret , and started with what he did know : the perimeter of a square .
( He actually used hexagons , but squares are easier to work with and draw , so let ’s go with that , ok ? ) .
We do n’t know a circle ’s circumference , but for kicks let ’s draw it between two squares :
Neat — it ’s like a racetrack with inner and outer edges .
Whatever the circumference is , it ’s somewhere between the perimeters of the squares : more than the inside , less than the outside .
And since squares are , well , square , we find their perimeters easily :
Outside square ( easy ) : side = 1 , therefore perimeter = 4
Inside square ( not so easy ) :
The diagonal is 1 ( top - to - bottom ) .
Using the Pythagorean theorem , side2 + side2 = 1 , therefore side = $ \sqrt { 1/2} $ or side = .7 . The perimeter is then .7 * 4 = 2.8 .
We may not know where pi is , but that critter is scurrying between 2.8 and 4 .
Let ’s say it ’s halfway between , or pi = 3.4 .
Squares drool , octagons rule
We estimated pi = 3.4 , but honestly we ’d be better off with the ruler and string .
What makes our guess so bad ?
Squares are clunky .
They do n’t match the circle well , and the gaps make for a loose , error - filled calculation .
But , increasing the sides ( using the mythical octagon , perhaps ) might give us a tighter fit and a better guess ( image credit ) :
Cool !
As we yank up the sides , we get closer to the shape of a circle .
So , what ’s the perimeter of an octagon ?
I ’m not sure if I learned that formula .
While we ’re at it , we could use a 16 - side - a - gon and a 32 - do - decker for better guesses .
What are their perimeters again ?
Crickey , those are tough questions .
Luckily , Archimedes used creative trigonometry to devise formulas for the perimeter of shape when you double the number of sides :
Inside perimeter :
One segment of the inside ( such as the side of a square ) is sin( x / 2 ) , where x is the angle spanning a side .
For example , one side of the inside square is sin( 90/ 2 ) = sin( 45 ) ~ .7 .
The full perimeter is then 4 * .7 = 2.8 , as we had before .
Outside perimeter : One segment of the outside is tan ( x / 2 ) , where x is the angle spanning one side .
So , one segment of the outside perimeter is tan ( 45 ) = 1 , for a total perimeter of 4 .
Neat — we have a simple formula !
Adding more sides makes the angle smaller :
Squares have an inside perimeter of 4 * sin( 90/2 ) .
Octogons have eight 45 - degree angles , for an inside perimeter of 8 * sin( 45/2 ) .
Try it out — a square ( sides=4 ) has 91 % accuracy , and with an octagon ( sides=8 ) we jump to 98 % !
But there ’s a problem : Archimedes did n’t have a calculator with a “ sin ” button !
Instead , he used trig identities to rewrite sin and tan in terms of their previous values :
New outside perimeter [ harmonic mean ]
New inside perimeter [ geometric mean ]
These formulas just use arithmetic — no trig required .
Since we started with known numbers like $ \sqrt{2} $ and 1 , we can repeatedly apply this formula to increase the number of sides and get a better guess for pi .
By the way , those special means show up in strange places , do n’t they ?
I do n’t have a nice intuitive grasp of the trig identities involved , so we ’ll save that battle for another day .
Cranking the formula
Starting with 4 sides ( a square ) , we make our way to a better pi ( download the spreadsheet ) :
Every round , we double the sides ( 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 ) and shrink the range where pi could be hiding .
Let ’s assume pi is halfway between the inside and outside boundaries .
After 3 steps ( 32 sides ) we already have 99.9 % accuracy .
After 7 steps ( 512 sides ) we have the lauded “ five nines ” .
And after 17 steps , or half a million sides , our guess for pi reaches Excel ’s accuracy limit .
Not a bad technique , Archimedes !
Unfortunately , decimals had n’t been invented in 250 BC , let alone spreadsheets .
So Archimedes had to slave away with these formulas using fractions .
He began with hexagons ( 6 sides ) and continued 12 , 24 , 48 , 96 until he ’d had enough ( ever try to take a square root using fractions alone ? ) .
His final estimate for pi , using a shape with 96 sides , was :
The midpoint puts pi at 3.14185 , which is over 99.9 % accurate .
Not too shabby !
If you enjoy fractions , the mysteriously symmetrical 355/113 is an extremely accurate ( 99.99999 % ) estimate of pi and was the best humanity had for nearly a millennium .
Some people use 22/7 for pi , but now you can chuckle “ Good grief , 22/7 is merely the upper bound found by Archimedes 2000 years ago ! ” while adjusting your monocle .
There ’s even better formulas out there too .
Where ’s the Calculus ?
Archimedes was n’t “ doing calculus ” but he laid the groundwork for its development : start with a crude model ( square mimicking a circle ) and refine it .
Calculus revolves around these themes :
We do n’t know the answer , but we ’ve got a guess .
We had a guess for pi : somewhere between 2.8 and 4 .
Calculus has many concepts such as Taylor Series to build a guess with varying degrees of accuracy .

Let ’s make our guess better .
Archimedes discovered that adding sides made a better estimate .
There are numerical methods to refine a formula again and again .
For example , computers can start with a rough guess for the square root and make it better ( faster than finding the closest answer from the outset ) .

You can run but not hide .
We did n’t know exactly where pi was , but trapped it between two boundaries .
As we tightened up the outside limits ( pun intended ) , we knew pi was hiding somewhere inside .
This is formally known as the Squeeze Theorem .

Pi is an unreachable ideal .
Finding pi is a process that never ends .
When we see π it really means " You want perfection ?
That 's nice -- everyone wants something .
Just start cranking away and stop when pi is good enough . " .
I ’ll say it again : Good enough is good enough .
A shape with 96 sides was accurate enough for anything Archimedes needed to build .
The idea that “ close counts ” is weird — should n’t math be precise ?
Math is a model to describe the world .
Our equations do n’t need to be razor - sharp if the universe and our instruments are fuzzy .
Life Lessons
Even math can have life lessons hidden inside .
Sometimes the best is the enemy of the good .
Perfectionism ( “ I need the exact value of pi ! ” ) can impede finding good , usable results .
Whether making estimates or writing software , perhaps you can start with a rough version and improve it over time , without fretting about the perfect model ( it worked for Archimedes ! ) .
Most of the accuracy may come from the initial stages , and future refinements may be a lot of work for little gain ( the Pareto Principle in action ) .
Ironically , the “ crude ” techniques seen here led to calculus , which in turn led to better formulas for pi .
Math Lessons
Calculus often lacks an intuitive grounding — we can count apples to test arithmetic , but it ’s hard to think about abstract equations that are repeatedly refined .
Archimedes ’ discovery of pi is a vivid , concrete example for our toolbox .
Just like geometry refines our intuition about lines and angles , calculus defines the rules about equations that get better over time .
Examples like this help use intuition as a starting point , instead of learning new ideas in a vacuum .
Later , we ’ll discuss what it means for numbers to be “ close enough ” .
Just remember that 96 sides was good enough for Archimedes , and half a million sides is good enough for Excel .
We ’ve all got our limits .

A Newly Discovered Solar System Contains Scaled - Down Versions of Saturn and Jupiter
Finding means solar systems like ours may be common throughout the galaxy
Scientists have discovered a solar system with scaled - down versions of Saturn and Jupiter .
February 14 , 2008

A team of international astronomers reports in the Feb. 15 issue of Science the discovery of a solar system nearly 5,000 light years away containing scaled - down versions of Jupiter and Saturn .
Their findings suggest that our galaxy could conceivably contain many star systems similar to our own .
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) sponsored the research .
" NSF is delighted to have played a role in enabling such an exciting discovery , " said Michael Briley , a program manager in NSF 's Division of Astronomical Sciences .
" One of the outstanding questions has been whether or not planetary systems like ours are common , and it appears they may well be . "
The new solar system appears to be a smaller analog of our own .
One of its planets has 70 percent of Jupiter 's mass and another has 90 percent of Saturn 's mass .
The sun they orbit has about 50 percent the mass of the sun .
Although the star is much dimmer than our sun , temperatures at both planets are likely to be similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn because they are closer to their star .
" The fascinating part is that if we ' scale ' everything to the mass and brightness of the parent star , the masses of these planets relative to their star , and the amount of sunlight they receive , [ the planets ] are close to our own Jupiter and Saturn , " said lead author Scott Gaudi , assistant professor of astronomy at Ohio State University .
" So what we 've found is a solar system analog , or a ' scaled solar system . ' "
The two planets were revealed when the star they orbit crossed in front of a more distant star being observed from Earth .
For a two - week period from late March through early April of 2006 , the nearer star magnified the light shining from the farther star .
The phenomenon is called gravitational microlensing -- in this case , the light from the more distant star was magnified 500 times .
The gravitational microlensing technique is based on a concept first discussed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century .
When astronomers observe a star , the light waves generally travel straight from the star to the telescope ; however , if another star passes in between , even if great distances separate the two , the gravity of the nearer object acts like a lens and magnifies the incoming light .
Telescopes cannot resolve the details of the magnified image , but they do notice a peak in light intensity -- and when a planet is present around the closer star , the planet 's gravity adds a small peak of its own .
Astronomers can use this occurrence to determine how large the planet is and how far away it is from its star .
" This is the first case in which a Jupiter - mass planet was detected [ where ] we had significant sensitivity to additional planets , " Gaudi said .
" You could call it luck , but I think it might just mean that these systems are common throughout our galaxy . "

1900
Novecento
Italy , 1976 Epic ( 300 mins ) about the lives of two friends , a landowner 's son , Alfredo Berlinghieri ( Paolo Pavesi , later Robert de Niro ) and a peasant 's , Olmo Dalcò ( Roberto Maccanti , later Gerard Depardieu ) , both born on January 1 , 1900 in Emilio , Italy
In an early scene in a silkworm farm , Olmo ( Maccanti ) has taken his wet clothes off and retracts his foreeskin .
Alfredo ( Pavesi ) :
That must hurt a lot .
Olmo :
Why should it hurt ?
Alfredo :
The skin 's all back .
Olmo :
Let 's see if yours is any different .
( Alfredo pulls out his . )
Looks just like a cocoon .
Pull the skin back and look just like mine .
Alfredo :
It wo n't go .
Olmo :
Well pull harder .
Alfredo : Oh , it burns !
Olmo :
Ah , it burns because you 're not courageous , and you 're not a socialist !
Years later Alfredo ( de Niro ) hires a woman for them both .
As they undress , Olmo ( Depardieu ) pulls on his foreskin , and again as they both become uncomfortable at the prospect of sexual activity together .
In bed hey are both naked with the woman between them , and both men have exposed glandes .
De Niro is visibly cut .
In his voice - over , Bertolucci says an overarching theme was the two men as two sides of the same coin .
He wanted a Russian and an America to play the leads , but the USSR would not cooperate , so he made do with the French Depardieu .
He saw the first scene as adolescent exploration , and the second as being about the unbridgable gap between the two men .
The second scene may have no connection with the first , and the men 's circumcision status may have been unimportant to him .
3 Needles
Canada , 2006 Grim dramas about the intersection between HIV / AIDS , greed , poverty , money and blood .
In a prologue and three unconnected parts set in China , Canada and Africa ; the prologue is a flashforward to the middle of the third part .
( There is a version in which the three parts are intercut together . )
In the prologue , Bongile ( Siv Mbelu ) is one of a group of Xhosa initiates in coastal South Africa ( near a spectacular waterfall ) who are ritually circumcised as part of their rite of passage to manhood .
The actual circumcisions are heard but not shown .
We see the youths coat each other 's bodies in mud , and lined up , the circumcisor ( Mbutuma Gubo ) raises the knife , chops , and says " Now you are a man " to which they respond " Now I am a man " as a blanket is put over them .
There are quick shots of the bloody knife and the pile of foreskins .
The voice - over ( Olympia Dukakis ) says how washing the mud off afterward makes them feel as if they have grown a new skin .
In the third part , a novice nun ( Choloe Sevigny ) says of a man who has raped a small child in the belief that having sex with a virgin will cure him of AIDS , " I think he should be circumcised below the belly button . "
There is a suggestion that poverty caused one of the intitiates , Bongile 's brother Huku ( Anele Solwandle ) , to delay his initiation until after he was old enough to have had sex , and so his blood infected the others .
Circumcision is shown as the cause , not a prevention of HIV infection .
28 Days
US , 2000 A comedy with a theme about the jargon and uplifting twaddle of rehabilitation .
A young woman ( Sandra Bullock ) is spending 28 days in a rehabilitation centre .
While eating , a woman finds an eyelash she lost and says everyone must make a wish .
Roshanda ( Marianne Jean- Baptiste ) : Custody of my children .
Gerhardt ( Alan Tudyk ) : Sobriety .
Roshanda :
Oh come on , baby , we all want that .
Gerhardt : My foreskin back .
No one asked before they took it ; they just took it .
They had no right to take it .
The others snicker .
Oliver ( Mike O'Malley ) :
Way to share , Gerhardt , way to share .
The others laugh .
Gerhardt is a figure of fun .
He is gay , self - absorbed and confused .
Earlier , at a therapy session he launched into a monologue about a fork in the road and trailed off into talking about ladles .
Later , told he can look for a partner when he can keep a plant alive , he talks to the plant , sketches it - everything except water it - then blames the seller when it dies .
The underlying message is that only such a hopeless person could mind being circumcised .
Coming right after " We all want that " the line 's message is that Gerhard has picked something nobody ( in his right mind ) could possibly want .
Above the Rim
US , 1994 Crime / drama about a promising high scchool basketball star and his relationship with two brothers .
Kyle ( Duane Martin ) and Bugaloo ( Marlon Wayans ) are walking when Kyle stops in an alley to urinate .
Bugaloo sneaks a peak at Kyle 's penis .
Bugaloo : Damn , gee , I did n't know you was uncircumcised .
Yo ' dick like a anteater !
( Laughs .
Kyle turns away )
But it 's so big .
What , you been liftin ' weights wit yo' dang dang ?
That big ol ' dick .
Kyle : No , I been liftin ' yo ' moms with my dick .
Shut the fuck up , man .
Kyle has probably heard the old " anteater " gibe many times .
Alex and Eve
Australia , 2015 Comedy about a multi-cultural romance between a young Greek teacher ( Richard Brancatisano ) and a Lebanese Muslim woman lawyer ( Andrea Demetriades ) .
The Greek parents , George ( Tony Nikolakopoulos ) and Chloe ( Zoe Carides ) are discussing the possibility of their son's marraige and how the religious question would play out : Chloe :
She 's the Muslim , he 's the Orthodox .
George :
It does n't work that way , love .
And the grandchildren ?
Would they be Muslim ?
Chloe :
Not if it 's a boy !
George :
What about his little willy ?
They circumcise !
( The mother looks pained )
There is no further discussion and the topic is n't raised again .
The romantic couple seem secular so it may be a non-issue .
American History X
US , 1998 Derek Vinyard ( Edward Norton ) and his kid brother , Danny ( Edward Furlong ) , racist skinheads of Venice Beach , vandalise a grocery story that has been taken over by Latinos and Koreans .
They terrorize the Latino employees , calling one " You fucking doggy dick ! "
American Pie 5 / Presents : The Naked Mile
US , 2006 Just before the characters run the mile of the title ( a college tradition after exams ) , Dwight Stifler ( Steve Talley ) gives a speech to three other characters to encourage them .
In the background , this exchange : Jackson ( uncredited ) : Stifler !
You uncircumcised twat !
Stifler : Jackson , you little - dicked motherfucker .
Clearly " uncircumcised " is meant as an insult .
Since the literal meaning of " twat " is vulva , the expression is doubly insulting , but literally meaningless .
An American Werewolf in London
UK , 1981 Horror - comedy Two American students backpacking across Europe , David Kessler ( David Naughton ) and Jack Goodman ( Griffin Dunne ) , are attacked by a werewolf on the Welsh moors .
Jack is killed ( but since this is about werewolves , that 's not the end of him ) while David is wounded and taken to a hospital in London .
Nurse Alex Price ( Jenny Agutter ) is looking in on David when fellow nurse Susan Gallagher ( Anne - Marie Davies ) enters .
Susan :
Is he all right ?
Alex :
Yes , I should think .
He called out just now .
Susan : He 's American , you know .
Doctor Hirsch is gonna fetch one of them embassy fellas to see him .
Alex :
His chart says he 's from New York .
Susan :
Oh , I think he 's a Jew .
Alex :
What makes you say that ?
Susan : I 've had a look .
Alex ( chuckling ) : Really , Susan , that was n't very proper .
Besides , it 's common practice now .
Dr. Hirsch ( John Woodvine ) ( entering ) : Nurse Gallagher , Nurse Price is quite right .
Nurse Price is not quite right .
Her " now " and Hirsch 's agreement implicitly endorse circumcision by implying it is " modern " - when in fact it became common more than 75 years earlier , and had been largely abandoned in the UK , as any real doctor in London would know .
Antwone Fisher
US , 2002 ( based on Fisher 's autobiography , " Finding Fish " )
As a boy , Antwone lived with foster parents ( called Tate in the film ) and was abused physically , emotionally and sexually .
As an adult , Antwone ( Derek Luke ) and his girlfriend Cheryl ( Joy Bryant ) look at his birth and adoption records in an unsuccessful attempt to find his real parents .
The scene lasts just a few seconds but by freeze - framing , it is possible to read : ...
1984
Mrs. Tate [ states ? ] that child and brother
like to urinate in wash baskets , [ ? ] and
bottles during the day .
She added that
bedwetting was no longer a problem .
I had Antwone take a physical and it
was recommended circumcision on
elective admission basis .
He was admitted
to University Hospital on [ 8/6/84 ? ]
and operated on [ 8/8/84 ? ] and discharged
on [ 8/9/84 ? ] .
He was well - prepared for this surgery ,
...
This appears to be an instance of punitive circumcision .
Antwone reads this poem in the film :
Who will cry for the little boy ,
lost and all alone ?
Who will cry for the little boy ,
abandoned without his own ?
Who will cry for the little boy ?
He cried himself to sleep .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
He never had for keeps .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
He walked the burning sand .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
The boy inside the man .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
Who knows well hurt and pain .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
He died and died again .
Who will cry for the little boy ?
A good boy he tried to be .
Who will cry for the little boy ,
who cries inside of me ?
In the film , Antwone was born in 1976 , making him about eight years old in 1984 .
( In real life , he was born in 1959 . )
Attack of the Devil
US , 2014 YouTube video ( 14'30 " )
Synopsis : A Catholic priest ( Ray Mcanally [ pseud .? ] ) is led to a giant intact penis in a cave in Iraq .
Removing it awakens the gigantic Devil ( Arden Banks ) , but it is also the last part needed to ( re ? ) assemble a giant Robot Jesus under the Vatican .
The last step , ordered ( 4:40 ) by the Pope ( Roger Conley ) , is His circumcision ( by a remote controlled giant Lego / drill - rig laser " circumtron " / Gomco clamp ) .
The cut edge activates Robot Jesus ( Mike Stegall ) with electrical discharges , and he speaks in a heavy menacing voice .
The Pope launches him like a missile from Vatican Square and he flies to New York .
At a heavy metal concert , the crowd run from the Devil .
Robot Jesus and the Devil fight , and the crowd , including the priest , applaud Jesus , but electricity from Jesus ' penis ( 10:30 ) makes him kill some of the crowd and start to destroy New York .
The Devil sees the lightning coming from Robot Jesus ' penis ( 11:40 ) and restores his foreskin with a touch .
The priest says " It is He who performs miracles , " and the two giants part as friends , Robot Jesus flying into a disturbance in space , the Devil wading into the sea .
The priest , now heavily pierced , waves goodbye to Satan .
See it on YouTube Revolutionarily , circumcision makes Robot Jesus evil , and the Devil cures him .
Bad Faith
( Mauvaise foi )
Belgium / France , 2006 Comedy about the problematic relationship between a Muslim and his pregnant Jewish girlfriend
There are several references to circumcision , all meant to be funny .
A male - bonding episode between Ismaël ( Roschdy Zem , who co-authored and directed ) , his Jewish partner Milou ( Pascal Elbé , another co-author ) , and their non-denominational French friend has some banter about doing it when he was 3 ½ ( " It was fun ; I had a party " ) compared to eight days ( " How cruel , you can't even remember it " ) .
The inconsequential milquetoast pipes in " We do n't do it ! " but he is ignored .
The idea that any boy finds his circumcision " fun " is grotesque .
Bad Moms
USA , 2016 Women 's comedy , released July 29 , 2016
Going by this clip , it is heavy on " the foreskin is disgusting . "
Kiki ( Kristen Bell ) says she is " just happy [ the man she is with ] is circumcised " .
This prompts Amy ( Mila Kunis ) to ask with a gasp " What if I get someone who is not circumcised ? "
She is told : Kiki : Run out of the room screaming .
It 's like finding a gun in the street .
Just scream and get out of there !
But Carla ( Kathryn Hahn ) damns intact men with faint praise : Carla :
No way , you guys .
Uncut guys are great !!
Kiki : Really ?
Carla :
Oh they 're just so nice to you because they know their dicks are gross .
Amy : How do I handle it ?
Carla : Just imagine that this [ pulling Kiki 's hoodie over her head ] is the hood of the uncut cock and this [ Kiki 's face ] is the penis - face .
So what you would to is just very gently [ demonstrating with the hood ] peeel it back , like that , to expose the head of the cock ... and then you [ pulling the jacket off Kiki 's shoulders ] work it off , and then you just go to town , you jerk if off until you want to sit on it .
[ This is all bad advice . ]
Amy :
What do I do with this ( the hood of the hoodie ) ?
do I put it in a hairclip or do I -"
Carla : Nonononono , nonono this , this , you can flick it , fuck it , rub your face on it .
Amy : I do n't wanna put my face on it .
Carla : OK , well take care of this , though , This is like a big , giant man-clit .
If you work this , it 's gonna be like - [ rising and spreading her arms in the air ] Whoosh ! "
But Kiki says Kiki : I 'm not gonna wear this sweatshirt ever again " - the foreskin is THAT disgusting .
No intact men were consulted in the making of this film .
It also has a line directed at a woman wearing a chest - flattening bra : " It looks like you 've got a ' Boys Don't Cry ' thing happening right now . "
a reference to the film about Brandon Teena , a FTM transperson ( possibly intersexed ) who was raped and murdered .
More information about the film itself will be welcome .

Because I Said So
USA , 2007 Comedy about Daphne ( Diane Keaton ) trying to find a boyfriend for the youngest of her three daughters , Milly ( Mandy Moore ) .
Milly is at her new boyfriend 's house .
While he is in bed in the next room , she surruptitiously telephones her mother and sisters Mae ( Piper Perabo ) and Maggie ( Lauren Graham ) .
Daphne puts her on speaker phone .
Daphne :
So , how 's it going ?
Milly :
It 's good , it 's good ... the only thing is , I think he may have a hotdog with a bun .
Daphne :
Are you having a picnic ?
Mae : No ! Uncircumcised is back IN .
Maggie :
You know , that guy I dated before Derrick , he had a - hmm - and I preferred it , because it was so much more dramatic when it finally made its appearance .
You were like , WOW !
( runs her hands down the sides of her head , like a foreskin sliding back to reveal the glans ) Daphne : Honey , just remember , he 's accomplished , he 's considerate , and do n't forget , you have one breast smaller than the other .
The family is portrayed as not mincing words and speaking frankly about sexuality ( Milly , in one scene , describing an orgasm to her mother ) yet Milly is not certain about his status .
Maggie does n't know , or wo n't use , the word " foreskin " .
Daphne ( ignoring Maggie 's preference ) implies she thinks a foreskin needs to be compensated for , and is a disfigurement
The film has had sharply mixed reviews .
Beyond Honor
USA , 2003 Mohammed Abdel - Karim ( Wadie Andrawis ) is an Islamic patriarch in Southern California , Sahira ( Ruth Osuna ) his medical student daugher .
" Variety " ( Jan 18 , 2004 ) describes the climax , involving female genital mutilation , as " blood - curdling " .
Black KKKlansman
( USA ) 2018 Historical drama :
In Colorado Springs in 1972 ( actually 1979 ) , a black police officer , Ron Stallworth ( John David Washington ) infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan , using a Jewish surrogate , Flip Zimmerman ( Adam Driver ) for face - to - face meetings .
Klansman Felix Kendrikson ( Jasper Pääkkönen ) suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and takes him to his basement for a " Jew lie detector test " .
They disagree about the reality of the Holocaust , Kendrikson saying it was faked , Zimmerman that it was " beautiful " .
Kendrikson ( pointing down with his pistol ) :
Let me see yer dick .
[ Cut to an unmarked police car outside where Stallworth is listening to Zimmerman 's wire . )
Voice of Zimmerman :
Are ya gonna shoot me ?
Put that gun away .
[ Stallworth rips of his headphones and races out of the car . ]
Kendrikson : I hear you Jews do something funny wit' yer dicks , some weird Jew shit .
Is yer dick circumstanced ?
Zimmerman :
Oh , is that what this is is about ?
Yer tryin ' to see my big Jew dick , yer fuckin ' faggot .
Kendrikson : Who 're yer callin ' a fuckin ' faggot ?
Jew faggot !
Zimmerman : ( points his index finger at Kendrikson as if pushing a button , and clicks with his tongue . )
The ultimate faith in the fallacy that " Only Jews cut . "
In reality , Kendikson would very likely have been " circumstanced " himself .
Blades of Glory
USA , 2007 Comedy - drama Jimmy MacElroy ( Jon Heder ) is an orphan adopted by a famous figure - skating coach who is raising him to be a champion , while Katie Von Waldenburg ( Jenna Fischer ) is the untalented younger sister of a brother - sister figure skating team .
They set her up to spy on Jimmy and his skating partner but Jimmy and Katie become romantically involved , so Katie admits she 's been spying , and they are soon telling each other the horrors of growing up in such a competitive sport .
Jimmy says his foster - father insisted he be circumcised " to reduce wind resistence . "
This might , and should , elicit horror , but also might be taken as light relief , circumcision being " trivial " and the reason given so ludicrous .
Blind Fury
USA , 1989 Nick Parker ( Rutger Hauer ) , a blinded Vietnam vet , uses his samurai fighting skills and concealed sword to rescue his old Army buddy , Frank Devereaux .
Nick :
Where is Frank Devereaux ?
Cobb ( Charles Cooper ) : F.O. Errol Flynn !
You know what that means ?
Fuck off !
( Nick swings his sword and shaves off Cobb 's bushy eyebrows .
Cobb looks shocked . )
Nick : I also do circumcision .
Makes circumcision trivial ( with an underlying castration threat : " Next time it wo n't just be your eyebrows " ) , but also implies it is a delicate task .
Brokeback Mountain
USA , 2005 Story of love between two sheep - herders in Wyoming , starring Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist ( with Peter McRobbie as John Twist ) , Directed by Ang Lee ( " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon " ) .
The short story by Annie Proulx includes a scene where Ennis remembers Jack telling him how his father punished him for uninating on the toilet seat by urinating on him , and how Jack learnt at that moment that he was circumcised , because his father was not , shattering any possibility of a relationship .
The scene is not in the film .
But I 'm a Cheerleader
USA , 1999 Comedy about a schoolgirl ( Natasha Lyonne ) sent to a " cure " camp after she is suspected of being a lesbian .
In one class , Mary J. Brown ( Cathy Moriarty ) requires the inmates to say what is the " root " of their homosexuality : Dolph ( Dante Basco ) :
Too many locker - room showers with the ?
team .
Hilary ( Melanie Lynskey ) :
All - girl boarding school .
Sinead ( Katharine Towne ) : I was born in France .
Clayton ( Kip Pardue ) :
My mom let me play in her pumps .
Jan ( Katrina Phillips ) : I like balls .
Joel Goldberg ( Joel Michaely ) : Traumatic Bris .
Since the other reasons are absurd and trivial , the implication is that circumcision is trivial too .
The Cable Guy
USA , 1996 Comedy directed by Ben Stiller .
The Cable Guy ( Jim Carey ) , Stephen Kovaks ( Matthew Broderick ) , Stephen 's ex-wife ( Leslie Mann ) and his parents ( George Segal and Diane Baker ) are playing a party game called " Password Porn " .
Each writes a ( sexual ) word on a scrap of paper to be placed into a container .
A scrap of paper with the word " foreskin " on it is among those placed .
A word is drawn and whispered to one person who then gives one - word clues to the word .
The first three words are " nipple " , " vagina " and " foreskin " .
When Stephen is told his word is " foreskin " , he says something like " I cannot play this any more " and starts to leave the room .
The foreskin is apparently too disgusting to be even mentioned in a risqué game .
The Changeling See The Exchange
Charlie 's Angels II : Full Throttle
US , 2003 Jimmy Bosely ( Bernie Mac ) must get past an Irish guard .
He asserts that he too is Irish , despite being black .
To prove it , he argues that his family is Irish because they too have gone through " terrible shit " - potato famine , unemployment ... and ... circumcision .
The guard , puzzled , and with guarded sympathy asks : " Circumcision ? "
Bernie later tells of twin boys in his family being born and how they were to be circumcised .
( More detail needed .
Circumcision is very rare in Ireland . )
Choke
US , 2008 Black comedy .
The mentally - ill mother ( Angelica Huston ) of Victor ( Sam Rockwell ) , a sex - addicted historical village employee , stole him as a baby , but her seeming nurse Paige ( Kelly Macdonald ) convinces him that his mother fled Italy because she had stolen the foreskin of Christ and used cells from it to impregnate herself , so that he is the Second Coming .
Foreskin cells have no power to impregnate after 2000 years , but with holy relics , all bets are off .
Circumcise Me !
US , 2009 [ Not the 2006 BBC documentary , Circumcise Me ? ]
Screened at the second annual Orange County Jewish - Israeli Film Festival .
" The story of a Hasidic comedian who has converted three times . "
What 's striking is that the words of the title are almost never uttered , compared to " Circumcise him " .
Circumcision / La Circoncision / Tiyabu Biru
Senegal , 1978 Directed by Moussa Bathily , in the Sarakhole language As an agrarian village prepares for their traditional circumcision ceremony , the village elders realize that they can no longer afford the sacrificial cattle , an integral part of the festivities .
Eavesdropping , a group of young boys find out about the dire situation and decide to steal the cattle so the ritual can continue .
" Visually poetic , with an inspired documentary ambience , Moussa Bathily ’s lone feature film is nostalgic and penetrating . " - preview
Circumcision
USA , 2013 Angel Station Pictures Tyrone Wilson as Walter Little
" I want a cision ... " ( based on actual events ) : Refreshingly different : man is not circumcised , and resisting it is a token for thinking for oneself .
Circumcision !
A Slice of Life
USA , 2012 Comedy in 10 minute episodes .
Gleb Kaminer migrates from Azerbijan to Israel , where the army requires him to be circumcised .
Pain is emphasised and the usual jokes trotted out .
The details of the operation are not shown , but his ( large ) foreskin is seen flying through the air and landing in a basket with others :
The point of this movie seems to be to show off Gleb Kaminer 's technical skill ( he plays every role ) .
He clearly has no experience of a foreskin and the movie says nothing useful about circumcision .
Coffee , Desserts , Light Fare
15 mins
US , 2002 Two white South Beach , Florida , gay men find they are involved with the same man .
One complains of " too many uncuts " , describing them as " disgusting " .
The other agrees .
In a film made almost entirely by people with Spanish names , this may be to illustrate the men 's shallowness .
The Commissar
USSR , 1967
( US release 1987 ) In a scene filmed through the wheels of a moving cannon carriage , three naked Jewish boys take an outdoor bath in a Ukranian shtetl sometime in the early 1920s .
The two older boys appear to be circumcised , while the youngest one , born after the Revolution , is not .
There is no suggestion that the third boy is any less Jewish for being intact .
The Core
US , 2003 No direct reference , but two reviewers independently comment :
A vessel in the shape of an uncircumcised phallus penetrates Mother Earth and inseminates her core with nuclear - tipped casings which explode in coordinated waves , thus returning equilibrium to the planet .
- Mark Ramsey , Movie Juice
March 23 , 2003
The team jumps into their cigar - shaped ship , appropriately titled the U.S.S. Massive Uncircumcised Cock , and so begin their journey to the center of Mother Earth , where they will penetrate her egg - like core to deposit a payload of nuclear - warhead sperm , which will rock her body with coordinated waves of post - coital delight and get her molten juices flowing again , thus saving the planet from a particularly bad case of sexual frustration .
- Michael Batz , Pulp
April 3,2003
( Both reviewers pan the movie , Ramsey calling it " astonishingly disastrous " and Batz " so bad it hurts " . )
Cours Toujours
Dad on the Run
France , 2000 Jonas 's father - in - law tells him that in their North African tradition , Jonas ( Clément Sibony ) must bury his son's foreskin after the bris .
Jonas loses the handkerchief containing the foreskin , and in the rest of the movie he and his best friend search for it around Paris .
In the last scene , after the foreskin has been found and buried , Jonas asks his friend where his father buried his foreskin .
The friend replies , " C'mon , not all Jewish families circumcise .
My family , for example , does n't bother . "
Crash
Canada / UK , 1996 Dir : David Cronenberg from the novel by J G Ballard ( not the 2004 film of the same title , dir : Paul Haggis )
About people who are sexually turned on by car crashes and the dangers involving them .
In an early scene , James Ballard ( James Spader ) and his wife Catherine ( Deborah Kara Unger ) are having normal sex and talking about Vaughan ( Elias Koteas ) who has been disfigured in a car accident .
Both are attracted to him and talking about him while having sex arouses them .
Catherine casually asks " Is he circumcised ? " along with other sexual questions about Vaughan .
Ballard is English , Cronenberg Canadian , and he set the film in Canada , so the question need not imply a preference on her part , and the answer is not open - and - shut .
One implication is that James has seen Vaughan naked , suggesting a degree of intimacy between them .
Deconstructing Harry
US , 1997 Writer Harry Block ( Woody Allen ) confuses his life with his writing .
On one of his rare visits to his son Hilly ( Eric Lloyd ) , at a parents - at - school day , Hilly asks him , " Dad , why does n't my penis look like yours ? "
( It is not clear when he might have seen it to notice . )
Harry explains , " because your mother and I never had you circumcised , " but then embarasses an overhearing mother ( Mariel Hemingway ) by expanding the topic to the naming of penises .
Hilly says he 's going to name his penis " Dillinger " , which Harry says is " perfect " .
In one of his stories , a psychotherapist ( Demi Moore ) who has had a son by Epstein , a former patient ( Stanley Tucci ) , Harry ( voice over ) : " as if she had experienced a divine revelation , suddenly became what Epstein referred to , angrily , as ' Jewish with a vengeance ' . "
Helen : I just rue the day that I listened to you and did n't have him circumcised .
Epstein :
What are you , nuts ?
Helen :
We could still do it .
Epstein : No , no !
He 's too old .
Helen :
Now he 's too old .
Epstein : My God , you 're like a born - again Christian , except you 're a Jew .
She becomes so devout , she says a blessing before giving him oral sex .
Soon after , she has an affair with an Orthodox patient .
On the basis of his stories , Harry 's sister and brother - in - law accuse him ( with some truth ) of being self - hating and anti-Semitic .
Circumcision is only a springboard off which characters ' attitude to Judaism is bounced - implicitly reinforcing the myth that only Jews circumcise .
Desert Flower
US , 1997 Docu- drama about the life of anti-FGC advocate Waris Diri , played by Ethiopian model Liya Kebede .
In the Hollywood Reporter of October 20 , 2010 , Sura Wood says " ... German writer - director Sherry Hormann includes a horrifying , graphic re-enactment of Dirie 's genital mutilation as a child , seen in a flashback .
... A love interest ( Anthony Mackie ) appears briefly , but potential complications , given Dirie 's traumatic history , are alluded to but not explored
... rather than examine what might have become of her if she had n't been so beautiful , the film opts for uplift ... "
In Culturemap Houston , April 1 , 2011 , Regina Scrugs writes :
It 's not a smooth ride to the top of the modeling world , however .
One of the most poignant moments occurs when Dirie , not yet comfortable with English , goes to the hospital for an infection arising from her long - ago operation .
A British doctor asks a Somali male nurse to translate his instructions to her , but by subtitles we see that the nurse berates her instead " for bringing shame on our people . "
Desert Flower is an entertaining film which manages to be more than just a tale of empowerment .
It 's the story of one woman 's triumph over adversity , yes ; but it 's also a learning experience .
One incredible fact :
Although the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation has been condemned by the World Health Organzation and the United Nations , it 's still commonly performed on as many as 6,000 girls per day .
The Devil 's Advocate
US , 1997 A lawyer , Kevin Lomax ( Keanu Reeves ) , defends a man who has slaughtenered a goat in his apartment .
He says other blood sacrifices are acceptable , such as circumcision .
Cross - examining a woman who claims to have had a relationship with a man : Lomax :
Is he circumcised ?
Witness : ( pause ) Uhh . .
Lomax :
Is he cut or not ?
Witness : ( silence )
Lomax ( forcefully ) :
Do you understand the question ?
Witness : ( silence )
Lomax :
So which is it ?
Witness : ( silence .
Cries )
Her hesitation convinces Lomax that she is lying about having slept with the man .
The questioning assumes she is familiar enough with both kinds to be able to tell the difference - by no means likely in the US .
Deuce Bigelow : European Gigolo
USA , 2005 ( Raunchy comedy , widely panned )
Deuce ( Rob Schneider ) and his love interest , Eva , ( Hanna Verboom ) are at an aquarium , Deuce leaves her alone and a man who was taunting Deuce earlier makes lewd remarks to Eva to gross her out , telling her kinky things he wants to do to her .
After some sharp retorts and glares from Eva , he says " My penis is uncircumcised . "
This makes no sense in England and Europe where the film is set and where almost every man is intact : it would be like saying " I have ten toes . "
To US audiences , however , it is intended as another gross remark .
Message : " Intact penises are inherently disgusting . "
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
US , 1988 A comedy set in Southern France .
In a museum , Freddy Benson ( Steve Martin ) takes a quick peek at a nude male statue .
He goes " Eeew ! " presumably because the statue 's penis is intact .
He would go " Eeew ! " a great deal in Italy , Greece or Scandinavia .
Drift
Germany /
Canada , 2000 Written and directed by Quentin Lee , not to be confused with Drift ( Netherlands , 2001 ) directed by Michiel van Jaarsveld .
Ryan ( Reggie T. Lee ) is on the phone with his recent ex , Joel ( Greyson Dayne ) .
when he is paged by Leo ( Jonathon Roessler ) , a 20 - year - old they 'd recently met at a party .
He ends the call with Joel and phones Leo. Leo : Hey .
What 's up ?
Ryan :
What are you doing ?
Leo :
Oh , I was just masturbating .
Ryan :
Do you want me to call you back ?
Leo :
No , I just came .
Ryan : Cool .
Leo : I do n't know .
I was just incredibly horny today .
Ryan :
So , how do you masturbate ?
Leo : Nothing kinky .
You know - Just my hand .
Ryan :
Do you use lubricant ?
Leo :
No , I 'm not circumcised .
How 'bout you ?
Ryan : Yeah ....
Leo ( laughing ) : Umm ...
This is an incredibly weird conversation .
Ryan :
You started it .
Leo : I was just telling you what I was doing .
Ryan ( laughing ) : I was just curious .
" Not having to use lubricant to masturbate ( or , often , for intercourse ) " is another good reason not to circumcise .
Drowning by Numbers
UK , 1988 A boy called " Smut " carries out little rituals with road kills , indicating his troubled state of mind .
He is told by a neighbourhood girl that circumcision is desirable .
He asks his father Madgett what it looks like .
Madgett , in bed , pulls back the bedclothes and says " see , nothing special " ( or words to that effect ) .
( In a generation , circumcision has gone from commonplace to rare . )
Smut circumcises himself , further indicating his morbid state of mind .
( Director Peter Greenaway has a particular interest in morbid states of mind . )
East is East
UK , 1999 George Khan , a strict Muslim Pakistani ( Om Puri ) is married to an Englishwoman , Ella ( Linda Bassett ) , in Salford , Manchester .
It is 1971 .
Their six sons and daughter , taking part in a Catholic procession , take a detour to prevent him from seeing them .
His eldest son - who proves to be gay - flees from an arranged wedding .
His youngest son , Sajid ( Jordan Routledge ) , who always wears a parka with a concealing hood ( like Kenny in South Park ) , easily wins a pissing contest behind the mosque , but his competitors see his intact penis and call a Mullah , who inspects him and complains to his father .
George takes him home in shame : Ella :
What the bloody 'ell 's 'e done now ?
George : Done ?
I tell you what he bloody done , missus .
'E makes a bloody show of me .
All the bloody family always makes a bloody show of me .
I go to that mosque long time .
Now how I looking Mullah in the bloody face ?
' Cause your son got bloody tickle - tackle .
Ella :
What y' goin ' on about , y ' big daft git , what bleedin ' tickle - tackle ?
George : Mullah sees .
All the bloody children in the mosque seeing .
Ella :
Well they must be seein ' things , George , because they were all done , all six of them .
Auntie Annie ( Leslie Nicol ) :
She 's right , George .
George :
You 're not believe me ?
You 're bloody looking !
Ella : Sajid , come 'ere .
Sajid ( backing away ) : Get stoofed !
Ella :
Ay ay , language !
I 'll stuff you in a minute , you cheeky little bleeder , now get 'ere an get 'em off !
( Sajid whimpers . )
Annie : Come on Saj , let me 'ave a look .
I 've wiped your shitty arse before now .
( She looks ) .
Oo , 'e 's right , y'know Ella , it 's still there !
[ An English mother mistaken about her nine - year - old son strains credulity . ]
George :
You sees , is all you bloody fault !
Annie : 's nowt to worry about , George , you can still get 'im done .
Ella : I know who I should 've got done .
( Annie snickers )
George :
No bloody funny , you sees .
It 's got be fixed !
This thing has to be cutting !
( Sajid runs away ) Ey !
Come 'ere you bastard !
...
Saleem : ( secretly an art student , drawing an intact penis to show his brothers and sister )
We draw 'em all the time at college .
... protects the end of the penis .
...
Maneer ( the religious one ) : Foreskins are dirty .
Saleem :
They would n't be there if they were dirty .
Meenah :
Why do they cut it off ?
Tariq :
It lessens the feeling in y' knob .
Maneer :
No it does n't .
Tariq : ' Ow would you know ?
You 've 'ave n't used yours yet .
Maneer : Yes I 'ave .
....
George ( calling through a hole in the outside toilet door to Sajid ) :
You can't 'ave this thing , my son .
It no belong to you .
Not our religion , see .
No worry about it .
( Cajoling ) I buy you nice watch .
Ella :
Oh why bother with all this now at 'is age , George ?
George : Your son goin ' bloody 'ell with this thing .
But we fixes .
Ella : ' E 's not goin ' to 'ell .
George : I tell you , missus , it 's my 'ouse , an I bloody control it .
( They argue . )
...
Ella ( through the hole ) : Oh , come on Saj .
'S only a little operation .
It wo n't hurt ...
( The word " hurt " echos as the black hole expands to fill the screen .
It contracts as we pull back from Sajid 's hood to reveal Sajid in his jacket on a hospital trolley , being wheeled away screaming .
Cut to a closeup of Sajid 's fly being zipped up .
Sajid , now on a hospital bed , groans . )
...
George :
Is everything all right ?
Tickle - tackle all gone ?
Doctor :
The circumcision was absolutely fine .
[ No question about the medical ethics of performing unnecessary surgery on a non-consenting patient . ]
George : You Indian ?
Doctor : I 'm sorry ?
Ella ( whispers ) : George !
George : Bastard Indian ! ... Sajid ( producing a watch )
This is very special watch .
It tells the time in ... Arabic .
( Sajid turns away . )
...
( Sajid has been brought home . )
Annie : How 's little one doing ?
Ella : 'S all right .
Just a bit sore .
Annie : Where 's old Bothered - Balls ?
' E 'appy now ?
Ella : Yeah .
' E bought him a new dressing gown , and a watch .
Annie : Hmph .
Not much of a swap , but it 's better than nowt , I suppose .
Ella : Annie , do you think I 'm a good mother ?
Annie : No , I think you 're a friggin ' awful mother .
Ella :
Would you 've put one of your lads through all this at 'is age ?
Annie :
Well you 'ad no choice , love .
Ella : I did .
I could 've put me foot down and said " No . "
Annie :
And given yourself a load of bleedin ' grief .
It 's 'is religion , Ella .
And its theirs , you know that .
You knew that when you got married .
In the climactic fight between George and his family , Sajid 's hood gets torn off .
That symbolic circumcision is more of a coming of age than his literal one .
The overall impression is that circumcision is an evil , but only one among many examples of George 's self - centredness and cruelty .
Eating Out 4 : Drama Camp
USA , 2011 Romantic gay comedy : lovers Casey ( Daniel Skelton ) and Zack ( Chris Salvadore ) go to a drama camp where sex is forbidden and their failing relationship is threatened by another man , Benji ( Aaron Milo ) .
Zack sniffs
Benji's underpants , which makes him want to masturbate and rub himself with them .
They have been contaminated with poison oak , making him itch all over ( 50:04 ) .
When his friends , though puzzled about how it happened , commiserate , he says : Zack :
It 's like my whole body is a circumcision wound .
Subtext : " Circumcision is very painful " but the scene is played for comedy , and the reference is more gratuitous .
Europa , Europa
[ Hitlerjunge Salomon ]
France /
Germany , 1990 " The true story of Solomon Perel . "
The film opens with the Bris of a German baby , shown in some detail .
The baby , Solomon , cries weakly when he is cut .
In voiceover , he ( Marco Hoffschneider - intact in real life , he wore a circumcised prosthesis for the nude scene ) says he can remember his own circumcision .
On the eve of his Bar Mitzvah , his family flee the Nazis and emigrate to Poland .
Separated from them , he becomes an unwilling Russian and Polish interpreter for the German army , as Josef " Jupp " Peters .
He has to conceal his circumcision from the soldiers of his unit .
When he sees hanged Jews , he asks himself , " How could they be so kind to me and treat the Jews so horribly ?
What set us apart ?
A simple foreskin ? "
A friend makes a pass at him while he is off - guard in a bath and discovers his secret , but tells him not all Germans are the same and is killed soon after .
He is sent to a Hitler Youth boarding school deep within the Reich .
On the train , a woman has sex with him , but before she exposes him an officer orders her to put the lights out .
At the school he checks the locks on the toilet doors and is relieved to learn they wear trunks when showering .
He falls in love with a German girl and , inspired by her poloneck sweater , attempts to restore his foreskin with string , but develops a painful infection .
Sex with her would expose him , and she turns to a rival .
He has a nightmare in which his family rejects him and he is told Hitler is Jewish too : " That 's why he covers it with his hands . "
After many close shaves he is saved from the Russians when he is recognised by a Jewish friend in a concentration camp they are liberating .
They urinate together in the rain as he embraces his Jewish identity .
He emigrates to Palestine and in voiceover says when he had sons , he " barely hesitated " to circumcise them .
( The real Solomon Perel appears in the last scene . )
The film strongly reinforces the theme that all and only Jewish males are cicumcised .
Everything Relative
US , 1996 Seven women , six of them lesbian , gather for a reunion following the bris of the son of two of them , Victoria ( Monica Bell ) and Katie ( Stacy Nelkin ) .
The mohel ( Harvey Fierstein ) jokes " Shall we take a bit off the top ? "
All the women gather round to watch and the scene fades .
( Baby is circumcised .
He seems unaffected afterwards .
He also seems well over eight days old . )
Though conventional family structures are challenged , circumcision is not .
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex
* But Were Afraid to Ask
US , 1972 Comedy distantly connected to the popular ( and ludicrously erroneous ) book by David Reuben
In the section , " What happens during ejaculation ? " the male body is imagined as a kind of craft with a large male crew , e.g. erection is produced by burly men cranking the winches of a crane - like device .
As a timorous sperm , Woody Allen wonders what will happen to him , and as he leaps off the gangway - like urethra he calls , " Well , at least he 's Jewish ! "
Why this should be a relief is a mystery and it reinforces the fallacy that " Only Jews cut off foreskins . "
Its function in the film seems only to reference the otherwise unmentioned penis .
The Ex See Fast Track
The Exchange
( a k a [ The ] Changeling )
US , 2008 Drama set in 1928 Los Angeles Christine Collins ( Angelina Jolie ) leaves her 9 - year - old son , Walter , at home .
When she returns he is gone .
Months later , the LA Police Department - riddled with corruption , cronyism and violence - try to foist off another boy on her as Walter .
They make a big thing of it , with newspaper headlines , pictures of the returning boy , etc .
She spots the switch immediately , but they insist she take him home on a trial basis .
( Christine comes into the hall and stops in front of the bathroom door .
Knocks . )
CHRISTINE : I found you a pair of pajamas .
I bought them for Walter but he did n't like the fabric , so - " WALTER " ( off - scene ) : Ow !
( She hears him fall and pushes the door open .
Inside the bathroom , she helps " Walter " stand , discreetly turned away from us .
) CHRISTINE : Are you all right ?
" WALTER " : I fell .
Stupid tub .
CHRISTINE : Did you hurt yourself ?
Let me see -
( She looks down , stops suddenly , reacting to something we do n't see .
Looks slowly looks up to his face . )
CHRISTINE : You 're circumcised ....
Get out .
( She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom . ) ... CHRISTINE ( to police officer ) :
He 's four inches shorter than Walter .
Boys his age do n't shrink .
If anything , he should be taller .
JONES : Maybe your measurements are off .
Look , I 'm sure there 's a reasonable explanation for - CHRISTINE : He 's circumcised .
Walter was n't .
( Jones glances back , uncomfortable about discussing circumcision with a woman in public view .
He lowers his voice . )
JONES : Mrs. Collins ... your son was missing for four months .
For at least part of that in the company of an as - yet unidentified drifter .
Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done ?
He could have had him ... circumcised ... might have - CHRISTINE : Made him smaller ?
Captain , please - They send a doctor over to examine the boy .
CHRISTINE : What about the circumcision ?
DR .
TARR : Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate .
After all , circumcision is hygienically sound .
Must have been quite traumatic at the time .
No wonder he 's submerged the memory .
These two scenes , with their two contradictory reasons for circumcising , are apparently there to indicate how desparate the authorities are to explain away the anomaly ; but they are rather like the contradictory reasons given for circumcising babies today .
( As the doctor indicates , non-religious circumcision was on its way into fashion in Los Angeles in 1928 . )
Fargo
US , 1996 Two hookers in Minnesota are asked to describe the two wanted men they had sex with .
Detective ( Frances McDormand ) : I want you tell me what these fellas looked like .
Hooker ( Larissa Kokernot ) :
Well , the little guy [ Steve Buscemi as " Carl Showalter " ] , he was kinda funny - lookin ' .
Detective :
In what way ?
[ Showalter has buck teeth , slicked - back hair and a pencil moustache . ]
Hooker : I dunno .
Just funny - lookin' .
Detective : Can you be any more specific ?
Hooker : I can't really say .
( inspiration : )
He was n't circumcised .
Detective : Was he funny - lookin ' apart from that ?
Hooker : Ya . [ Much is made of the Minnesotan " Ya " . ]
Detective : So .
You were havin ' sex with the little fella then ?
Hooker : Anh - huh .
Detective :
Is there anything else you can tell me about 'im ?
Hooker : Nah .
Like I say , he was funny - looking .
More than most people even .
This sets up a later scene : Officer Olsen ( Cliff Rakerd ) :
Well , what 'd this guy look like , anyways ?
Mr Mohra ( Bain Boehlke ) : Ohh , he 's a little guy , kinda funny - lookin ' .
Olsen : Aha .
In what way ?
Mohra :
Ohh , just a general kinda way .
... where the joke is on us for expecting Mohra to know or say anything about Showalter 's circumcision status .
On the positive side , we are invited to consider the hookers ignorant for thinking intactness is " funny - lookin ' " .
The underlying message is that circumcision is too trivial for intelligent people to consider .
Fast Track / The Ex
US , 2006 Comedy about office rivalry Chip ( Jason Bateman ) is paraplegic - or in some versions , pretending to be .
Tom ( Zach Braff ) married Chip 's former girlfriend , but thinks Chip is trying to steal her back .
When Chip wheels into a locker room naked , Tom stares and looks shocked .
Chip says it 's okay to stare - " He likes it . "
Later , a woman who works with both tells
Tom that Chip is great in bed .
Chip and Tom argue and Tom accuses Chip of wanting to " bang my wife with that giant uncircumcised anteater ! "
Clearly for Tom , " uncircumcised " is a term of abuse ( and a grudge he has been holding against Chip ) .
This undefined " wrongness " of intactness is part of the way the circumcision meme is transmitted .
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
US , 1998 Dramatisation of part of the life of writer Hunter Thompson .
" Raoul Duke " ( Thompson , played by Johnny Depp ) and his Samoan lawyer Dr Gonzo ( Benicio Del Toro ) go to Las Vegas .
Dr Gonzo picks up a young girl , but Duke convinces him to get rid of her before they get in trouble and end up in court with Gonzo accused of violating the virgin girl with his " uncircumcised member " .
Almost all Samoans are in fact circumcised .
The implication is that illegal sex is worse if the penis is not circumcised , and perhaps that to be intact is to be morally suspect .
The reference is somewhat tongue in cheek , because Thompson / Duke is not bothered by the " uncircumcised " member , but having a jibe at the American way of viewing it .
Flirting with Disaster
US , 1996 Comedy about Mel Coplin ( Ben Stiller ) , his wife Nancy ( Patricia Arquette ) and their incompetent caseworker ( Téa Leoni ) searching for Mel 's birth - parents so they can name their four - month - old son .
Along the way they meet Paul ( Josh Brolin ) who is trying to convince his partner to adopt a child .
Paul ( to Nancy ) :
So , where did you folks come down on the big circumcision controversy ?
' Cause there 's a movement afoot these days to keep the foreskin .
Personally , I think a boy 's penis should look just like his father 's .
You know ? "
Nancy ( nods ) : " Yeah , uh - huh " .
Since Paul is gay , the question could arise , " Which father ? "
The film touches on many issues , apparently to seem trendy , but does n't engage with any of them .
The Golden Compass
US / UK , 2007 Fantasy drama based on " Northern Lights " , the first of Philip Pullman 's " His Dark Materials " trilogy .
In a parallel universe , everyone has a daemon ( soul , in the form of an animal ) .
To separate a human from their daemon causes acute pain .
Lyra Belacqua ( Dakota Blue Richards ) is taken to Bolvangar in the Arctic , where the evil and powerful Magisterium performs " intercision " on children , cutting them apart from their daemons and devastating their personalities .
In the ultimate operating theatre , cold and sterile , the child and their daemon are put in a cage , a mesh wall is lowered between them , then a sheet of white light slowly comes down the wall .
The Magisterium is still perfecting the process of intercision , but the evil Marisa Coulter ( Nicole Kidman ) says " It 's just a little cut " .
Lyra is saved at the last second from being intercised .
From the screenwriter / director 's commentary :
As in the book , there 's something quite off about the way that people act at Bolvangar .
They 're not quite aware of the fact that they 're doing something terrible .
In fact they 're quite proud of themselves and proud of their station , and they 're also condescending towards chldren .
...
And here comes a hateful lie from the male nurse : " But this is the way that you grow up " and the idea here is that this intercision process that they 're inflicting on children is something that they see as good for them , and if only they could perfect the process they would be saving the children from something terrible , which is the infection of Dust [ Original Sin ] .
- Chris Weitz
In the second book of the trilogy , there is a direct reference to genital cutting .
Goldmember
( Austin Powers III )
USA , 2002 Austin Powers ( Mike Myers ) laments that his father ( Michael Caine ) has never been present at key moments of his life , such as his ordination as Man of Mystery in front of his school .
Song :
When I was first baptized ,
When I was criticized ,
When I was ostracized ,
When I was Jazzercised -
Steak ' n ' kidney pies -
When I was modernized ,
When I was circumcised ,
Daddy was n't there .
This makes little more sense sense in context , but the impression is of a list of unpleasant experiences .
Halfaouine : Boy of the Terraces
[ Asfour Stah ]
Tunisia / France /
Italy , 1990 A coming - of - age film set in Tunisia .
Noura ( Selim Boughedir ) , 12 years old , is lying on his bed while his little brother , aged about three , is being circumcised .
The sequence jumps from one boy to the other .
The little boy is crying as he is put on a table and circumcised .
His older brother lies clutching his crotch in agony as he hears his brother 's screams .
Hannibal Rising
US , 2007 A prequel to " Silence of the Lambs " .
On the Internet Movie DataBase In Lithuania , in 1944 , a Nazi soldier , Vladis Grutas ( Rhys Ifans ) and his men have captured a peasant .
Vladis :
Are you a gypsy ?
Peasant : No , sir .
Vladis ( Sniffing him as a dog would ) :
Are you a Jew ?
Peasant : No , sir .
Vladis :
Why do n't you show us your dick ?
( Vladis and his men laugh loudly , but they are distracted by a loud explosion )
In Lithuania in 1944 , none but a Jew would be circumcised , but the point of the scene is to show Vladis ' contempt .
Harry and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo
US , 2008 Comedy
The girlfriend of one of the boys is off in Amsterdam and the other taunts him that she is " probably having it off with some European guys " and that " she probably has a couple of uncircumcised dicks in front of her face right now " .
Though of Korean and Indian origin , their thought - patterns are thoroughly U.S.
They do not , however , suggest that the girlfriend finds foreskins disgusting .
Harry and Max
US , 2004 OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS : Harry ( BRYCE JOHNSON of WB ’s " Popular " & MTV’s " Undressed " ) , aged 23 , is a former boy band idol who is watching his younger brother Max ( COLE WILLIAMS of ABC ’s " 8 Simple Rules … For Dating My Teenage Daughter " ) , aged 16 , follow in his footsteps .
Harry escorts
Max on a long - promised camping adventure to the San Gabriel mountains above Los Angeles but things quickly turn serious as the boys discuss Harry ’s contradictory relationship with their family .
Max ’s longing to connect with Harry both physically and emotionally grows even more , wanting to bring stability to Harry ’s life .
In an effort to create a type of alternative family for his brother , Max goads Harry to rekindle his affections for his former girlfriend , Nikki ( RAIN PHOENIX of " O " and " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues " ) .
Back from the weekend , Max realizes that he must redefine his relationship with his brother , and that only by setting boundaries can the boys grow into adulthood together .
On the camping trip , Harry complains bitterly of having been circumcised at birth .
Max sympathizes completely , but the way the issue is brought up ( " I do n't know why Mom and Dad had this done to me " ) suggests that at some time in the seven years between the sons ' births , the parents saw the light , and Max is intact .
Max also seems to conduct his life with more ease and honesty , and this is written into the film as consistent with his being more comfortable with his whole body .
A remarkable departure from the usual US pattern .
Hello Goodbye
France / Italy / Israel , 2008 Comedy Gisèle ( Fanny Ardant ) converted to Judaism when she married Alain ( Gerard Depardieu ) , a secular Jew .
" She decides that only a trip to Israel will inject meaning and renewal into their bourgeois lives .
After a holiday there , ... they pack up their apartment and move .
...
Gisele takes to their new home ... and falls for a young rabbi ...
But by the time Alain submits himself , at his wife 's behest , to the mohel 's knife -- yes , that would be for a circumcision -- all one can say is " oy . " - Midlife - crisis rom-com " Hello " a nonstarter by Sheri Linden , Reuters , April 21 , 2009 ... As he was never circumcised , the first step is to be circumcised .
He is horrified but eventually acquiesces .
The doctor pronounces that in 35 years he is the first adult on whom he has removed the foreskin .
[ In Israel , with many immigrants from communist regines , that is very unlikely . ]
MmegiOnlineNovember 5 , 2010
This is mildly anti-circumcision , if his willingness to undergo it is an indication of his weakness .
Horrible Bosses
US , 2011 Comedy about three friends who conspire to murder their awful bosses Dale Arbus , a dental assistant ( Charlie Day ) is sexuallly harassed by his boss Dr. Julia Harris ( Jennifer Aniston ) .
While they 're working on an unconscious patient , she purposely sprays the crotch of Dale 's scrubs with a dental water squirter .
Dale jumps up from his stool in shock and dismay .
Dr. Harris :
Oooh , I think we can make out the outline of our little friend there .
Shabbat shalom , somebody 's circumcised .
This implies " Circumcision is Jewish " , and " Shabbat shalom " is a Sabbath greeting , not for working hours - but such a person may be careless with facts .
Hostel
US , 2005 Comedy / Horror Two American students , Paxton ( Jay Hernandez ) and Josh ( Derek Richardson ) , and an Icelandic friend , Oli ( Eythor Gudjonsson ) , are backpacking across Europe in search of women .
Soon after they arrive at a hostel , the three go to a sauna , where there are two topless women .
They whisper hellos , then there is a lull .
Oli breaks the silence : Oli ( jumps up ) : I 'm so happy I shaved my balls .
( laughter )
What ?
I have the smoothest balls in Iceland .
( takes off his towel , stands up and shakes his genitals in Josh 's face )
Do you want to see ?
Josh : No , no , ... You 're not ... no ...
I 'm good , I 'm good .
Put your anteater away .
It 's totally creepy .
Natalya ( Barbara Nedeljakova , to Josh ) :
You 're not from Iceland , no ?
Josh : No , f no , American .
Yeah , unlike him I had my foreskin removed at birth .
Hygiene and - am I talking ?
Ummhuh , I 'm Josh .... ( Natalya looks at him in disbelief throughout . )
Hostel Steam Room ToplessClip - High Quality by UZI4you
Apparently just another gratuitous swipe at intactness , though Natalya 's line makes it clear she is familiar with Icelandic foreskins , and has no problem with Oli's .
Calling a foreskin an " anteater / elephant 's trunk / Shar - pei " is just a way of trying to make one 's own discomfort seem objective .
And that discomfort ultimately derives from fear of facing one 's own loss .
If a body part looks ( a little ) like some other natural object , what of it ?
House Calls
US , 1978 Comedy about a romance between a doctor in a run-down hospital and his patient .
Ann Atkinson ( Glenda Jackson ) lists the operations from which Dr. Charley Nichols ( Walter Mattahu ) makes money .
One is circumcison .
Charley says , " Only for boys . "
In 1978 , it could be considered funny to refer to female genital cutting because it was so obscure as to be unthinkable .
The Infidel
UK , 2010 Comedy : Mahmud Nasir ( Omid Djalili ) , a relaxed Muslim , plans to marry the daughter of a " hate cleric " when he learns that he is actually Jewish .
As he becomes reconciled to his identity , he says something like , " We 're not so different .
We eat similar foods , we 're both .... "
He gestures at his and his friend 's crotches , and shrugs his shoulders in a stereotypically Jewish way .
The scene implies that to be circumcised is a negative thing .
Jennifer 's Body
US , 2009 High school horror comedy : an ambitious band sell their soul to the devil by sacrificing a virgin , but their plans go awry because Jennifer ( Megan Fox ) is not a virgin and she comes back as a demon - possessed killer .
Best friends Jennifer and Needy ( Amanda Seyfried ) , a nerdy virgin , go to a local bar .
There Ahmet ( Aman Johal ) , is sitting alone .
Needy :
Hey , there 's Ahmet , the exchange student from India .
Jennifer : I wonder if he 's circumcised .
I 've always wanted to try a sea cucumber .
Needy : Eww . ( giggles )
A sea-cucumber
Perhaps the left end looks something like an intact penis ( covered with warts ) ,
but equally the right end looks like a circumcised penis .
Ambivalent .
Even though she 's " always wanted to try " one , " sea cucumber " suggests the rarity of , and the disdain usually reserved for , the intact penis in the USA .
Since Jennifer is the sophisticated character , it may be her point of view we are expected to support .
From his turban , Ahmet is a Sikh , so he is almost certainly intact , but Jennifer may not know this .
Jojo Rabbit
Czech Republic/NZ /US , 2019 Comedy - drama :
Near the end of WW2 in Germany , a 10 - year - old would - be Nazi ( Roman Griffin Davis ) finds a Jewish girl ( Thomasin McKenzie ) hiding within his solo mother 's house .
He has fantastic ideas about Jews , which she does little to discourage .
He asks her if they " still steal the ends of penises .
... Rabbis use them as earplugs . "
Jungle2Jungle
US , 1997 There is mention of circumcision of the native people of the Amazon .
( They do not practise it . )
Just Married
US , 2000 [ deleted scene ]
Tom Leezak ( Ashton Kutcher ) is in the bath when Father Robert ( George Gaynes ) walks in .
The priest sits on the edge of the bath , looks at Tom and asks " You 're not Catholic , are you ? "
Tom explains later that he 's half Jewish , the reason he is circumcised .
This reinforces the myth that " Only Jews circumcise . "
In fact many boys have been circumcised " because he 's Catholic " .
Keeping The Faith
US , 2000 In the opening sequence , narrated by priest Brian Finn ( Edward Norton ) , he and his friend Rabbi Jacob Schram ( Ben Stiller ) have parallel problems " coming to grips with the practical aspects of our jobs " .
His robe catches fire and he strikes a parishioner in the head with his incense burner , and has to put himself out by sitting in the font , while Jake faints during a Bris .
The two scenes are intercut , but after the establishing longshot we see Jake 's reaction , the baby 's trusting face and the mohel 's hands reaching for glittering instruments .
We see Jake start to fall and hear a single " snip " sound and the baby crying .
The following long shots show all but the mohel run to attend Jake .
The focus is entirely on the man - though his reaction speaks volumes about the reality of the unseen circumcision .
That the scene is played for laughs is somewhat sick .
Imagine if the baby were a girl ....
The Killer Who Never Kills
Taiwan , 2011 Comedy / thriller about a compassionate trainee assassin who fakes his victims ' deaths for them .
" Wan & Lee only rarely gets their audience to laugh .
For example , one of Ouyang 's targets is a creepy surgeon who specializes in circumcision .
Not only does Ouyang discover that the guy keeps all the removed foreskins in a gallery of test tubes , but our hero actually concedes to part company with his own in the name of undercover surveillance .
This sequence has the potential for comedy gold , especially considering how events play out , but in Wan & Lee 's hands it barely raises more than a smile . "
- Review on Twitch , November 11 , 2011
It 's progress that the surgeon is " creepy " , but as usual , the loss is trivialised .
Kinsey
US 2004 Biopic about the famous mid-20th century sex researcher , played by Liam Neeson .
Early in his career , Kinsey gives a talk about sex to married and senior students at the University of Indiana , illustrated with pictures of an erect penis that is clearly circumcised , even though Kinsey himself was , and most of his students would have been , intact at the time , before 1940 .
Late in the film , his wife Mac ( née Clara Macmillan , played by Laura Linney ) finds him sitting on the edge of the bath reading letters from people with unhappy sexual histories .
Drops of blood are on the floor between his feet .
Mac :
What 's that blood ?
Kinsey : I punctured my foreskin .
Mac :
Why ?
Kinsey : People do all sorts of things to themselves and I wanted to see what they were experiencing .
I did not find it particularly pleasurable .
This apparently follows " Sex , the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey " ( 1998 ) by Jonathan Gathorne - Hardy .
But in " Alfred C. Kinsey : A Public / Private Life " ( 1997 ) , James H. Jones puts it differently : " On one occasion when his inner demons plunged him to new depths of despair , Kinsey climbed into a bathtub , unfolded the blade of his pocketknife , and circumcised himself without the benefit of anesthesia . "
Knocked Up
US 2007 Romantic comedy about chalk - and - cheese Ben Stone ( Seth Rogan ) and Allison Scott ( Katherine Heigl ) falling in love during Alison 's pregnancy after a one - night stand .
While awaiting the birth , Allison 's sister Debbie ( Leslie Mann ) asks her husband about Ben 's long - bearded friend , Martin ( Martin Starr ) .
Debbie : " Is he Ben 's rabbi ?
Is he the one that cuts the penis ? "
Implying she mistakenly believes If Ben is Jewish , the baby is Jewish ; the rabbi does it soon after birth ; and ( implicitly ) only Jews circumcise - all common enough mistakes .
Krippendorf's Tribe
US 1998 Anthropologist James Krippendorf ( Richard Dreyfuss ) has misused grant money , so he needs to fake some anthropology .
He uses his three kids , Shelley , Mickey , and Edmund , to help him mock up a documentary on the " Shelmickedmu " tribe .
They slap together several tapes , by splicing actual footage of a tribe with images of the four of them mucking about their backyard with makeup and tribal - type clothing .
In one scene the eldest son " circumcises " the younger son with an axe .
( One reviewer on the Internet Movie Data Base calls this " the only thing worth seeing in the movie . "
Another loved " all the social commentary allusions to our own tribal way of living . " )
Critic Daniel Barnes slammed the scene in detail in The Barnesyard blog on November 14 , 2005 ( reprinted in The E Street review ) .
KRIPPENDORF ON…CIRCUMCISION
Krippendorf ’s first order of business involves faking a circumcision ritual by using his 4 year - old son as bait , pretending to remove the foreskin with a stone machete .
This “ comedic ” sequence is extremely prolonged , atonal and disturbing , to the point that I lamented my lack of a time machine , or any other technology that would have allowed me to travel back and assassinate D.W. Griffith for allowing this madness to happen .
When Krippendorf shows his grisly circumcision footage to the public , it causes a huge sensation that has television network execs clamoring at his door for more .
It makes sense , because we all know how popular genital mutilation is with the general public these days .
The moral seems to be that circumcision is primitive and funny when other people do it .
The Lamb
Kuzu
Turkey , 2014 " The Lamb " takes place in an eastern Anatolian village .
According to tradition , 27 - year - old Medine ( Nesrin Cavadzade ) has to serve oven - roast lamb at the circumcision feast of her little son Mert ( Mert Taştan ) .
Medine does her best to earn enough money to buy a sheep .
Ismail , Medine 's unemployed husband ( Cahit Gök ) , is under a lot of stress .
Meanwhile Mert 's elder sister Vicdan ( Sıra Lara Cantürk ) tells him that he will be slaughtered if they cannot find a sheep before the ceremony .
" My mom always calls you 'my little lamb , ' does she not ? " she tells him .
Director Kutluğ Ataman has apprently not thought much about consent as an issue in genital cutting : " I think the idea of circumcision must be more scary than it actually is .
I was circumcised as soon as I was born so I do n't remember it .
Personally , I like being a circumcised man .
I would not want to be uncircumcised .
Some people may have problems with rituals , but I am completely taken by rituals .
I think rituals are part of our culture , they are part of what makes us and make us belong to one another .
I am always curious about new rituals of my own culture and I like to follow them .
There is a certain comfort to be had in following rituals .
One feels more secure and the sense of belonging is comforting .
But having said this , I guess everyone should be allowed to make their own choices in the end .
These are individual choices . "

Laughter on the 23rd Floor
US ( TV ) , 2000 A group of TV comedy writers is joking about Catholicism , the Pope , communion .
A Catholic Writer : Take communion .
It beats circumcision .
A Jewish Writer :
What would you know about circumcision ?
[ To the others : ]
Have you ever seen this guy in the bathroom ?
He pees straight up .
Since he has the last laugh , he - and circumcision - wins the exchange , but cutting a boy 's genitals in case he " pees straight up " comes close to being the silliest circumstition yet .

The Life of David Gale
US , 2003 David Gale ( Kevin Spacey ) is a philosophy professor at the University of Texas , Austin , who knows a lot of trivia .
Berlin ( Rhona Mitra ) a failing graduate student , propositions him , saying she 'll " do anything for the grade . "
He leads her on a little , then says , " The one thing you can do for the grade is - study . "
Later , at a party , Berlin , who has been expelled , accosts David : Berlin : " Has anyone ever told you that after you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part ?
David : Shmuck .
Berlin : Excuse me ?
David : Schmuck .
That 's what they call what is left over from circumcision , schmuck .
David shows off his knowledge of minutiae - wrongly : schmuck is Yiddish for penis ( from the German for ornament ) .
If Berlin were British like the actress who plays her , she would not assume that Gale was circumcised .

Thousands of parents could face a choice : volunteer at your child 's school or pay a $ 100 fine .
A bill introduced in the Ohio legislature would require parents to donate at least 13 hours of time to their school district each year or pay the price .
And , if parents failed to pay up , the fine could be deducted from their state income tax refunds .
School districts would report parents who did n't volunteer to the Ohio Department of Education .
" This is just one of those stupid ideas that surface every now and then , " said Elizabeth Papp Taylor , former council president of the Shaker Heights Parent Teacher Organization .
" It will get crushed . "
Papp Taylor said the legislation is unfair , especially to parents already burdened with more than one job .
People volunteer because it gives them pleasure , not because it is required of them , she said .
House Bill 519 was introduced by Rep. Sandra Williams , a Cleveland Democrat , and co-sponsored by six other lawmakers including Rep. Stephen Dyer , a Democrat from Green , and Rep. Barbara Boyd , a Cleveland Heights Democrat .
• Allows a nonrefundable credit against the corporate franchise or commercial activity tax for employer - paid leave for employees participating in school activities .
• Requires districts to establish mentoring programs for students .
• Levies a $ 100 fine against parents who do n't volunteer at least 13 hours a year .
If fine not paid , the state would withhold $ 100 from future state refund .
Neither Williams nor Boyd returned phone calls on Tuesday .
But Dyer said he co-sponsored the bill because he believes in the spirit of the legislation .
He acknowledged that the measure may have to undergo revisions in committee and said he does n't want it to become overly burdensome for parents .
" Ensuring that parents play a vital role in their children 's life is the reason I signed on to it , " Dyer said .
" There are plenty of studies out there that say children whose parents are involved , do better in school . "
School districts would have to offer a three - hour orientation seminar for parents before they began volunteering .
The seminars would include tips for helping children succeed in school .
Each school district would adopt a policy describing volunteer opportunities available .
Those could include tutoring , participating on school or district committees , assisting with extracurricular activities , chaperoning field trips , clerical work and lunchroom or library duty .
The bill also requires school districts to create a mentoring program for students .
All mentors would have to undergo criminal background checks and complete an annual training course developed by the school district .
Robert Boynton , the Amherst schools superintendent , said he worries that the legislation would become another unfunded mandate .
He supports the need for parent involvement , but is wary of the method .
" Legislating volunteering does n't sound logical to me , " he said .
For 15 years , Diana Leitch , the mother of four children , has volunteered with the Rocky River school district .
She said the legislators are not taking into account how parents spend their time with their kids outside of school , such as taking part in church activities .
" There is a lot of ways to be involved in your child 's life , " she said .
" It does n't just have to take place in the school . "
At first , it may seem impressive that a 17 - year - old is making a multi - touch table running Mac OS X , similar to Microsoft 's Surface , for a science fair .
It all becomes a little more clear when you consider that the youngster , Bridger Maxwell , is from Utah .
I maintain that if more bright 17 - year - olds lived in Utah , we would already have flying cars and personal jet - packs .
After all , with nothing to do in Utah , they are forced to spend their time on things like science fairs .
Joking aside , the young whipper - snapper is currently on the second generation of his project .
The table uses infrared light emitting diodes , where an IR camera transmits input via fingertip motions to the computer running Mac OS X .
The information is then passed to an OS X - specific , multi - touch framework that was developed during last year 's Google Summer of Code called Open Touch .
Maxwell then wrote a framework that decodes the information that Open Touch interprets into Objective C objects .
He then uses the decoded information to control the user input into an application that Maxwell wrote to display comics with Core Animation effects .
The end result is the ability to manipulate the program with the user 's fingertips .
While the project is still in its infancy , as are the the libraries Maxwell relies on , the project is a great proof of concept for future modifiers .
The project is pretty impressive for a 17 - year - old , too .
Even one living in Utah .
Staring at a pattern meant to evoke an optical illusion is usually an act of idle curiosity , akin to palm reading or astrology .
The dot disappears , or it does n’t .
The silhouette of the dancer spins clockwise or counterclockwise .
The three - dimensional face materializes or not , and the explanation always seems to have something to do with the eye or creativity or even personality .
That ’s the usual cue to nod and feign renewed absorption in the pattern .
In fact , scientists have investigated such illusions for hundreds of years , looking for clues to how the brain constructs a seamless whole from the bouncing kaleidoscope of light coming through the eyes .
Brain researchers today call the illusions perceptual , not optical , because the entire visual system is involved , and their theories about what is occurring can sound as exotic as anyone ’s .
In the current issue of the journal Cognitive Science , researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Sussex argue that the brain ’s adaptive ability to see into the near future creates many common illusions .
There is a very interesting post on RH Reality Check today that reviews the American Medical Association 's recent decision to push for legislation criminalizing home birth .
Here is the text of the AMA 's Resolution 205 on Home Birth .
How do beliefs and legislation like this gain support ?
Amie Newman suggests that as soon as a fetus gains legal protections which trump a pregnant woman 's right to self - determination , a birthing mother loses all her power to make critical decisions about how and where her baby should be born .
Can you have it both ways ?
If I am not intelligent , critical or responsible enough to consider when it is the correct time to bring new life into the world through my body , how can I be trusted to know the best , most appropriate way to birth my baby into the world ?
Who should be trusted ?
Who gets to decide ?
Let 's revisit a question that was posed for anti-abortion protesters in a widely circulated video and essay .
Illegal home birth -- how much time should she do ?
Nell
Cyrus Yazdani is a 24 - year - old San Jose State University graduate with a degree in art and a job as a convention planner in Las Vegas .
But authorities say Yazdani is also “ Buket , ” one of Los Angeles ’ most prolific taggers who is featured in several heavily viewed YouTube videos defacing signs and buses .
His most popular video -- with nearly 170,000 page views -- shows him clambering behind the Hollywood Freeway sign near Melrose Avenue and tagging the structure as traffic speeds below .
Los Angeles County sheriff ’s investigators arrested Yazdani on Tuesday , saying that his moniker has marked hundreds of freeway overpasses , concrete walls and transit buses across the state and southern Nevada .
He is believed responsible for upward of $ 150,000 in property damage along the Los Angeles River and in the areas patrolled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department -- and at least that much in other parts of California .
Yazdani was nabbed when he showed up to meet with his probation officer and booked on multiple charges of felony vandalism .

Authorities are used to dealing with graffiti vandals -- even those who display their handiwork on the Internet .
But there is general agreement that “ Buket ” is different .
According to investigators , Yazdani is a professional graphic artist .
Though he works in Las Vegas , he is frequently in Los Angeles , living with roommates at a downtown Los Angeles loft .
He moved to Los Angeles two years ago , authorities said .
He ’s older than many taggers -- but his age has n’t kept him down , said Sheriff ’s Deputy Devin Vanderlaan , who has tracked Buket for months .
“ He ’s one of the most prolific taggers we ’ve seen , ” Vanderlaan said .
“ He ’s on buses , overpasses , in the L.A. riverbed -- he ’s everywhere . ”

The investigators said they spotted four “ Buket ” scrawls Tuesday during the short trip from downtown to the Crenshaw District to pick Yazdani up at the probation office .
But you do n’t have to drive throughout L.A. to see “ Buket ’s ” work -- and that ’s what did him in , authorities said .
“ Buket , ” they said , became something of an Internet sensation with the daredevil tagging 20 feet above the busy Hollywood Freeway -- vandalism captured on videotape and posted with a rap soundtrack on You Tube and numerous tagger - related blogs .
Another daylight attack captured on video appears to show “ Buket ” applying his moniker to a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus as passersby and passengers watch in surprise .

It ’s the bus video that got Vanderlaan ’s attention .
“ If he ’s brave enough to tag on an MTA bus in the middle of the day , I ’ve gotta find out who this guy is , ” he said .
Vanderlaan started investigating “ Buket ” in January , when the Internet videos began appearing .
It turned out , he quickly learned , that “ Buket ” was a well - known figure in the graffiti world whose work had been featured in the art book “ Los Angeles Graffiti . ”
The book ’s author , Roger Gastman , said “ Buket ” is known as a “ bomber ” who tries to cover as much ground with his graffiti as possible .

“ He did a lot of in - your - face graffiti , ” Gastman said .
“ He goes big , bold and as many places as he can . ”
Sheriff ’s investigators said they determined that “ Buket ” was the moniker for Yazdani , who has been arrested several times on suspicion of graffiti vandalism in cities including Los Angeles , Long Beach and San Jose .
He was on probation for a 2007 tagging conviction .
But finding Yazdani proved difficult , in part because he works in Las Vegas and travels frequently in California , authorities said .
Yazdani , who was booked into Los Angeles County Jail , could not be reached for comment .

But Vanderlaan said that when he was arrested , Yazdani insisted that he “ does n’t do it anymore . ”
Investigators , however , say they do n’t believe him .
Vanderlaan said they found spray cans at Yazdani ’s downtown loft along with images stored in a computer that allegedly showed him in action .

Upswing in graffiti
In the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County , crews removed nearly 40 million square feet of graffiti in 2007 , nearly double the 21 million square feet removed in 2004 , according to county public works records .
The cleanup cost was nearly $ 30 million .
Law enforcement officials and others said they have noticed an upswing in graffiti in recent years .
Cuba 's first gay pride parade was abruptly cancelled yesterday , moments before it was to begin .
The unofficial march , organised with Florida 's Unity Coalition , was not sanctioned by Cuba 's National Centre for Sex Education , which is headed by Mariela Castro , the daughter of President Raul Castro .
Activist Mario Jose Delgado said two organisers who were to deliver a set of demands to the Justice Ministry were detained on Tuesday .
" The president of the Cuban League Against Aids and the president of the Foundation LGTB Reinaldo Arenas in Memoriam have been arrested , " Delgado said .
" They were to be here with our written demands but now we cannot carry out our activity . "
Delgado said he had no details of the arrests .
Only one other marcher appeared for the event at Don Quixote park in the Vedado neighbourhood .
" Our society needs to be sensitised , " said Jandri Penton , 22 , a teacher .
But a passer - by , Felix Lopez , 40 , a personal trainer who said he was gay , dismissed the gay pride march as unnecessary .
" Important strides have been made , " he said .
" We do n't need to be instructed by people in Miami or any other part of the world .
We 're slowly gaining a space in our society and that 's important . "
The activists were seeking an apology from the government for its past repression and , in some cases , incarceration of openly gay citizens , and the inhumane treatment of prisoners with Aids , according to Unity .
" Despite a so - called opening in the area of gay rights ... homosexuals are still being arrested and fined in Villa Clara and ... beaten in Granma , Pinar del Rio and Santiago , " Delgado said .
" We know change is coming , but it 's coming too slowly . "
Delgado identified one of the jailed organisers as Aliomar Janjaque , 31 , a psychology student and president of the Foundation LGTB Reinaldo Arenas in Memoriam .
In an interview last week , Janjaque said homosexuals are still passed over for jobs , prevented from gathering in certain places and , in some cases , jailed because of their sexual orientation .
" Mariela Castro 's work is good and valid and we 're not criticising it , " said Janjaque last week .
" But we believe they should do more . "
In May , Mariela Castro led a public rally against homophobia that briefly brought gay activists out of the shadows .
Earlier this month , Cuban officials announced they were allowing free sex - change operations .
At Cuba 's National Centre for Sex Education , Mariela Castro 's secretary , who gave her name only as Iliana , said there would be no comment on the event .
Gay activists in southern Florida condemned the arrests and proceeded with a community rally at Club Azucar in Miami yesterday afternoon to show support for Cuba 's gays .
" It proves there is no true openness toward the gay community in Cuba , " said Efren Martinez Pulgaron of Unity Coalition , a former independent journalist who fled Cuba nine years ago .
He said Mariela Castro's May rally and the government 's recent decision to allow sex - change operations were token gestures .
" Raul Castro 's administration is simply trying to project a better image of itself .
But the truth is the gay community is still threatened and repressed . "
Bush warns ' all options ' open on Iran
MESEBERG , Germany , June 11 ( AFP ) Jun 11 , 2008
US President George W. Bush on Wednesday backed Europe - led diplomacy to convince Iran to abandon its suspect nuclear drive but warned he has not ruled out using force .
" My first choice of course is to solve this diplomatically .
All options are all the table , but the first choice is to solve this problem by working closely together , " said Bush after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
He expressed support for a European package of diplomatic and economic rewards -- put together by Berlin , London , and Paris -- if Iran 's leaders halt uranium enrichment , which can be a key step towards making atomic weapons .
" We 'll see what choice they make , " he said , one day after the European Union agreed to crack down on Iranian banks .
" We 'll give diplomacy a chance to work . "
Merkel said diplomatic pressure had already shown signs of paying off , highlighted international cooperation in squeezing the Islamic republic and warned Tehran would face more sanctions if it rejects the incentives .
" If Iran does not meet its commitments , further sanctions will have to follow , " she said .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared unswayed .
" We will not trade our dignity with anything , " the ISNA news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying , referring to the package .
" If they want to give us something , then they should sell it and we will buy it . "
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana is to visit Tehran Saturday and Sunday in an effort to convince Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities .
Iran denies its nuclear programme hides an atomic weapons push and has made its own diplomatic overture -- which does not include halting uranium enrichment .
Bush met Merkel as part of his last tour of Europe before he steps down in January , a voyage that began in Slovenia Monday and takes him to Italy , the Vatican , France , and Britain .
The US president is still widely unpopular over the Iraq war that Germany , France and Russia fiercely opposed , as well as his resistance to European - favoured strategies for battling climate change .
" I hope that with regard to climate change we will take constructive steps forward in Japan " where the Group of Eight industrialized nations will meet in July , Merkel said after hosting Bush at a palace in Meseberg , a village north of Berlin .
Last year Merkel was credited with winning concessions from Bush on climate change at a G8 summit in Germany -- albeit non-binding pledges on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on which he has been accused of reneging .
Bush urged Germany to step up its commitments in Afghanistan , and said there was little he would have done differently in Iraq .
The unpopular president predicted that Washington and Baghdad would strike a deal on the long term presence of US forces in Iraq after the UN mandate lapses at the end of 2008 .
But he angrily denounced " erroneous " news reports that he seeks permanent US military bases .
The White House has said it does not consider any US military bases in the world , except perhaps Guantanamo Bay , as permanent , because host countries could ask US forces to leave .
The talks came with much of Europe is waiting to see who takes over from Bush in January .
There were no anti-Bush demonstrations in Germany but several political officials in Berlin , including leading figures from Merkel 's own conservative party , said he would not be missed .
" The disaster after the war in Iraq caused serious damage to the image of the United States , and not just in Germany , " the foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Union 's parliamentary group , Eckart von Klaeden , said .
In 2006 , Bush and Merkel bonded over pickled herring and barbecued boar on Germany 's Baltic coast and the chancellor has tried to strike a balance between rebuilding ties to Washington and reserving the right to criticise US policy .
This time Merkel , Bush and their spouses dined on asparagus and schnitzel with strawberries for dessert , and strolled together in the gardens of Meseberg Palace , an 18th - century baroque residence turned government guest house .
( Natural News )
An FDA advisory panel has recommended stronger warnings on two influenza drugs after reviewing evidence linking them to neurological and psychiatric problems that have led to deaths in some cases .
The current warning on Roche Laboratories ' Tamiflu ( generic name oseltamivir ) urges close monitoring of flu patients , particularly children , for " increased risk of self injury and confusion shortly after taking Tamiflu . "
The panel recommended that this warning be strengthened to say that " in some cases , these behaviors resulted in serious injuries , including death , in adult and pediatric patients .
" The label of Glaxo SmithKline 's Relenza ( generic name zanamivir ) , the panel said , should be strengthened to mention " reports of hallucinations , delirium and abnormal behavior . "
The panel said that both labels should mention that some flu patients not taking the drugs have also experienced such symptoms .
There have been no reported deaths from Tamiflu in the United States , but in Japan , where the drug is much more widely used , at least 14 deaths have been reported .
Five children under the age of 17 died after " falling from windows or balconies or running into traffic , " according to the FDA .
According to Roche , two people under the age of 21 died from a brain infection , and seven deaths from neuropsychiatric symptoms have also been attributed to use of the drug by adults .
Since Tamiflu 's introduction in 1999 , a total of 48 million prescriptions have been written , 75 percent of them in Japan .
According to Roche , 1,745 of 1,808 reports of side effects came from Japan .
The FDA has noted that people in Japan appear to be more likely to report side effects than people in the United States .
In March , Japan issued a warning against prescribing Tamiflu to people between the ages of 10 and 19 , and South Korea followed suit a month later with a warning against use by teenagers .
Gen Hood would have been a highly controversial appointment Pakistan says it has asked the United States not to appoint the former head of the US prison at Guantanamo as military envoy in Islamabad .
Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said his government had " genuine reservations " over the appointment of Maj - Gen Jay Hood .
Washington has already cancelled the posting , The New York Times reports .
No formal announcement has been made .
Correspondents say the appointment would have provoked uproar in Pakistan .
Hundreds of Muslim prisoners , many from Pakistan , have been held at Guantanamo without charge since the prison was set up following the 11 September , 2001 attacks on the US .
' Sensitivities ' Pakistan 's foreign minister said his government wanted Washington to respect its concerns over Gen Hood 's proposed assignment .
We have genuine reservations and want these to be respected
Shah Mehmood Qureshi ,
Pakistan foreign minister " We are allies and partners and we understand , and we should understand , each other 's needs , " Mr Qureshi told the Senate , parliament 's upper house , on Friday .
" If ... our request is not entertained then we have options not to allow Hood and people sharing his thinking inside Pakistani territory . "
On Thursday a spokesman for Pakistan 's foreign office said the US would take a decision on the posting bearing in mind Pakistani " sentiments and sensitivities " .
Maj - Gen
Hood would have become the most senior US officer in Pakistan , a key ally in the US - led " war on terror " .
His appointment was announced in March .
" It reflected the military 's aim to put a crisis - tested veteran in a critical job at a pivotal time in the fight against al - Qaeda and the Taleban in Pakistan 's tribal areas , " the New York Times reported .
The paper quoted a US Central Command spokesman as saying Gen Hood was now being considered for " a different , equally important job " at command headquarters .
During Gen Hood 's command at Guantanamo between 2004 and 2006 detainees on hunger strike were force - fed with tubes .
Brig Gen Jay Hood admitted in 2005 that there had been a number of incidents involving Guantanamo guards showing " mishandling " the Koran .
In recent weeks , a number of reports in the Pakistani media have been highly critical of Gen Hood 's proposed posting .

Firefox fans held parties around the world to mark download day Mozilla is claiming a download record for the release of Firefox 3.0 .
In the first 24 hours the web browser was available the software was downloaded more than eight million times , says its creator Mozilla .
Statistics from the download servers are being scrutinised to produce an official figure that will be passed to the Guinness World Record organisation .
But the launch was marred by news from computer security firms who have found the first flaws in the software .
Big figures
The attempt to set the download record was scheduled to begin at 1300 PST ( 2000 GMT ) on 17 June .
However , the record attempt was almost wrecked from the start as the servers handling the downloads collapsed under the weight of visitors checking to see if new version was available .
Once the servers were up and functioning normally the record attempt began .
At their busiest the servers were handling more than 9,000 downloads per minute .
Within five hours the number of downloads for Version 3.0 exceeded the 1.6 million set by Firefox 2.0 in October 2006 .
In total Firefox 3.0 was downloaded 8.3 million times over the 24 hour record setting period .
The figure beats the five million Mozilla predicted before the day .
Logs from the download servers have been handed to the Open Source Labs at Oregon State University for auditing .
The scrutiny will ensure duplicate and unfinished downloads are not counted .
The verification process could take a week to complete .
The surge of interest in Firefox 3.0 has continued and Mozilla has reported that the software has now been downloaded more than 10 million times .
However , some of the shine of the launch was removed by reports that a security firm had already found a flaw in the browser .
DV Labs / Tipping Point reported a flaw only five hours after Firefox 3.0 debuted .
The flaw potentially lets an attacker take over a PC if a user clicks on a booby - trapped link .

Genshi Tutorial
This tutorial is intended to give an introduction on how to use Genshi in your web application , and present common patterns and best practices .
It is aimed at developers new to Genshi as well as those who 've already used Genshi , but are looking for advice or inspiration on how to improve that usage .
Introduction
In this tutorial we 'll create a simple Python web application based on ​ CherryPy 3 .
CherryPy was chosen because it provides a convenient level of abstraction over raw CGI or ​WSGI development , but is less ambitious than full - stack web frameworks such as ​ Pylons or ​ Django , which tend to come with a preferred templating language , and often show significant bias towards that language .
The application we 'll build here is a stripped - down version of sites such as ​reddit or ​digg : it lets users submit links to online articles they find interesting , and then lets other users comment on those stories .
Just for kicks , we 'll call that application Geddit ?.
We 'll keep the project as simple as possible , while still showing many of Genshi 's features and how to best use them :
For persistence , we 'll use native Python object serialization ( via the pickle module ) , instead of an SQL database and an ORM .
module ) , instead of an SQL database and an ORM .
There 's no authentication of any kind .
Anyone can submit links , anyone can comment .
We 'll start with the basics ( rendering templates , handling forms , etc ) , and then continue by adding features such as Atom feeds and an AJAX interface .
Content
Getting Started
Prerequisites
First , make sure you have CherryPy 3.0.x installed , as well as recent versions of ​ FormEncode and obviously Genshi .
You can download and install those manually , or just use ​easy_install :
$ easy_install CherryPy $ easy_install FormEncode $ easy_install Genshi
The CherryPy Application
Next , set up the basic Cherry Py application .
Create a directory that should contain the application Inside that directory create a Python package named geddit by doing the following : Create a geddit directory
directory Create an empty file called __init__.py inside the geddit directory Inside the geddit package directory , create a file called controller .py with the following content :
#!/usr /bin/env python import operator , os , pickle , sys import cherrypy class Root ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , data ) : self .
data = data @cherrypy .expose def index ( self ) : return ' Geddit ' def main ( filename ) : data = {} #
We 'll replace this later #
Some global configuration ; note that this could be moved into a # configuration file cherrypy .
config .
update ( { ' tools.encode.on ' : True , ' tools.encode.encoding ' : ' utf - 8 ' , ' tools.decode.on ' : True , ' tools.trailing_slash.on ' : True , ' tools.staticdir.root ' : os . path .
abspath ( os . path .
dirname ( __file__ ) ) , } ) cherrypy .
quickstart ( Root ( data ) , '/' , { '/ media ' : { ' tools.staticdir.on ' : True , ' tools.staticdir.dir ' : ' static ' } } ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main ( sys . argv [ 1 ] )
Enter the tutorial directory in the terminal , and run :
$ PYTHONPATH =.
python geddit/controller.py geddit.db
Note :
On some Windows systems you may have to enter two lines : SET PYTHONPATH = .
python geddit/controller.py geddit.db
You should see a log message pointing you to the URL where the application is being served , which is usually ​http://localhost:8080/.
Visiting that page will respond with just the string “ Geddit ” , as that 's what the index ( ) method of the Root object returns .
Note that we 've configured CherryPy to serve static files from the geddit / static directory .
CherryPy will complain that that directory does not exist , so create it , but leave it empty for now .
We 'll add static resources later on in the tutorial .
Basic Template Rendering
So far the code does n't actually use Genshi , or even any kind of templating .
Let 's change that .
Inside of the geddit directory , create a directory called templates , and inside that directory create a file called index.html , with the following content :
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > $ title </ title > </ head > < body class= " index " > < div id= " header " > < h1 > $ title </h1 > </div > < p > Welcome ! </ p> < div id= " footer " > < hr /> < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div > </body > </html >
Note : make sure you 're saving this file using UTF - 8 encoding with your editor .
If for some reason you can't use UTF - 8 ( maybe you 're using an outdated editor ) , replace the “ © ” character in the template with the corresponding character entity “ © ” .
The same is true for all other template files in this tutorial .
This is basically an almost static XHTML file with some simple variable substitution : the string $ title will be replaced by a variable of that name that we 'll pass into the template from the controller .
There are couple of important things to point out here :
Variables substituted into templates , such as $ title in our example , can be of any Python data type .
Genshi will convert the value to a string and insert the result into the generated output stream .
in our example , can be of any Python data type .
Genshi will convert the value to a string and insert the result into the generated output stream .
You generally do not need to worry about XML - escaping such variables .
Genshi will automatically take care of that when the template is serialized .
We 'll look into the details of this process later .
The template will be parsed by Genshi using an XML parser , which means that it needs to be well - formed XML .
If you know HTML but are unfamiliar with XML / XHTML , you will need to read up on the topic .
Here are a couple of good references : ​ Differences Between XHTML
And HTML at W3Schools ​ XHTML - An Introduction at SitePoint
.
If you know HTML but are unfamiliar with XML / XHTML , you will need to read up on the topic .
Here are a couple of good references :
Just because the template uses XHTML does not mean that our web - application should generate XHTML !
While that is possible , you can also choose to generate good old HTML 4.01 , because , despite all the hype , that 's still the format that works best in most browsers ( see ​ this blog post over at Surfin ' Safari for some background ) .
We now need to change the controller code so that this template is used .
First , add the Genshi TemplateLoader to the imports at the top of the geddit / controller .py file , and instantiate a loader for the geddit / templates directory :
import cherrypy from genshi. template import TemplateLoader loader = TemplateLoader ( os . path .
join ( os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) , ' templates ' ) , auto_reload = True )
Next , change the implementation of the index ( ) method of the Root class to look like this :
@cherrypy .expose def index ( self ) : tmpl = loader .
load ( ' index.html ' ) return tmpl .
generate ( title = ' Geddit ' ) . render ( ' html ' , doctype = ' html ' )
This asks the template loader for a template named index.html , generates the output stream , and finally serializes the output to HTML .
When you now reload the page in your browser , you should get back the following HTML response :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < html > < head > < title > Geddit </ title > </ head > < body class= " index " > < div id= " header " > < h1 > Geddit </h1 > </div > < p > Welcome ! </ p> < div id= " footer " > < hr > < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div > </body > </html >
Note that the output has some subtle differences compared to the template , even beyond the variable substitution that has taken place : Genshi has added a proper HTML DOCTYPE ( important to get the browser to render using standards mode , through a commonly employed mechanism in web browsers called “ ​doctype switching ” . )
It has also removed the XHTML namespace declaration , because we 're rendering to HTML , and HTML does n't support XML namespaces .
And the < hr > element in the footer is missing the trailing slash that can be used in XML markup for empty elements ; HTML user agents know that < hr > is always an empty element , and including either the trailing slash , or even adding an explicit < / hr > end tag would be invalid and might even confuse some browsers .
The Data Model
To continue , we 'll need to first add some Python classes to define the data model the application will use .
As mentioned above , we 're using a simple pickle file for persistence , so all we need to do here is create a couple of very simple Python classes .
Inside the geddit directory , create a file named model.py , with the following content :
from datetime import datetime class Link ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , username , url , title ) : self .
username = username self .
url = url self .
title = title self .
time = datetime .
utcnow ( ) self .
id = hex ( hash ( tuple ( [ username , url , title , self . time ] ) ) ) [ 2 :] self .
comments = [ ] def __repr__ ( self ) : return '< %s %r >' % ( type ( self ) .
__name__ , self .
title ) def add_comment ( self , username , content ) : comment = Comment ( username , content ) self .
comments .
append ( comment ) return comment class Comment ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , username , content ) : self .
username = username self .
content = content self .
time = datetime . utcnow ( ) def __repr__ ( self ) : return '< %s by %r >' % ( type ( self ) .
__name__ , self .
username )
You 'll need to import those classes in geddit / controller.py , just below the other imports :
from geddit. model import Link , Comment
And in the main ( ) function , let 's replace the placeholder data = {} with some code to read our data from the pickle file , and write it back :
def main ( filename ) : # load data from the pickle file , or initialize it to an empty list if os .
path .
exists ( filename ) : fileobj = open ( filename , ' rb ' ) try : data = pickle .
load ( fileobj ) finally : fileobj .
close ( ) else : data = {} def _save_data ( ) : # save data back to the pickle file fileobj = open ( filename , ' wb ' ) try : pickle .
dump ( data , fileobj ) finally : fileobj . close ( ) if hasattr ( cherrypy .
engine , ' subscribe ' ) : # CherryPy >= 3.1 cherrypy .
engine .
subscribe ( ' stop ' , _save_data ) else : cherrypy .
engine . on_stop_engine_list .
append ( _save_data )
Now let 's add some initial content to our “ database ” .
Note :
You 'll need to stop the Cherry Py server to do the following , otherwise your changes will get overwritten .
In the terminal , from the tutorial directory , launch the interactive Python shell by executing PYTHONPATH =.
python , and enter the following code :
>>> from geddit. model import * >>> link1 = Link ( username = ' joe ' , url = ' http://example.org/' , title = ' An example ' ) >>> link1 .
add_comment ( username = ' jack ' , content = ' Bla bla bla ' ) < Comment by ' jack ' > >>> link1 .
add_comment ( username = ' joe ' , content = ' Bla bla bla , bla bla . ' )
< Comment by ' joe ' > >>> link2 = Link ( username = ' annie ' , url = ' http://reddit.com/' , title =
' The real thing ' ) >>> import pickle >>> pickle .
dump ( { link1 . id : link1 , link2 . id : link2 } , open ( ' geddit.db ' , ' wb ' ) ) >>> ^ D # Control - Z ( ^Z ) on Windows
You should now have two links in the pickle file , with the first link having two comments .
Start the CherryPy server again by running :
$ PYTHONPATH =.
python geddit/controller.py geddit.db
Making the Application “ Do Stuff ”
Extending the Template
Now let 's change the Root.index ( ) method in geddit / controller.py to pass the links list to the template :
@cherrypy .expose def index ( self ) : links = sorted ( self . data . values ( ) , key = operator .
attrgetter ( ' time ' ) ) tmpl = loader .
load ( ' index.html ' ) stream = tmpl .
generate ( links = links ) return stream .
render ( ' html ' , doctype = ' html ' )
And finally , we 'll modify the index.html template so that it displays the links in a simple ordered list .
While we 're at it , let 's add a link to submit new items :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < head > < title > Geddit : News </ title > </ head > < body class= " index " > < div id= " header " > < h1 > News </h1 > </div > < ol py:if= " links " > < li py:for= " link in reversed ( links ) " > <!--
FAILS HERE : unable to read link object but can read links --> < a href= " $ { link .
url } " > $ { link .
title } </a> posted by ${ link .
username } at ${ link .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } </li > </ ol > < p >< a class= " action " href= " / submit / " >
Submit new link </a></p> < div id= " footer " > < hr /> < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div > </body > </html >
This template demonstrates some aspects of Genshi that we 've not seen so far :
We declare the py : namespace prefix on the < html > element , which is required to be able to add directives to the template .
namespace prefix on the element , which is required to be able to add directives to the template .
There 's a py : if condition on the < ol > element .
That means that the < ol > and everything it contains will only be included in the output stream if the expression links evaluates to a truth value .
In this case we know that links is a list ( assembled by the Root.index ( ) method ) , so if the list is empty , the < ol > will be skipped .

You can tell that we can also use more complex expressions than just simple variable substitutions : the directives such as py : if and py : for take Python expressions of any complexity , and you can include Python expressions in other places by putting them inside curly braces prefixed with a dollar sign ( $ {...} ) .
When you reload the page in the browser , you should get something like this :
Adding a Submission Form
In the previous step , we 've already added a link to a submission form to the template , but we have n't implemented the logic to handle requests to that link yet .
To do that , we need to add a method to the Root class in geddit / controller.py :
@cherrypy .expose def submit ( self , cancel = False , ** data ) : if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) # TODO : validate the input data !
link = Link ( ** data ) self .
data [ link .
id ] = link raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) tmpl = loader .
load ( ' submit.html ' ) stream = tmpl .
generate ( ) return stream .
render ( ' html ' , doctype = ' html ' )
Note : we explicitly check for the HTTP request method here .
And only if it 's a “ POST ” request we actually go and look into the submitted data and add it to the database .
That 's because “ GET ” requests in HTTP are ​supposed to be idempotent , that is , they should not have side effects .
If we did n't make this check , we 'd also be accepting requests that would change the database via “ GET ” or “ HEAD ” , thereby violating the rules .
And of course we 'll need to add a template to display the submission form .
In geddit / templates , create a file named submit. html , with the following content :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < head > < title > Geddit : Submit new link </ title > </ head > < body class= " submit " > < div id= " header " > < h1 > Submit new link </ h1 > </div > < form action= " " method= " post " > < table summary= " " >< tbody > < tr > < th >< label for= " username " >
Your name : </ label ></th > < td >< input type= " text " id= " username " name= " username " /></td> </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " url " > Link URL : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " url " name= " url " /></td> </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " title " >
Title : </ label ></th > < td >< input type= " text " name= " title " /></td> </tr>< tr> < td></td> < td> < input type= " submit " value= " Submit " /> < input type= " submit " name= " cancel " value= " Cancel " /> </td> </tr></tbody></table> </ form > < div id= " footer " > < hr /> < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div > </body > </html >
Now , if you click on the “ Submit new link ” link on the start page , you should see the submission form .
Filling out the form and clicking " Submit " will post a new link and take you to the start page .
Clicking on the “ Cancel ” button , will take you back to the start page , but not add a link .
Please note though that we 're not performing any kind of validation on the input , and that 's of course a bad thing .
So let 's add validation next .
Adding Form Validation
We 'll use ​ FormEncode to do the validation , but we 'll keep it all fairly basic .
Let 's declare our form in a separate file , namely geddit / form.py , which will have the following content :
from formencode import Schema , validators class LinkForm ( Schema ) : username = validators .
UnicodeString ( not_empty = True ) url = validators .
URL ( not_empty = True , add_http =
True , check_exists = False ) title = validators .
UnicodeString ( not_empty = True ) class CommentForm ( Schema ) : username = validators .
UnicodeString ( not_empty = True ) content = validators .
UnicodeString ( not_empty = True )
Now let 's use those in the Root.submit ( ) method .
First add the form classes , as well as the Invalid exception type used by FormEncode , to the imports at the top of geddit / controller .py , which should then look something like this :
import cherrypy from formencode import Invalid from genshi. template import TemplateLoader from geddit.form import LinkForm , CommentForm from geddit. model import Link , Comment
Then , update the submit ( ) method to match the following :
@cherrypy .expose def submit ( self , cancel = False , ** data ) : if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) form = LinkForm ( ) try : data = form .
to_python ( data ) link = Link ( ** data ) self .
data [ link .
id ] = link raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) except Invalid , e : errors = e . unpack_errors ( ) else : errors = {} tmpl = loader .
load ( ' submit.html ' ) stream = tmpl .
generate ( errors = errors ) return stream .
render ( ' html ' , doctype = ' html ' )
As you can tell , we now only add the submitted link to our database when validation is successful : all fields need to be filled out , and the url field needs to contain a valid URL .
If the submission is valid , we proceed as before .
If it is not valid , we render the submission form template again , passing it the dictionary of validation errors .
Let 's modify the submit.html template so that it displays those error messages :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < head > < title > Geddit : Submit new link </ title > </ head > < body class= " submit " > < div id= " header " > < h1 > Submit new link </ h1 > </div > < form action= " " method= " post " > < table summary= " " >< tbody > < tr > < th >< label for= " username " >
Your name : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " username " name= " username " /> < span py:if= " ' username ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
username } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " url " > Link URL : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " url " name= " url " /> < span py:if= " 'url ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
url } </ span > </td> </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " title " > Title : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " name= " title " /> < span py:if= " ' title ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
title } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr>
< td></td> < td> < input type= " submit " value= " Submit " /> < input type= " submit " name= " cancel " value= " Cancel " /> </td> </tr></tbody></table> </ form > < div id= " footer " > < hr /> < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div > </ body > </html >
So now , if you submit the form without entering a title , and having entered an invalid URL , you 'd see something like the following :
But there 's a problem here :
Note how the input values have vanished from the form !
We 'd have to repopulate the form manually from the data submitted so far .
We could do that by adding the required value= " " attributes to the text fields in the template , but Genshi provides a more elegant way : the HTMLFormFiller stream filter .
Given a dictionary of values , it can automatically populate HTML forms in the template output stream .
To enable this functionality , first you 'll need to add the following import to the geddit / controller .py file :
from genshi.filters import HTMLFormFiller
Next , update the bottom lines of the Root.submit ( ) method implementation so that they look as follows :
tmpl = loader .
load ( ' submit.html ' ) stream = tmpl .
generate ( errors = errors ) | HTMLFormFiller ( data = data ) return stream .
render ( ' html ' , doctype = ' html ' )
Now , all entered values are preserved when validation errors occur .
Note that the form is populated as the template is being generated , there is no reparsing and reserialization of the output .
Improving the Application
Factoring out the Templating
By now , we already have some repetitive code when it comes to rendering templates : both the Root.index ( ) and the Root.submit ( ) methods look very similar in that regard : they load a specific template , call its generate ( ) method passing it some data , and then call the render ( ) method of the resulting stream .
As we 're going to be adding more controller methods , let 's factor out those things into a library module .
There 's a special challenge here , though : we still want to be able to add the HTMLFormFiller or other stream filters to the template output stream , which needs to be done before that output stream is serialized .
We 'll use a combination of a decorator and a regular function to achieve that , which collaborate using the Cherry Py thread - local context .
Create a directory called lib inside the geddit directory , and inside the lib directory create two files , named __init__.py and template .py , respectively .
Leave the first one empty , and in the second one , insert the following code :
import os import cherrypy from genshi.core import Stream from genshi.output import encode , get_serializer from genshi. template import Context , TemplateLoader loader = TemplateLoader ( os . path .
join ( os .
path .
dirname ( __file__ ) , '..' , ' templates ' ) , auto_reload =
True ) def output ( filename , method = ' html ' , encoding = ' utf - 8 ' , ** options ) : " " " Decorator for exposed methods to specify what template they should use for rendering , and which serialization method and options should be applied . " " " def decorate ( func ) : def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) : cherrypy .
thread_data .
template = loader .
load ( filename ) opt = options .
copy ( ) if method == ' html ' : opt .
setdefault ( ' doctype ' , ' html ' ) serializer = get_serializer ( method , ** opt ) stream = func ( * args , ** kwargs ) if not isinstance ( stream , Stream ) : return stream return encode ( serializer ( stream ) , method = serializer , encoding = encoding ) return wrapper return decorate def render ( * args , ** kwargs ) : " " " Function to render the given data to the template specified via the ``@output`` decorator . " " " if args : assert len ( args ) == 1 , \ ' Expected exactly one argument , but got %r ' % ( args , ) template = loader .
load ( args [ 0 ] ) else : template = cherrypy .
thread_data .
template ctxt = Context ( url = cherrypy .
url ) ctxt .
push ( kwargs ) return template .
generate ( ctxt )
In the geddit / controller .py file , you can now remove the from genshi. template import TemplateLoader line , and also the instantiation of the TemplateLoader , as that is now done in our new library module .
Of course , you 'll have to import that library module instead :
from geddit.lib import template
Now , we can change the Root class to match the following :
class Root ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , data ) : self .
data = data @cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' index.html ' ) def index ( self ) : links = sorted ( self . data . values ( ) , key = operator .
attrgetter ( ' time ' ) ) return template .
render ( links = links ) @cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' submit.html ' ) def submit ( self , cancel = False , ** data ) : if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) form = LinkForm ( ) try : data = form .
to_python ( data ) link = Link ( ** data ) self .
data [ link .
id ] = link raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/' ) except Invalid , e : errors = e . unpack_errors ( ) else : errors = {} return template .
render ( errors = errors ) | HTMLFormFiller ( data = data )
As you can see here , the code is now less repetitive : there 's a simple decorator to define which template should be used , and the render ( ) function produces the template output stream which can then be further processed if necessary .
Adding a Layout Template
But there 's also duplication in the template files themselves : each template has to redefine the complete header and footer , and any other “ decoration ” markup that we may want to apply to the complete site .
Now , we could simply put those commonly used markup snippets into separate HTML files and include them in the templates where they are needed .
But Genshi provides a more elegant way to apply a common structure to different templates : match templates .
Most template languages provide an inheritance mechanism to allow different templates to share some kind of common structure , such as a common header , navigation , and footer .
Using this mechanism , you create a “ master template ” in which you declare slots that “ derived templates ” can fill in .
The problem with this approach is that it is fairly rigid : the master needs to know which content the templates will produce , and what kind of slots need to be provided for them to stuff their content in .
Also , a derived template is itself not a valid or even well - formed HTML file , and can not be easily previewed or edited in a WYSIWYG authoring tool .
Match templates in Genshi turn this upside down .
They are conceptually similar to running an XSLT transformation over your template output : you create rules that match elements in the template output stream based on XPath patterns .
Whenever there is a match , the matched content is replaced by what the match template produces .
This sounds complicated in theory , but is fairly intuitive in practice , so let 's look at a concrete example .
In the geddit / templates / directory , add a file named layout . html , with the following content :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " py:strip= " " > < py:match path= " head " once= " true " > < head py:attrs= " select ( '@ * ' ) " > < title py : with= " title = list ( select ( ' title /text ( ) ' ) ) " > Geddit < py : if test= " title " > : $ { title } </ py:if > </ title > < link rel= " stylesheet " href= " $ { url ( '/ media/layout.css ' ) } " type= " text/css " /> < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " ${url ( '/media/jquery.js ' ) } " ></script > $ { select ( ' * [ local - name ( ) ! =" title " ] ' ) } </head > </ py:match > < py : match path= " body " once= " true " > < body py:attrs= " select ( '@ * ' ) " >< div id= " wrap " > < div id= " header " > < a href= " / " >< img src= " $ { url ( '/ media/logo.gif ' ) } " width= " 201 " height= " 79 " alt= " geddit ? "
/></a> </div > < div id= " content " > $ { select ( ' * |text ( ) ' ) } </div > < div id= " footer " > < hr /> < p class= " legalese " > © 2007 Edgewall Software </ p> </div> </div></body > </ py:match > </html >
That contains a whole lot of things , so let 's break it up into smaller pieces and go through the various aspects to clarify them .
The Document Element
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " py:strip= " " >
First , note that the root element of the template is an < html > tag .
This is needed because markup templates are XML documents , and XML documents require a single root element ( we also use it to attach our namespace declarations , but we could just as well do that on the nested < py : match > elements ) .
However , because the page templates that include this file will also have < html > root elements , we add the py : strip= " " directive so that this second < html > tag does n't make it through into the output stream .
Match Template Definition
< py : match path= " head " once= " true " >
Here we define the first match template .
The path attribute contains an XPath pattern specifying which elements this match template should be applied to .
In this case , the XPath is very simple : it matches any element with the tag name “ head ” , so it will be applied to the < head > ...</ head > element .
We also add the once =" true " attribute to tell Genshi that we only expect a single occurrence of the < head > element in the stream .
Genshi can perform some optimizations based on this information .
Selecting Matched Content
< head py:attrs= " select ( '@ * ' ) " >
Inside match templates , you can use the special function select ( path ) to access the element that matched the pattern .
Here we use that function in the py : attrs directive , which basically translates to “ get all attributes on the matched element , and add them to this element ” .
So for example if your page template contained < head id = " foo " > , the element produced by this match template would also have the same id = " foo " attribute .
< title py : with= " title = list ( select ( ' title /text ( ) ' ) ) " > Geddit < py : if test= " title " > : $ { title } </ py:if > </ title >
This is a more complex example for selecting matched content : it fetches the text contained in the < title > element of the original < head > and prefixes it with the string “ Geddit : ” .
But as page templates may not even contain a < title > element , we first check whether it exists , and only add the colon if it does .
Thus , if the page has no title of its own , the result will be “ Geddit ” .
${ select ( ' * [ local - name ( ) ! =" title " ] ' ) }
Finally , this is an example for using a more complex XPath pattern .
This select ( ) incantation here returns a stream that contains all child elements of the original < head > , except for those elements with the tag name “ title ” .
If we did n't add that predicate , the output stream would contain two < title > tags .
If you 've done a bit of XSLT , match templates should look familiar .
Otherwise , you may want to familiarize yourself with the basics of ​XPath 1 — but note that Genshi only implements a subset of the full spec as explained in Using XPath in Genshi .
Just play around with match templates a bit ; at the core , the concept is actually pretty simple and consistent .
Now we need to update the page templates : they no longer need the header and footer , and we 'll have to include the layout .
html file so that the match templates are applied .
For the inclusion , we add the namespace prefix for XInclude , and an xi:include element .
Let 's see how the template should look now for index.html :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title > News </ title > </ head > < body class= " index " > < h1 > News </h1 > < ol py:if= " links " > < li py:for= " link in links " > < a href= " $ { link .
url } " > $ { link .
title } </a> posted by ${ link .
username } at ${ link .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } </li > </ ol > < p >< a class= " action " href= " / submit / " >
Submit new link </a></p> </body > </html >
Also change the submit.html template analogously , by adding the namespace prefix , the < xi:include > element , and by removing the header and footer < div > s :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title >
Submit new link </ title > </ head > < body class= " submit " > < h1 > Submit new link </ h1 > < form action= " " method= " post " > < table summary= " " >< tbody > < tr > < th >< label for= " username " >
Your name : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " username " name= " username " /> < span py:if= " ' username ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
username } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " url " > Link URL : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " url " name= " url " /> < span py:if= " 'url ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
url } </ span > </td> </tr > < tr > < th >< label for= " title " >
Title : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " name= " title " /> < span py:if= " ' title ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
title } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr>
< td></td> < td> < input type= " submit " value= " Submit " /> < input type= " submit " name= " cancel " value= " Cancel " /> </td> </tr></tbody></table> </ form > </ body > </html >
And speaking of “ layout ” , you can see that we 've added references to some static resources in the layout template : there 's an embedded image as well as a linked stylesheet and javascript file .
​ Download those files and put them in your geddit / static / directory .
When you reload the front page in your browser , you should now see something similar to the following :
We 're still missing an important bit of functionality : people should be able to comment on submitted links .
Three things are needed to implement that :
a detail view of a link , showing all comments made so far ,
a way to get to that page from the list of links , and ,
a form to add new comments .
Note that on the model side we 're covered , there 's already a Comment class in geddit .
model , and we even have two comments in our database already .
And we already have to form that 'll be used to validate comment submissions , in form of the class CommentForm in geddit .
form .
So let 's add the rest by extending the index.html template to show how many comments there are so far , and make that a link to the detail page .
Change your geddit / templates / index.html file to match the following :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title > News </ title > </ head > < body class= " index " > < h1 > News </h1 > < ol py:if= " links " class= " links " > < li py:for= " link in links " > < a href= " $ { link .
url } " > $ { link .
title } </a> posted by ${ link .
username } at ${ link .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } < div class= " info " > < a href= " $ { url ( '/ info / %s /' % link . id ) } " > $ { len ( link .
comments ) } comments </ a> </div > </li > </ ol > < p >< a class= " action " href= " $ { url ( ' / submit / ' ) } " > Submit new link </a></p> </body > </html >
We 've added a < div class = " info " > for every link in the list , each containing the number of comments , and linking to the detail page .
Of couse , if you click on those links , you 'll get an error page : we have n't implemented the info ( ) view yet !
Let 's do that now .
Add the following method to the Root class :
@cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' info.html ' ) def info ( self , id ) : link = self .
data .
get ( id ) if not link : raise cherrypy .
NotFound ( ) return template .
render ( link = link )
And then add the needed temlate geddit / templates / info. html with the following content :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title > $ { link .
title } </ title > </ head > < body class= " info " > < h1 > $ { link .
title } </h1 > < a href= " $ { link .
url } " > $ { link .
url } </a>< br /> posted by ${ link .
username } at ${ link .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } < br /> < ul py:if= " link .
comments " class= " comments " >
< li py:for= " idx , comment in enumerate ( link .
comments ) " id= " comment $idx " > < strong > $ { comment .
username } </ strong > at $ { comment .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } < blockquote > $ { comment .
content } </ blockquote > </li > </ul > < p >< a class= " action " href= " $ { url ( '/ comment / %s /' % link . id ) } " > Add comment
</a></p> </body > </html >
At this point you should be able to see the number of comments on the start page , click on that link to get to the details page , where you should see all comments listed for the corresponding link submission .
That page also contains a link for submitting additional comments , and that 's what we 'll need to set up next .
We need to add the method for handling comment submissions to our Root object .
It should look like this :
@cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' comment.html ' ) def comment ( self , id , cancel = False , ** data ) : link = self .
data .
get ( id ) if not link : raise cherrypy .
NotFound ( ) if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) form = CommentForm ( ) try : data = form .
to_python ( data ) comment = link .
add_comment ( ** data ) raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) except Invalid , e : errors = e . unpack_errors ( ) else : errors = {} return template .
render ( link = link , comment = None , errors = errors ) | HTMLFormFiller ( data = data )
Last but not least , we need the template that renders the comment submission form .
Inside geddit / templates , add a file named comment . html , and insert the following content :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title >
Comment on “ $ { link .
title } ” < / title > </ head > < body class= " comment " > < h1 > Comment on “ $ { link .
title } ” </h1 > < p py:if= " comment " >
In reply to < strong > $ { comment .
username } </ strong > at $ { comment .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } : < blockquote > $ { comment .
content } </ blockquote > </ p> < form action= " " method= " post " > < table summary= " " >< tbody > < tr > < th >< label for= " username " >
Your name : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " username " name= " username " /> < span py:if= " ' username ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
username } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " comment " > Comment : </ label ></th > < td > < textarea id= " comment " name= " content " rows= " 6 " cols= " 50 " ></textarea > < span py:if= " ' content ' in errors " class= " error " >< br /> $ { errors .
content } </ span > </td > </tr></tbody></table> < div > < input type= " submit " value= " Submit " /> < input type= " submit " name= " cancel " value= " Cancel " /> </div> </ form > </ body > </html >
Phew !
We should be done with the commenting now .
Play around with the application a bit to get a feel for what we 've achieved so far .
The next section will look into various things that can be done to further improve the application .
Advanced Topics
Adding an Atom Feed
Every web site needs an RSS or ​ Atom feed these days .
So we shall provide one too .
Adding Atom feeds to Geddit is fairly straightforward .
First , we 'll need to add auto - discovery links to the index and detail pages .
Inside the < head > element of geddit / templates / index.html , add :
< link rel= " alternate " type= " application / atom+xml " title= " Geddit " href= " $ { url ( ' / feed / ' ) } " />
And inside the < head > element of geddit / templates / info.html , add :
< link rel= " alternate " type= " application / atom+xml " title= " Geddit : ${ link .
title } " href= " $ { url ( '/ feed / %s /' % link . id ) } " />
Now we need to add the feed ( ) method to our Root class in geddit / controller.py :
@cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' index.xml ' , method = ' xml ' ) def feed ( self , id = None ) : if id : link = self .
data .
get ( id ) if not link : raise cherrypy .
NotFound ( ) return template .
render ( ' info.xml ' , link = link ) else : links = sorted ( self . data . values ( ) , key = operator .
attrgetter ( ' time ' ) ) return template .
render ( links = links )
Note that this method dispatches to different templates depending on whether the id parameter was provided .
So , for the URL / feed / , we 'll render the list of links using the template index.xml , and for the URL / feed / {link_id} / , we 'll render a link and the list of related comments using the template info.xml .
The templates for this are also pretty simple .
First , geddit/ templates/index.xml :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?>

Voila !
We now provide Atom feeds for all our content .
​ AJAX ( Asynchronous Javascript And XML ) is all the rage today , and in many ways , it is indeed a helpful technique for improving the usability and responsiveness of web - based applications .
To demonstrate how you 'd use Genshi in a project that uses AJAX , let 's enhance the Geddit commenting feature to use AJAX .
We 'll implement this in such a way that the current way comments work remains available , to serve those who do n't have Javascript available , and also just to be good web citizens .
That approach to using funky new techniques is often referred to as “ unobtrusive Javascript ” , and what it provides is “ graceful degradation . ”
Note : technically , what we 'll be doing here is n't AJAX in the literal sense , because we 'll not be transmitting XML .
Instead , we 'll respond with simple HTML fragments , a technique that is sometimes referred to as “ AJAH ” ( “ H ” as in HTML ) .
We 'll go about this in the following way : on a link submission detail page , the “ Add comment ” button will now load the comment form into the current page , instead of going to the dedicated comment submission page .
When the user clicks the “ Cancel ” button , we simply remove the form from the page .
On the other hand , if the user clicks the ” Submit ” button , we validate the entry , and if it 's okay , we remove the form and load the new comment into the list on the page .
That means that the user never leaves or reloads the link submission detail page in the process !
The first thing we need to do is to make the comment form available as a fragment , outside of the normally needed HTML skeleton .
To do that , we create a new template file , in geddit / templates / _form.html , with the following content :
< form xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " class= " comment " action= " $ { url ( '/ comment / %s /' % link . id ) } " method= " post " > < table summary= " " >< tbody > < tr > < th >< label for= " username " >
Your name : </ label ></th > < td > < input type= " text " id= " username " name= " username " /> < span py:if= " ' username ' in errors " class= " error " > $ { errors .
username } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr> < th >< label for= " comment " > Comment : </ label ></th > < td > < textarea id= " comment " name= " content " rows= " 6 " cols= " 50 " ></textarea > < span py:if= " ' content ' in errors " class= " error " >< br /> $ { errors .
content } </ span > </td > </tr>< tr>
< td></td> < td> < input type= " submit " value= " Submit " /> < input type= " submit " name= " cancel " value= " Cancel " /> </td> </tr></tbody></table > </ form >
And as that is the same form as the one used in the geddit / templates / comment .
html template , let 's replace the markup in that template with an include :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < xi:include href= " layout.html " /> < head > < title >
Comment on “ $ { link .
title } ” < / title > </ head > < body class= " comment " > < h1 > Comment on “ $ { link .
title } ” </h1 > < p py:if= " comment " >
In reply to < strong > $ { comment .
username } </ strong > at $ { comment .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } : < blockquote > $ { comment .
content } </ blockquote > </p> < xi:include href= " _form.html " /> </ body > </html >
We 'll also need to make the display of an individual comment available as an HTML fragment , so let 's factor it out into a separate template file as well .
Add a template called _comment .
html to the geddit / templates directory , and insert the following lines :
< li id= " comment $ num " > < strong > $ { comment .
username } </ strong > at $ { comment .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } < blockquote > $ { comment .
content } </ blockquote > </li >
And in geddit / templates / info.html replace the < ul > element rendering the comments with the following :
< ul py:if= " link .
comments " class= " comments " > < xi:include href= " _comment.html " py:for= " num , comment in enumerate ( link .
comments ) " /> </ul >
Now we 'll need to look into modifying the Root.comment ( ) method so that it correctly deals with the AJAX requests we 'll be adding .
For convenience , let 's add a new small module to our lib package .
Inside the geddit / lib directory , create a file named ajax .py , and add the following code to it :
import cherrypy def is_xhr ( ) : requested _with = cherrypy .
request .
headers .
get ( ' X - Requested - With ' ) return requested _with and requested _with .
lower ( ) == ' xmlhttprequest '
This checks whether the current request originates from usage of AJAX ( technically , the XMLHttpRequest Javascript object ) , based on a convention commonly used in Javascript libraries to add the special HTTP header “ X - Requested - With : XMLHttpRequest ” to all requests .
Add an import of that module to the top of the geddit / controller .py file , replacing :
from geddit.lib import template
with :
from geddit.lib import ajax , template
Then , replace the Root.comment ( ) method in geddit / controller.py with the following code :
@cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' comment.html ' ) def comment ( self , id , cancel = False , ** data ) : link = self .
data .
get ( id ) if not link : raise cherrypy .
NotFound ( ) if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) form = CommentForm ( ) try : data = form .
to_python ( data ) comment = link .
add_comment ( ** data ) if not ajax .
is_xhr ( ) : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) return template .
render ( ' _comment.html ' , comment = comment , num = len ( link .
comments ) ) except Invalid , e : errors = e . unpack_errors ( ) else : errors = {} if ajax .
is_xhr ( ) : stream = template .
render ( ' _form.html ' , link = link , errors = errors ) else : stream = template .
render ( link = link , comment = None , errors = errors ) return stream | HTMLFormFiller ( data = data )
There 's another small detail we 'll need to care of : in our @template decorator , we 're automatically adding a <! DOCTYPE > declaration to any template output stream that is being serialized to HTML .
For AJAX responses containing HTML fragments , we do n't really want to add any kind of DOCTYPE , so we 'll need to adjust the implementation of the decorator .
To do that , first add an import of our geddit / lib / ajax .py file to the geddit / lib / template .py file :
from geddit.lib import ajax
Then , replace the implementation of the output ( ) function with the following :
def output ( filename , method = ' html ' , encoding = ' utf - 8 ' , ** options ) : " " " Decorator for exposed methods to specify what template the should use for rendering , and which serialization method and options should be applied . " " " def decorate ( func ) : def wrapper ( * args , ** kwargs ) : cherrypy .
thread_data .
template = loader .
load ( filename ) opt = options .
copy ( ) if not ajax .
is_xhr ( ) and method == ' html ' : opt .
setdefault ( ' doctype ' , ' html ' ) serializer = get_serializer ( method , ** opt ) stream = func ( * args , ** kwargs ) if not isinstance ( stream , Stream ) : return stream return encode ( serializer ( stream ) , method = serializer , encoding = encoding ) return wrapper return decorate
Note how we 're now only adding the doctype= ' html ' serialization option when we 're not handling an AJAX request .
Finally , we need to add the actual Javascript logic needed to orchestrate all this .
Add the following code at the bottom of the < head > element in the geddit / templates / info.html template :
< script type= " text/ javascript " > function loadCommentForm ( a ) { $. get ( " ${url ( ' / comment /%s/' % link.id)} " , {} , function ( html ) { var form = a.hide ( ) .
parent ( ) . after ( html ) .next ( ) ; function closeForm ( ) { form.slideUp( " fast " , function ( ) { a.fadeIn ( ) ; form.remove( ) } ) ; return false ; } function initForm ( ) { form.find ( " input[@name= ' cancel ' ] " ).click(closeForm ) ; form.submit( function ( ) { var data = form.find ( " input[@type= ' text ' ] , textarea " ) .serialize ( ) ; $.post ( " ${url ( ' / comment/%s/' % link.id)} " , data , function ( html ) { var elem = $ ( html ) .get (0 ) ; if ( / form/i.test(elem.tagName ) ) { form.after (elem ) .remove( ) ; form = $ ( elem ) ; initForm ( ) ; } else { if ( $ ( " ul.comments " ) .
length == 0 ) { a.parent ( ) . before ( ' < ul class= " comments " ></ul > ' ) ; } $ ( " ul.comments " ) .append ( elem ) ; closeForm ( ) ; } } ) ; return false ; } ) ; } initForm ( ) ; } ) ; } $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " a.action " ) .click ( function ( ) { loadCommentForm ( $ ( this ) ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ; </script >
This Javascript snippet uses ​jQuery ( via the jquery . js file you 've already added to you geddit / static directory ) .
We wo n't go into the details of the script here , suffice to say that it implements our goals in a fairly lightweight manner .
For a nice introduction to jQuery , see ​ Simon Willison´s blog post ​jQuery for JavaScript programmers .
Now , when you click on the “ Add comment ” link on the link submission detail page , with Javascript enabled , you should see the comment form appear on the same page :
At this point we allow users to post plain text comments , but those comments can't include niceties such as hyperlinks or HTML inline formatting ( emphasis , etc ) .
A very naive application would simply accept HTML tags in the input , and pass those tags through to the output .
That is generally a bad thing , however , as it ​opens up your site to ​cross - site scripting ( XSS ) attacks , which can undermine any security measures you try put into effect ( including SSL ) .
And because this is generally not the behavior you want , Genshi XML - escapes everything by default , which makes it safe to include in ( X ) HTML output .
( Note that as Geddit allows anyone to do anything , we do n't actually have any valuable assets to protect , so this exercise is somewhat theoretical .
For the rest of this section , just imagine we required users to register and login to submit links or post comments . )
So what we want to do in this section is to allow users to include HTML tags in their comments , but do so in a safe manner .
We do not want to enable malicious users to include Javascript code , or CSS styles that turn the whole page black , or other things that may be considered harmful .
In other words , we need to “ sanitize ” the markup in the comments .
But let 's ignore that aspect for now , and start by making Genshi not escape HTML tags in comments .
We 'll start by editing geddit / template / _comment.html :
<? python from genshi import HTML ?>
< li id= " comment $ num " > < strong > $ { comment .
username } </ strong > at $ { comment .
time .
strftime ( ' %x %X ' ) } < blockquote > ${ HTML ( comment .
content ) } </blockquote > </li >
Here , we 've added an import for the Genshi HTML ( ) function .
This is done using a Python code block via the <?
python ?> processing instruction .
We 've already seen that we can use complex Python expressions in templates .
By using the <? python ?> processing instruction , we can embed any Python statements directly in the template , for example to define classes or functions .
In this case we simply import a function that we need to use .
The HTML ( ) function parses a snippet of HTML and returns a Genshi markup stream .
It tries to do this in a way that invalid HTML is corrected ( for example by fixing the nesting of tags ) .
We then use that function to render the content of the comment .
So what does this do , exactly ?
Well , the comment text is parsed using an HTML parser , fixed up if necessary ( and possible ) , and injected into the template as a markup stream .
A template expression that evaluates to a markup stream is treated differently than other data types : it is injected directly into the template output stream , effectively resulting in tags not getting escaped .
Note : Genshi also provides the genshi.core .
Markup class , which is just a special string class that flags its content as safe for being included in HTML / XML output for Genshi .
So instead of wrapping the comment text inside a call to the HTML ( ) function , you could also use Markup ( comment.content ) .
That would avoid the reparsing of the content , but at the cost of that content not being subject to stream filters and different serialization methods .
In a nutshell , using Markup is not recommended unless you really know what you 're doing .
So at this point our users can include HTML tags in their comments , and the comments will be rendered as HTML .
But as noted above , that approach is very dangerous for most real - world applications , so we 've got more work to do : we need to sanitize the markup in the comment so that only markup that can be considered safe is let through .
Genshi provides a stream filter to help us here : HTMLSanitizer .
To add sanitization , first add the imports for the HTML function and the HTMLSanitizer filter to geddit / controller .py , so that the imports at the top of that file look something like this :
import cherrypy from formencode import Invalid from genshi.input import HTML from genshi.filters import HTMLFormFiller , HTMLSanitizer
Then we 'll update the Root.comment ( ) method so that it sanitizes comments as they are submitted :
@cherrypy.expose @template.output ( ' comment.html ' ) def comment ( self , id , cancel = False , ** data ) : link = self .
data .
get ( id ) if not link : raise cherrypy .
NotFound ( ) if cherrypy .
request .
method == ' POST ' : if cancel : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) form = CommentForm ( ) try : data = form .
to_python ( data ) markup = HTML ( data [ ' content ' ] ) | HTMLSanitizer ( ) data [ ' content ' ] = markup .
render ( ' xhtml ' ) comment = link .
add_comment ( ** data ) if not ajax .
is_xhr ( ) : raise cherrypy .
HTTPRedirect ( '/ info / %s ' % link .
id ) return template .
render ( ' _comment.html ' , comment = comment , num = len ( link .
comments ) ) except Invalid , e : errors = e . unpack_errors ( ) else : errors = {} if ajax .
is_xhr ( ) : stream = template .
render ( ' _form.html ' , link = link , errors = errors ) else : stream = template .
render ( link = link , comment = None , errors = errors ) return stream | HTMLFormFiller ( data = data )
We 've just added two lines here , namely :
markup = HTML ( data [ ' content ' ] ) | HTMLSanitizer ( ) data [ ' content ' ] = markup .
render ( ' xhtml ' )
This parses the comment text , runs it through the sanitizer , and serializes it to XHTML .
And the result of the transformation is what we 'll save to our “ database ” .
We use XHTML here just because that can be processed by a wider variety of tools .
For the purposes of this tutorial we could just as well be storing the content using HTML serialization , because Genshi can handle both .
Note : this is just one way to add sanitization .
Another equally valid approach would be to store comment submissions exactly how they were entered , and sanitize them when they are displayed .
Or you could have two fields in the model : one to store the text as originally submitted , and the other to store the sanitized content ready for display .
Or , if you were really paranoid , you 'd sanitize both the input and the output .
Which method you choose depends on the needs of your particular application .
You may want to try performing some XSS attacks by including malicious HTML markup in comments .
Try some of the methods shown on the ​XSS Cheat Sheet .
You should not be able to get past the sanitizer ; if you are , please let us know .
We 're almost done — the only remaining task is to update the Atom feed so that it , too , includes the user - submitted HTML tags as markup , instead of as escaped text .
Open geddit / templates / info.xml , and update it to look as follows :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?>
< feed xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom " xmlns:py= " http://genshi.edgewall.org/ " > < title > Geddit : $ { link .
title } </ title > < id href= " $ { url ( '/ info / %s /' % link . id ) } " / > < link rel= " alternate " href= " $ { url ( '/ info / %s /' % link . id ) } " type= " text / html " / > < link rel= " self " href= " $ { url ( '/ feed / %s /' % link . id ) } " type= " application / atom+xml " / > < updated py : with= " time = link .
comments and link .
comments [ - 1 ] . time or link .
time " > $ { time . isoformat ( ) } </updated > <? python from genshi import HTML ?>
< entry py:for= " idx , comment in enumerate ( reversed ( link . comments ) ) " > < title >
Comment $ { len ( link .
comments ) - idx } on “ $ { link .
title } ” < / title > < link rel= " alternate " href= " $ { url ( '/ info / %s /' % link .
id ) } #comment $ { idx } " type= " text / html " / > < id > $ { url ( '/ info / %s /' % link . id ) } #comment $ { idx } </id > < author > < name > $ { comment .
username } </ name > </ author > < updated > $ { comment .
time . isoformat ( ) } </updated > < content type= " xhtml " >< div xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > ${ HTML ( comment .
content ) } </div></content > </ entry > </ feed >
Just like above , we 've added the import of the Genshi HTML ( ) function .
On the < content > element we 've added the type = " xhtml " attribute , and we 've added a wrapper < div > inside that element to declare the XHTML namespace .
Finally , inside that < div > , we inject the comment text as an HTML - parsed stream , analogous to what we 've done in the HTML template .

Thanks for reading , we hope the tutorial has been useful !
EAST AMWELL , N.J. — Mike Strizki has not paid an electric , oil or gas bill — nor has he spent a nickel to fill up his Mercury Sable — in nearly two years .
Instead , the 51 - year - old civil engineer makes all the fuel he needs using a system he built in the capacious garage of his home , which employs photovoltaic ( PV ) panels to turn sunlight into electricity that is harnessed in turn to extract hydrogen from tap water .
Although the device cost $ 500,000 to construct , and it is unlikely it will ever pay off financially ( even with today 's skyrocketing oil and gas prices ) , the civil engineer says it is priceless in terms of what it does buy : freedom from ever paying another heating or electric bill , not to mention keeping a lid on pollution , because water is its only by - product .
Slide Show : Photos show what makes this house work
" The ability to make your own fuel is priceless , " says the man known as " Mr. Gadget " to his friends .
He boasts a collection of hydrogen - powered and electric vehicles , including a hydrogen - run lawn mower and car ( the Sable , which he redesigned and named the " Genesis " ) as well as an electric racing boat , and even an electric motorcycle .
" All the technology is off - the - shelf .
All I 'm doing is putting them together . "
" I'm a self - sufficiency guy , " he adds .
Strizki , a civil engineer , has been interested in alternative energy sources since 1997 when he began working on vehicles fueled by alternative means during his tenure with the New Jersey Department of Transportation .
Strizki's two - story colonial on an 11 - acre ( 4.5 hectare ) plot 12 miles ( 19 kilometers ) north of Trenton is the nation 's first private hydrogen - powered house , which he now shares with his wife , two dogs and a cat .
( His two daughters and son , all in their 20s , have left the nest . )
It has been running entirely on electricity generated from the sun and stored hydrogen since October 2006 , when Strizki — in a project that his wife Ann fully supports — built an off - grid energy system with $ 100,000 of his own cash and $ 400,000 in grants from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities , along with technology from companies such as Sharp , Swagelok and Proton Energy Systems .
The Strizki's personalized home - energy system consists of 56 solar panels on his garage roof , and housed inside is a small electrolyzer ( a device , about the size of a washing machine , that uses electricity to break down water into its component hydrogen and oxygen ) .
There are 100 batteries for nighttime power needs along the garage 's inside wall ; just outside are ten propane tanks ( leftovers from the 1970s that are capable of storing 19,000 cubic feet , or 538 cubic meters , of hydrogen ) as well as a Plug Power fuel cell stack ( an electrochemical device that mixes hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water ) and a hydrogen refueling kit for the car .
On a typical summer day , the solar panels drink in and convert sunlight to about 90 kilowatt - hours of electricity , according to Strizki .
He consumes about 10 kilowatt - hours daily to run the family 's appliances , including a 50 - inch plasma television , along with his three computers and stereo equipment , among other modern conveniences .
The remaining 80 kilowatt - hours recharge the batteries — which provide electricity for the house at night — and power the electrolyzer , which splits the molecules of purified tap water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The oxygen is vented and the hydrogen goes into the tanks where it is stored for use in the cold , dark winter months .
From November to March or so Strizki runs the stored hydrogen through the fuel cell stacks outside his garage or in his car to power his entire house — and the only waste product is water , which can be pumped right back into the system .
" I can make fuel out of sunlight and water — and I do n't even use the water , " he notes .
" If it 's raining , it 's fuel .
If it 's sunny , it 's fuel .
It 's all fuel . "
The modular home — built in 1991 — looks like a typical suburban house ; its top - of - the - line insulation and energy - efficient windows look no different , and the facade hides the hydrogen - powered clothes dryer and geothermal system for heating and cooling , which pumps Freon gas underground to harvest heat in winter and cool in summer .
" Geothermal is another piece of free energy , " Strizki says , noting that he dug eight feet ( 2.4 meters ) down into the granite under his home to take advantage of the constant 56 - degree Fahrenheit ( 13 - degree Celsius ) temperature underground .
In summer he can use the lower temperatures underground to cool his entire house , and in winter he can capture those warmer temperatures , supplementing them with a heat pump powered by electricity from hydrogen .
" Nothing goes to waste . "
This year , Strizki is hardly running his $ 78,000 Hogen electrolyzer ( manufactured by Proton Energy Systems in Connecticut , a company that makes hydrogen - generation equipment ) because last year 's mild winter left him with full tanks .
When he does turn it on , the excess hydrogen vents from a small pipe on the roof with the sound of an impolite burp .
That vented hydrogen speeds at 45 miles ( 72 kilometers ) per hour through the atmosphere on its way off the planet — one of only two gases , the other being helium , that escapes into space entirely because it is lighter than air .
In fact , Strizki 's quarter - inch thick propane tanks weigh less when filled with hydrogen than when depleted .
Of course , hydrogen is a highly flammable gas , but its quick escape eases Strizki 's fears that it might ignite or explode .
It " disperses faster than any other gas , " he notes .
" Hydrogen wo n't sit around waiting for a flame . "
The final piece of Strizki 's energy solution is dubbed " Genesis , " his $ 3 - million aluminum Mercury Sable , one of 10 that carmaker Ford produced in the 1990s to test how well the lighter metal would fare in crash tests .
Ford gave Strizki the special model to drive in the Tour de Sol solar car race in New Jersey in 2000 .
Strizki installed a 104 - horsepower electric engine ( compared with a Toyota Prius 's 44 - horsepower motor ) that can reach speeds of 140 miles ( 225 kilometers ) per hour .
Pop the hood and next to the electric engine sit two fuel cell stacks that convert hydrogen and oxygen into water and electricity , propelling the electric engine forward smoothly and quickly .
The car never competed because it was not ready in time , but the unique vehicle does hold the world record for farthest travel on a single charge : 401.5 miles ( 646.2 kilometers ) , a distance which Strizki drove in December 2001 .
Today , Genesis shares the road with a variety of less costly fuel cell cars : Honda 's new hydrogen - powered FCX Clarity , which hit the market this week leasing for $ 600 a month , as well as the hydrogen - powered Chevrolet Equinox test - vehicle fleet from General Motors — part of a pilot program that aims to determine how hydrogen cars might function in everyday life .
Both the Japanese and U.S. automakers are betting that these nonpolluting cars will one day replace the internal combustion engine .
GM is committed to building a " mass volume " of its hydrogen fuel cell powered Equinoxes in coming years , according to Larry Burns , GM 's vice president of research and development , but only if a way to refuel them exists .
As it stands , the entire nation has just 122 hydrogen stations — compared with 170,000 gasoline and diesel stations .
This is part of the reason that not everyone is a fan of hydrogen .
Former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm , a physicist , notes that it's a waste of time and electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen instead of just using the electricity directly in an all - electric , plug - in hybrid car .
The debate boils down to whether batteries or hydrogen are a better way to store and deliver electrical energy .
But Strizki argues that hydrogen offers benefits that batteries do not .
For example , GE Global Research found that hydrogen might prove a better way to store electricity generated by renewable resources in remote areas — such as wind farms in North Dakota or solar arrays in New Mexico — than building expensive and costly electric transmission lines .
Instead , the hydrogen generated in such locations could be pumped nationwide through existing natural gas pipelines , providing fuel for a fleet of hydrogen - powered vehicles .
Regardless of whether those future vehicles are powered by hydrogen or rechargeable batteries , both would move using an electric motor that does not require polluting ( and newly expensive ) fossil fuels .
And they would come with another important extra benefit : the batteries or hydrogen fuel cells that run the car could also serve as a backup energy source for the home .
" I can plug this car into my home and run it , " Strizki notes .
Strizki is now working to bring the price down enough to make homes powered by the sun and hydrogen affordable for average consumers .
He says that he can build a solar - hydrogen system for as little as $ 90,000 , thanks to dipping costs for solar panels and lessons learned in building his home .
Even at that price , however , the off - grid system would be expensive compared with annual electric bills in New Jersey that average $ 1,500 , although that number has been increasing every year , including a jump of as much as 17 percent this year .
But add gasoline costs to that — which average more than $ 3,000 annually , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — and the price becomes more reasonable , particularly because the EIA figures were calculated back when gasoline was $ 2 per gallon rather than the present $ 4 .
" It did n't make sense when gas was $ 1 but now at $ 4 ?
A lot of things that did n't make sense , now make a lot of sense , " Strizki says .
He is already overseeing construction of the second such home - energy system — estimated to cost $ 150,000 — for a wealthy client in the Caribbean .
The backyard tinkerer is also working with several potential clients to construct off - grid homes in New Jersey , New York State and even Colorado , and has quit his most recent job as an installer of solar energy systems to concentrate full - time on the company he co-founded to promote the homes : Renewable Energy International .
The key to bringing the price down will be newer , better generations of the component technology , particularly the electrolyzer .
Fuel cell manufacturers such as ReliOn in Spokane , Wash . , are already taking a page from the computer industry — employing removable individual fuel cells , known as " blades , " similar to the computer blades in data centers , that can be changed individually if problems occur .
Ultimately , this suburban home may become the first of a coming hydrogen - electric economy — one that eliminates or sharply reduces the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change — or merely another technological dead end , like Buckminster Fuller 's geodesic dome or dymaxion car .

JUNE 5-- Last June , Matthew Lincoln was attending an evening service at his nondenominational Tennessee church when he approached the altar where a visiting minister was offering individual prayers for parishioners .
Assigned ' catchers ' were present on the altar in case congregants fainted , fell , or otherwise lost control .
When the minister , Robert Lavala , slightly touched his forehead , the Knoxville - area man ' received the spirit and fell backwards . '
Except nobody was there to catch him , Lincoln charges in a $ 2.5 million lawsuit filed yesterday against Lakewind Church and its pastors .
Lincoln , 58 , claims that he fell backwards , striking his head against the ' carpet - covered cement floor , ' according to the Circuit Court complaint , which was first reported by Courthouse News Service .
A copy of Lincoln 's lawsuit can be found here .
Since he already suffered from a ' degenerative disc disease of his neck and back , ' Lincoln , a former church board member , contends the fall exacerbated the pre-existing condition and has caused him ' severe and permanent ' injuries .
As a result of the fall , Lincoln , a recording engineer , claims that he is no longer able to care for his disabled daughter .
Lincoln alleges that Lakewind and its pastors were ' negligent in not supervising the catchers to be sure that they stood behind the person being prayed for ... should they have a dizzying , fainting , or falling in the spirit as had occurred on many occasions before . '
Lincoln 's lawyer , J.D. Lee , told TSG that the church 's insurer , Zurich of North America , rejected an insurance claim , asserting that Lincoln should have realized that no catchers were situated behind him .

There are some big questions theological systems try to answer .
Two of the biggest are :
1 . What is our situation / condition / ailment / predicament / problem ?
2 . How are we rescued from our Condition ?
Basically ,
What 's broken ?
and How is it fixed ?
These are the soteriological questions ( i.e. , How are we saved ? ) and , given that the Son is the aspect of the Trinity that acts as Savior , the answer to these questions defines the work of the Christ .
Modern Protestants tend to see our main problem as Sin , and all it entails ( e.g. , separation from God ) .
Thus , in most Protestant churches Jesus overcomes the problem of Sin by laying down his life as an atonement sacrifice .
( Along with the Sin - is - the - Problem formulation there is a secondary aspect of Christ 's work : Jesus as Moral Teacher / Exemplar .
That is , another way Jesus defeats sin is by showing us how to live morally virtuous lives .
This is why Protestants emphasize Sunday School and bible study .
However , the Moral Teacher / Exemplar model plays a second fiddle to the Atoning Sacrifice model in most churches . )
In contrast to these formulations , Marilyn McCord Adams begins Christ and Horrors with a refreshing soteriological move .
That is , she sees horrors , and not sin , as our fundamental Problem / Condition .
Thus , salvation is about the defeat of horrors .
Christ is a horror - defeater .
Adams ( p. 32 ) writes that she is " taking my cue from the book of Job rather than stories of Adam 's fall .
I want to explore what shape Christology takes if the Savior 's job is to rescue us , not fundamentally from sin , but from horrors ! "
What are horrors ?
Adams ( p. 32 ) centers them upon existential concerns about meaning : " horrors as evils the participation in ( the doing or suffering of ) which constitutes prima facie reason to doubt whether the participant 's life could ( given their inclusion in it ) have positive meaning for him / her on the whole . "
Just to be clear , Adams ( p. 32 -33 ) gives examples , " Paradigm horrors include the rape of a woman and axing off her arms , psychological torture whose ultimate goal is the disintegration of personality , schizophrenia , severe clinical depression , cannibalizing one 's own offspring , child abuse the sort described by Ivan Karamazov , parental incest , participation in the Nazi death camps , the explosion of nuclear bombs over populated areas , being the accidental and / or unwitting agent in the disfigurement or death of those one loves best . "
These events are horrors because they furnish " reason to doubt whether the participant 's life can be worth living , because it engulfs the positive value of his / her life and penetrates into his / her meaning - making structures seemingly to defeat and degrade his / her value as a person " ( p. 33 ) .
Adams summarizes ( p. 34 ) : " the heart of the horrendous , what makes horrors so pernicious , is their life - ruining potential . "
Two further comments about horrors are in order .
First , even if we do not participate in horrors ( either as victim or perpetrator ) we are all complicit in horror .
Adams ( p. 35 - 36 , emphases hers ) makes this clear : " Virtually every human being is complicit in actual horrors merely by living in his / her nation or society .
Few individuals would deliberately starve a child into mental retardation .
But this happens even in the United States , because of the economic and social systems we collectively allow to persist and from which most of us profit .
Likewise complicit in actual horrors are all those who live in societies that defend the interests of warfare and so accept horror - perpetration as a chosen means to or a side effect of its military aims .
Human being in this world is thus radically vulnerable to , or at least collectively an inevitable participant in , horrors . "
A second point that Adams makes later in the book ( p. 207 ) is that " death itself is a horror ! "
She continues ( p. 208-209 ) : " Death proves that there is not enough to us to maintain integrity , to hold body and soul together ...
It is in our nature and our calling as human beings to strive against the forces what would undo us , and it is in our nature surely to lose ... Death mock our personal pretensions ...
If death is a horror , and death is natural to human being , then to be human is to be headed for horror .
In cultic conceptuality , human being is a prima facie cursed kind of thing to be . "
In sum , this is our Condition : God made a world where we are radically vulnerable to or complicit in horrors .
The world is saturated in horror .
Thus , the Work of Christ must be , fundamentally and foundationally , involved in horror defeat ( p. 52 ) : " If non-optimality is construed in terms of God 's setting us up for horror - participation by creating us personal animals in a material world such as this , then the Savior 's job is to be the horror - defeater .
Our next question is :
Who would Christ have to be , what relation to God and humankind would Christ have to have , to accomplish this saving work ? "
I 'll sketch Adams ' answer to that question in coming posts .
Today , I just want to reflect on the genius of Adams ' focus on horrors .
In my last post I said that my first response to reading Christ and Horrors was " Finally , a theologian that gets it . "
What did I mean by this ?
What does Adams , in my opinion , get ?
The genius of Christ and Horrors is that it links soteriology ( i.e. , salvation ) with theodicy ( i.e. , the problem of evil or pain ) .
The two become one .
Salvation becomes about horror defeat !
This union is a masterstroke .
Let me clarify .
When soteriology and theodicy are decoupled , soteriology , in my opinion , becomes laughable .
It becomes a silly , thin , ridiculous project .
Let me give a personal example .
In my church we work with the classic Protestant soteriological scheme :
Our problem is sin and our separation from God .
Thus , we accept Jesus as our Savior and become concerned about our moral lives .
Sin and its management becomes paramount .
I find this focus appalling .
Constantly in church I 'm fighting the impulse to scream the following : " People , this world is a hellhole .
The human predicament is monstrous .
And we are sitting here arguing about if homosexuality is a sin or if a woman can be in a leadership role / clergy in the church ?
Are you kidding me ?
Are you FREAKING kidding me ! ? "
As Adams repeatedly points out , our situation is ruin ; wreaked , horrifically painful lives .
And that ruin , in my humble opinion , trivializes the common soteriological impulses of the church .
Who really gives a damn about doctrines of justification , election , or atonement ?
God has got to fix this mess !
And if your soteriological scheme does n't address the massive ruin of Creation , does n't speak directly to Rwanda , or Darfur , or the Nazi Death camps , or the child nursing a parent ravaged by Alzheimer 's , then your soteriological scheme is simply ridiculous , given my sensibilities .
I refuse to participate in a church life preoccupied with hand - wringing over our moral peccadilloes and the quest for assurances that we are , indeed , going to heaven .
As I once said to a classroom of students , " Given your beliefs about salvation , God promptly sent those six million Jews , killed in Nazi Death camps , to hell .
And , given that hell is both much worse and longer in duration than a death camp , I refuse to believe that God is worse than Hitler . "
That is to say , if we separate issues of salvation ( e.g. , Are Jews going to heaven ? ) from the issue of horror ( e.g. , the death camps ) we get this appalling disjoint where God compounds the horror .
Horror for horror .
What kind of God is that ?
So you can see my great relief upon reading Christ and Horrors .
The linking of soteriology and theodicy makes our most important concern the central work of Christ .
And that , to me , is an amazing theological insight .
What they did was go to the Blogspot addresses found on the site of the NoObama coalition called Just Say No Deal and constantly hit the " mark as spam " link so that Google 's Blogger would be flooded with spam warnings .
This caused Google / Blogger to freeze the sites marked .
Apparently , this campaign merely took advantage of Google / Blogger 's flawed system of finding spam blogs .
So , it looks like what we have here is an Obama dirty trick to shut down political opposition .
People tend to think of computer hackers as illegally breaking into systems and wreaking havoc - damaging , stealing , or even completely taking over other people 's machines and networks .
But the current incarnation of hacktivism is anything but .
Today 's hacktivism is mostly made up of very legal activities that simply use clever ways to make existing systems work to further the hacktivist 's own political goals .
And this presidential election campaign is ripe full of examples .
The conservative blog , Newsbusters , reported this morning that Google is actively censoring and shutting down any blogs on its servers that espouse an anti-Obama message .
Nevermind for a second that the claim seems completely bogus ( after all , since when did shutting down 7 hardly - read blogs in all of cyberspace constitute a vast conspiracy ? ) .
Newsbusters almost immediately then corrected itself , stating that the fault , in fact , was not Google 's , but rather Obama hacktivists who used Google 's anti-spam feature to " trick "
Google into freezing the blogs until it could be ascertained whether , indeed , the sites were spam .
All of this comes directly on the heels of last week 's incident where an Obama hacktivist dropped a " Google Bomb " against John McCain , attempting to manipulate search results to display negative stories when someone searched for the candidate 's name .
Again , none of these activities are actually illegal - they are merely clever ways of gaming the system .
While they certainly undermine the intended purpose of Google 's algorithms , and even run counter to the ideals of democracy , there is little that can be done about it on a practical level - save for Google making internal changes to how it detects spam and determines its search rankings .
And that 's not exactly a quick fix .
But does any of this even matter ?
Those Obama hacktivists may have temporarily tricked Google into shutting down seven anti-Obama blogs , but in response , as demonstrated by Newsbusters , conservative bloggers have been flooding cyberspace with a torrent of reporting and their own opinions on the story .
In the end , who has really won the day ?
If there is one lesson we can draw thus far it is simply this :
That the rise of the hacktivists in this presidential election campaign is undeniable , and that their powerful will is unrelenting .
What real impact they will eventually have on the electoral outcome , however , is yet to be determined .
Safety Lapses Raised Risks In Trailers for Katrina Victims
By Spencer S. Hsu – Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday , May 25 , 2008 ; A01
Â© 2008 The Washington Post Company
Formaldehyde Found in High Levels ; 17,000 Say Homes Caused Illnesses
Within days of Hurricane Katrina ’s landfall in August 2005 , frantic officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency ordered nearly $ 2.7 billion worth of trailers and mobile homes to house the storm ’s victims , many of them using a single page of specifications .
Just 25 lines spelled out FEMA ’s requirements , with little mention of the safety of those to be housed .
Manufacturers produced trailers with unusual speed .
Within months , some residents began complaining about unusual sickness ; breathing problems ; burning eyes , noses and throats ; even deaths .
Today , industry and government experts depict the rushed procurement and construction as key failures that may have triggered a public health catastrophe among the more than 300,000 people , many of them children , who lived in FEMA homes .
Formaldehyde – an industrial chemical that can cause nasal cancer , may be linked to leukemia , and worsens asthma and respiratory problems – was present in many of the FEMA housing units in amounts exceeding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s recommended 15 - minute exposure limit for workers , the limit at which acute health symptoms begin to appear in sensitive individuals .
Weak government contracting , sloppy private construction , a surge of low - quality wood imports from China and inconsistent regulation all contributed to the crisis , a Washington Post review found .
But each of the key players has pointed fingers at others , a chain of blame with a cost that will not be known for years .
Already , 17,000 plaintiffs who lived in FEMA units have alleged damaging health consequences , from respiratory problems to dozens of deaths and cancer cases , in a federal class - action lawsuit naming 64 trailer makers and the federal government .
Many of the plaintiffs were drawn from the roughly 350,000 people who unsuccessfully filed claims against the Army Corps of Engineers over the levee breaches that flooded New Orleans .
The CDC reported this month that Hurricane Katrina led to increased complaints of lower - respiratory illnesses among 144 children studied in Mississippi , but it found no difference between those who lived in FEMA housing and those who did not .
However , the CDC said the findings could not be generalized beyond the sample , and the agency is conducting a broad , five - year study of the storm ’s health impact on children across the Gulf Coast area .
“ I still ca n’t believe that we bought a billion dollars ’ worth of product with a 25 - line spec .
There ’s not much you can do in 25 lines to protect life safety , ” said Joseph Hagerman , a Federation of American Scientists expert who is leading a $ 275 million effort , funded by the Department of Homeland Security , to develop new emergency housing .
“ There ’s over 20,000 parts in these homes . ”
FEMA , for its part , faults manufacturers of the trailers , which are wheeled , and the mobile homes , which usually sit on concrete pads .
Some trailer makers used cheaper , substandard wood products in the rush to meet production targets , increasing emissions of the cancer - causing chemical , according to industry officials and analysts .
Companies say that federal guidelines were inconsistent and that they relied on suppliers to deliver quality materials .
In turn , wood suppliers blame cheap , high - formaldehyde - emitting plywood imports that flooded the U.S. market during the recent housing boom .
R. David Paulison , who became acting FEMA administrator two weeks after the storm hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29 , 2005 , acknowledged missteps but said changes are needed far beyond his agency .
“ We ’re taking all the darn heat .
… You would think that I ordered them with extra formaldehyde so they did n’t rot or something , ” he said .
“ The manufacturers have been skating by on this thing , ” he said , noting that many trailers bought by FEMA were on sale to consumers .
“ This is bigger than FEMA .
This is bigger than FEMA , ” he said , repeating for emphasis .
A price has already been paid by trailer residents such as Nicole Esposito , 25 , a full - time warehouse worker in Slidell , La .
She first noticed her toddler ’s symptoms after moving into a FEMA trailer in April 2006 : an endless series of coughs , colds , sinus infections , earaches and pink , crusty eyes .
Treatments and antibiotics had no effect , and soon Alexa , now 4 , and later her newborn sister , Alyssa , now 16 months old , regularly needed atomizers to help them breathe .
Last August , doctors said they suspected the cause was exposure to formaldehyde , and told the single mother to leave her trailer at once .
“ My girls , they could have all these problems the rest of their lives , ” Esposito said , her voice breaking , “ … and the doctors still do n’t know any more . ”
Hasty Decisions
On Sept. 4 , 2005 , one week after the storm , Paulison ’s predecessor , Michael D. Brown , declared that FEMA was “ pulling out the stops ” to find housing for 237,000 Katrina evacuees who were staying in shelters , the largest internal displacement of Americans since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s .
The price of haste was , inevitably , waste .
FEMA bought $ 762 million worth of mobile homes , most of them unusable in coastal flood zones under FEMA rules because they could not be moved quickly in case of another storm .
After an intervention by then - Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ( R ) , FEMA spent $ 249 million to lease cruise ship cabins , which evacuees largely refused to use .
FEMA bought 21,300 mobile homes and 33,100 trailers off dealers ’ lots for $ 1.4 billion using one page of specifications , according to interviews and documents provided by the agency .
It paid manufacturers $ 931 million to produce an additional 76,800 trailers using eight pages of custom requirements , again with limited safety standards and no mention of formaldehyde .
Paulison said FEMA incorporated applicable federal codes in ordering the mobile homes .
Regarding trailers , which are not subject to federal regulation , those sold to the public and to FEMA in the past produced few complaints , he said .
“ We bought them in good faith , just like we have for the last 20 years . ”
The largest housing orders were filled by Fleetwood Enterprises and Gulf Stream Coach .
FEMA ’s $ 520 million order from Gulf Stream , the largest from any builder , exceeded the company ’s reported 2004 recreational vehicle sales and was its first direct federal contract .
Formaldehyde is a colorless gas present at background levels in nature but emitted from the resins and glues used in many construction components , including particleboard flooring , plywood wall panels , composite wood cabinets and laminated countertops .
Emissions are greatest in warm weather and when trailers are newly constructed , the conditions experienced by Katrina victims on the Gulf Coast .
But manufacturers did not discuss , nor did FEMA ask , if it would be safe to house evacuees in trailers for 18 months or more with such materials .
“ They did not , ” Paulison said .
“ I do n’t think they were asked , either . ”
A spokeswoman for Fleetwood , based in Riverside , Calif. , whose subsidiaries produced 10,600 trailers and 3,000 mobile homes for FEMA , said the company did not discuss the formaldehyde issue with the agency .
“ You know , when something has n’t been a problem , you often do n’t suddenly consider that it will be .
I do n’t believe that anybody expected these people to stay in the trailers as long as people have stayed in them , ” Kathy Munson said .
Fleetwood said its trailers , which were built with only higher - quality , low - emitting wood products that the company said met federal standards for mobile homes , had the lowest levels of formaldehyde , with only 10 percent exceeding the CDC benchmark .
Gulf Stream ’s trailers had the highest levels , with more than 50 percent topping the CDC standard .
Gulf Stream ’s lawyers said in a letter to congressional investigators that the company mostly met a “ longstanding policy ” to buy components that comply with mobile home standards , but it acknowledged exceptions .
They said the firm “ did not conduct any testing on components or parts ” but instead “ relied on the representations ” of its suppliers about their quality .
Brian Delaney , a Gulf Stream spokesman , said he could not respond to questions , citing in part litigation .
Among other companies whose trailers tested high in the CDC study , Keystone RV declined to comment .
Forest River referred questions to the industry ’s trade group , the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association .
Dave Hoefer Sr. , chairman of Pilgrim International , said the pending lawsuits limited what he could say , but he pointed out that FEMA specifications prompted his company to put in fewer sidewall openings than usual , which may have restricted ventilation .
He said his company had never received a complaint about formaldehyde and used its usual materials to build Katrina trailers .
An industry association spokesman , Robert Feldman , said symptoms may be caused by mold , Katrina - related chemical spills , smoking or local climate factors .
“ There may be a rush to conclude formaldehyde is the issue when in fact the results seem to suggest the answer is a little more complex , ” he said .
However , others said that in 2005 and 2006 , much of the nation ’s hardwood plywood came from Asia and was high in formaldehyde .
China ’s share of the North American market has grown from 4 percent to nearly 40 percent since 2001 , according to the Hardwood Plywood & Veneer Association , which represents North American producers .
“ The most likely source of formaldehyde in the Katrina trailers and in all travel trailers are composite wood products … [ and ] the most likely source for those materials are imported products , ” primarily from China , said Elizabeth Whalen , director of corporate sustainability for Columbia Forest Products , of Portland , Ore. , the association ’s largest U.S. plywood manufacturer .
Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) demanded a U.S. trade investigation after domestic producers complained in 2006 that containers of imported hardwood plywood reeked of formaldehyde , products advertised as having low formaldehyde emissions were falsely labeled and sample tests showed levels much higher than allowed in federal housing .
“ There ’s no real enforcement authority by the government , ” said Gail Overgard , vice president of Timber Products in Springfield , Ore .
Little Regulation
No binding safety standard exists for formaldehyde in any U.S. homes , even though the chemical was classified as a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 2004 and is deemed a probable carcinogen by the U.S. government .
But early this year , the CDC reported that 41 percent of the trailers it tested in December and January had levels of formaldehyde greater than 100 parts per billion , the level that the CDC ’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends as safe for 15 minutes of exposure by workers .
California health regulators estimate that lifetime exposure to formaldehyde at 100 parts per billion increases cancer risk by 50 cases per 100,000 people .
“ Even at levels too low to cause … symptoms , there could be an increased risk of cancer , ” the CDC reported in February .
Because the tests were done in winter , they understated exposure levels during warmer months , the agency said .
J. Joe Donaldson , president of the Mississippi chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics , said that “ pediatricians along the Gulf Coast … all reported epidemic problems with asthma and respiratory symptoms … covering the time of the hurricane , and , although it ’s diminished over time , it ’s ongoing .
I personally believe that formaldehyde did play a significant part in the problem . ”
Despite its hazards , the chemical ’s presence in homes has largely escaped regulation .
In 1985 , after consumer complaints and lawsuits , Washington imposed a limit on the amount of formaldehyde emitted by plywood and particleboard in mobile homes – but did not restrict how much of that wood can be used .
The Housing and Urban Development office that enforces those rules has a small budget of $ 6 million and a staff of 13 based only at headquarters .
Robert Wilden , who directed the office in the 1980s and 1990s , said in an interview that while the industry “ benefits from minimal regulation , ” it lobbied for cuts in the office ’s budget .
When HUD set the formaldehyde limit for wood in mobile homes 23 years ago , it said it anticipated that the resulting ambient air levels would be less than 400 parts per billion , or quadruple what the CDC says is problematic .
The RV industry association points out that , according to the CDC tests over the winter , levels in 99 percent of the Katrina trailers fell below that threshold .
The use of formaldehyde in trailers is unregulated because they are considered vehicles , not homes , and because their makers say they are typically used a few days at a time , a few times a year .
“ The RV industry is generally unregulated , and lobbying efforts have succeeded in keeping it that way , ” said Connie Gallant , head of the RV Consumer Group , which represents trailer owners .
California regulators recently enacted the nation ’s tightest formaldehyde limits on wood products , setting limits 60 percent below HUD standards by next year and 75 percent below by 2011 .
The rules are expected to become a de facto national standard .
FEMA , meanwhile , has barred the future use of trailers , and required that mobile home builders use wood that emits virtually no formaldehyde .
The RV industry has embraced HUD and California standards .
FEMA has relocated more than 4,000 families after receiving 11,000 health complaints , but about 22,000 of its trailers remain occupied despite a CDC recommendation that all residents be moved to safer housing .
As of May 1 , more than 3,000 mobile homes were still occupied .
Paulison said that in the absence of a legally binding safety standard for residential air quality , FEMA will do the best it can in providing disaster housing .
But , he complained , “ There is no national standard for formaldehyde levels in American homes – not conventional … homes , not [ mobile ] homes . ”

If you think that is expensive , try mobile data rates in Canada .

Mobile data rates anywhere are pretty terrible .
I think the hardest part is actually getting mobile data .
The strings attached to those plans make doing anything other than downloading your e-mail nearly impossible .

In the states you then have to pay to recevie the darned thing as well so that adds considerable costs as well .
However these are companies trying to make a profit compared to NASA that are trying to do things cheaply so that their grant money gets them further ( although arguably could be done cheaper still as they have unlimited funding and do n't try and make as cheap as it could be ) .

The former head of interrogations at Guantánamo Bay found that records of an al - Qaida suspect tortured at the prison camp were mysteriously lost by the US military , according to a new book by one of Britain 's top human rights lawyers .
Retired general Michael Dunlavey , who supervised Guantánamo for eight months in 2002 , tried to locate records on Mohammed al - Qahtani , accused by the US of plotting the 9/11 attacks , but found they had disappeared .
The records on al - Qahtani , who was interrogated for 48 days - " were backed up ... after I left , there was a snafu and all was lost " , Dunlavey told Philippe Sands QC , who reports the conversation in his book Torture Team , previewed last week by the Guardian .
Snafu stands for Situation Normal : All Fucked Up .
Saudi - born al - Qahtani was sexually taunted , forced to perform dog tricks and given enemas at Guantánamo .
The CIA admitted last year that it destroyed videotapes of al - Qaida suspects being interrogated at a secret " black site " in Thailand .
No proof has so far emerged that tapes of interrogations at Guantánamo were destroyed , but Sands ' report suggests the US may have also buried politically sensitive proof relating to abuse by interrogators at the prison camp .
Other new evidence has also emerged in the last month that raises questions about destroyed tapes at Guantánamo .
Cameras that run 24 hours a day at the prison were set to automatically record over their contents , the US military admitted in court papers .
It is unclear how much , if any , prisoner mistreatment was on the taped - over video , but the military admitted that the automatic erasure " likely destroyed " potential evidence in at least one prisoner 's case .
The erased tapes may have violated a 2005 court order to preserve " all evidence [ of ] the torture , mistreatment and abuse of detainees " at Guantánamo .
The order was retroactive , so it also applies to the 2003 loss of al - Qahtani 's records .
Lawyers representing other Guantánamo detainees are asking whether tapes of their clients ' treatment may also be erased .
" You ca n't just destroy relevant evidence , " said Jonathan Hafetz , of the Brennan Centre for Justice in New York .
David H Remes , a lawyer for 16 Guantánamo prisoners , said the CIA 's destruction of interrogation videos shows the US government is capable of getting rid of potentially incriminating evidence .
" [ In Guantánamo ] the government had a system that automatically overwrote records , " Remes told the Guardian .
" That is a passive form of evidence destruction .
If a party has destroyed evidence in one place , there 's no reason to assume it has preserved evidence in another place . "
More than 24,000 interrogations were videotaped at Guantánamo , according to a US army report unearthed by researchers at Seton Hall University in New Jersey .
The US military office at Guantánamo did not return a request for comment from the Guardian about its taping policies .
The National Defense Strategy provides a clear road map for the Department of Defense to meet the challenges posed by a re-emergence of long - term strategic competition with China and Russia .
The National Defense Strategy acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment , characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order .
Here is the story behind this picture :
I was in downtown looking for a shot for this challenge and I came across these two individuals who were homeless .
I normally eye my subjects before asking them to give me some time for photograph them and I saw that this man .
He had a big gash over his eye and he was a bit bruised .
The first thing that came to mind was " Poor Tom " .
I politely asked him if I could take a couple of pictures and to my surprise he was very nice and full of life ( many homeless turned me down ) .
I asked him what was the story behind the gash and he politely said " I had a run - in to the wall last night " .
I guess it was his way of saying that he was beat up by someone .
The whole time I photographed him he cracked jokes and was very upbeat .
This was a lesson learned for me .
No matter how hard you have it , being negative never helps .
This guy was homeless , beat up , cut up and bruised and yet he managed to keep a smile on his face .
I know many who cant keep a smile just because they woke up on the wrong side of the bed .
This guy kept his smile and should be an example to many .

THE ARTICLE United Nations says rape is a war crime More than 60 nations met in the UN Security Council on Thursday to agree that sexual violence against women is a weapon of war .
Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon announced new measures to try to end what he called the " silent war against women and girls " in the world ’s war zones .
He called on UN bodies , national governments , aid organizations and rape survivors to help end sexual crimes against women in conflict areas .
He said : " Violence against women has reached unspeakable … proportions in societies attempting to recover from conflict . "
He announced the creation of a UN Messenger of Peace , whose job will be to combat sexual crimes against women .
He also promised there would be a " zero - tolerance policy against sexual … abuse ” by UN workers .
Rape has been an ugly , but common feature of many armed conflicts around the world .

Holy Jetpacks , Fusion Man! Swiss Man Flies With Own Wings
It 's a bird , it 's a plane ... it 's a crazy Swiss guy with four jet engines strapped to his back flying above the Alps !
A dedicated inventor has set a new record for powered personal flight .
( REAL SIMPLE ) --
Some things should never be said .
Here are some tips on how to avoid putting your foot in your mouth -- and what to use instead .
Do n't say : " You look tired . "
Why :
It implies she does n't look good .
Instead say : " Is everything OK ? "
We often blurt the " tired " comment when we get the sense that the other person feels out of sorts .
So just ask .
Do n't say : " Wow , you 've lost a ton of weight ! "
Why :
To a newly trim person , it might give the impression that she used to look unattractive .
Instead say : " You look fantastic . "
And leave it at that .
If you 're curious about how she got so svelte , add , " What 's your secret ? "
Do n't say : : " You look so good for your age . "
Why : Anything with a caveat like this is rude .
It 's saying , " You look great -- compared with other old people .
It 's amazing you have all your own teeth . "
Instead say : " You look great . "
Real Simple : Easy ways to exit awkward situations
Do n't say : " I could never wear that . "
Why :
It can be misunderstood as a criticism .
( " I could never wear that because it 's so ugly . " )
Instead say : " You look so good in skinny jeans . "
If you slip , say something like " I could never wear that ... because I was n't blessed with your long legs . "
Expert : Clinton Kelly , cohost of the TLC show , " What Not to Wear . "
What not to say in the workplace
Do n't say : " That 's not my job . "
Why :
If your superior asks you to do something , it is your job .
Instead say : " I 'm not sure that should be my priority right now . "
Then have a conversation with your boss about your responsibilities .
Real Simple : How to be nice
Do n't say : " This might sound stupid , but ... "
Why : Never undermine your ideas by prefacing your remarks with wishy - washy language .
Instead say :
What 's on your mind .
It reinforces your credibility to present your ideas with confidence .
Do n't say : " I do n't have time to talk to you . "
Why :
It 's plain rude , in person or on the phone .
Instead say : " I 'm just finishing something up right now .
Can I come by when I 've completed this ? "
Graciously explain why you can't talk now , and suggest catching up at an appointed time later .
Let phone calls go to voice mail until you can give callers your undivided attention .
Expert : Suzanne Bates , president and chief executive officer of Bates Communications , an executive - training firm in Wellesley , Massachusetts , and author of " Speak Like a CEO . "
What not to say during a job interview
Do n't say : " My current boss is horrendous . "
Why : It 's unprofessional .
Your interviewer might wonder when you 'd start bad - mouthing her .
For all you know , she and your current boss are old pals .
Instead say : " I 'm ready for a new challenge " or a similarly positive remark .
Do n't say : " Do you think I 'd fit in here ? "
Why :
You 're the interviewee , not the interviewer .
Instead say : " What do you enjoy about working here ? "
By all means ask questions , but prepare ones that demonstrate your genuine interest in the company .
Do n't say : " What are the hours like ? " or " What 's the vacation policy ? "
Why :
You want to be seen as someone who focuses on getting the job done .
Instead say : " What 's the day - to - day like here ? "
Then , if you 've really jumped through every hoop and time off still has n't been mentioned , say , " Can you tell me about the compensation and benefits package ? "
Expert : Mary Mitchell , president of the Mitchell Organization , a corporate - etiquette training firm in Seattle , and author of " The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Etiquette . "
What not to say about pregnancy and babies
Do n't say : " Are you pregnant ? "
Why :
You ask , she 's not , and you feel totally embarrassed for essentially pointing out that she 's overweight .
Instead say : " Hello " or " Great to see you " or " You look great . "
Anything besides " Are you pregnant ? " or " What 's the due date ? " will do .
Save yourself the humiliation and never ask .
Do n't say : " Do you plan on breast - feeding ? "
Why :
The issue can be controversial , and she may not want to discuss her decision publicly .
Instead say : Nothing .
Unless you 're very close , do n't ask .
If you slip , make up for the blunder by adding , " And do you feel comfortable telling me ? "
Do n't say : " Were your twins natural ? " or " It must have been hard for your child 's birth parent to give him up . "
Why :
You 're suggesting that natural conception is better than in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or adoption .
Instead say :
To a parent of multiples , try a light " Wow , you have your hands full ! "
To an adoptive parent , say the same stuff you would to any other parent : " She 's adorable ! " or " How old is he ? "
Expert : Kim Hahn , founder and chief executive officer of " Conceive " magazine .
What not to say to a single ( or newly single ) person
Do n't say : " You were too good for him . "
Why :
You are basically saying she has bad taste .
And you 'll be embarrassed if they ever patch it up .
Instead say : " His loss ! "
It gets the same point across without disparaging her judgment .
Real Simple : How to express sympathy
Do n't say : " I 'm glad you got rid of him .
I never liked him anyway . "
Why : She 'll wonder about your fake adoration for him while they were together .
Instead say : " I 'm confident you 'll find someone who will give you exactly what you want . "
It focuses on what 's to come , not on the dud you 're glad she 's done with .
Do n't say : " How could someone as perfect as you still be single ? "
Why : A statement like this comes off as a backhanded compliment .
What she hears is " What 's wrong with you ? "
Instead say : " Seeing anyone ? "
If she 's tight - lipped about her love life , move on to other topics .
Expert : Bethany Marshall , Ph.D. , a psychotherapist in Beverly Hills and the author of " Deal Breakers : When to Work On a Relationship and When to Walk Away . "
What not to say during a fight with your beloved
Do n't say : " You always " or " You never " or " You 're a [ slob , jerk ] " or " You 're wrong . "
Why : Speaking in absolutes like " you always " and " you 're wrong " is playing the blame game , and resorting to name calling makes your partner feel helpless , which puts him on the defensive and makes a bad fight worse .
Instead say : " I 'm upset that you left the dishes in the sink again .
What can we do so that this stops happening ? "
Starting with the pronoun I puts the focus on how you feel , not why he's in the doghouse , and it will make him more receptive to fixing the problem .
Do n't say : " If you really loved me , you would ... "
Why :
The more you treat your partner as if he 'll never satisfy you , the less satisfied you 'll be .
Controlling your partner by imploring him to do something is n't a good way to build intimacy .
Instead say : " I feel taken for granted when you do n't help around the house .
I would feel better if we could ... "
The best way to keep a productive fight from becoming a dirty one is to be clear about why you 're upset and then offer a solution .

All About Etiquette and Manners
ZAM ZAM DISPLACEMENT CAMP , Sudan ( CNN ) -- Sudan's Darfur crisis has exploded on many fronts -- violence , hunger , displacement and looting -- but United Nations peacekeepers say the biggest issue now affecting the region is the systematic rape of women and children .
UNAMID police officer Ajayi Funmi , left , educates Darfur women about rape .
Thousands of women as young as 4 caught in the middle of the struggle between rebel forces and government - backed militias have become victims of rape , they say , with some aid groups claiming that it is being used as a weapon of ethnic cleansing .
" That is one of the biggest issues in Darfur : the rapes , and crimes against women and children , " said Michael Fryer , police commissioner of UNAMID , the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed to try to tackle the violence .
Relief workers say they are powerless to stop the attacks and say that if they do speak out , they fear that the Sudanese government will tell them to leave the country .
Humanitarian group Refugees International said in a report last year that rape was " an integral part of the pattern of violence that the government of Sudan is inflicting upon the targeted ethnic groups in Darfur . "
Some relief workers say that almost every woman living in aid camps has been raped or become a victim of gender - based violence .
Many teenagers , while out running errands such as collecting firewood , are raped multiple times by militiamen , the workers say .
Watch women face dangers in Darfur »
They say the situation has now become so bad that many women are now resigned to rape as a way of life and men are unwilling to accompany them because they fear that they will be killed if they try to defend them .
But despite the extent of the abuse , the Sudanese government insists there is no problem , adding to the difficulties faced by the victims , who are often ostracized by their communities or fall afoul of a legal system seen as favoring their attackers .
iReport.com : Share your photos , videos of Darfur
" There is no rape in Darfur , " said Mohammad Hassan Awad , a Humanitarian Aid Commissioner for West Darfur , who accuses foreign aid workers of persuading people in refugee camps to make false claims .
Although few aid workers dispute the extent of the attacks against women , they say survivors are unwilling to come forward .
But those who do reveal shocking levels of abuse .

" She said they removed their scarves and used it to tie them up and were taking turns to rape them .
One is 13 years old ; the other one is 16 years , " Ajayi Funmi of the UNAMID police , who is trying to educate women , said after talking to two girls .
Making matters worse , aid workers say scores of babies conceived through rape are being dumped by their mothers .
" Abandoned babies are reported , but because of the stigma attached to it , there is no detailed report , because the women do n't come forward , " said Dr Naqib Safi of the U.N. children 's body UNICEF .
As many as 20 babies a month are being dumped in one camp of 22,000 people .
With U.N. officials calling for more female officers to better educate women against rape and women saying they wo n't feel safe until the under - equipped and undermanned United Nations force is strong enough to protect them , the situation shows little sign of improving .

Facebook is following in the footsteps of its rival MySpace by reaching an online safety agreement with the attorneys general of 49 U.S. states and Washington , D.C .
As part of the agreement , Facebook is pledging to implement new safety measures and refine existing ones , as well as affirming its participation on the Internet Safety Task Force that MySpace launched in January with the attorneys general .
Specifically , Facebook is making commitments around locking profiles of members who are under 18 years old , Facebook announced Thursday .
" Facebook already implements most of the enhancements that are part of this agreement .
The company 's cooperative relationship with the Attorneys General is long - standing and will continue indefinitely , " a spokeswoman for Facebook wrote via e-mail .
Chris Kelly , Facebook 's chief privacy officer , said in a statement that the company is " proud to join 49 states and the District of Columbia in affirming our commitment to these principles and to continue improving our technology and policy solutions to keep kids safer on Facebook . "
Some of the safety and privacy features Facebook will " continue and enhance " as part of the agreement include age and identity identification tools , automatic warning messages when a minor is in danger of giving personal information to an unknown adult and restricting members ' ability to change their listed ages .
Facebook is also pledging to be aggressive in responding to requests to remove inappropriate content and groups , immediate removal of links to pornographic sites and prominent display of privacy information and safety tips .

March to War in Lebanon ?
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Statement on H Res 1194 ,  Reaffirming the support of the House of Representatives for the legitimate , democratically - elected Government of Lebanon under Prime Minister Fouad Siniora . 
Madam Speaker , I rise in opposition to H. Res. 1194 because it is dangerously interventionist and will likely lead to more rather than less violence in the Middle East .
I have noticed that this legislation reads eerily similar to a key clause in the 2002 Iraq war bill , H J Res 114 , which authorized the use of force .
The key resolved clause in H. Res. 1194 before us today reads :
Resolved ,
That the House of Representatives —
( 6 ) urges —
( A ) the United States Government and the international community to immediately take all appropriate actions to support and strengthen the legitimate Government of Lebanon under Prime Minister Fouad Siniora ;
The Iraq war authorization language from 2002 is strikingly similar , as you can see here :
( a) AUTHORIZATION —
The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to —
( 1 ) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq ;
I am concerned that this kind of similarity is intentional and will inevitably result in US military action in Lebanon , or against Syria or Iran .
I am also concerned over the process of bringing this resolution to the Floor for a vote .
I find it outrageous that H. Res. 1194 , which calls for more risky US interventionism in the Middle East , is judged sufficiently non-controversial to be placed on the suspension calendar for consideration on the House Floor outside of normal order .
Have we reached the point where it is no longer controversial to urge the president to use all appropriate actions  — with the unmistakable implication that force may be used — to intervene in the domestic affairs of a foreign country ?
Mr. Speaker , the Arab League has been mediating the conflict between rival political factions in Lebanon and has had some success in halting the recent violence .
Currently , negotiations are taking place in Qatar between the Lebanese factions and some slow but encouraging progress is being made .
Regional actors — who do have an interest in the conflict — have stepped up in attempt to diffuse the crisis and reach a peaceful solution , and press reports today suggest that a deal between the rival factions may have been reached .
Yet at this delicate stage of negotiations the US House is preparing to pass a very confrontational resolution pledging strong support for one side and condemning competing factions .
US threats in this resolution to use all appropriate actions to support one faction are in fact a strong disincentive for factions to continue peaceful negotiations and could undermine the successes thus far under Arab League moderation .
This legislation strongly condemns Iranian and Syrian support to one faction in Lebanon while pledging to involve the United States on the other side .
Would n’t it be better to be involved on neither side and instead encourage the negotiations that have already begun to resolve the conflict ?
Afghanistan continues to sink toward chaos with no end in sight .
The war in Iraq , launched on lies and deceptions , has cost nearly a trillion dollars and more than 4,000 lives with no end in sight .
Saber rattling toward Iran and Syria increases daily , including in this very legislation .
Yet we are committing ourselves to intervene in a domestic political dispute that has nothing to do with the United States .
This resolution leads us closer to a wider war in the Middle East .
It involves the United States unnecessarily in an internal conflict between competing Lebanese political factions and will increase rather than decrease the chance for an increase in violence .
The Lebanese should work out political disputes on their own or with the assistance of regional organizations like the Arab League .
I urge my colleagues to reject this march to war and to reject H. Res. 1194 .

The Creative Cheat Sheet
Admit it .
All creatives get stuck sometimes and end up staring blankly into space .
We become so caught up in a fruitless route that we ’re unable to jolt our minds out of the rut .
So instead of looking for inspiration at http://www.hairyminxes.com use these techniques to give yourself the kick in the pants you desperately need .
This is an ever - expanding list – so keep coming back for more .
And please add your own suggestions and advice in the comments area below .
What ’s the logical conclusion ?
Try changing the focus of the brief .
If you ’ve been asked to say that a car is fuel - efficient , change your proposition to the fact that it saves you money ; or it prevents you from having to make too many stops at a petrol station ; or it makes the fuel gauge a very boring thing to look at .
If your proposition is about a cure for the common cold think about the doctor ’s surgery being empty ; or a doctor being bored in their office ; or a supermarket doing a special on their surplus order of hankies ; or someone having to come up with a better excuse to pull a sickie .
What ’s the illogical conclusion ?
Now it ’s time to step into the world of cartoon .
You ’ve been given a brief for an incredibly fuel efficient car again .
This time you ’re going to be a bit daft with your solutions .
If you start thinking like Homer Simpson , the proposition could now mean that you forget where the petrol cap is because it ’s so long since you ’ve used one ; the only thing you refuel at the service station is yourself when you buy a some donuts ; petrol stations start going out of business because so many people are buying this car .
These are unbelievably wild outcomes but they help to illustrate the proposition in a more entertaining way .
Beat up the competitor
Is your product better than the competition ?
Even in just one way ?
Show people how your product compares favourably .
Do a good - old - fashioned side by side comparison to show how your product stacks up .
Or , if it can be done in an acceptable way , rip the competition to shreds .
For example , if you have a brief for a smaller quality newspaper , show how unwieldy and awkward the other big broadsheets are .
If you have a brief for a lower - rate bank loan , show how the competition ’s customers are having to take on more work to pay their loan off .
If the competition has had some bad PR , twist the knife while the wound is fresh .
Play dirty .
Even if the ad never runs , being a bitch is fun .
Use the medium
Is the space where the ad ’s going to appear of any help ?
Is it an unusual size or shape ?
Where will it appear ?
What will it be surrounded by ?
Can you use a quirk of the media to communicate the message ?
Your visual may just be the ad itself .
Remove all the words
See if you can do the whole job in the visual without a headline .
It ’s the ultimate distillation of communication .
John Hegarty apparently put a screensaver on the computers at BBH which read ‘ Words are a barrier to communication ’ .
And I believe him .
So how would you get the message across to a person who ca n’t read ?
Or what would it look like if it was a road sign ?
Aim for doing the whole job in the visual and if you end up having to chuck in a few words , at least your ad will be simpler .
Look at it in the mirror
What ’s the exact opposite of what you ’re trying to communicate ?
How about having one beer for the price of two ?
Or guaranteeing that your product is the worst one available ?
How could your sports car become the slowest on the road ?
This will at least provoke you to think in a different way .
And surely that ’s what creativity is all about .
Look at it upside down
Ask yourself what the product does n’t do .
Who would have no use for it whatsoever ?
What does n’t it cost ?
How would it be inefficient ?
What ’s it like then ?
Are there any metaphors for the product ?
Is it like a lion or a camel or a clockwork chicken ?
Is it a Harley Davidson rider wearing drag ?
Or a car that runs on custard ?
Or a dolphin with an aqualung ?
Metaphors are great ways of helping the audience understand something in a simple way .
But it ’s easy for them to be cheesy so be careful and avoid clichés .
Please !
If I see another image of a zebra amongst horses as an analogy of how a company stands out from the crowd , I think I ’ll borrow a metaphorical rifle and climb a metaphorical clocktower .
Tell the truth
Revolutionary , or what ?
Most people have a healthy distrust of advertising , so being blatantly honest can have a dramatic effect .
Look at the old classic
Avis campaign – ‘ We ’re number two , so we try harder ’ .
Genius !
They hit you with something so surprisingly truthful in the first half of the phrase that you have no option but to believe the second half .
Or how about Skoda ’s advertising ?
They never tried to hide the fact that they had a stinking image .
Instead , they capitalised on it .
The whole campaign was even stronger because it was backed up by award - winning products .
It convinced me enough to go out and buy one , anyway .
Go on !
Prove it !
If you ’ve got a strong proposition about how your product is better than the rest , prove it .
But do it in an interesting and surprising way .
Could you show your washing up liquid cleaning a truck full of plates as well as the truck ?
Could you show your car beating an F - 15 fighter jet along a runway ?
Could you pile up coins higher than a house to demonstrate exactly how much your mortgage will save someone in the next 12 months ?
Demonstrations have been used since the dawn of advertising .
But that does n’t mean they ’re out of date .
Just remember two things : keep them honest and make them dramatic .
Use a celebrity
I hate this one .
But it may just work for you .
Please , please , please do n’t use a celebrity just for the sake of it .
Borrowed interest is only useful if it actively builds on a strong concept .
Unfortunately , when the latest fast - rising celebrity appears , they are usually over - exploited by advertisers .
We were all sick to death with Dom Jolly and Fast Show immitators 5 years ago .
I ’m just glad that Little Britain and Catherine Tate did n’t sell out in the same way .
Unfortunately Gordon Ramsey and Jamie Oliver seem to have made up for it .
This seems to be the route when an agency does n’t actually have a big idea .
Tread carefully .
It can suck big time .
Turn a positive into a negative
What is the downside to your proposition ?
Which part of your life will it have a negative impact on ?
If you ’re advertising extra strong hair gel , it may cause abrasive scratches on your headboard or take lumps out of the lintel over a door or tear holes in your hat .
If it ’s a computer game , magazine or TV series it may have a bad effect on your neglected relationship .
If it ’s an incredibly good mortgage rate , you may talk about it so much that you become the most boring person at any party .
Think ying and yang .
For every positive , there ’s a negative .
And it ’s your job to find it .
Celebrate the problem
What is the issue that your product resolves ?
Maybe your product frees you up to enjoy that problem all the more .
This worked great for Persil with their ‘ dirt is good ’ campaign because getting dirty can be lots of fun .
Especially if you ’re 8 years old .
Or drunk .
So rather than stifle that opportunity for enjoyment – do it more and let Persil deal with the consequences .
This strategy will work great for products like hangover cures , liposuction and genital wart cream .
But not so great for chemotherapy , psychiatric treatments and prosthetic limbs .
Shock the fuck out of people
Is there a visual you can use that will provoke a strong reaction ?
Or could you say something that would seriously offend your parents ?
If you ’re advertising an amazingly powerful vacuum cleaner , you could use a close up shot of a dustmite – they scare the shit out of me !
If you ’re advertising a rugged bike helmet , you could show the mashed up corpse of a cyclist with tyre tracks across his chest and not even a scratch on the helmet .
If you ’re advertising underwear you could dress a goat up in it and say that bestiality is a serious option now .
Sometimes the right thing is just to be plain wrong .
Peace agreements , stability and regional prosperity , in an interesting paradox , increase the risk of air terror in Israel , according to new research conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Ron Tuegeman under the supervision of Prof.
Arnon Sofer of the University of Haifa .
The research , which was published by the Reuven Chaikin Chair in Geostrategy at the University of Haifa , the Fisher Brothers Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies and the Israeli National Defense College , reveals that during the past few years , the civil aviation traffic has increased dramatically in Israel 's neighboring countries .
This increase includes not only the number of actual flights but also the number of flight paths that pass close to Israel .
According to the researchers , peace agreements and normalization of relations between Israel and her neighbors will require , among other things , opening up Israel 's airspace to civilian airliners from these neighboring countries including flights that originate in countries with which Israeli does not have peace agreements .
These flights , they warn , could become the preferred target of terror organizations .
" Israel 's airspace is very small .
The flight time of an airliner – civil or military – from Beirut to Haifa is about seven minutes , and two minutes from the border crossing at Rosh Hanikra .
Crossing the width of the entire country by air takes less than five minutes .
Therefore , the task of defending this open space is a big challenge , " stressed the researchers who point to certain flight routes that were opened in the 1990s over Israel 's airspace following peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt , that did n't take into account the terror attacks like 9/11 .
According to the researchers , the closeness of the worldwide jihad to Israel warrants a complete change in the way Israel thinks about defending against air terror , " The city of Eilat is an example of the complexity of policy - making following the signing of peace accords .
The new flight paths G - 183 and " cross - Israel " , which opened during a period of positive trends in planning , are now weak points which put the Israeli air defense establishment in a very difficult position .
It seems that today , with the hindsight of the air terror attack on the United States , these lanes of air travel would not have been opened , " write the researchers , who propose that in any future political settlement , Israel must consider protection of its airspace , knowing that daring air terror with no early intelligence warning is no longer an imaginary scenario .
Take for example , the developments with the Palestinians , whether under agreement or one - sided actions , which must take into account the proximity of the West Bank to Ben Gurion Airport , " It will be enough if the Palestinians acquire an anti-aircraft missile system – shoulder missiles such as SA - 7 , to shut down Ben Gurion Airport and effectively halt the majority of Israeli air traffic .
In any political - security agreement , Israel will not be able to concede sovereignty over its airspace to any neighboring Palestinian entity that will be established , " say the researchers .

The federal government is accepting bids for up to three new family detention centers that would house as many as 600 men , women and children fighting deportation cases .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a call for proposals last month and set June 16 as the deadline .
New facilities are being considered on both coasts and on the Southwestern border .
The agency calls for minimum - security residential facilities that would provide a “ least restrictive , nonsecure setting ” and provide schooling for children , recreational activities and access to religious services .
Family detention has been condemned by human rights groups and immigrant rights organizations as punitive and unnecessary .
But immigration authorities said it ensures that immigrants show up for their court hearings and leave the country when ordered deported .
“ Family detention has had the desired impact , ” ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said .
“ We do n’t see as many families coming across the border .
That automatic pass is no longer there . ”

There are currently two family facilities -- a former nursing home in Pennsylvania and a former prison in Texas .
The T. Don Hutto detention center in Taylor , Texas , opened in 2006 and faced protests and lawsuits within the year charging that the children were living in substandard conditions .
A settlement resulted in changes in how the children are treated .
New facilities would allow the government more flexibility and enable the agency to keep families together , Nantel said .
In Los Angeles this week , three illegal immigrant mothers and their toddlers , including one American child , were among about 60 people discovered at a drop house used by smugglers .
Because there is no family facility nearby , the women and children are being housed in a private shelter .
The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the proposed plan to open new family detention centers .
“ After the horrible conditions that were revealed at the Hutto facility , it is very disappointing that the government appears to want to produce more immigration prisons for families and children , ” said Ahilan Arulanantham , a staff attorney at the Southern California office .

Arulanantham said most families do not pose a safety or flight risk and should not be detained .
Instead , he said , they should post bonds , wear electronic monitors or be part of an intensive supervision program .
“ There are other ways to deter illegal immigration without imprisoning children , ” he said .
“ This shows that we have become addicted to incarceration as a method to solving our problems , which it is obviously not . ”
In extreme cases , Arulanantham said , he could see families being housed in some sort of halfway house , but not a former prison run by a private prison company .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to review the proposals and make a decision within several months , Nantel said .
The bids could come from county governments or private companies .
The facilities would house up to 200 people each , about 150 juveniles and 50 adults .
Authorities estimate detainees would be kept at the center for between 20 and 30 days .
Advertisement
The proposal calls for minimal security facilities and refers to the centers as residential family shelters , but says the contractor should structure programs “ designed to prevent escapes ” and should provide a plan that “ monitors resident movement and physically counts residents . ”
Nobody with a criminal record would be admitted .
Corrections Corp. of America senior vice president Damon Hininger said he was aware of the request for proposals and that the company was “ taking a look at it . ”
The company already runs several immigration detention centers , including Hutto .
Hutto has 450 beds , and as of last week there were about 150 people being held in family detention there .
If new facilities are built , Nantel said the agency would consider transferring the families out of Hutto and using it as an adult immigration detention center .
“ Running a residential facility in what was a former prison , that was a challenge , ” she said .
“ There have been lessons learned out of Hutto . ”

When the center opened , children were given hospital scrubs to wear , forbidden to have toys and allowed only one hour of recreation per day , attorneys said .
As a result of the settlement , children are allowed to wear pajamas , move freely around the center and bring toys into their rooms .
There also have been changes made to the facility , including adding individual bathrooms , adding murals and replacing metal doors .
Given the national security goals of the Department of Homeland Security , advocates said they are skeptical about future family centers .
“ They really do have this penal system model in their heads , ” said Andrea Black , coordinator of Detention Watch Network , a coalition advocating reform of immigration detention and deportation .
“ I think it ’s going to be challenging for them to actually be able to run a family facility that is nonpunitive given their current philosophy and practices . ”
The need to imprison families stems from the presence of so many illegal families sneaking across the border or hiding in the United States , said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , a nonprofit group that advocates a reduction in the number of immigrants .
Advertisement
“ This is really recognizing the realities of the illegal alien population , ” he said .
“ They used to let everybody out and trust them to come back .
That has n’t worked out , to say the least .
This is simply the pendulum moving back the other way . ”

The Attack on Prosperity How Speculators Are Causing the Cost of Living to Skyrocket
After investing in high - tech stocks and real estate loans for years , legions of speculators have now discovered commodities like oil and gas , wheat and rice .
Their billions are pushing prices up to astronomical levels -- with serious consequences for ordinary people 's quality of life and the global economy .

The no -man 's - land that emerged , ranging from 60 to 200 meters wide , provided the ideal conditions for the flourishing of flora and fauna .
Up to 600 endangered species , including the black stork and the lady 's slipper orchid , thrived in this unusual terrain .
What has made this green corridor remarkable is the interlocking of over 100 types of biotopes , including forests , fens and meadows .
Hubert Weiger , president of BUND , told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday that " in other places species become extinct because their habitats shrink to islands due urban sprawl . "
According to Geidezis this is unique in Central Europe .
" You do n't find these connecting biotopes in Europe any more .
Most have been split up , preventing animals from traveling from place to place . "

Foreigners make up less than 2 % of Japan 's population
Officials are investigating how a scheme adding a language requirement for long - term residency visas and work permits could be implemented .
Japan recently began photographing and finger - printing all foreign nationals when they enter the country
There are about two million foreigners living in Japan , less than 2 % of the country 's population .
Those who apply for visas to live or work here do not have to prove they can speak Japanese .
Most come from Korea , China or are Brazilians of Japanese descent .
Fighting terrorism
Officials say Japan 's Foreign Minister , Masahiko Komura , has long held the view that it would be better if long - term visitor could speak Japanese .
Mr Komura says society benefits from foreigners speaking Japanese
He says it would improve their quality of life , and society as a whole here would benefit too .
Officials are quoted as saying that adding a language requirement to the visa application process could help to combat illegal immigration or terrorism .
But some here fear that requiring all foreign workers to learn Japanese before they arrive could harm Tokyo's efforts to attract international business and to compete with other Asian cities like Singapore and Hong Kong .
Last year an opinion poll carried out for the government found that more than half the foreigners who live in areas where they mix with Japanese people would like more opportunities to interact with them .
But only one in 10 of the Japanese living in the same areas wanted to talk to someone from abroad .
WASHINGTON  Scott McClellan , President Bush ’s former press secretary , told the House Judiciary Committee on Friday that he had been unfairly vilified by Bush supporters for his recent book criticizing former White House colleagues over the Iraq war and their involvement in leaking the identity of an intelligence officer .
Mr. McClellan , however , offered little new information in his testimony on those issues beyond what he wrote in the book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception ” ( PublicAffairs ) , which was published in May and last week topped the nonfiction best - seller list in The New York Times .
In the book , Mr. McClellan says senior White House officials misled the nation about the reasons for invading Iraq and maneuvered him into lying to the public about their roles in the leak case .
The book , with Mr. McClellan ’s lacerating criticism of his former colleagues , has generated a rich discussion about the obligations of political loyalty , and his appearance Friday on Capitol Hill provided another stage for that debate .
The man who once regularly and seemingly by rote defended Mr. Bush in the White House press room was attacked by the committee ’s ranking Republican , Representative Lamar Smith of Texas , who grilled Mr. McClellan as ferociously as any reporter had in his three years as press secretary .

Dutch security researchers rode the London Underground free for a day after easily using an ordinary laptop to clone the " smartcards " commuters use to pay fares , a hack that highlights a serious security flaw because similar cards provide access to thousands of government offices , hospitals and schools .
There are more than 17 million of the transit cards , called Oyster Cards , in circulation .
Transport for London says the breach poses no threat to passengers and " the most anyone could gain from a rogue card is one day 's travel . "
But this is about more than stealing a free fare or even cribbing any personal information that might be on the cards .
Oyster Cards feature the same Mifare chip used in security cards that provide access to thousands of secure locations .
Security experts say the breach poses a threat to public safety and the cards should be replaced .
" The cryptography is simply not fit for purpose , " security consultant Adam Laurie told the Telegraph .
" It 's very vulnerable and we can expect the bad guys to hack into it soon if they have n't already . "
The Dutch government has taken the breach seriously and says it is upgrading the smartcard system that secures its buildings .
" It 's a national security issue , " a spokesman for the Dutch Interior
Ministry told reporters .
" We 're in the process of replacing the cards of all 120,000 civil servants at central government level . "
According to the Times , Radboud University researcher
Bart Jacobs and his team used an ordinary laptop to clone an access card to a building in the Netherlands .
When that worked , they went to London to test the technique on the Underground .
The hackers scanned one of the Underground 's many card readers to collect the cryptographic key that purportedly keeps the system secure .
The keys were uploaded to a laptop , essentially turning them into portable card readers .
The hackers then brushed up against passengers to wirelessly upload the information on their Oyster cars .
That information in hand , it was a simple matter of using it to program new cards .
Jacobs says the same technique can clone smartcards that provide access to secure buildings .
" An employee can be cloned by bumping into that person with a portable card reader , " he told the Times .
" The person whose identity is being stolen may then be completely unaware that anything has happened .
At the technical level there are currently no known countermeasures . "

East Sussex County Council has rejected calls to stop using a controversial weedkiller .
On Monday , lead member for transport and environment Claire Dowling confirmed the council will continue to use glyphosate - based weedkillers to control roadside vegetation .
The decision follows two petitions from local residents , calling on the council to ban the use of the herbicide in the Eastbourne , Jevington and Willingdon areas , and in Hastings .
BBC
Green Party campaigner Julia Hilton , who was the lead signatory of the Hastings petition , spoke at the meeting .
She said : “ It is almost a year since the council declared a climate emergency and one aspect of that was that we support the aims and implementations of the UN ’s sustainable development goals .
“ [ One of those ] is to protect , restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems … and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss .
“ Better verge management and banning pesticide use would be a really good start locally . ”
Responding to the concerns , councillor Dowling said the council would work with its partners to find alternative methods as part of the next highways maintenance contract in 2023 .
She said : “ We have already , unlike a lot of local authorities out there , reduced what we do on the ground .
“ We have reduced to one spray per year and I believe we are down to the weakest solution that we could possibly do .
“ We do have a responsibility for maintaining our highways and gullies and I am aware that we do only look at treating where there are weeds , not blanket spraying . ”
Description :
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Statement of the Technical Field
The present invention relates to the internationalization of computer software , and more particularly , to testing multi- byte character handling in an application under test .
2. Description of the Related Art
Internationalizing computer software can be difficult and expensive .
Yet , the internationalization of computer software can be critical to ensure the global success of computer software .
In this regard , it has been estimated that worldwide business - to - business e-commerce will have grown to $ 30 billion by the early 21st century , while at the same time non-English speakers will constitute more than 50 percent of the world 's online population .
With more than half of the world 's Internet users predicted to be non-native English speakers in the near future , going global is not merely a business advantage in the 21st century ; it is a business imperative .
In the past , the process of accommodating a specific country 's language , conventions , and culture was done on a more or less ad hoc basis — essentially retrofitting software to accommodate a particular locale .
Merely separating the text in a user interface from one 's program is not an acceptable solution , however .
Even after translating software prompts , help messages , and other textual information to the target languages , one still has to address basic issues of displaying and printing characters in the target language .
Information interchange codes define character sets for national languages .
The necessary symbols or characters are relatively few in number in most languages .
English , for example , uses only 26 Roman letters , each of which has an upper case and a lower case representation , for 52 symbols .
German requires the addition of only 7 symbols , allowing for three vowels receiving diacritics ( both in upper case and lower case ) and the Greek lower case beta symbol .
In all it has been found sufficient to provide 256 bytes of 8 bits each to express all of these characters .
Unlike most languages , Chinese , Japanese , and Korean contain more than 256 characters .
Traditional written Chinese utilizes in excess of 13,000 ideographs .
Japanese utilizes between 3,000 and 8,000 ideographs ( kanji characters ) and several hundred other symbols for the numerical , hiragana and katakana characters .
Conversion between interchange codes is further complicated by the fact that the ideograph sets for Japanese , Korean , Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese differ in content and size .
To handle such large character bases , the interchange code sets for these languages use a double - byte of 16 bits for each character .
This allows the expression of some 65,536 characters .
As more companies deploy software products world - wide , software testing must change to verify software products developed for deployment in non-English operating environments .
To that end , the Global Verification Test ( GVT ) addresses the testing of software for international compatibility .
GVT is a portion of the product functional verification test that addresses internationalization issues .
GVT assures that software can run in non-US environments and after translation .
The goal of GVT is to certify that a product is ready for world - wide distribution .
Some of the techniques utilized in GVT include verification through execution , pseudo translation environments and scanning .
Verification through execution involves running the un-translated application to verify specific functional support such as bi-directional language support , Unicode character set support or multi- byte character set support for platforms that do not yet support Unicode .
Third Party source scanning tools search source code for potential internationalization problems .
Finally , pseudo translation tools incorporate several pseudo - languages and pseudo locales which disclose problems undetectable by code scanning tools such as data formatting , field expansion , column misalignment , and line truncation .
Notably , GVT ensures that text data having multi- byte characters can be input , handled and displayed without corruption .
One of the most important international markets is the Far East in which many countries use text that requires multi- byte characters such as Japanese and Chinese .
The testing of the ability of software to handle multi- byte character data currently requires that the testing personnel be able to read the language .
This often can lead to expensive assignments as the normal functional tester is English speaking and cannot read foreign text .
Pseudo translation tools have been developed that either use the full width ASCII equivalents of a multi - byte character , or that simply repeat a single Asian character and retain the English text as it was .
These solutions only address the text that appears as part of a user interface and these solutions do not test the ability of the software under test to handle user data correctly .
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention addresses the deficiencies of the art in respect to testing multi- byte data handling in an application under test and provides a novel and non-obvious method , system and apparatus for generating multi- byte equivalents based upon test data for use in testing a computer program .
A method for testing multi- byte data handling can include the steps of converting each single byte native text character of a source string to a multi - byte equivalent to produce a multi - byte test string .
Subsequently , the multi - byte test string can be provided to a testing tool for use when testing a computer program .
Notably , the multi - byte equivalent can be a wide Latin equivalent .
A Latin equivalent , by way of example , can include the Unicode characters ranging from U+FF21 through U+FF5A .
The converting step can include determining , for each single byte native text character , whether the character falls within a range of alphanumeric characters .
Subsequently , for each single byte native character , the character can be converted to a multi - byte equivalent to produce a multi- byte test string only if the character falls within the range .
Preferably , the converting step can include the step of adding a fixed integer value to each character to produce a wide Latin equivalent .
Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows , and in part will be obvious from the description , or may be learned by practice of the invention .
The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims .
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention , as claimed .

The accompanying drawings , which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification , illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description , serve to explain the principles of the invention .
The embodiments illustrated herein are presently preferred , it being understood , however , that the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities shown , wherein :
FIG .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The present invention is a system , method and apparatus for testing multi- byte data handling in an application under test .
In accordance with the present invention , a source string of test data can be converted to a multi - byte string by converting each character in the string to its multi- byte equivalent .
Once converted , the multi - byte equivalent version of the source string can be provided as input to an application under test to ensure that not only whether the user interface of the application test can properly render the multi- byte equivalent version of the source string , but also whether the internal logic of the application under test can process , store and retrieve the multi- byte representation of the source string .
In a more particular illustration of a preferred embodiment of the present invention , FIG .
1 is a schematic illustration of a system for testing multi- byte data handling in an application under test .
The system can include a conversion processor 120 configured to process source strings 110 into multi- byte equivalents 140 .
The multi - byte equivalents 140 can be based upon a base coding value 130 specific to the particular coding scheme .
Preferably , the multi - byte equivalents 140 can be full width Latin equivalents such as those provided by Unicode .
The multi - byte equivalents 140 produced by the conversion processor 120 can be provided to a testing tool 160 as input to an application under test 170 .
Alternatively , the multi - byte equivalents can be stored in a table of test values 150 which the testing tool 160 can use for automating the testing process .
FIG .
2 is a flow chart illustrating a process for testing multi- byte data handling in the system of FIG .
1 . Beginning in block 210 , a result string can be initialized and in block 220 , a source string can be loaded for processing .
In block 230 , a first character in the source string can be loaded .
If in decision block 240 , the character is within a code range indicating that the character is alphanumeric in nature , whether upper or lower case , then the character can be widened from a single byte value to the multi- byte value in block 250 .
For example , a base code value can be added to the code value of the character to change the character type from a single byte native text value to its full width Latin equivalent .
In the case of Unicode , for instance , the native text string “ ABC ” can convert to full width Latin by adding the integer value 65,248 to each of the letters “ A ” , “ B ” and “ C ” .
In either case , in block 260 , the character can be added to the result string .
In decision block 270 , if additional characters in the source string remain to be processed , in block 280 the next character in the source string can be loaded for processing .
Subsequently , the process of blocks 240 through 270 can repeat until no characters in the source string remain to be processed .
Once all of the characters in the source string have been processed , in block 290 the result can be returned .
In this regard , in a preferred aspect of the present invention , the result can include a string comprising full width Latin equivalents to the single byte narrow native text of the source string .
The present invention can be realized in hardware , software , or a combination of hardware and software .
For example , the data handling policy can be stored in a database .
An implementation of the method and system of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system , or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems .
Any kind of computer system , or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein , is suited to perform the functions described herein .
For example , the data handling policy can be stored in a database .
A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general purpose computer system having a central processing unit and a computer program stored on a storage medium that , when loaded and executed , controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein .
The present invention can also be embedded in a computer program product , which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein , and which , when loaded in a computer system is able to carry out these methods .
Storage medium refers to any volatile or non-volatile storage device .
Computer program or application in the present context means any expression , in any language , code or notation , of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the following a ) conversion to another language , code or notation ; b ) reproduction in a different material form .
Significantly , this invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof , and accordingly , reference should be had to the following claims , rather than to the foregoing specification , as indicating the scope of the invention .

Have you noticed how the political establishment hates elections ?
It regards them as vulgar , foreign , exhibitionist and unpredictable .
To those in power they are mere concessions to mob rule .
If electors did not insist on them , elections would have been abolished long ago as Victorian gimmicks to appease proletarian sentiment .
There is no other explanation for Westminster 's reaction to Ireland 's weekend vote on the Lisbon treaty and to David Davis 's resignation over 42 - day - detention .
Nor is there any other explanation for the welcome that will be given to Hazel Blears 's forthcoming local government white paper .
This will , it is rumoured , reduce the 95 % of elections still held in Britain ( local ones ) to largely consultative status , to clear the ground for Gordon Brown 's Putin - style appointed regional government .
In the case of Ireland , the rule is clear .
Any change in the constitution of Europe requires unanimity among the nations of Europe .
Irrespective of what moved the Irish electorate , the treaty has failed and must be redrafted .
Yet Britain , France , Germany and the rest are proceeding with ratification as if the vote had gone the other way .
They are saying that Europe 's constitutional framework - good or bad - can be disregarded when inconvenient , for instance when democracy has rejected what they want .
Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have blatantly reneged on an election promise to hold a referendum on the constitution after an earlier version was defeated in 2005 by French and Dutch votes .
At the time Tony Blair and Gordon Brown instantly declared the constitution dead , adding that there could be no question of " bringing it back with a few amendments " .
This time Ireland 's rejection of a virtually identical proposal is met with an opposite response .
Ireland is regarded as too small to matter , or too stupid to know what it was doing , or too irritating to worry overworked Eurocrats who might have to renegotiate the rejected document .
The treaty is defunct when rejected by a member of the Union .
Yet I have heard commentators argue that 5 million Irish cannot be allowed to stand over against 500 million Europeans - as if the rule was not really a rule and as if the 500 million had ever been asked their view .
None had , for the obvious reason that they would have agreed with the Irish .
A writer in the Financial Times even depicted Ireland as a snivelling little country that should be kicked into the sea .
That is how Belgium and Poland were once treated .
European super - statehood seems to drive people mad .
Every time the new European constitution has been put to a popular vote it has been rejected .
A YouGov poll yesterday indicated support for full EU membership in Britain is down to 29 % .
The reasons are many , but the contempt shown by Europe 's governing elite for the wishes of Europe 's peoples is dangerous .
It indicates how far a noble postwar ideal has strayed into oligarchy and contempt for democracy .
The European Union 's inability to clean up its governance , to audit its administration and to put its reform to public scrutiny has reinforced voter scepticism for politics generally .
Members of the European parliament are now helpless popinjays , as incapable of controlling Brussels as of limiting their personal greed .
Davis 's decision to stand down as an MP and fight a byelection over 42 - day detention produced similar revulsion in Westminster .
All political ambitions are mixed , but Davis was clearly shocked by the devious way in which the Labour government trampled on civil liberties last week .
He decided to express that shock in the most public way available to a politician , to invite electors to debate with him and vote him back to office .
Westminster politicians and lobby reporters derided Davis as an exhibitionist , a loner and crazy .
Why did he not wait for parliament to handle the matter ?
Why not stick within the club ?
Did he not realise that the public disagreed with him over 42 days , as revealed in Westminster 's favourite franchise , the polls ?
Worst of all , Davis was currying favour with mere voters , as if he were consorting in the servants ' hall .
By Sunday , when thousands of members of the public ( and celebrities ) had rallied to Davis 's flag , Westminster was gulping and wondering if it had missed something .
It had .
As in Ireland , the public liked being asked its view .
That is why 80 % of people want a referendum on Lisbon , irrespective of their being more evenly divided on its virtues .
Blears 's impending white paper on " local empowerment " is rumoured to be equally anti-electoral .
With the rest of Europe moving ever further down the road to local devolution , Blears believes that only central control can yield better public services .
The 2004 Planning Act and subsequent acts stripped local electorates of any discretion over their environment .
Now their remaining powers are to be supplanted by forums , meetings and consultation sessions , subject to superior veto .
Pronouncements with such ironic titles as " empowerment " , " organic change " and " strong and prosperous communities " , from David Miliband , Ruth Kelly and Blears , have reduced English local government to agency status .
An analysis of recent legislation - Botched Business , by Michael Chisholm and Steve Leach - depicts ministers with the same executive arrogance as the governors of Guantánamo Bay .
Today 's councillors must contract with Whitehall , not with their voters .
Blears 's proposals will have no truck with elective discretion or tax devolution .
The present Treasury minister , Yvette Cooper , wrote in 2004 that localism means " nimbyism and divisive inequalities " .
To her and her colleagues , Lenin was right and democratic centralism was all the accountability needed for better public services .
While these cases are clearly different they share a feature noted by such political observers as Bernard Crick and Jerry White - " fear of voting " .
It is every politician 's dread at having to " meet his maker " , the electorate .
In most countries that dread is disciplined by a formal constitution .
In Britain it is not and democracy has duly atrophied .
That is why Britons have fewer elections and fewer elected representatives than any other democracy in Europe .
The tradition of monarchical deference is alive and well .
As the week has shown , any chicanery will do to deny people 's will .

The USA Rock Paper Scissors Leauge is heading to television with a new deal that will see the USARPS League Championship Tournament shown on Fox Sports Net .
For those not familiar with professional Rock Paper Scissors ( and no , I ’m not making this up ) , the game is played under international rules with various countries holding local , regional and national finals , and there is even a world championship .
The USARPS League Championship Tournament will feature more than 300 “ RPS Athletes ” representing all corners of America June 20 - 22 Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .
First prize is $ 50,000 .
The event is scheduled to air on Fox Sports Net October 6th .

In 2000 , William Harold Newman announced his new Lisp project , SBCL , to comp.lang.lisp :
I 'm working on SBCL , http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/
a variant of CMU CL which should be easier to maintain than CMU CL .
Some of the changes involved -- especially making the system bootstrap itself cleanly -- involved major surgery on the CMU CL code base , not just local patches , and the result is a distinct version of the system .
I consider the new release of SBCL ( sbcl - 0.6.0 ) to be alpha quality , unstable but fairly usable .
For eight years he 's been working on SBCL and making new releases every month .
But a few weeks ago , he stepped down :
I 'd like to resign as project administrator .
This decision is not affected by sbcl - 1.1 release issues : I 've been absently thinking about it for months , and actively for the past month or so .
The decision is hardly affected by anything about the SBCL project at all , in fact .
Other things in my life have chewed up a lot of my energy and motivation , and it is far harder for me to deal with any extra responsibilities than it used to to be , and SBCL is just one of the casualties .
Christophe Rhodes , Juho Snellman , and Nikodemus Siivola will now manage SBCL releases .
I started using CL and SBCL after Bill 's busiest period of SBCL hacking , but he paved the way and made it easy for new people to become vital developers of the system .
The CREDITS file lists nearly 60 contributors of great and small features and fixes .
Thanks for creating SBCL , Bill !

The Egyptian - mediated truce took effect at dawn A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has begun , despite a last - minute flurry of cross - border attacks .
The truce is designed to halt Israeli incursions into the Gaza Strip , and to stop missiles being fired from Gaza into southern Israel .
If it holds , Israel will ease its blockade on Gaza and there may be further talks on a prisoner exchange .
Correspondents say the eve- of - truce attacks underline how fragile the agreement could be .
There were no reports of fire from either side on Thursday morning .
Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist group which controls Gaza , said it was confident all militants would abide by the Egypt - brokered truce , which is supposed to last six months .
Since the last ceasefire collapsed in April 2007 , about 600 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed in fighting between the two sides .
Hamas isolated Speaking on Wednesday , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the truce would be fragile and could be short - lived .
He said Israel would abide by the ceasefire , but its armed forces were ready to act if cross - border rocket attacks continued .
GAZA TRUCE TIMETABLE 0600 ( 0300 GMT )
Thursday ceasefire begins After 24 hours , Israel begins to ease crossing restrictions
After five days , Israel opens up crossings
After two weeks , talks to begin on reopening the Rafah crossing into Egypt
Timely Gaza truce to test parties
Your views : Israelis and Gazans Send us your comments " We should not have illusions .
The terror organisations , and Hamas among them , have not changed their goals , " he said .
Hamas 's leader in Gaza , Ismail Haniya , said the truce would " bring stability to Israel if they commit themselves to it " .
Syria , which has hosted the political wing of Hamas since the 1990s , has welcomed the truce .
Speaking on a trip to India , President Bashar al - Assad said only peace and stability would " ensure sustainable development and long - term prosperity " in the region .
Israelis in the south of the country will appreciate the relief from daily missile fire , says the BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem , but many fear that a ceasefire could give Hamas the chance to rearm and strengthen itself further .
Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007 , driving out forces loyal to Fatah , the political faction led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Israel then tightened its blockade on Gaza , allowing through only humanitarian supplies .
Under the terms of the new agreement , Israel will ease restrictions on the trade of certain goods between Gaza and Israel on Friday morning , and open up the crossings for all commercial goods next week .

After two weeks , talks will start involving Israel , Hamas , the Palestinian Authority and the EU on reopening the Rafah crossing into Egypt .
And negotiations on the return of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , captured by militants in Gaza in June 2006 , are supposed to resume within a few days , Israeli sources say .
Separately , Mr Olmert told the BBC that peace talks with the Palestinian Authority were going well .
He said serious progress had been made on issues including the borders of a future Palestinian state .
He said Israel could make dramatic compromises on territorial issues but that the Palestinians would have to make compromises as well .
Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas pledged last year to works towards concluding a peace agreement by the end of 2008 .
Key questions
On Wednesday , before the truce came into effect , at least 40 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza at Israel , and the Israeli army killed a Palestinian militant in an air strike .
The Islamic Jihad militant group , which lost several members to Israeli air strikes in recent days , claimed responsibility for some of the attacks .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Gaza says the key questions when considering whether the truce will hold are : Will Hamas be able to keep control over all of the disparate militant groups that fire rockets over the border ?
Will those groups be able to show restraint should there be any Palestinian deaths in the West Bank , where this ceasefire does not apply ?
A senior Islamic Jihad leader has told the BBC his group would not violate the ceasefire , but it " resolves the right to respond at any time " to any Israeli attack in Gaza or the West Bank .

People who post smiley photos on social networking sites attract happy friends .
Look happy online , and you 'll have cheery friends .
Anne - Marie Palmer / Alamy
How happy you are is influenced by your social links to people you 've never heard of and never met .
That 's the conclusion of a US study looking at the spread of happiness and depression across social networks .
Happy people cluster together , the research suggests .
And the opposite also seems to be true — so if you are miserable , you are more likely to have miserable friends .
The effect holds in both the real and virtual worlds .
People who put smiling photos on their profiles for social networking sites such as Facebook tend to link to one another .
Frowners do likewise .
But it 's not just direct contact that counts .
The link is significant to three degrees of separation — that is , your own emotional state is connected to that of your friends ' friends ' friends .
" Your happiness depends on the happiness of individuals beyond your own social horizon , " says sociologist Nicholas Christakis of Harvard University in Cambridge , who carried out the study .
" You can understand happiness by studying individuals , but that only gets you so far .
There 's more to be learned by studying the group . "
Grin to win
Christakis and his colleague James Fowler , a political scientist at the University of California , San Diego , drew their network of emotional states using data from the Framingham Heart Study .
This project has monitored the health of the people of Framingham , Massachusetts , since 1948 .
Christakis presented the latest findings on 25 June at the International Workshop and Conference on Network Science in Norwich , UK .
As well as gathering information on their physical health , the study collected data on people 's emotional states , to see whether depression and heart disease are correlated .
Understandably enough , emotions are contagious over short distances and times .
Waitresses who smile at their customers get bigger tips , and students with depressed room mates are more likely to get depressed themselves .
The Framingham data allowed Christakis and Fowler to show that the same holds over long time spans , and in large networks of social interaction .
" At one level it 's not surprising — if your partner is really happy today , then you feel better , " says network researcher Albert - LászlóBarabási of Northeastern University in Boston , Massachusetts .
" But it 's surprising how systematic and measurable the effect is . "
Friends like these
As well as social proximity , geographical distance is important — your friends are more influential the nearer they live .
However , the effect was not seen in the workplace — perhaps because the things that make you happy , such as a promotion , might disgruntle your passed - over colleagues .
Christakis and Fowler also looked at the photos on the Facebook pages of a network of 1,700 students at an unnamed university in the northern United States .
Smiley students clustered together .
They were also closer to the centre of the network , and had more friends than those who did n't smile .
The researchers have preliminary evidence that there are similar patterns for other Facebook properties , such as privacy settings .
Besides emotions , Christakis and Fowler have seen similar patterns in the Framingham data for obesity and smoking .
Both factors show what Christakis calls " three - degrees of influence " , in that the effects of connections peter out beyond contacts that are twice - removed .

" The regularities are intriguing , " he says .
" We think there are limits to how far influence can stretch , and we seem to be finding that across a broad range of phenomena . "
The findings have big implications for public - health policy , he says , in how we measure cost - effectiveness — as interventions aimed at individuals have knock - on effects — and how we target healthcare .
" People are slowly understanding that there 's a huge effect here , but we 're till a step away from how we use that , " says Barabási .
" But if we know of these factors as individuals , then we can alter them , not necessarily by cutting friendships , but by being aware of their influence . "
Since PyCon
I have been working on a set of tests to demonstrate incompatibilities between Python 2.5 , 2.6 and 3.0 , with the aim of not only documenting the incompatibilities , but also testing if you avoid them , and write code that runs under both Python 2.6 and 3.0 , thereby providing a transitional path from 2.x to 3.0 .
( 2.5 code should run under 2.6 unmodified , so that part of the transition is done ) .
I found only one major incompatibility , that 2.6 required u ” for Unicode , but 3.0 does n’t support it .
This was solved in Python 2.6a3 , which introduced a from __future__ import unicode_literals , which makes 2.6 behave the same as 3.0 .
Thanks for that !
So , at the moment , I ’m not aware of any major unavoidable incompatibilities .
I decided to put up my half - assed code somewhere public , so other people can add to it .
So , I created a new project on code.google.com : http://code.google.com/p/python-incompatibility/
You can check out out for yourselves .
running runtests .py 26 will work on both Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 .
But the code is n’t finished yet .
There may be incompatibilities I have n’t thought about , and there are no tests of the library reorganisation .
Please help out on this !
It ’s fun , easy and a great way to learn Python 3.0 !

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A 44 - year - old mother of two has become Japan ’s oldest professional boxer after passing the Japanese board ’s license test .
Kazumi Izaki , who has daughters aged 21 and 14 and herself turns 45 next week , laced up her first pair of boxing gloves in 2001 .
“ She has passed , ” the Japan Boxing Commission ( JBC ) told Reuters Friday .
“ This is first time she has held a JBC license and she is now Japan ’s oldest pro boxer . ”
Under JBC rules , applicants for a license must be under 32 but Izaki was allowed permission to fight because she previously won a Japanese title , albeit one not recognized by the country ’s governing body .
Hiroaki Yokota had held the distinction of being Japan ’s oldest professional boxer but the 46 - year - old declined to renew his license .
“ I try not to think about my age , ” the former aerobics instructor told reporters .
“ I ’m a mum but I ’m going to give it everything I ’ve got .
“ I wanted to show my children that if you give up , then you ’re washed up ! ”
Yeah , not very smart to use Fred Thompson to attack Obama over bin Laden .
First off , Thompson said last year that Osama did n’t really matter , he ’s “ more symbolism than anything else . ”
Yeah , the symbol of 3,000 dead Americans and others on September 11 .
That ’s a symbol worth catching .
But Thompson did n’t stop there .
He said last year that bin Laden “ “ should get due process if he ’s caught ” .
Now , why is that a problem ?
Because McCain has been railing all week against Obama for saying that there ’s no reason we ca n’t try suspected terrorists in US courts , even if they ’re military courts .
McCain says that ’s naive .
And now McCain is using Thompson to further that attack on Obama .
Except that Thompson said pretty what Obama said , if not far worse in McCain ’s thinking .
Yesterday Team McCain put Giuliani out there to attack Obama on national security after McCain had said that Giuliani has zero national security experience .
And now this .
Seriously poorly managed campaign over in McCain - land .
When it comes to web programming languages , PHP probably holds the record for copping criticism from the community at large .
Comparisons with alternatives such as Ruby on Rails and Python / Django are common ; defenders of PHP are quick to criticise the comparison of a language and a framework .
But at the end of the day , developers work with Ruby on Rails , and with Python / Django , and with PHP .
Just PHP .
For most of the PHP applications out there , the language is just perfect , because PHP , to an extent , is the framework .
PHP is designed for the web .
You could plug vanilla Ruby or Python into a web server and get up and running pretty quickly .
But , at least at a basic level , you ’d want a framework to deal with common issues of web development .
In PHP , you just get started .
PHP and Apache work out request data , output handling and more , right out of the box .
( PHP also masters deployment . )
David Heinemeier Hanson , the creator of the Ruby on Rails framework , calls this the immediacy of PHP .
Now , consider the “ average ” PHP frameworks .
They help you handle request data , manage your output , control app flow – essentially , extending PHP ’s inbuilt functionality .
They are , therefore , PHP frameworks on the PHP framework .
PHP provides a vast array ( pardon the pun ) of functionality out of the box .
But when you want to do things your way , it gets out of the way , and this is really important when building anything beyond a simple database frontend .
How many PHP applications in wide distribution are built on a third - party framework ?
MediaWiki ?
No framework here .
WordPress ?
Not here either .
Drupal ?
You get the idea .
Each of these applications have their own framework , inasfar that the developers built a structure for their code that suited what they were trying to create .
These three , and the countless others , clearly did something right – MediaWiki even powers one of the world ’s top 10 websites .
And when building these “ frameworks ” , PHP helped them along the way .
Sure , Cake , Symfony , CI – they all help you build PHP applications .
But unlike a Ruby framework or a Python framework , coding is perfectly tolerable without them .
Of course , most developers tend to create their own framework as they go along – I call this PHP ’s DIY framework mentality , where you build the last level in your stack , and by extension you know exactly what ’s going on under the hood .
This comes back to the oft - cited “ best tool for the job ” argument – but by being a “ half framework ” of sorts , PHP simply helps you within a web context .
I ’m sure Rails is great for countless applications ; Ruby syntax helps a little too .
But beyond the basics , the language becomes increasingly irrelevant , and a framework will force you to build your app according to design decisions made by the original developers .
On the other hand , PHP allows you to quickly put together your application the way you want , helping you with the web - based aspect , and without having to break the language / framework to achieve your goals .
Essentially , PHP is the web layer without the framework baggage .
Twitter recently had some downtime that could be attributed to its use of Ruby on Rails .
Now , there ’s nothing wrong with Ruby , or Rails .
But Twitter is a messaging system , RoR is an application framework .
Could Rails be worked around to suit Twitter ?
Maybe .
Could Twitter have avoided these problems if they ’d used PHP ?
Probably .
Twitter ’s developers have noted they were n’t quite expecting the site to be so succesful .
If they had built it in PHP , they would probably have encountered other ( similar ) problems earlier on , rewritten the entire app while it was still feasible , and built a powerful system that could scale just fine ( likely with the messaging platform in C ) .
Using PHP could have helped , not as a language with syntax and libraries as such , but as a web development platform that gives developers the freedom to architect their systems as they want .
( They could also have tried Erlang . )
So the next time you ’re on the lookout for a PHP framework to build your killer app on , consider using the best framework of them all : PHP .
It will give you the freedom to achieve what you want , how you want , with results .
A quick hack ?
Check the manual , it could be a one - liner .
A massive distributed messaging platform ?
Full steam ahead , build it your way .
For everything in between , there ’s a multitude of options , but if you have the time , PHP is all the framework you need .
Terrorism is among the threats which have been looked at Gordon Brown has set out plans to deal with national emergencies such as terror , disease pandemics and flooding .
The National Security Strategy also proposes that the " national register of risks " be made available to the public .
The prime minister said the number of security service staff would rise to 4,000 and that there would be new moves to secure the UK against cyber - attacks .
He also said there would be a 1,000 person civilian task force to be sent to trouble - spots around the world .
This would include police , emergency services and judges and would be put on standby to help failing states and countries emerging from conflict .
Commitment bonus Speaking in the House of Commons , Mr Brown said Britain would use diplomacy to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world .
Among other changes , he also said there would be £ 15,000 payments for military personnel staying on for an extra five years and a £ 20 m fund to help armed forces purchase homes .

Four regional counter - terrorism units and four regional intelligence units would be set up to help the police .
Meanwhile , the government has launched a review of the role of the Territorial Army and other reserve forces .
Mr Brown said threats to Britain had " changed out of all recognition " in recent years and that tactics had to alter accordingly .
" Our new approach to security also means improved local resilience against emergencies , building and strengthening local capacity to respond effectively in a range of circumstances from floods to possible terrorism incidents , " he said .
" Not the old Cold War idea of civil defence but a new form of civil protection that combines expert preparedness for potential emergencies with greater local engagement of individuals and families themselves . "
Mr Brown also announced reforms of the Intelligence and Security Committee , a parliamentary body which oversees the security services MI5 and MI6 , and other areas .

He added : " We all know our armed forces are over - stretched , over - committed and under - resourced ... it is high time that [ Mr Brown ] announces urgently a new full strategic defence review for our defence capabilities for today and the years ahead . "

Journalist released from Gitmo calls it ' most heinous mankind has ever known '
John Byrne
Published : Tuesday May 6 , 2008

Print This Email This An Al Jazeera cameraman who returned yesterday to his home of Sudan from Guantánamo Bay and delivered a speech broadcast live on Sudanese television described the US facility as " heinous . "
His speech was broadcast live on Sudanese television .
He was held at Guantanamo for seven years , and was never charged .
" After 2,340 days spent in the most heinous prison mankind has ever known , we are honored to be here .
Thank you , and thank all those defended us and of our right in freedom , " said Sami al Hajj , who spoke at an event organized by his family .
Hajj is the only major mainstream news journalist ever to be held at the prison .
His supporters claimed that he was being held in retaliation for US anger over the Arabic television network .
The cameraman was never prosecuted .
The US never published its allegations , but said in a hearing that Hajj was classified as an enemy combatant because he worked as executive secretary for a beverage company whose director allegedly aided Muslim forces in Bosnia and Chechnya .
He was also suspected of transfering money to a charity the US labeled as terrorist , and had interviewed Bin Laden .
Released after a 16 - month hunger strike , Hajj was visibly weak upon his return , according to the Miami Herald .
Hajj said he was arrested because of US frustration with Al Jazeera and his reports of alleged US human rights violations in Afghanistan .
" I was subjected to 130 [ interrogation ] sessions , more than 35 about Al Jazeera , and they wanted me to be a spy against Al Jazeera , " he said .

Micropayments on the march
FOR millions of East Asians , online gaming is not so much a hobby as a way of life .
“ Massively multiplayer ” online games such as “ Legend of Mir 3 ” and “ MapleStory ” have legions of devoted fans who spend an alarming proportion of their waking hours sitting in front of their PCs , at home or in internet cafés , doing battle with elves , wizards and mythological beasts .
Some players take their parallel gaming lives very seriously : one man murdered a friend in a dispute over a stolen virtual sword .
Many of these games rely on a business model that is different from the way the video - games industry works in the West .
Rather than selling games as shrink - wrapped retail products which can then be played on a PC or games console , the Asian industry often gives away the software as a free download and lets users play for nothing .
Revenue comes instead from small payments made by more avid players to buy extras for their in - game characters , from weapons to haircuts .
In this way , a minority of paying customers subsidise the game for everyone else .
Now this model is being applied outside Asia .
Electronic Arts ( EA ) , a giant American video - games publisher , is preparing to release “ Battlefield Heroes ” ( pictured ) , an online combat game with a slapstick sense of humour .
It will be a free download but will , the company hopes , make money from both in - game advertising and the sale of character upgrades .
Sean Decker of DICE , the EA subsidiary responsible for the game , says the game 's website is already attracting 60,000 visits per day , which bodes well for its launch later this summer .
PlayFirst , a publisher of “ casual ” games based in San Francisco , is already making a success of the micropayment model .
“ Diner Dash : Hometown Hero ” , a game that involves running a chain of restaurants , allows players to buy extra levels , clothing and decorations online .
John Welch , PlayFirst 's boss , says sales of such items now account for 10 % of the company 's revenue .
Micropayments are already proving successful in the field of social networking , notes Piers Harding - Rolls of Screen Digest , a consultancy .
He points out that Habbo — a self - styled “ hangout for teens ” that takes the form of a virtual hotel , and operates in 31 countries — generates the lion 's share of its revenue ( $ 66 m last year ) from sales of virtual clothing , furniture and accessories .
For games , the Asian model has many benefits .
It lowers the barrier to entry for new players by allowing people to play games without having to pay anything .
And since the game 's software is usually given away , there is no need to worry about piracy — indeed , the more a game is copied and passed around , the better .
Given the huge cost of developing the most advanced video games , however , the new model seems unlikely to push aside the traditional model of selling games on disc ( or as paid downloads ) any time soon .
But as gaming reaches out to new audiences , there may be more scope for new business models based on advertising and micropayments .

Joe Biden and Donald Trump face off for the first of three high stakes presidential debates .
I finished reading David Allen ’s unofficial productivity bible , “ Getting Things Done ” ( GTD ) about 2 and a half months ago .
Since then I ’ve made an asserted effort to implement his suggestions .
The fundamental goal was to simply increase my daily rate of productive output .
I found that some of David Allen ’s suggestions were instantly applicable , some needed a little tweaking to better suit my needs and others were a bit too rigid and were thus substituted for alternative methods .
After 2 months of fine - tuning I ’m happy to report that I have implemented a productivity system that works really well .
That ’s what this short article is about .
A crystal clear , 1 minute read on increasing your productivity by using the slightly modified GTD - based methods that have worked for me .
Let ’s get to it …
Create 1 Inbox ( Entry Point ) for All New Tasks –
This should be the only place you record the new things you must get done and the only place you need to reference when you are ready to review them .
I use my Outlook inbox as my GTD inbox .
This will work well for anyone like me who receives a large quantity of tasks via email .
If a task comes in any other format ( snail mail , face to face meeting , phone call , etc. ) , I immediately send myself one email with a descriptive subject and body ( more info below ) for each new task .
Create “ Work ” , “ Personal ” and “ Someday Maybe ” Folders – I created 3 subfolders under my main Outlook inbox for this purpose .
All work related tasks that must be done will be filed under “ Work ” and all personal tasks that must be done will be filed under “ Personal ” .
Any less urgent tasks or miscellaneous ideas will be filed under “ Someday Maybe ” ( these are open ended tasks like “ learn Spanish ” ) .
Completely Empty Your Inbox Every Morning – I completely empty my inbox every single morning without failure .
This entails deleting any garbage emails , instantly completing the open tasks that take less than 2 minutes to resolve ( more info below ) and then filing all the remaining tasks into their appropriate subfolders .
Instantly Complete All 2 - Minute ( or less ) Tasks –
This is the most useful GTD method in the whole book .
Every time you review new tasks ( or new small parts of bigger tasks ) ask yourself this question :
Will this task take me longer than two minutes to complete if I start on it now ?
If the answer is no , do it now .
File All Remaining Tasks with Actionable Labeling –
As you ’re filing all the tasks that take more than 2 minutes to complete , verify that the subject and description ( for me this is placed in the subject line of an email message ) of the task is clear and action oriented .
It ’s easiest to think of this in labeling method as having two distincts parts , the task subject and the next action description .
For example , “ Design New Website Layout | Meet with the CEO to discuss my design ideas . ”
Set Reminders in Calendar for Time Dependant Tasks –
You should place a reminder in your calendar ( for me this is the Outlook calendar ) for any task with an associated time dependency .
For example , a task entitled “ Design New Website Layout | Design meeting Monday 10 AM ” , should also have a reminder entry placed in your calendar for 10 AM Monday morning .
Review Every Open Task a Least Once a Day –
Once your inbox is empty , read through all the tasks in your “ Work ” and “ Personal ” folders everyday just to review what you have in there .
During this quick review process you will be able to remove tasks that have been completed , edit tasks as necessary with additional information and refresh your memory on all the open tasks you have .
Note :
Only review your “ Someday Maybe ” folder once a week at a set time .
Create a Short “ Everyday ” List for Complex Tasks or Projects – Create a short list of the things you must do everyday to ensure that you remain in control of a specific complex task or project ( a group of related tasks ) .
Review this list every morning or whenever you need a quick reminder .
This especially helps me get into the groove of managing new , long - term projects that I have not yet fully mastered .
An “ Everyday ” list might look something like this : Project X Everyday – 1 .
Meet with program managers , 2 . Review active status reports , 3 . Verify validity of open issues , etc .

Advisers to Mr. McCain said they thought the problems Congressional Republicans were having would not translate into significant problems for Mr. McCain .
But they said it steeled their resolve to run a campaign that distinguished Mr. McCain from both Mr. Bush and a Congress where he has served , in the House and the Senate , since January 1983 .
They said Mr. McCain would seek  sometimes explicitly , sometimes not  to distance himself by speaking critically of what he has described as excessive spending in Washington , as well on issues like the environment .
“ There ’s no question that the results in these special elections portend ominously for House Republicans , but they will have little impact on the presidential election campaign , ” said Steve Schmidt , a senior adviser to Mr. McCain .
The special election results left Democrats and Republicans in rare agreement about one thing : President Bush looms as a drag on Republicans .
Democratic leaders said a combination of anxiety among voters about the state of the country and the prospect of an unusually heavy turnout of African - Americans meant that many new Senate and House seats could be in play , including those in states like North Carolina that just two years ago seemed out of reach for Democrats .
Woody Jenkins , a Louisiana Republican who lost in a special House election this month , said in an interview that the high African - American turnout in his district was “ probably the decisive factor ” in his loss .
The election results also raised questions about what had been a main Republican strategy for the fall , if Mr. Obama wins the nomination : to link Democrats in conservative districts to Mr. Obama .
Mr. Obama , campaigning in Sterling Heights , Mich. , said the outcome in the Mississippi contest , to fill a “ hard - core Republican seat , ” proved that the strategy would not work .
“ They lost it by eight points , and they did everything they could , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ They ran ads with my face on it , and they said , ‘ Oh , you look at this , a former liberal , and his former pastor ’s said offensive things .
They were trying to do everything in the book to try to scare folks in Mississippi , and it did n’t work . ”
But Mr. Duncan , the Republican national chairman , said he thought the strategy would be effective as voters became aware of Mr. Obama ’s liberal record in the months ahead .
PHILADELPHIA – Hillary Rodham Clinton stumbled badly at last night ’s Democratic debate when she repeatedly refused to give a direct answer about whether she supports Gov. Spitzer ‘s plan to give driver ’s licenses to illegal aliens – and got slammed by her opponents for evasive double - talk .
“ I was confused on Sen. Clinton ’s answer , ” said Sen. Barack Obama , who backs the plan .
“ I ca n’t tell whether she was for it or against it . ”
He added , “ One of the things that we have to do in this country is be honest about the challenges that we face . ”
Sen .
Chris Dodd of Connecticut said a driver ’s license was “ a privilege , not a right , ” and that illegals should n’t be allowed to get one .
Clinton shot back that “ I did not say that it should be done , ” prompting Dodd to counter , “ You said yes . ”
“ No I did n’t , Chris , ” Clinton insisted .
The Democratic front - runner said illegal immigrants are “ driving on our roads .
The possibility of them having an accident that harms themselves or others is just a matter of the odds . ”
But she did not clearly say whether or not she backs Spitzer ’s plan .
That prompted MSNBC moderator Tim Russert to ask , “ Do you . . . support your governor ’s plan to give an illegal immigrant a driver ’s license ? ”
Again , Clinton would n’t respond directly , saying , “ We want people to come out of the shadows , ” and adding Spitzer is “ making an honest effort to do it . ”
“ Unless I ’m missing something , Senator Clinton said two different things in about two minutes , ” said former Sen. John Edwards .
The heated exchange took place at the tail end of a two - hour debate at Drexel University .
The driver ’s - license issue puts Clinton in a bind , because opposing giving them to illegals could alienate Hispanic voters and left - wing activists who are influential in the primary , while favoring the plan could alienate many moderate voters with whom the plan is highly unpopular .
Earlier in the evening , Obama and Edwards launched a tag - team attack against Clinton , pummeling her on her positions on the war in Iraq and her ability to take on the Republicans .
Obama said he would provide “ sharp contrasts ” on torture policy , trade and Iraq .
“ [ Leadership ] does not mean changing positions whenever it ’s politically convenient , ” the Illinois senator said .
“ She voted for a war , to authorize sending troops into Iraq and then later said this was a war for diplomacy . . .
Now that may be politically savvy , but I do n’t think it offers the clear contrast that we need . ”
Edwards said voters needed to determine “ who ’s honest , who ’s sincere , who has integrity . . .
Senator Clinton says that she believes she can be the candidate for change , but she defends a broken system that ’s corrupt in Washington , D.C. ”
Edwards said of Clinton ’s pledge to begin withdrawing troops without promising to bring them all home immediately : “ To me , that ’s not ending the war .
That ’s a continuation of the war . ”

As gas prices and oil profits soar , Bush promotes giveaways to corporations
By Joe Kay
30 April 2008
US President George W. Bush used a White House press conference Tuesday to trot out his familiar litany of right - wing proposals , ostensibly intended to address rising gas prices and the growing economic crisis facing millions of Americans .
The proposals are all designed in one way or another to increase the power of the oil companies , even as these conglomerates have begun posting record profits for the first quarter of 2008 .
Bush proposed opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) to oil drilling , increasing incentives to companies for refinery construction , and blocking new regulations and emissions targets for domestic energy producers .
Bush sidestepped questions on his administration ’s position on a limited proposal , advanced by Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate John McCain , for a summer moratorium on the federal gas tax .
Such a move would have only a marginal impact on gasoline prices .
Bush said there was no “ magic wand ” to deal with gasoline prices , and he blamed Congress for blocking previous energy bills that included some of his proposals .
Rising gasoline prices are beginning to have a major impact on the living standards of millions of people in the United States and internationally .
In the US , prices on Monday topped $ 3.60 a gallon , a record in inflation - adjusted terms and more than 21 cents above the price just two weeks ago .
The price for diesel fuel , used in trucks , tractors , and other vehicles , is at a record $ 4.20 a gallon .
According to a poll conducted on behalf of the Kaiser Family Foundation , 44 percent of the American population now cites the price of gasoline as a “ serious problem ” — more than any other economic concern .
The effects are predictably felt most keenly by those earning the least .
About 63 percent of those with incomes of less than $ 30,000 said gasoline prices were a serious problem .
In a country where the automobile is the primary and often only available means of transportation , it is not uncommon for a worker to have to fill his or her gasoline tank several times a week , compounding the impact of any price increase and putting a severe dent in household budgets already strained by rising food and other costs .
In some parts of the country , gasoline prices are soaring much higher than the national average .
In San Francisco , California , average prices topped $ 4.00 a gallon over the weekend .
The statewide average was $ 3.91 .
In Europe , prices are sharply higher as well .
In England , where regressive taxes make up much of the price , gasoline is close to £ 1.10 per liter , or about $ 10 a gallon .
In the US and in England , many independent truckers are unable to turn a profit off hauling goods , as the cost of filling a tank with diesel can now exceed $ 1,200 .
The cost of transport often exceeds truckers ’ pay .
On Monday , about 100 truckers staged a protest in Washington , while dozens converged on London .
Independent truckers staged slowdowns and stoppages throughout the country at the beginning of the month .
Within this context , the position of the Bush administration is essentially to do nothing .
White House press secretary Dana Perino emphasized this point on Monday , saying , “ I think it would be disingenuous and unfortunate for American consumers for them to be led to believe that there is a short - term fix [ to gasoline prices ] .
There ’s not going to be one . ”
The proposals from the Democrats are no more serious .
In addition to the tax moratorium , Clinton is proposing a suspension of oil input into the Strategic Petroleum reserve , a marginal increase in spending on alternative energy sources , and an increase in fuel economy over a period of 20 years .
Obama has rejected the tax moratorium on the grounds that companies would just increase their prices to make up the difference , and supports fuel economy standard increases and alternative energy investment .
None of the candidates are capable of raising the basic issue : that the energy market , so critical to the livelihood of billions of people and to the functioning of the world economy , is largely controlled by private companies , and that these companies exercise enormous influence over the political establishment in the US .
As usual , the oil companies and wealthy investors are reaping fortunes off of the economic hardship inflicted upon the vast majority of the population .
The current sharp spike in gasoline prices has been driven largely by the rise in crude oil prices , which reached close to $ 120 a barrel on Monday — once considered an unimaginable price .
The average price of oil in the first quarter was $ 97.94 , up 68.9 percent from a year ago .
There are a number of factors behind the increase in oil prices , including rising demand from China and India and a weak US dollar , in which oil is priced .
One of the principal factors , however , is the flood of cash into basic commodities , including oil and food , as wealthy investors have liquidated holdings in more risky financial assets and are looking for hedges on inflation .
This is creating a new bubble in commodity markets , forcing billions of people around the world to pay the higher prices generated by artificial demand .
Whatever the cause , the rise in oil prices has been a boondoggle for oil companies , which have begun announcing their first quarter 2008 profits this week .
Europe ’s two biggest oil producers , Royal Dutch Shell and BP , announced profits on Tuesday that far exceeded analysts ’ expectations .
The combined profit for the two companies was close to $ 17 billion — $ 9.08 billion for Shell and $ 7.6 billion for BP .
These figures include earnings attributed to the rise in oil prices .
If this rise is factored out ( as is done in the so - called current cost of supplies figures ) , Shell ’s profits were $ 7.8 billion and BP ’s were $ 6.6 billion .
That is , at least $ 2 billion in profit for the two companies can be attributed solely to the recent rise in oil prices .
Analysts expect the profits for Exxon Mobil , the largest private energy company , to soar to $ 11.2 billion in the first quarter , an increase of 22 percent over 2007 .
If the company ’s profits exceed expectations , however , it could beat its fourth quarter profits from 2007 of $ 11.66 billion — the record for a US company .
Of course , the top executives and investors will benefit enormously from these windfalls .
Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson received an 18 percent raise in 2007 , pulling in $ 21.7 million .
The oil companies will also give back billions to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends .
The news from Shell and BP came as a surprise to analysts , who have been concerned about profit troubles in the refinery component of production , which transforms crude oil into useable products like gasoline and diesel .
Giants like Shell and BP , and US companies Exxon and Chevron , are vertically integrated , including in their operations both oil extraction and refining .
In fact , independent refinery operations are fairing poorly , which could indicate that gasoline prices will continue their upward march over the next several weeks as refiners struggle to raise their own profits .
Valero Energy , a refiner , reported a 77 percent drop in first quarter net income on Tuesday , complaining that it had been unable to shift all of its increased costs ( from purchasing crude oil ) onto consumers .
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal , “ While the price of gasoline has been rising at the pump , those increases have so far been modest in comparison to oil .
In a bid to save their bottom lines , companies operating refineries , especially on the West Coast , are reducing their output .
That would likely drive fuel prices higher . ”
The Sacramento Bee reported that some of California ’s refineries “ have had problems returning to full production following their usual winter - spring overhauls , ” and that this has contributed to the near - $ 4 a gallon price of gasoline in that state .
There are indications that refiners have in the past artificially manipulated capacity and downtime in order to influence prices .
The integrated oil giants can make windfall profits on either the oil extraction or refining ( the upstream or downstream ) sides of the energy market .
Last summer , when gasoline prices were at $ 3.22 a gallon , much of the profits were booked on the refining end , and attributed to a shortage in refining capacity .
This has been the long term trend , as oil companies have shut down refineries in response to low prices .
In this context , Bush ’s insistence Tuesday that Congress grant incentives to increase refining capacity is absurd .
Bush noted on several occasions , “ It ’s been more than 30 years since America built its last refinery . ”
This fact — an indictment of the state of American infrastructure — has been a product of a deliberate policy of reducing refining capacity in order to force gasoline prices up .
The oil companies have no interest in building new refineries , with or without tax incentives .
Prices of basic foods such as rice and wheat also have soared in recent months .
Among the factors behind this price explosion is the shift to ethanol production , which has increased demand on some food items , particularly corn in the US .
Ethanol production , which Bush championed on Tuesday , has largely been intended as a boondoggle for agribusiness .
Also on Tuesday , Archer Daniels Midland , one of the world ’s largest processors of grains and other foods , posted a 42 percent increase in its quarterly profits ending on March 31 .
The ability of the oil companies to maintain record profits has been facilitated greatly by the enormous consolidation of the industry over the past 20 years .
The top five energy companies now control about 15 percent of global oil production , more than 50 percent of US domestic refinery capacity , and 62 percent of the retail gasoline market .
The entire structure of energy production on a global scale is completely irrational .
However , the consolidation of the energy industry has made the rational solution clearer :
There is no conceivable reason why these giant corporations — which straddle the globe in search of profits , have done much to encourage war and colonial occupations in key strategic areas , and have worked assiduously to block any attempt to deal with global warming — should remain in the hands of private individuals and under the sway of the profit motive .
Instead , the giant productive forces that control the lives of billions — including the energy and food infrastructure of the globe — must be transferred into public utilities , socially owned and democratically controlled .
Blood cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary artery disease and heart attack , so reducing your risk of high cholesterol is a worthy goal .
A smarter way of looking at cholesterol risk is by component .
However , the next time you brag that your cholesterol is nice and low -- or lament that your number is in the mid-200s -- know this :
" Your total cholesterol is a pretty meaningless number , " says Maureen Mays , M.D. , a preventive cardiologist and lipid specialist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland .
" Not only does the general public not know this , some doctors do n't either . "
Here 's why " the number " is so misleading .
Total cholesterol is calculated by adding LDL ( bad cholesterol ) , HDL ( good cholesterol ) , and one - fifth of your triglyceride total .
" We have been using this formula of adding a bad thing to a good thing and factoring in one - fifth of a bad thing , and it's not useful , " Dr. Mays says .
That 's one reason 50 percent of people who have a heart attack have normal cholesterol readings .
Health.com : Slash your heart disease risk by 83 percent
Effects of diet and exercise
A smarter way of looking at cholesterol risk is by component .
LDL , or bad cholesterol , is very responsive to good nutrition and exercise .
The target number is less than 100 mg / dL .
It 's not uncommon for LDL to swing up by 40 percent in response to a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in saturated and other unhealthy fats , according to Dr. Mays .
It can also drop by up to 40 percent in response to a heart - healthy diet and regular exercise .
Health.com :
The new cholesterol math
When should you have a cholesterol test ?
One in 500 people has an inherited risk of extremely high LDL and should be put on statins to control their risk of heart disease .
Health.com : Statins cut cholesterol and heart disease risk
Being overweight can also raise your triglycerides , for which the goal is 150 mg / dL or under .
High triglycerides put you at risk for type 2 diabetes , which is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent ; this means that if you have diabetes , you have the same risk of dying from cardiovascular problems as someone who already has coronary heart disease .
While increasing age and stress will slightly change your cholesterol panel , " stopping smoking is the best way to raise your good cholesterol , " says Dr. Mays .
It is critical for women nearing menopause to maintain a healthy diet and exercise plan to counteract the effects of estrogen loss .
Health.com : 10 simple food choices that can help your heart
Because estrogen suppresses LDL levels , women who reach menopause may notice a surge of bad cholesterol , says Denise Janosik , M.D. , a cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Saint Louis University School of Medicine .
Effect of drugs and alcohol
Certain medications , including the steroid prednisone and HIV drugs , can affect your cholesterol panel negatively , so much so that people who are on protease inhibitors for HIV need to be concerned about developing heart disease , according to Dr. Mays .
One to two drinks a day is fine for keeping your cholesterol in check .
More than that may raise triglycerides because of the high sugar and calorie content of alcoholic drinks .
Alcohol also raises HDL slightly , but this increase in good cholesterol is n't as great as that caused by a healthy lifestyle .
Hypothyroidism , too , can result in skewed cholesterol numbers .
" If you are fatigued and have sudden weight gain , it is good to have a thyroid screening , " says Dr. Mays .
" If your thyroid is n't working properly , your lipid panel will make no sense . "

BitTorrent watchdog MediaDefender is once again taking heat after it was accused of launching a pernicious attack that brought down a web - based distributor of legal video .
Jim Louderback , chief executive of Revision3 , said in this blog post that the FBI is investigating the assault , which at points flooded his site with more than 8,000 SYN packets a second .
The attack , which lasted through the Memorial Day weekend in the US , was enough to bring down the company 's public facing website , its RSS server and its internal email system .
The packets began appearing on Saturday and were directed at port 20000 , which happens to be the entry point for a BitTorrent tracking server Revision3 uses to distribute videos it has the legal rights to make available .
They came primarily from machines that brazenly bore MediaDefender 's IP address and did n't let up until sometime on Tuesday .
" Revision3 suffered measurable harm to its business due to that flood of packets , as the attacks on our legitimate and legal Torrent Tracking server spilled over into our entire internet infrastructure , " Louderback wrote .
" Thus we were unable to serve videos and advertising through much of the weekend . "
Representatives of MediaDefender , which is a wholly owned subsidiary of publicly traded company ArtistDirect , did n't respond to phone calls and emails asking for comment .
But as you can imagine , Louderback was a bit more motivated to speak with officials there and finally got a hold of interim CEO Dimitry Villard and vice president of operations Ben Grodsky .
According to Louderback , the former editor - in - chief for PC Magazine , they told him their computers had been injecting a " broad array of torrents " into Revision3 's tracking server for months .
The flood of SYN packets - the internet protocol equivalent of a " hi " that begins a face - to - face conversation - seems to have started once Revision3 closed the loophole that allowed MediaDefender 's unauthorized action .
" MediaDefender 's servers , at that point , initiated a flood of SYN packets attempting to reconnect to the files stored on our server , " Louderback wrote .
" And that torrential cascade of ' Hi's ' brought down our network . "
This is by no means the first time MediaDefender has been accused of thuggish behavior .
In September , a slew of internal emails turned up on BitTorrent sites , of all places , and showed the company engaged in tactics including " infrastructural sabotage , denial of service attacks , hacking , and spamming . "
MediaDefender is funded by a broad array of record labels and movie studios .
Of course , some people may say Revision3 is little more than a site that offers second - rate videos , so where is the real harm in knocking it off line for a few days .
Well , Louderback has anticipated that and offers this counterargument :
" What if MediaDefender discovers a tracker inside a hospital , fire department or 911 center ?
If it happened to us , it could happen to them too . " ®

A complete overhaul of the way in which people navigate the internet has been given the go - ahead in Paris .
The net 's regulator , Icann , voted unanimously to relax the strict rules on so - called " top - level " domain names , such as .com or .uk .
The decision means that companies could turn brands into web addresses , while individuals could use their names .
A second proposal , to introduce domain names written in Asian , Arabic or other scripts , was also approved .
" We are opening up a new world and I think this cannot be underestimated , " said Roberto Gaetano , a member of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Surely this will be nothing more than very , very irritating for people who want to use the internet ?

The organisation said it had already been contacted about setting up domains in the Cyrillic script - used in many Eastern European countries .
" This is a huge step forward in the development of the internet - it will unblock something that has prevented a lot of people getting online , " said Emily Taylor , director of legal and policy at Nominet , the national registry for .uk domain names .
" At the moment , there are one - and - a - half billion people online and four - and - a - half billion people for whom the Roman script just means nothing . "
Dr Paul Twomey , chief executive of Icann , described passing the resolution as a " historic moment " .
Country appeal Icann has been working towards opening up the 25 - year - old net addresses for nearly six years .
It was one of its founding goals in 1998 .
At the moment , top - level domains ( TLDs ) are currently limited to individual countries , such as .uk ( UK ) or .it ( Italy ) , as well as to commerce , .com , and to institutional organisations , such as .net , or .org .
The .com suffix is the most popular and most costly TLD .
To get around the restrictions , some companies have used the current system to their own ends .
For example , the Polynesian island nation Tuvalu has leased the use of the .tv address to many television firms .
Under the new plans , domain names can be based on any string of letters , in any script .
Individuals will be able to register a domain based on their own name , for example , as long as they can show a " business plan and technical capacity " .
Companies will be able to secure domain names based on their intellectual property .
The result could be thousands or even millions of new addresses .
" The most likely new TLDs to be pushed into the Icann process are those that have been under development for some time now - the geo - TLDs such as .cym for Wales , .sco for Scotland , .ldn for London , .nyc for New York and so on , " explained Marcus Eggensperger , of Lycos Webhosting .
Lasting legacy
However , the cost of setting up a domain - at least initially - will be an expensive business .
" We expect that the fee will be in the low six figure dollar amounts , " said Dr Twomey .
Q&A : Internet shake - up
The organisation has already spent close to $ 10 m on the proposals - set to rise to $ 20 m - and needs to recoup the costs .
" The costs of developing and implementing this policy will be borne by the applicants , " he said .
" But we 're certainly not setting this up for profit . "
Many have pointed out that because of the scale of the plan , its introduction and effect will have to be monitored closely .
" I am concerned about spending our TLD name inheritance for future TLD users , " said Dave Wodelet , also of the Icann board .
" I certainly do n't want future generations to look back at us with disdain for not being good stewards of this limited TLD resource . "
However , he said , on balance , he felt that technical and administrative hurdles could be overcome .
Public interest
It is not a view shared by everyone .
Many businesses have pointed out that the new system could be very costly .

" The major issue with the potentially large number of new TLDs is going to be for brand owners who will want to protect their trademarks , " said Mr Eggensperger .
" For a major pharmaceutical business , the cost of registering all of their trademarks when a new trademark is released runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds . "
Others point out that some generic domain names - such as .news or . sport - could become subject to contention and a bidding war .
Icann has said that it was " aware of all of the concerns " and that it had " considered them very carefully " .
It will implement an arbitration process to oversee disputes and has said that if all else fails a domain would go to the " highest bidder " in an auction .
" On balance , the board feels that adopting this resolution is in the best interests of the internet and the public at large , " said Icann board member Dennis Jennings .
The process of introducing the new system will start in 2009 , with the first websites possibly coming online in the final quarter of the year .

What are these ?
The train was on time , but the commercial launch of Wi-Fi Internet access service on high - speed trains between Brussels and Paris was marred by a technical glitch that kept many travelers offline for much of the inaugural journey .
Train operator
Thalys is installing Wi -Fi access points on its high - speed trains running between Paris , Brussels , Amsterdam and the German city of Cologne to connect travelers to the Internet via a satellite link or 3G ( third generation ) mobile networks while the train is moving , or to Wi -Fi hotspots in stations along the route .
But for the senior executives of the train operator and the system 's developers gathered on board the 1:13 p.m. departure from Brussels for the commercial launch of the service on Wednesday , pride quickly turned to dismay as they realized that dozens of journalists invited to test the service were unable to log in .
As technicians attempted to restore service , Henry Hyde - Thomson , founder and chairman of 21 Net , the company behind the technology , said the satellite link was still working but that the problem was with the on - board equipment .
" The DHCP server has given up for some reason , " he said , referring to the system that hands computers the IP ( Internet Protocol ) addresses they need to use the system .
When working , ThalysNet allows first - class passengers to create an account and connect to the Internet free .
Passengers in second class can access an on - board portal offering travel information and ticket reservations for free , but Internet access costs ¬ 6.50 ( US$ 10 ) an hour , or ¬ 13 for the full journey .
The trip from Paris to Brussels takes only one hour and 20 minutes , but the journey to Cologne is over three hours long .
By journey 's end , the server was working and it was possible to search Google and see the news headlines on CNN.com .
Jean - Michel Dancoisne , CEO of train operator
Thalys , sees broadband Internet access quickly becoming a basic need among business travelers .
The ability to deliver it will be a major differentiator between rail and air travel , he said .
ThalysNet is managed for Thalys by a consortium of three companies : 21 Net , which developed the satellite communications system for high - speed trains ; Nokia Siemens Networks , which supplies some of the equipment and installs and integrates the systems on the trains , and Telenet , a Belgian Internet service provider and hotspot operator , which provides the billing and authentication system .
So far , seven of Thalys ' 26 trains have been fully equipped for Wi -Fi : Paul Broekhuizen , head of the consortium , expects to have work on all 26 trains completed by October .
Signals are bounced off a satellite over the Atlantic Ocean and down to a base station in Spain .
The company currently allocates around 2 M bits per second to each train -- although with compression , that looks more like 4 M bps to users , said Hyde - Thomson .
There are no plans yet to shape or block particular kinds of traffic , and unlike many mobile phone operators , ThalysNet allows video streaming and voice - over - IP calls .
The only restriction is that access to certain Web sites carrying adult content is not allowed , said Ines Clenjans , business manager for Wi-Fi on trains at Nokia Siemens Networks .
For now , the Wi-Fi-enabled trains are easy to spot : in addition to the " Wi - Fi inside " stickers in every window , they have a large white radome on top , protecting a satellite dish 80 centimeters in diameter and 72 cm high .
The dish is motorized to keep it pointed at the satellite , however the train turns .
21 Net is seeking certification for a lower - profile dish that is oval in shape and just 45 cm high , said company spokesman Philip Haines .
In the future , the company hopes to use a phased - array antenna just 3 cm thick , " covering as much of the train 's roof as we can , " said Haines .
Phased - array antennas are composed of many flat elements which each transmit the same signal at different times to direct the beam .
Picture a " Mexican wave " in the crowd at a football match , where each person in the crowd jumping up and down creates the impression of a wave moving around the stadium .
The wave can be sent in another direction by changing the order in which people jump .
With a phased - array antenna 21 net hopes to do away with moving parts and bulky covers .
S.F. settles excessive force suit for $ 235,000 Victim in jaywalking case says officer broke her arm
San Francisco police officer Chris Damonte was featured in a controversial video produced in 2005 by fellow officer Andrew Cohen .

Kelly Medora , a petite preschool teacher who weighed about 118 pounds , went out with a friend in North Beach one Saturday night in 2005 for some fun .
Instead , San Francisco police officer Christopher Damonte , who weighed about 250 pounds , arrested her for jaywalking , twisted her arm behind her back and broke it with an audible crack .
Although Damonte and the city denied wrongdoing , the city recently mailed Medora a check for $ 235,000 , the largest amount ever to settle a lawsuit claiming San Francisco police used excessive force not involving a weapon .
The Office of Citizen Complaints , meanwhile , has found that Damonte used excessive force in the incident and that another officer failed to investigate Medora 's complaint .
Damonte faces a disciplinary hearing at the Police Commission and potential punishment including dismissal .
Damonte , 41 , a six - year veteran of the department , has been the subject of other misconduct complaints , according to city sources .
He was admonished in 2003 for inappropriately threatening to arrest a woman without authority , and he is among more than 18 officers disciplined for their role in the controversial 2005 Bayview Police Station videos , which Mayor Gavin Newsom denounced as racist , sexist and homophobic .
Damonte declined to comment .
Matt Dorsey , spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera , said the officers in the Medora case did nothing wrong , and the city settled only to avoid a potentially more costly jury verdict .
Eileen Burke , Medora 's lawyer , said the case showed police failed to properly investigate misconduct claims .
In a 2006 series , The Chronicle reported that the Police Department had a history of failing to control officers who repeatedly resorted to force .
Chief Heather
Fong said at the time that she was developing better ways to identify problem officers .
" We 've made a lot of progress , " said Sgt. Neville Gittens , department spokesman .
The North Beach arm - breaking incident highlights the kind of police misconduct records that have become secret under a recent state Supreme Court ruling known as the Copley case .
Gittens cited the ruling in saying the department would have no comment on the Medora incident .
Details of the incident became public because Medora filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing Damonte of intentionally using excessive force .
In defending the suit , the city was required to make public some evidence .
Broadway encounter
According to court records , the evening of Jan. 23 , 2005 , began serenely for Medora , 27 , a teacher at the Helen Diller Family Preschool .
After dinner in her Russian Hill apartment , she and a friend walked down to a club on Broadway , where each had two single - shot vodka and soda drinks , according to testimony .
They left at about midnight and walked west on Broadway , which was crowded with revelers .
Her friend stepped from the sidewalk between two parked cars to hail a cab .
Medora stepped off the curb behind her .
There was no oncoming traffic .
Seconds later , Damonte approached .
From this point on , the officers ' and teacher 's accounts diverge .
Robert Bonta , the deputy city attorney representing the police , said in court records that Medora and her friend had endangered themselves and others by walking into Broadway .
He said Damonte and another officer asked them to get out of the street and said they would be cited .
Medora walked away .
When Damonte caught up to her , he said , she refused to give him her driver 's license .
When police detained her , she allegedly screamed , struggled and struck an officer .
The city later said she was drunk , but the officers did n't cite her for that .
According to Medora 's account , Damonte seemed " irate " and " angry " from the start .
" I was fearful just of his demeanor , " she testified .
" He was definitely very threatening with the questions he was asking and his body language and his facial expression , the tone of voice he was using . "
Damonte grabbed her friend 's arm , held it up by her face and demanded she tell him her age , Medora said .
Damonte said he would cite her , but did n't say why .
Medora saw the name " R. Fitzpatrick " on Damonte 's jacket - he had borrowed it from another officer - and asked if that was his name .
This seemed to set him off , she said .
He said yes and demanded why she wanted to know .
" I do n't believe you 're treating my friend appropriately , " she replied , court records show .
" You have n't told us what we 're being cited for .
Please let go of her arm . "
Medora said Damonte started to scream at her .
Fearful , she said she turned and walked up to another officer and complained about Damonte .
By her account , Damonte then demanded Medora 's driver 's license .
Medora said she 'd give him her license if he told her what she did .
Instead , Damonte said " detain her , " by this account , and he and two other officers surrounded her .
She said she did not resist them , but merely clutched her purse .
Then Damonte grabbed her right arm .
" It all happened very quick , " she testified .
" Like he physically took my arm and twisted it up back by my neck to a point where I was completely immobilized .
And I said 'ow , ow . '
And he pulled even harder , and he snapped it . "
There was an audible " pop , " according to a police report .
The city 's lawyer said in court papers that Damonte used an approved method of holding her arm , but she struggled .
Then " in an effort to escape , " she squatted down and " broke her own arm . "
Lawsuit 's claims
Medora cried out in pain .
Police called an ambulance and cited her for jaywalking .
At Kaiser Hospital , she was treated for a spiral fracture to her right humerus .
Medical records state she was not intoxicated .
Medora said she phoned police from Kaiser to file a misconduct complaint , but no one responded .
Instead , an officer delivered a new citation for resisting , delaying and assaulting an officer .
The charges were later dismissed .
In her suit , Medora said Damonte had used excessive force , and that another officer , then - Sgt.
Timothy Oberzeir , failed to investigate the incident .
Oberzeir did not respond to a call seeking comment .
After U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte ruled there was enough evidence for the case to go to trial , the city settled .
Laporte ruled that a jury could find that Damonte " intended to cause her extreme pain and distress by breaking her arm . "
There was even a question of whether the officers had cause to arrest Medora for jaywalking , the judge ruled .
Police Commission staff refused The Chronicle 's request for a copy of any disciplinary charges pending against Damonte .
Such records used to be public , but in an August 2006 decision urged by police groups , the state Supreme Court ruled them confidential personnel files .
Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , introduced a bill last year to make police misconduct findings public , but the measure failed after police officers ' groups lobbied against it .
As a result , while Californians can readily learn about sustained disciplinary actions concerning doctors , lawyers and judges , similar information about police officers is secret , said Terry Francke , a First Amendment lawyer with Californians Aware , a nonprofit group that advocates open government .
Meanwhile , Damonte has filed a $ 1 million lawsuit against the city , saying Fong unfairly disciplined him for his part in the Bayview police videos .
His suit is similar to a pending case brought by 18 other officers disciplined in the video case .
The city denies the claims .

Recently I ’ve heard the name Myanmar pronounced several different ways on news broadcasts , and I was curious to know what the officially correct pronunciation was .
So I looked it up in Leopard ’s built - in dictionary .
Wow .
Other dictionaries offer a wide range of suggested pronunciations , but Apple ’s definitely takes the cake .
Update —
A couple of people wrote to say that Dictionary on their systems ( running Mac OS X 10.5.2 , just like mine ) had the correct pronunciation shown .
Reader Jonathan Lundell solved the mystery .
Dictionary has three different options for displaying the pronunciation key , which you can select in the Preferences window : US English ( Diacritical ) , US English ( IPA ) , and British English ( IPA ) .
It turns out that only the two IPA ( international phonetic alphabet ) choices show the pronunciation of “ Burma ” ; the US English ( Diacritical ) pronunciation is correct .
Mine is set to US English ( IPA ) .
And they conclude there 's a lot of bad information out there .
They try to set the record straight .
Bring a bottle .
[ The Diagnostic Guidelines Task Force of the International Society for Bipolar Disorder ( ISBD ) ] chairman S. Nassir Ghaemi , MD , MPH ... brought together some of the world 's clinical experts on bipolar disorder and key researchers with the goal of having them develop a more systematic and coherent set of diagnostic guidelines .
Also expanded was the definition of bipolar depression , according to Ghaemi .
" It is not just depression in someone who happens to have had manic episodes but rather specific kinds of depression with specific features , " he said .
... Clinical features include early onset of first depression ( before age 25 years ) , multiple ( 5 or more ) previous episodes of depression , family history of bipolar disorder , atypical depressive symptoms ( such as leaden paralysis ) , psychomotor retardation , psychotic features , and / or pathological guilt .
The subgroup describes this as a ' probabilistic ' approach to the differentiation of bipolar from unipolar depression , and offers a heuristic of operationalized criteria to be studied empirically .
Areas of dissensus persist ...
Most of the evidence , he explained , suggests that schizoaffective disorder does not represent a separate categorical disease entity ; rather , it is " a variation on schizophrenia or a variation on mood disorder or co-occurrence of the two . "
The subgroup recommended dropping the schizoaffective disorder diagnostic category altogether from DSM - V ...
Or , you find an elephant 's leg , and say , this is an elephant .
And next you find a horse 's leg , so you say , this has much in common with an " elephant , " same joint here , so this is an elephant also .
Which would be okay , except then we start making treatment decisions based on that logic : ah ha !
Antifungal cream is the mainstay of treatment for all elephant illnesses !
And meanwhile the elephant dies of throat cancer .
Does it make any sense that the best of our science suggests that the manipulation of four neurotransmitters is somehow involved in the treatment of every single psychiatric illness known , from anxiety to xenophobia ?
What do we say to all of those patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder ?
Oops ?
Is it any consolation to them , or their families , to hear that it 's actually bipolar ?
How about the criminal cases of schizoaffectives ?
Should they get new trials ?
Their new diagnosis of bipolar has more studies to draw from , it has more play in the legal system , and better known to jurors ?
As a final question , Ghaemi was asked if he believed bipolar disorder is being overdiagnosed .
" While unipolar depression , personality disorders , and schizophrenia have each had periods of overdiagnosis , there has never been an era in which bipolar disorder has been overdiagnosed , " he said , " no matter what skeptics claim . "
He said that concerns about bipolar overdiagnosis are largely anecdotal , have not been empirically well - established , and ignore solid evidence of continued underdiagnosis .
The lack of focus on bipolar disorder has led to neglect and controversy , Ghaemi noted .
" Our task force , " he said , " is a step toward more consensus and less controversy . "
From the article :
In other words , what do the best minds in psychiatry have to say about bipolar disorder ?
What says the latest data ?
That 's based on the PET scans and the NIMH genetic studies which have so far cost a quadrillion dollars , right ?
Well , here 's a line from the actual Guidelines .
It 's the kind of line that makes you , well , look upon the works , and despair : Got that ?
No ?
Good , it 'll go down easier .
So it 's soon to be official : Farewell , Depression .
What else does the team think ?
Oh : schizoaffective disorder does n't exist .
The question is , if the evidence has so far been indicating that schizoaffective is not real , why did we have to wait for the DSM to tell us it does n't exist ?
Why can't psychiatry simply make it happen ?
But the sleight of hand is saying that the schizoaffective is " really " a variation on a mood disorder ( read : bipolar . )
It is equally plausible that bipolar disorder is a variation of schizoaffective disorder since neither one exist except synthetically .
I do n't mean the symptomatology does n't exist , I mean the classification is completely empty .
We choose to call this thing schizoaffective , and now we choose not to .
We chose to call it depression , now we choose to call it bipolar depression .
It 's not like you chose to call it a unicorn but later discover it ' sa rhinoceros .
A more accurate analogy is that you chose to call this a unicorn , and now choose to call it a ki-ran .
Wait -- what 's a ki-ran , you say ?
And there 's some more sleight of hand .
Empirically ?
What 's the test to see if it is actually bipolar or actually depression ?
Especially when you have the power to change definitions ?
The best is at the end : Bipolar is the neglected diagnosis ?
And this will cause less controversy ?
Are you serious ?

To all intents and purposes the race for the Democratic nomination is over .
Barack Obama : About to gain 30 new super - delegates ?
Senator Obama needs slightly fewer than 200 delegates to pass the winning post and there are more than enough pledged delegates remaining to be elected , and super - delegates waiting to put him over the top .
What is important about Indiana and North Carolina is that Senator Clinton was not able to damage Mr Obama .
The Illinois senator showed himself to be resilient in the wake of three weeks or so of crisis and , much more importantly , he got back on the winning track .
This is the evidence that some super - delegates have been waiting for .
Many of them - most of them - had clearly made up their minds that they would not support Mrs Clinton , and so this had become a case of whether or not Mr Obama could close the deal .
That is what appears to have happened last night .
Cash shortage
Where do we go from here ?
My understanding is that probably today , but certainly within 48 hours , about 30 super - delegates will endorse Mr Obama .
That should give him further momentum .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mathematically , this will widen the gap between him and Mrs Clinton .
He has a bigger share of the popular vote , more pledged delegates , and will now overtake her in terms of super - delegates too .
I honestly believe that she will find a way to get out of the race before the next primaries - so as to not hurt her future and to not be blamed for hurting Mr Obama and his chances in the general election .
Here are the reasons :
There really is no mathematical chance for her to win
Her campaign is virtually out of money - and it will be difficult for her to raise significant amounts of money after last night
Not enough happened last night to give her any hope , so continuing would only give the appearance of wanting to damage Mr Obama Another problem she faces is that she is not perceived as a strong general election contender , because of her high negative poll ratings .
I have no evidence that she will throw in the towel , or when she will .
She is a Clinton and the Clintons do not have the word " lose " in their playbook - but these are the things I am hearing from supporters on both sides .
Disappointed women
You will also see pressure from party leaders and party elders on undecided super - delegates to come off the fence .
Mrs Clinton can help ensure women voters back Barack Obama
It is very important that some of that pressure comes from women , because Mrs Clinton has a devoted following among older women , who have a sense that this is the last chance in their lifetimes to elect a woman president , and the members of this demographic may not be keen on voting for Obama .
Expect leading Democratic stateswomen , such as Nancy Pelosi , Diane Feinstein , Barbara Boxer , Patty Murray and Blanche Lincoln to take on this role .
When they do that depends on how long they want this to go on .
These are the people who , together with Mrs Clinton , will send signals to older women supporters - not just delegates - that there is no chance for her , and that we have to get on with the general election campaign .

RIO DE JANEIRO , May 9 ( Reuters ) - Brazil sees no threat from Iran , despite U.S. concerns that the Tehran government is courting allies in Latin America , Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said on Friday .
Thomas Shannon , the senior U.S. official for Latin America , said on Wednesday that Iran was making allies in the region to counter Washington ’s traditional influence and could use them to threaten U.S. security .
“ This is news to me , ” Jobim said .
“ I ’m not working on that theory .
The information that I have has nothing about this . ”
Shannon urged Latin American governments to respect U.N. - backed sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program and urged them “ to be vigilant . ”
But Jobim told reporters that although Latin American governments were in close contact with each other over the setting up of a regional defense council , “ there ’s been no dialogue of this nature . ”
The prime U.S. concern seems to be the left - wing governments in Venezuela , Cuba , Nicaragua and Bolivia , which have all become closer to Iran in recent years .
However , U.S. officials have long complained that Iran - backed Hezbollah and other Islamic groups that Washington considers to be terrorist organizations are active in Brazil ’s Arab communities , especially in the so - called tri-border region where Brazil , Argentina and Paraguay meet .
Brazil , which does not classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group , has said it has had no indication that any terrorist cells are present in the region .

SAPBR.N has some exploration activities in Iran and the U.S. state of Florida has threatened to end its pension fund investment in any companies that have business dealings with Iran unless they divest by September .

Amalgam dental fillings – which contain the highly toxic metal mercury – pose a health risk , the world 's top medical regulatory agency has conceded .
After years of insisting the fillings are safe , the US government 's Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has issued a health warning about them .
It represents a landmark victory for campaigners , who say the fillings are responsible for a range of ailments , including heart conditions and Alzheimer 's disease .
Earlier this month , in an unprecedented U - turn , the FDA dropped much of its reassuring language on the fillings from its website , substituting : " Dental amalgams contain mercury , which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and foetuses . "
It adds that when amalgam fillings are " placed in teeth or removed they release mercury vapour " , and that the same thing happens when chewing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The FDA is now reviewing its rules and may end up restricting or banning the use of the metal .
Mercury is placed in tens of millions of teeth worldwide each year .
About 125 tons of it is used annually in dental treatments in the EU alone .
And it was used in eight million fillings ( including one million in children and young people ) in Britain in 2002 - 03 , the last year for which the British Dental Association ( BDA ) can produce figures .
The association continues to insist that amalgam is " safe , durable and cost - effective " and " does not pose a risk of systemic disease " , though it advises pregnant women to avoid " any dental intervention or medication " .
However , Norway and Denmark banned mercury from fillings earlier this year .
Sweden has cut its use by more than 90 per cent over the past decade , and mercury use is also heavily restricted in Finland and Japan .
Mercury makes up about half of an amalgam filling , where it is mixed with silver and small amounts of copper and tin .
The combination – which has now been used for some 150 years – is extremely durable , and its supporters used to stress that it locked in the mercury .
They now accept , however , that mercury vapour escapes , is breathed in , and gets into the bloodstream and organs , but they also stress that levels are very low .
Opponents argue that the metal accumulates in the body and no safe level is known .
Some research suggests that mercury from dental fillings may be linked to high blood pressure , infertility , fatigue , disorders of the central nervous system , multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer 's disease .
Dentists have been found to have high levels of mercury in their bodies as well being more susceptible to brain tumours and problems with concentration and manual dexterity .
However , a study that followed 507 Portuguese and American children for seven years after they received amalgam or mercury - free fillings found no differences in the rates of neurological symptoms between the two groups .
Nevertheless , more and more dentists – now some 500 in Britain – are setting up mercury - free practices , and more patients are demanding alternative fillings made of resin and glass .
The alternatives are more expensive and not as strong as amalgam , which leads the defenders of mercury to say that only mercury will do for molars , which carry most of the burden of chewing .
And some have released another toxic material , the gender - bending chemical bisphenol A .
But the alternatives are getting stronger , and the chemical is being used less in the newer products .
Even the BDA now says that the alternatives " have improved over time " , adding : " Trends towards greater use of these materials imply that there is to be a sustained reduction in the use of dental amalgam . "

Most custody deaths are a result of torture , the group says ( Photo : Prashant Ravi ) Nearly 7,500 people have died in official custody in India over the past five years , according to a report by a human rights group .
The report by Delhi - based Asian Centre for Human Rights says many of these people were tortured in custody .
It says the Indian government is in a state of denial about torture .
Even when action is taken against officials who are accused of wrongdoing , the report argues , the system tries to cover up any crimes .
The Indian report was released to coincide with the United Nations ' global day against torture on Thursday .
The rights group has collated official figures and found that 7,468 people - that is four people every day - have died in prison or police custody since 2002 .
Appalling Nearly all the deaths , it says , were the result of torture .
But the government routinely attributes deaths in custody to illness , attempted escape , suicide and accidents .
Suhas Chakma , director of the Asian Centre for Human Rights , says prosecuting responsible officials takes a long time in India , and leads to a " culture of impunity " .
" It takes about 25 - 30 years to prosecute somebody .
And by that time many of the accused are dead , or possibly the relatives that have filed a complaint are dead , " he said .
" So there is a culture of impunity which is given by the government of India , and I think this is the single most important factor which is encouraging torture . "
The report also criticises an appalling record of torture among armed groups which fight against the Indian state - highlighting in particular the actions of Maoist rebels .
But the onus is on the government , it says , to improve its record .
Torture , it recommends , must be made a specific criminal offence .
And the government should ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture without delay .

The ACM Curriculum board has re-opened the 2001 design for review .
Although ACM is a US - based organization , the curriculum is not only influential at the middle tier of US colleges and universities , but it is also taken seriously by many evolving and developing educational institutions overseas .
In recent years , the study of non-OO PLs , and of other key PL topics such as type systems , has grown increasingly marginal in the undergraduate CS curriculum .
In particular , the study of functional programming is not included in the ACM CS2001 core .
We may now have an opening to make a small change in this situation .
The ACM Curriculum board has agreed to consider a proposal on including FP as an equal to OOP ( 10 " hours " each ) in the standard curriculum .
This was the most concrete outcome of the PLC workshop at Harvard two weeks ago .
The proposal was drafted by Stuart Reges , Shriram Krishnamurthi , and Matthias Felleisen and was endorsed unanimously by the workshop attendees and by the SIGPLAN Executive Committee .
It proceeds on the premise that inclusion of FP in the core curriculum is the most important single thing that the PL community can do for CS education .
In particular , this will help prepare students for a properly designed though possibly optional PL course or courses .
Please consider contributing comments to the web site .
A simple " Yes , I think this is a great idea " will be helpful .
A short explanation is even better .
There is now a long list of comments supporting this proposal .
However , we have very few comments from people in industry , so comments from the many non-academics on LtU would be particularly helpful .
Examples of how FP has helped you would , I think , be particularly persuasive .
The web site is http://wiki.acm.org/cs2001/index.php?title=SIGPLAN_Proposal.
Unfortunately , you must be an ACM member to view or submit comments .
[ Edit :
This is important enough that I am promoting this item to the front page even though the link is only accessible with an ACM account .
The issue itself can be debated in the comments , and hopefully at some point an open mirror of the ACM discussion will be created .

Chicago is taking its status as one of the Top 10 Greenest Cities in the U.S. very seriously .
While other parts of the country are recovering from the havoc wreaked on their poor infrastructures due to floods , hurricanes and collapsing bridges , The Windy City is looking toward the future with plans to develop one of the premier Eco-landmarks of the new millennium .
The proposed project , still in the planning phase , is a two - mile expanse of bridge that will extend in an arch from Adler Planetarium on the south to East Wacker Drive on the north .
The bridge will create a breakwater in the Monroe harbor and provide a civic space for recreational activities , including running and biking , as well as additional protected area for boating and water sports .
Interestingly , the plan is a modern , updated version of the original breakwater proposed in the 1909 city plan of Chicago .
The current plan features the construction of wind turbines to line the bridge and create and alternate source of power for the city .
The actual breakwater itself will be built on a foundation of slag — a permeable byproduct of steel which will provide a habitat for aquatic wildlife in the lake .
Some critics insist that the project is way over the top .
With the $ 1 billion price tag , and the futuristic high - end design , they feel that it is less about the environment , and more about the city ’s 2016 bid to host the Olympics .
There ’s no doubt that the project would draw attention to Chicago as a highly desirable tourist destination , which does n’t necessarily work against eco-initiatives .
The bridge ’s design is a product of the Chicago based , and world - renowned design firm AS +GG .
Adrian Smith , the project ’s lead designer was also the lead designer of Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago , and the Burj Dubai which holds the record as the world ’s tallest building .
The eco - bridge is n’t just a “ home improvement ” project for Chicago — it ’s a world class structure designed to capture the attention of the world .
The bridge project is not an arbitrary concept that is meant to green wash the city .
Chicago has already taken the eco-revolution upon itself in the past decade , with such initiatives as the Green Roof Project , the Green Alley Project , and other steps toward eco-friendly municipal practices that are revolutionary to say the least .
For example , since 1989 , over 500,000 trees have been planted in Chicago ; and the building which houses the Center for Green Technology is one of the only municipal buildings in the world to have received a platinum rating for its green design and operation .
Mayor Richard Daly and his staff make no secret about their plans to define Chicago as the premier city for eco-conscious living in the U.S. Despite its industrial past , the city ’s administration and green organizations are on a massive educational campaign that seems to be having just the desired effect .
More and more Chicagoans are jumping in the bandwagon , and the city has seen itself transform in leaps and bounds in just a few short years .
Regardless of how beneficial the bridge project advocates claim it is , there is still the tiny little problem of the necessary funding to get the thing underway .
Raising $ 1 billion dollars for a shiny new bridge during a war and a recession may not be the easiest thing to do , and then there is the issue of meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who have a say in shoreline redevelopment .
There are some obstacles to overcome , but in a social and political environment when many people in this country are still not convinced that there is a need for environmental initiatives of any kind , Chicago will go down in history as one of the leaders who led our country to change during this period of environmental revolution .
That in and of itself should be enough to attract forward thinking investors and supporters .
After all , who does n’t want to go down as having supported the winning team from the very beginning ?
The U.S. national average gas price is now up to $ 4 a gallon , so unless you live in one of the few metropolitan areas that have a robust public transit system , you 've likely already spent a whole lot of coin on fuel this year .

Skip the gimmicks and question the myths
Let 's start with what does n't work .
We 've covered gas saving myths here before , but here 's a refresher .
The Environmental Protection Agency has tested hundreds of products and none of them have ever proven to improve fuel efficiency .
Some even decrease it !
If the fancy wing , the magic gas station fuel - boosting potion , or the magnets on your fuel line seem to be making your mileage go up you 're likely driving downhill with a nice tailwind .
There are strong opinions about how much gas air conditioning uses up , versus how much is wasted via drag with the windows kept open .
In multiple studies it has shown to have no or minimal effect on fuel efficiency .
Crank up the air conditioning and be comfortable .
Tire inflation falls into the same category : having your tires overinflated or under inflated with cause more wear on your tires but wo n't alter your gas bill much ( if at all ) .

Keep an eye on gas prices
Thanks to web sites like GasBuddy and GasPriceWatch , it 's easy to keep a tabs on which stations have the best prices in your area .
With frequent user - supplied updates , price indexing web sites can help you make the decision to fuel up right next door or on the way to work to save the most .
GasBuddy has even been incorporated as a feature in Google Maps .
However , do use common sense : you wo n't save any money , gas , or time by driving 12 miles across town to save $ 0.01 a gallon .

is both an industry and a hobby , in which a car is modified in order to improve its performance and handling and improve the owner 's driving style .
As most cars leave the factory set up for average driver expectations and average conditions , tuning has become a way to personalize the characteristics of the vehicle to the owner 's preference .
For example cars may be altered to provide better fuel economy , produce more power at high RPM or the ride comfort may be sacrificed to provide better handling .
KDE4Daily , a virtual machine image of KDE 4 with daily updates was released for KDE 4.1 .
This gives anyone the opportunity to test the newest KDE 4.1 sanely inside a virtual machine .
KDE4Daily had its debut in November 2007 when SSJ announced a virtual machine image with daily updates for the still in development KDE 4 .
Today it was announced that once again the KDE4 Daily project will provide a daily snapshot of the current KDE development in form of a virtual machine image .
The image itself is a some 660 MB large qemu image .
It can be run directly within qemu , but it is also possible to transform the image into for example a VirtualBox image .
Once launched the Ubuntu based Linux starts up and simply works .
It can be used to have a look at the new features of the upcoming KDE 4.1 .
But it can also be used to find bugs .
However , in case you find a bug always state that the bug was found inside KDE4 Daily – it could also be that a bug is specific to this special environment .
In any way , KDE4 Daily already shows that KDE 4.1 will indeed be an appealing Desktop Environment .
The following image gallery is just a random set of images I shot having a look at the virtual machine .

KDE 4.1 ships the first KDE 4 version of KDE - PIM apps .
They are still not based on Akonadi , but they are at least ported to KDE 4 .
In other news , the KInfocenter was also ported and got a face lift .

Responsible for such unwanted video game - to - terrible film adaptations as Alone in the Dark , Dungeon Seige , and the Blood Rayne ones , Uwe Boll may be one of the worst ( probably the worst ) big - name directors working today .
But that does n't mean he 's not a man of the people -- provided those people come in groups of one million or larger .
Speaking to FEARnet , the German director / pugilist responded to the ongoing petition to get him to stop making films :
FEARnet : Are you aware that there is a petition online , signed by 18,000 people , requesting that you stop making movies ?
Uwe : Yeah , I know that .
18,000 is not enough to convince me .
FEARnet : How many would it take ?
Uwe : One million .
Now we have a new goal .
Since this announcement , the petition has reached nearly 50,000 signatures , still 950,000 short of his challenge .
So if you care -- and actually believe he 'll respond to an internet - based petition -- virtually sign it here .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The wave of foreclosures sweeping the nation is driven in part by a nearly unprecedented decline in home prices and require a concerted government and private - sector response , Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , said Monday .
" Realistic public - and private - sector policies must take into account the fact that traditional foreclosure avoidance strategies may not always work well in the current environment , " Bernanke said in a speech before the Columbia School of Business .
Bernanke 's comments come as concern about the housing crisis and debate about how to help homeowners in trouble is growing .
Foreclosure filings of all kinds - delinquency notices , auctions sale notices and bank repossessions - were up 112 % during the first three months of 2008 compared with the same period a year ago .
Community advocates and policy makers are worried that the problem will worsen as the interest rates on as many as 1.8 million mortgages reset this year .
" High rates of delinquency and foreclosure can have substantial spillover effects on the housing market , the financial markets , and the broader economy , " concluded Bernanke .
" Doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers .
It 's in everybody 's interest . "
In explaining the forces behind the problem , Bernanke cited the " increasing role " of declines in home values .
He unveiled a series of " heat maps " that showed delinquency rates , job losses and home price changes .
Unemployment statistics , according to Bernanke , do not explain the increased delinquencies of many areas , including California , Florida and parts of Colorado , where foreclosure filings have increased even when unemployment generally have fallen .
More revealing was the close correlation between declining home prices and high delinquency rates .
On the home price decline map , states like California and Florida were drenched in red , indicating the worst losses .
On the map revealing the highest foreclosure rates , the same states were also covered in red .
Piggy - back problems
Bernanke pointed to the use of so - called piggy - back loans in helping drive foreclosures .
These loans , which required low down payments or none at all , were used with increasing frequency during the bubble years to enable borrowers to purchase homes in high - priced states .
Because of price drops , many of the borrowers are now " upside - down , " meaning they owe more than their homes are worth .
Many of the owners had counted on the idea that their home values would continue to soar , increasing their home equity , which they could then tap to pay their bills .
Now , they can't afford to pay off their mortgages and they have no assets to rely on .
In the past , said Bernanke , lenders and companies that service loans were " used to dealing with mortgage delinquencies related to life events such as unemployment or illness .
. . .
A widespread decline in home prices , by contrast , is a relatively novel phenomenon , and lenders and servicers will have to develop new and flexible strategies to deal with this issue . "
In some cases , such as when the value of a home has fallen below the mortgage balance , a writedown of principal may be the best solution , according to Bernanke , although , he added , to be effective they must be targeted to cases facing the highest risks of foreclosure .
What Washington can do
Bernanke outlined the steps that the Federal Reserve was taking to try to minimize the impact and scope of the foreclosure crisis .
The response includes working with community groups trying to acquire and restore vacant properties ; encouraging lenders and mortgage servicers to work with at - risk borrowers ; and developing new lending standards to prevent some of the abusive lending practices of the past from continuing .
The Fed , according to Bernanke , has worked closely with the Hope Now alliance - an industry foreclosure - relief effort spurred on by the Bush administration - to support help for troubled borrowers , develop protocols to standardize loss-mitigation approaches and improve reporting standards .
Bernanke also threw his support behind the expanded use of the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) and government - sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) to address problems in mortgage markets .
Opening up the lending markets has already helped thousands of at - risk borrowers to refinance into lower cost loans and save their homes , Bernanke said .
But with more than 156,000 families who lost their homes during the first three months of the year and with as many as 1.8 million adjustable rate mortgages scheduled to reset to higher rates this year , there 's still much work that needs to be done , he said .
イギリスのキッチンには必ずといっていいほど食器洗い機がある。大概キッチンの下にはめ込み式でかなり大きく、気合を切れて詰め込めば皿２０枚にコップ３０個くらいは一気に洗える代物だ。この「詰め込んでポン」で「皿洗い完了」の感覚に慣れると病み付きになり、食器洗い機なしに生活ができなくなる。
基本的にご飯粒など粘着力の強いものは落ちにくいが、この便利さに比べればご飯粒の一つや二つ残ってようが気にならなくなってしまうから怖い。それにも増して恐ろしいのは、ものを洗うという作業から意地でも脱出しようと悪あがきを始めることに尽きる。
最初は大体、風呂場の石鹸箱、花瓶という辺りから侵食が始まり、気がつけばゴミ収納部分が分解丸洗い可能なサイクロン式掃除機がそのまま食器洗い機に吸い込まれてしまっている。さすがに食器と同時には洗わないものの、手洗いでは取れにくい部品の隅の埃もきれいさっぱりピカピカである。
ここまでくれば食器洗い機の使い方は極めたもの、とタカをくくっていたら私の知り合いから、「まだまだ甘い」と指摘を受けた。彼女が「あんまり人には言わないでね」とこっそり教えてくれたのは、なんと「食器洗い機でクッキング」である。
イギリスの立食パーティーで出てくるものの一つに「鮭の丸茹で」がある。これを家庭で作ろうとすると、まず鮭が丸々茹でられる様な調理器具がない。オーブンの下段に水を張って蒸し焼きで……という手もあるが、ただでさえパーティーの準備ではオーブンはフル稼働、ふたを開けると既に４種類くらいの料理がその中でぐつぐつ、照り照りになっている。もう鮭の入るスペースなどない。
そこで、鮭をアルミホイルでしっかり防水して、オーブンではなく食器洗い機にそのまま放り込むのである！
「しっかりモード」で洗浄を開始すると水温は７０度まで上がるので、そのままスイッチを入れてほうっておくだけ。洗浄完了のブザーがオーブンの「チーン」の役回り。ふたを開けると、見事に出来上がっているらしい。
確かに彼女の家のパーティーに招かれたとき、テーブルの真ん中にはクスクスやサラダで周りを彩られ、ひんやりと冷やされた鮭の丸茹でが見事ないでたちで鎮座していた。てっきり有名デパート・ハロッズのデリか何かで注文したものだと思っていたら、種明かしは食器洗い機だったとは。パーティーで食べた鮭の味を思い出す。それにしても絶品だったよなぁ。

The invention of the microwave may have been intimately connected to the beginning of an epidemic in obesity , according to Jane Wardle , a professor of clinical psychology at University College London .
" I looked at the figures showing rates of obesity in the population over many years , and it seemed very clear [ that ] it began between 1984 and 1987 , " Wardle said in a debate at the Cheltenham Science Festival , which took place from June 6 - 10 .
" We looked at what changes were going on in the food and activity world at that time , and one of the striking differences was ... in the speed with which we could prepare a meal .
"
The microwave oven first became a common household appliance in the mid-1980s .
Wardle claims that the introduction of the microwave led to cheaper , easy meals -- including microwave dinners -- appearing in stores .
" I 'm not trying to demonize the microwave , but it was emblematic of a change that took place in the 1980s in terms of the availability of food -- a real change in the disincentives for eating .
" Between 1980 and 2004 , obesity rates in the United Kingdom skyrocketed from 8 percent of women and 6 percent of men to 24 percent of both men and women .
From 1995 to 2003 , the rate of obesity among children leaped from 10 to 16 percent .
Also at the Cheltenham Science Festival , two other researchers suggested alternate explanations .
Ken Fox , a professor of exercise and health science at the University of Bristol , attributed rising obesity to the widespread introduction of new technology after World War II that largely replaced physical labor " in both work and leisure .
" Tim Lang , a professor of food policy at City University in London , instead blamed the introduction of supermarkets , " heralding the late 20th century food revolution in which prices have tumbled , car use skyrocketed [ and ] physical activity plummeted . "

Background Basics on Socialized Medicine
SOURCE : AP / Chris O’Meara
Politicians have recently used the term “ socialized medicine ” to describe everything from the public - private plans that insure all Americans to the reauthorization of the Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
It ’s a concept that has been embraced , demonized , and misunderstood since the early 20th century in the United States .
We ’ve stood by and watched the entire industrialized world turn to varying forms of government - supported health care systems for all their citizens .
But , in part because of fears about socialized medicine , similar policy changes have been blocked here .
What exactly is socialized medicine , and why is it slander in the current health reform debate ?
Textbook Definition
The Columbia Encyclopedia defines socialized medicine as “ a system of health care delivery in which care is provided as a state - supported service . ”
In a strictly defined socialized system , the government controls all means and methods of delivering , financing , and allocating health care .
In practice , the government role in socialized medicine systems ranges from complete government ownership and salaried facilities and providers to public financing of private insurance and providers .
The loosest interpretation — used most often to scare Americans — applies to any government involvement in health care .
In fact , just last year President Bush called reauthorizing the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , which would have increased access to health care for millions of children , a “ move toward socialized medicine . ”
The Spectrum of “ Socialized ” Health Care
There are a variety of ways that governments can finance and deliver health care .
Government financing for health care systems is typically achieved through tax revenue and / or compulsory national health insurance plans .
Scandinavian countries such as Sweden and Finland are examples of strictly socialized medicine systems , in which the government operates all aspects of the delivery of health care and uses tax funding to disburse medical services to their citizens .
Similarly , the United Kingdom ’s National Health Service is completely financed via taxes and National Insurance contributions ; the government also employs doctors and nurses at NHS - run facilities .
They do allow some private insurance to augment national services .
Another model is a compulsory national insurance system , like those in Germany , Japan , Switzerland , and , most recently , Massachusetts .
Individuals must purchase health insurance under this type of system .
The government typically provides a base amount of support plus additional financing for low - income and high - cost individuals .
Such systems tend to be managed by employers , insurers ( sometimes called “ sickness funds ” ) , and other non-governmental actors .
In reality , most countries have some type of private / public balance .
This usually entails public funding for commercial and non-profit providers , and / or an allowance for the purchase of private insurance for services not covered through public funding .
Examples of this kind of arrangement vary with the degree to which the government is involved .
Australia ’s publicly funded Medicare program pays for doctors and public hospitals for all citizens , with incentives for people to purchase private insurance for private hospitals and services that are not covered ( for example , dental exams , cosmetic surgery ) .
The fact is that socialized medicine in its purest form is difficult to come by in the real world .
Some sort of private entity operates or is allowed to operate within almost every health system .
These private - entity roles mean that many systems are better classified as single - payer and universal health care systems , which differ from socialized medicine .
The chart below details these differences :
What ’s in a Name ?
Defining Health Care Systems
Point - Counterpoint
Socialized Medicine : Is The “ S ” Word Such a Dirty Word ?
Point Counter - Point Bottom Line Progressive plans in the United States are synonymous with “ European - style socialized medicine .
Progressive plans vary in their degree of proposed health care reforms .
None advocates socialized ( government - run ) medicine .
Universal health care does not equal socialized medicine .
Government - provided health care is merely one strategy to achieve universal health coverage .
The health care plans proposed in the current debate do not attempt to move the country toward socialized medicine ; they are hybrid plans that combine public and private elements in an attempt to achieve universal health coverage .
Socialized medicine means bureaucracy and government - run health care .
It would combine “ the efficiency of the post office with the compassion of the IRS . ”
The Veterans Affairs Health Care System , which is government funded and administered , is an example of a successful model of socialized medicine in the United States .
Although the veterans ’ health care system faces special challenges due to veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the VA delivery system continues to be lauded for providing some of the best quality health care in the nation .
Since adopting major reforms in the 1990s , ( for example , an electronic medical records system and performance indicators ) , the VA has dramatically improved the quality of care it delivers , and , according to some studies , it even outpaced other health care delivery systems .
Socialized medicine means you ’ll die waiting in line for health care .
Under our current health care system , people are already dying and waiting in overcrowded emergency rooms .
Given the absence of universal health care and a lack of access to primary care physicians , people continue to visit the ER like a doctor ’s office or forgo needed medical care ( then and now ) .
If waiting times are an important measure of health system responsiveness , it ’s no surprise that Americans wait longer for same - day access to care than nations with universal coverage .
In addition , ER wait times increased by 36 percent from 1997 to 2004 ( from 22 minutes to 30 minutes ) and waits for patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarctions increased 150 percent ( from 8 minutes to 20 minutes ) .
The U.S. has the highest rate of preventable deaths among 19 industrialized nations due to a lack of timely and effective care — evidence that we already ration care , partly on ability to pay .
The Situation in the United States
The United States relies primarily on employer - based and private insurance to cover the costs of patients receiving medical services .
However , the United States does provide certain populations , such as seniors and low - income children with government - subsidized health care or insurance that , in at least one case , is analogous to socialized medicine .
The Veterans Health Administration , which is similar to the British system , actually qualifies as a socialized system of medicine under the strictest definition .
The VHA provides medical services to retired , disabled , or recently discharged military personnel who are eligible to receive benefits .
VA medical benefits are only redeemable at VA hospitals and medical centers , which are owned and operated by the government ; health care providers working within the VHA are government employees .
The U.S. version of Medicare is best characterized as a single - payer system .
The government provides Medicare to all citizens over the age of 65 ( with various exemptions and exceptions ) using public funding that reimburses public and private providers of medical services .
Medicare is financed through general tax revenues , a 2.9 percent dedicated payroll tax split evenly between employers and workers , and monthly beneficiary premiums .
People who use Medicare may also supplement the program ’s benefits by purchasing private insurance , known as Medigap , taking advantage of employer - based plans , or opting to buy into Medicare Parts C and / or D ( which refer to the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug plans respectively ) .
Though Medicare Parts C and D are private plans , they are still contracted through the Medicare program , meaning that health care professionals are paid with government funds that are allocated to private insurance providers .
Fear and Smear of “ Socialized Medicine ”

The political definition of socialized medicine in the United States differs wildly from the textbook one .
Politicians like to claim that “ big government ” programs are a disruptive hindrance to the American ideal of free - market capitalism and individual choice .
The threat of socialized medicine has been used to block numerous reform efforts , as it plays on fears of the United States becoming a communist or socialist state on par with China , Cuba , or the former Soviet Union .
In the 1950s and 1960s , physicians called the move toward health care reform a “ Communist plot , ” impeding progress during the Truman administration .
In the 1960s , opponents of Medicare employed Ronald Reagan in their “ Operation Coffee Cup ” initiative .
The future president recorded an LP denouncing the proposed expansion on the basis that it was essentially the “ first step toward government control over every aspect of an individual ’s life . "
The public ’s view of socialized medicine is no longer rooted so heavily in the fear of our country becoming a communist or socialist state .
The new specters conjured by enterprising politicians are bureaucratic inadequacies that lead to poor medical outcomes , horrendous waiting periods , lack of choice of providers , overuse and abuse of limited resources , excessive taxation , and damage to private , free enterprise .
As in past debates , the reality of health reform proposals is far from the truth : none of the presidential candidates supports a government run or single - payer system .
Nonetheless , accusations of socialized medicine will likely continue to be raised about any reform proposal that is not based entirely on letting private insurance companies rule our health care system .

Point - Counterpoint
Socialized Medicine : Is The “ S ” Word Such a Dirty Word ?
Point Counter - Point Bottom Line Progressive plans in the United States are synonymous with “ European - style socialized medicine .
Progressive plans vary in their degree of proposed health care reforms .
None advocates socialized ( government - run ) medicine .
Universal health care does not equal socialized medicine .
Government - provided health care is merely one strategy to achieve universal health coverage .
The health care plans proposed in the current debate do not attempt to move the country toward socialized medicine ; they are hybrid plans that combine public and private elements in an attempt to achieve universal health coverage .
Socialized medicine means bureaucracy and government - run health care .
It would combine “ the efficiency of the post office with the compassion of the IRS . ”
The Veterans Affairs Health Care System , which is government funded and administered , is an example of a successful model of socialized medicine in the United States .
Although the veterans ’ health care system faces special challenges due to veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the VA delivery system continues to be lauded for providing some of the best quality health care in the nation .
Since adopting major reforms in the 1990s , ( for example , an electronic medical records system and performance indicators ) , the VA has dramatically improved the quality of care it delivers , and , according to some studies , it even outpaced other health care delivery systems .
Socialized medicine means you ’ll die waiting in line for health care .
Under our current health care system , people are already dying and waiting in overcrowded emergency rooms .
Given the absence of universal health care and a lack of access to primary care physicians , people continue to visit the ER like a doctor ’s office or forgo needed medical care ( then and now ) .
If waiting times are an important measure of health system responsiveness , it ’s no surprise that Americans wait longer for same - day access to care than nations with universal coverage .
In addition , ER wait times increased by 36 percent from 1997 to 2004 ( from 22 minutes to 30 minutes ) and waits for patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarctions increased 150 percent ( from 8 minutes to 20 minutes ) .
The U.S. has the highest rate of preventable deaths among 19 industrialized nations due to a lack of timely and effective care — evidence that we already ration care , partly on ability to pay .

The Last Words
Then : “ One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine , ” warned Ronald Reagan in 1961 , when he was enlisted by the American Medical Association to alert Americans to the dangers of socializing health care as part of “ Operation Coffee Cup . ”
Now : “ Those who are advocating a government - run health plan are offering a naïve and destructive vision … the counterfeit compassion of a utopian government - run health care system .
This legislation will help us reverse our slide toward socialized medicine … ” says Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) re : his Tax Equity and Affordability Act of 2007 .
We have n’t had Rudy Giuliani to kick around for a while .
But Rudy seems intent on throwing us a bone .
The Times reports that with the GOP for once running seriously behind Democrats in campaign fundraising , Giuliani is offering to hold fundraisers for down - ticket Republicans .
But with an important catch — he gets to keep part of the haul for himself .
Rudy has $ 3.6 million in campaign debt from his historically catastrophic campaign for the Republican presidential nomination .
And while the precise modalities are n’t completely clear , Giuliani is telling Republicans candidates that for him to come to headline a fundraiser to raise money for them — some of the cash has to be set aside to help him retire his campaign debt .
The article contains quotes from various Republicans operatives who seem to think Giuliani is a self - serving schmuck .
But the kicker comes in this passage toward the end of the piece …
The fact that Mr. Giuliani — who had an estimated net worth of at least $ 30 million in 2006 , according to financial disclosure forms filed last year — has loaned his campaign money gives the fund - raising a particular urgency .
Candidates generally have unlimited time to pay off campaign debt .
But if any portion of a personal loan to a campaign is unpaid by the end of an election cycle , the maximum amount that can be repaid with money raised after that is $ 250,000 , according to Bob Biersack , a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission .
That means that Mr. Giuliani could have to forgive all or part of his $ 500,000 loan if he does not raise the funds to pay it back before September , when Senator John McCain is formally chosen as the Republican presidential nominee , officially ending the primary elections
That is tough , is n’t it ?
$ 30 million Rudy is faced with the prospect of having to take a loss of as much as $ 250,000 unless he can find local Republican givers who ’ll give him a chunk of the money they ’ve set aside for funding the party ’s candidates .
Gary Spivey is world - renowned for his psychic talent , uncanny ability to predict future catastrophic events ( it ’s no wonder that people all over the world gave him the nickname ‘ The Modern Day Nostradamus ’ ) , his gift to communicate with those who have crossed over to the other side and for his amazing healing energy .

Fourteen servicemen died when a Nimrod exploded in mid-air in 2006
The families of some of the 14 servicemen killed when their RAF Nimrod plane exploded in Afghanistan in 2006 are to sue the Ministry of Defence .
A coroner ruled last month the Nimrod fleet , based at RAF Kinloss , had never been airworthy and should be grounded .
An MoD spokesperson said compensation would be paid to the relatives and any further legal claims would be dealt with when they were submitted .
Ministers have insisted the planes are safe to fly after changes were made .
Demands for legal action have been led by Graham Knight , whose son Ben was among those killed when the aircraft crashed in Afghanistan two years ago .
The crash was blamed on a fuel leak following mid-air refuelling .
But the aircraft are still flying and continue to operate in Afghanistan where the military sees them as crucial to the fight against the Taliban .
The lawyer in charge of the action , David Orchard , said the basis of the case would be in relation to Article 2 of the Human Rights Act .
He said : " The thrust is that they were sent into the theatre of war ill - equipped . "
Fourteen men died on that plane and apart from apologies nothing has really been done about it
Graham Knight Mr Orchard added that the families were not seeking compensation but a judgement .
Mr Knight told BBC Scotland : " Fourteen men died on that plane and apart from apologies nothing has really been done about it and although the planes have been deemed un-airworthy , they 're still flying . "
He added : " Had it been a bus company and it had been an un-roadworthy bus , legal action would have been taken against the bus company .
I feel that something needs to be done as nobody has been brought to task . "
Ministers insist the planes are safe now that mid-air refuelling is suspended and other changes have been made since the men died .
An MoD spokesperson said : " The Secretary of State has directed that compensation will be paid , and claims will be handled quickly and amicably .
" We are currently awaiting detailed evaluations of the claims from the families ' solicitors .
" Once these are received , we will deal with the claims as quickly as possible .
Any further legal claims will be reviewed as and when they are submitted . "

What are these ?
Saudi Arabia will raise oil production to record levels within weeks in an attempt to avert an escalation of social and political unrest around the world .
King Abdullah signalled the commitment to the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , at the weekend after the impact of skyrocketing oil prices on food sparked protests and riots from Spain to South Korea .
Next month , the Saudis will be pumping an extra half - a- million barrels of oil a day compared to last month , bringing total Saudi production to 9.7 million barrels a day , their highest ever level .
But the world 's biggest oil exporters are coupling the increase with an appeal to western Europe to cut fuel taxes to lower the price of petrol to consumers .
Saudi Arabia , which has called an emergency meeting of oil producers and consumers in the port city Jeddah next Sunday , says the energy crisis has not been caused purely by market pressures but by a speculative bubble .
Saudi Arabia and Opec believe there are no shortages to justify the sudden surge in prices .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Ban held talks with King Abdullah at the royal palace in Jeddah on Saturday evening for more than an hour which were dominated by the energy crisis .
The Saudi monarch shared his concern that the oil price was " abnormally high " although he blamed " national policies " in the West , Mr Ban told The Independent yesterday .
" He was also suggesting that consumers should play their own role , " Mr Ban added .
Just before his departure for London yesterday , he had a telephone conversation with the Saudi oil minister , Ali al - Naimi , who told him that Saudi Arabia had raised production this month by 300,000 barrels per day at the request of consumers , and next month would raise output by a further 200,000 barrels per day .
Mr Ban said : " He told me they will respond positively whenever there is a request for an increase in production .
So there will be no shortage of oil . "
Mr Naimi said Saudi Arabia was responding to requests from between 30 and 60 consumer countries .
Finance ministers from the Group of Eight nations meeting in Tokyo yesterday added to the chorus urging Saudi Arabia to increase production .
The UN chief said he had asked the Saudi minister whether the additional output would be enough to help stabilise the market , adding : " He said the consumers and others should play their own role . "
Mr Ban , who flew to Saudi Arabia after a meeting in London with Gordon Brown at Downing Street on Friday as Britain was in the grip of a protest by lorry drivers , conveyed the concerns of world leaders about the impending oil crisis .
The South Korean secretary general said : " Unless we properly manage these issues , this may create a cascade of all other challenges and prices , affecting not only social and economic issues but also creating political instability . "
But it appears the Saudis are just as worried that record prices – on Friday oil was being priced at just under $ 135 a barrel – could dampen growth in the industrialised West and lower demand , which would in turn hurt the kingdom .
As well as the protests in Britain , which continued with a go - slow by lorry drivers on the M6 on Saturday , oil - related protests have swept Europe and Asia in recent weeks .
Violence has erupted in Spain , riot police were deployed in Malaysia , several Indian states have been hit by fuel - related strikes and most of South Korea 's main ports have been paralysed by blockades .

Mr Ban said the King shared his view that the prices of oil and food were intricately linked to the issue of flooding and drought caused by climate change and needed to be dealt with comprehensively .
" But while he acknowledged this concern , he also expressed his own concern that common effort and co-ordination are required , particularly from consumer countries , " Mr Ban said .
Saudi Arabia , which is the only Opec member with spare capacity , has been under pressure from the Bush administration to increase production , with petrol now costing a record $ 4 ( £ 2 ) per gallon in America .
But the Saudis argue that although the barrel has jumped as high as $ 140 recently , they are earning less in real terms owing to the decline in the value of the dollar .
Until now they have hesitated to announce a large increase over a sustained period , sticking to the Opec line which blames Western speculators for the increase .
Opec countries generally follow the Saudi lead on raising levels of production , although the cartel 's president , Chakib Khelil , has said it will make no new decision until a September meeting in Vienna .
Gordon Brown is to attend the unprecedented meeting of oil producers and consumers in Jeddah , and the Energy minister , Malcolm Wicks , met Mr Naimi in Riyadh on Saturday .
The US , the world 's biggest oil customer , which has expressed considerable frustration with the Saudi position , will be represented at the meeting at ministerial level .
Yesterday 's Arabic - language newspapers had dampened down speculation about an increase in Saudi production .
The Al Riyadh newspaper quoted oil ministry sources who said that if there had been no increase in demand , there was no need to increase supply .
A commentator in Al Watan newspaper said : " Why should we please consumers and increase production ? " pointing out that the value of the dollar was in decline .
Saudi Arabia is keenly aware of the political and economic effect of the oil market on the upwards spiral of food prices , and contributed $ 500 m to the World Food Programme ahead of the food summit in Rome to enable the UN agency to cope with escalating problems in feeding the world 's poor .
Mr Ban thanked King Abdullah for that gesture .
Mr Ban 's talks in Saudi Arabia also focused on regional Middle East issues , including Lebanon , Israel / Palestine and Somalia , where a UN - brokered process backed by the Saudis has just produced a peace agreement .
Police arrested Gillian Gibbons , 54 , on Sunday after complaints by parents that she had acted blasphemously in allowing the toy to be called Muhammad .
Gibbons , a teacher at the exclusive British - style Unity high school in Khartoum , had asked her pupils to name the bear as part of a project to teach them about animals and their habitats .
" The teacher asked me what I wanted to call the teddy , " the boy told Reuters .
" I said Muhammad .
I named it after my name . "
His suggestion was put to a class vote and was the clear winner .
The boy , who said he was not thinking about the prophet when he put forward his choice , described Gibbons as " very nice " .
Gibbons , who is from Liverpool , spent her third night in jail yesterday , as she was moved from a local police station to a bigger police office in Khartoum north , where she is waiting to be charged .
She has retained a local lawyer , but embassy officials were prevented from seeing her yesterday .
" She is still in detention and the investigation appears to be ongoing , " said a British embassy spokesman in Khartoum .
" We visited her on Monday and we hope to be allowed to see her again tomorrow morning . "
Gordon Brown said yesterday that he felt " very sorry for what has happened to Miss Gibbons " , and that every effort was being made to ensure a speedy release .
The Muslim Council of Britain also condemned the arrest , saying it was " obvious that no malice was intended " .
The Sudanese government is insisting the law follow its course .
Mohamed al - Mardhi , the justice minister , told local media that he had ordered the country 's general prosecutor to take charge of the case .
" [ The charges ] are under the Sudanese penal code ... insulting religion and provoking the feeling of Muslims , " he said .
The offence carries a penalty of six months in jail or 40 lashes .
The teddy bear incident occurred in September , a month after Gibbons arrived in Sudan , but it was not until last week that Unity 's director was informed that a few parents had complained to the Ministry of Education that their religion had been insulted .
For devout Muslims , any depiction of the prophet Muhammad is regarded as blasphemous .
The school is closed until January , for fear of reprisals .
The feeling among most teachers and parents at Unity - Muslim and non-Muslim - is that the Sudanese authorities have overreacted .
" I 'm annoyed ... that this has escalated in this way , " Muhammad 's mother said .
" If it happened as Muhammad said , there is no problem here - it was not intended . "
An English mother , who had a child in one of the other classes in Unity , said : " I was just gobsmacked .
And when I talked about it to colleagues who were Muslims , they felt the same .
They were amazed .
" When I first heard about the teddy bear I thought ' Oh no , do n't go down that road .
That 's a really bad idea . '
But she had just arrived in Sudan .
She must have been idealistic , full of new ideas .
She just did n't realise that it was such a problem . "
Even the Sudanese embassy in London called it a " storm in a teacup " .
Khalid al - Mubarak , the embassy spokesman , told the BBC he expected the case would be treated as a " minute complaint " , and that cultural differences had caused the problem .

These words by Lee Iacocca are excerpts from his new book and have been circulating the net lately .
I could n’t help but spread the word as his opinions are my feelings as well .
I am not taking any responsibility for their accuracy , I ’m just passing on the information received .
Lee Iacocca Says :
‘ Am I the only guy in this country who ’s fed up with what ’s happening ?
Where the hell is our outrage ?
We should be screaming bloody murder .
We ’ve got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff , we ’ve got corporate gangsters stealing us blind , and we ca n’t even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car .
But instead of getting mad , everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say , ‘ Stay the course ’ .
Stay the course ?
You ’ve got to be kidding .
This is America , not the damned ‘ Titanic ’ .
I ’ll give you a sound bite : ‘ Throw all the bums out ! ’
You might think I ’m getting senile , that I ’ve gone off my rocker , and maybe I have .
But someone has to speak up .
I hardly recognize this country anymore .
The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs .
While we ’re fiddling in Iraq , the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do .
And the press is waving ‘ pom - poms ’ instead of asking hard questions .
That ’s not the promise of the ‘ America ’ my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for .
I ’ve had enough .
How about you ?
I ’ll go a step further .
You ca n’t call yourself a patriot if you ’re not outraged .
This is a fight I ’m ready and willing to have .
The Biggest ‘ C ’ is Crisis ! ( see the ten C’s in his book )
Leaders are made , not born .
Leadership is forged in times of crisis .
It ’s easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory .
Or send someone else ’s kids off to war when you ’ve never seen a attlefield yourself .
It ’s another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down .
On September 11 , 2001 , we needed a strong leader more than any other time in our history .
We needed a steady hand to guide us out of the ashes .
A Hell of a Mess , so here ’s where we stand .
We ’re immersed in a bloody war with no plan for winning and no plan for leaving .
We ’re running the biggest deficit in the history of the country .
We ’re losing the manufacturing edge to Asia , while our once - great companies are getting slaughtered by health care costs .
Gas prices are skyrocketing , and nobody in power has a coherent energy policy .
Our schools are in trouble .
Our borders are like sieves .
The middle class is being squeezed every which way .
These are times that cry out for leadership .
But when you look around , you ’ve got to ask : ‘ Where have all the leaders gone ? ’
Where are the curious , creative communicators ?
Where are the people of character , courage , conviction , omnipotence and common sense ?
I may be a sucker for alliteration , but I think you get the point .
Name me a leader who has a better idea for homeland security than making us take off our shoes in airports and throw away our shampoo ?
We ’ve spent billions of dollars building a huge new bureaucracy , and all we know how to do is react to things that have already happened .
Name me one leader who emerged from the crisis of Hurricane Katrina .
Congress has yet to spend a single day evaluating the response to the hurricane , or demanding accountability for the decisions that were made in the crucial hours after the storm .
Everyone ’s hunkering down , fingers crossed , hoping it does n’t happen again .
Now , that ’s just crazy .
Storms happen .
Deal with it .
Make a plan .
Figure out what you ’re going to do the next time .
Name me an industry leader who is thinking creatively about how we can restore our competitive edge in manufacturing .
Who would have believed that there could ever be a time when ‘ The Big Three ’ referred to Japanese car companies ?
How did this happen , and more important , what are we going to do about it ?
Name me a government leader who can articulate a plan for paying down the debit , or solving the energy crisis or managing the health care problem .
The silence is deafening .
But these are the crises that are eating away at our country and milking the middle class dry .
I have news for the gang in Congress .
We did n’t elect you to sit on your asses and do nothing and remain silent while our democracy is being hijacked and our greatness is being replaced with mediocrity .
What is everybody so afraid of ?
That some bonehead on Fox News will call them a name ?
Give me a break .
Why do n’t you guys show some spine for a change ?
Had Enough ?
Hey , I ’m not trying to be the voice of gloom and doom here .
I ’m trying to light a fire .
I ’m speaking out because I have hope .
I believe in America .
In my lifetime I ’ve had the privilege of living through some of America ’s greatest moments .
I ’ve also experienced some of our worst crises : the ‘ Great Depression ’ , ‘ World War II ’ , the ‘ Korean War ’ , the ‘ Kennedy Assassination ’ , the ‘ Vietnam War ’ , the 1970s oil crisis and the struggles of recent years culminating with 9/11 .
If I ’ve learned one thing , it ’s this :
‘ You do n’t get anywhere by standing on the sidelines waiting for somebody else to take action .
Whether it ’s building a better car or building a better future for our children , we all have a role to play .
That ’s the challenge I ’m raising in this book .
It ’s a call to ‘ Action ’ for people who , like me , believe in America .
It ’s not too late , but it ’s getting pretty close .
So let ’s shake off the crap and go to work .
Let ’s tell ’em all we ’ve had ‘ enough . ’

People often miss meals because they get busy or are trying to lose weight .
But how you skip meals , and the amount you eat at your next meal , can affect your overall health .
The scientific data on skipping meals has been confusing .
In some studies , fasting has resulted in measurable metabolic benefits for obese people , and in animal studies , intermittent feeding and fasting reduces the incidence of diabetes and improves certain indicators of cardiovascular health .
Even so , several observational studies and short - term experiments have suggested an association between meal skipping and poor health .
In recent months , two new studies may help explain how skipping meals affects health .
The most recent study , published this month in the medical journal Metabolism , looked at what happens when people skip meals but end up eating just as much as they would in a normal day when they finally do sit down to a meal .
The study , conducted by diabetes researchers at the National Institute on Aging , involved healthy , normal - weight men and women in their 40s .
For two months , the study subjects ate three meals a day .
For another eight - week period , they skipped two meals but ate the same number of calories in one evening meal , consumed between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m .
The researchers found that skipping meals during the day and eating one large meal in the evening resulted in potentially risky metabolic changes .
The meal skippers had elevated fasting glucose levels and a delayed insulin response — conditions that , if they persisted long term , could lead to diabetes .
The study was notable because it followed another study earlier this year that found that skipping meals every other day could actually improve a patient ’s health .
In that study , published in March in Free Radical Biology & Medicine , overweight adults with mild asthma ate normal meals one day .
This was followed by a day of severely restricted eating , when they ate less than 20 percent of their normal caloric intake , or about 400 or 500 calories a day — the equivalent of about one meal .
Nine out of 10 study participants were able to stick to the eating plan .
After following the alternate - day dieting pattern for two months , the dieters lost an average of 8 percent of their body weight , and their asthma - related symptoms also improved .
They had lower cholesterol and triglycerides , “ striking ” reductions in markers of oxidative stress and increased levels of the antioxidant uric acid .
Markers of inflammation were also significantly lower .
The conclusion , say the authors of the more recent meal - skipping study , is that skipping meals as part of a controlled eating plan that results in lower calorie intake can result in better health .
However , skipping meals during the day and then overeating at the evening meal results in harmful metabolic changes in the body .
With 100 % reporting , Dr. Paul took 17 % of the vote in South Dakota ( over 10,000 votes ) , 14 % in New Mexico ( over 15,000 votes ) , and 22 % of the vote in Montana ( over 20,000 votes ) .
Thanks to all those who came out in support of Dr. Paul in these three primaries and joined over 1,000,000 of their fellow Americans in voting for the message of freedom , peace , and prosperity !
@ITの記事は、発言の意図をねじまげて強調しているという指摘があった。確かにこのエントリを見ると、かなり印象が違う。id:next49さんの方が、パネラーの発言の真意をよく理解してまとめている気がする。
しかし、私は、このエントリを読んでますますIT業界に絶望的な気分になった。
多分西垣さんの言いたいことはそうではない。西垣さんが引用した言葉は「10年泥のように働き、次の10年で人材管理などを十分勉強してもらい、次の10年で学んだことを発揮してもらう」というような意味合いだった。言いたい言葉の意図は「業務を体に覚えさせ、体で覚えた業務をもとに人材管理を学び、そして、管理・運営を行える人材となる」ということだと思う。
これは、個人に対する心構えとしては、納得できる部分もある。
実際、私はほぼこの時間割通りに生きてきている。83年に就職して93年まではIT業界の中で「泥のように」働いて、93年頃から徐々に普通と違う仕事に移行していった。その過程でコンピュータのこともそれ以外のことも相当勉強した。そして、2003年頃からは本格的にブログで発信するようになった。「泥経験」の10年と次の10年の勉強が、その頃から、ブログ以外のことでも役に立ってるという感覚はある。
しかし、これを企業側の姿勢として受け取れば、「10年泥のように」は、新人が異物で無くなるまでは、その力を一切使う気がないという宣言だ。
会社や業界の色に染まってない時期、フレッシュな感性やアイディアを持っているうちは本当の即戦力ではなくて、泥にまみれてネズミ色のスーツが似合うようになってきてはじめて人材として評価される対象になるということだろう。
IT業界はコンシューマだけではないけど、直接消費者を相手にしてモノやサービスを売る部分もたくさんある。そういう産業の大部分がWEBによる地殻変動に直面している時に、そんな考えでいいのだろうか。外部から入ってきた人は、社内の人間が持ってない情報、感性、価値観を持っている。それをアンテナとして会社がどれだけ有効活用していけるかどうか、普通のコンシューマ産業は今みんなそれを考えていると思う。
それと、この発言をした人は、その場が「アウェイ」だという認識はあったのだろうか。
このフォーラムは、背景に学生のIT業界に対する不信感があって、それを解く為に企画されているのだと思う。業界の中から見てそれが誤解に思えたとしても、既に不信は相当広がっているわけで、価値観に大きな開きがあるという現状認識を持って臨むべき場だ。
「 10年泥のように」という言葉を、たとえば入社式の訓示の中で使ったとしたら、その真意を汲まない方が悪いかもしれない。それは、聞く側が、その場にある特有のコンテキストに近づこうと努力して聞く場だからだ。
これは想像で言うのだが、IT業界の偉い人は、常にコンテキストを深く共有する人の中だけで働いてきた人である。そういう集団の中でのまとめ役、調整役としては有能だったのかもしれないが、「アウェイ」できちんと言葉を発する経験はあまりされてないのではないかと思う。「役員会に英語を」の部分も含めて、そういうキャリアを想像させる発言である。
では、コンシューマ以外の分野、企業の業務システムならば、内向きの企業文化に染まった人たちだけでやっていけるだろうか。
確かに、それは日本の中では大きな強みとなる。業務システムを構築する時に、外資系は自社のコンセプトを上から押しつけるのに対して、国内のメーカは、客先の企業文化を大事にして、それを壊さないように手間をかけてシステム化する。そういう信頼関係の中に異物が入りこむことは難しい。
たとえば、小規模な小売店と地場に密着した問屋の伝統的な商習慣みたいなものを、なるべく壊さないようにコンピュータに乗せるなんてことは、自分たちもどこか共通点を持つベンダーでなければできない。こういう仕事をする為には、ユーザ企業の持つ言語化されない意図を汲み取れるSEが必要で、「泥のような」修行期間は必須である。
しかし、外資はそこに入ってこないで、コンビニのフランチャイジーにPOSシステムを提供するというような入り方をする。
これたとえ話で私が言いたいのはPOSシステムではなくてSaaSのことだ。SaaSは、自社の業務プロセスを変える気がない会社には入らないだろう。SaaSは、それを活用して従来の業界を壊すような会社に採用されていくだろう。SaaSによって客を奪われることはないけど、客をつぶされることでシェアを奪われていく、そういう危機が迫っている。
そういう時期に、異物を異物のまま活用する気が全くないことを見せてしまって、それでいいのだろうか。
それでは業務システムでも、民間の競争と隔離された社会のインフラとなるようなシステム。そういうシステムならば、安定した企業文化に支えられた昔ながらのシステム開発が必要とされるだろうか。
IT 業界と十把一絡げにまとめているが、人材がもっとも欲しいと思っているのは業務システム・インフラ系システムを開発しているところであり、ここで求められる人材像は業務知識に精通し、かつ、大規模システムをチームワークで作れる人材である。技術力を持っているに越したことはないが、技術力があったとしても業務知識がないと開発に投入できないので、どうしても社内で教育して育てる必要がある。このような業務システムの開発は、西垣さんが引用した現場叩き上げ主義とよくマッチする。
これは、西垣氏の真意を汲んだ正確な要約だと思う。
しかし、ここで言っている「技術力」とは、30年前のプログラミングの水準の話である。確かにその頃には、プログラミングができるだけでは、大規模で高品質なシステムを開発することは不可能だった。
こ の30年間にプログラミングは相当進歩しているが、そこに全く注意が払われてないことをこの発言は示している。
たとえば、次のような議論がある。
非常に専門的な議論なので、あえて@ITの真似をして煽り風味でまとめると、Web回りでたまたまうまくいったやり方で「TDDを知らない年寄りはもう全員引退しろ。これからは俺達の時代だ」みたいに、いい気になってる若造を「馬鹿やろ、この世界はそんな甘いもんじゃねえ」と業界の重鎮が諫めている図だ。
しかし、諫める側 のCoplien氏が強調するのは、「業務知識」のようなあいまいなものではなく科学的なエンジニアリングの重要性である。プログラミングを体系的に整理して、高度化することで大規模なシステム開発を管理する方法論である。
いわゆるギークとは全く違うタイプだが、Coplien氏もまたスーパープログラマの一人である。こういう人が語ると、業務システム・インフラ系システムも全く違う世界に見えてくる。
日本で同じような議論をしたら、Coplien氏のようなC++の達人ではなくて、Cobol時代のプログラミングしか知らない人が出て来るだろう。
日本のIT産業は、30年前の技術に最適化されている。しかも、当時のプログラミングで解決できなかった問題を、企業文化の中に取りこんで属人的に対応して、そのままになっている。それを「業務知識」と呼び、それを暗黙知のまま継承することを強いている。だから、Coplien氏が進めているような、人材の配置を含めた開発プロセスそのものを見直すことを要求する技術を取り入れる余地が無いのだ。
そして、これらの問題全ての背後にあるのは、組織の共同体化ではないかと思う。組織が、内部の特有の文化、価値観を守ることを第一の目的としてしまっている。だから、危機を認識すると、より一層内向きの言葉で内部に向けて固まろうとするのだ。

Almost all of our proposals and policies for global warming are aimed at reducing fossil fuel use .
Yet even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow , global warming will continue for decades .
Why is our approach so one - sided ?
The dominant view of global warming is that it's a technical problem .
The burning of fossil fuels --- often regarded as the lifeblood of modern economies --- puts greenhouse gases into the air , mainly carbon dioxide .
These trap more solar energy , which makes things hotter and alters weather patterns .
We used to have three greenhouse blankets , and now we have four or five .
The solution is defined as reducing greenhouse gas emissions ( pollution ) .
The political , social , and moral campaign is directed at technological change , and at using our technology less .
Stopping at five or six blankets is better than going to seven or eight , but it wo n't restore our climate .
Our technology cannot economically remove carbon or other excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere .
Limiting ourselves to technology - focused solutions does n't give us the leverage we need to actually fix the problem .
The best we can do is wreck the world slower .
There is another side to global warming , one that existing scientific panels are ill - equipped to recognize , and that existing political institutions are ill - equipped to act on .
Global warming is not just an atmospheric pollution problem caused by fossil fuel burning .
Like the ancient problem of desertification , it is also a systemic problem --- the result of changes in basic biospheric processes .
Let 's look at some examples .
Carbon
Carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning represent less than 3 % of the net annual flow of carbon into the atmosphere .
The other 97 % also results from combustion reactions --- respiration , decay of organic compounds , and burning of biomass .
These reactions emit carbon and yield energy .
The right hand bar below represents the flow out of the atmosphere .
This is driven by the photosynthesis of green plants ( including ocean phytoplankton ) .
Photosynthesis is the reverse reaction : consuming solar energy , plants take in carbon , and store both carbon and energy in complex organic compounds .
The difference between the two flows is less than 3 % .
This makes the fossil - fuel contribution loom large in the ongoing accumulation of atmospheric carbon .
There is also a guilt factor .
Fossil carbon is a human add - on to the natural cycle of carbon from plants to atmosphere and back again .
But as a wealth of new findings are showing , the rest of the carbon cycle is also controlled or influenced by human decisions .
Our circle of influence is a good deal larger than our concerns over fossil fuels and deforestation .
Because humans exercise such dominion over the growth , decay , and combustion of plants , most of these carbon flows represent our human desire to survive , and to prosper .
They are our habits , and may be difficult to change .
But they are also our decisions .
For thousands of years , long before we discovered fossil fuels , people have been burning and oxidizing carbon compounds that were formed by photosynthesis .
Cutting down and burning trees , or burning grass , brush , or crop residue are obvious examples , and still hugely popular .
Less obvious but more significant is the release of stable soil carbon to the atmosphere through plowing and other forms of soil exposure , whereby aerobic microbes rapidly oxidize or “ burn ” the carbon compounds .
Today our soils still contain twice the carbon that the atmosphere does , and these historic and prehistoric losses of soil carbon to the atmosphere can only be guessed at .
And it 's ongoing .
Tillage continues worldwide , productive grassland turns to dusty desert , and millions of tons of soil carbon are oxidized into the atmosphere .
But it does n't have to be this way .
Around the world , progressive farmers and graziers have accomplished some spectacular and rapid reversals of this soil carbon loss , at little additional cost .
That 's right , reversals .
In some cases this is a byproduct of their search for sustainability , for maintaining or increasing production while decreasing their dependence on fossil - fuel inputs such as fertilizers , chemicals , and tillage .
Unlike vegetation ( even trees ) , the carbon in soil organic matter is fairly stable , lasting more than a generation on average .
Pasture cropping
Colin Seis , an innovative grain and sheep farmer near Gulgong in Australia , has doubled the organic carbon in his soil in little more than a decade .
He did n’t set out to do this .
In order to make his operation profitable , and to regenerate the fertility lost by a century of misguided farming practices , he began sowing cereal crops directly into perennial pasture , thus combining farming and intensive grazing while reducing herbicides and tillage .
Profits increased because inputs decreased .
Another thousand Australian farmers are following his lead , and the system is spreading to North America and Europe .
“ The hardest thing to change is your head .
Once you ’ve done that , the rest is easy , ” he says .
“ Do n’t spend a cent , ” he advises farmers .
“ Throw away your disc plow .
Put your animals into large mobs and start moving them around . ”
These approaches increase photosynthesis while slowing decay or respiration .
No , this is n't a secret technology .
It 's management , enhancing and working with biospheric processes instead of going to war against them .
It 's not abandoning all technology and modern knowledge , going back to some mythical past .
It 's new knowledge , based on mimicking natural patterns .
Let me repeat that --- with good land management , it 's possible to take carbon out of the air , rapidly and cheaply .
But documentation is scarce , because in our technology - focused society these achievements , and the tremendous opportunities they represent , are seldom recognized .
Instead , we regard land use --- cattle , corn , houses , or trees --- as a fixed category , with determined environmental effects .
We do n't pay attention to how it is managed .
Researchers familiar with conventional and industrial agriculture tend to underestimate the soil carbon opportunity .
Many are hoping for some kind of technology to capture carbon out of flue gases or out of the air .
So far , it 's not practical or economical .
Reversing combustion requires energy , and any recovered carbon or carbon dioxide becomes a disposal problem .
But with good land management , photosynthesis can turn atmospheric carbon into valuable soil organic matter , using free solar energy .
Energy
As you might guess from the diagram , photosynthesis captures far more energy than all the world 's mechanical power .
Even in the industrialized U.S. , with all our spinning shafts and gas flames , and with all our plowing , paving , burning , and herbicide spraying , those ridiculously inefficient green plants capture more energy .
Carrying capacity
On his small grassland farm in Virginia , Joel Salatin produces more pounds of beef , chicken , eggs , pork , lamb , and rabbit than most conventional farms or extension agents would consider possible .
He does this with few outside inputs , and builds soil , organic matter and carbon , and increases fertility in the process .
Salatin's methods are described in Michael Pollan 's book The Omnivore 's Dilemma .
Salatin produces such quantity and quality by working with and enhancing the biospheric processes such as water cycling , nutrient cycling , solar energy flow , and synergy among species ( rather than separation and confinement ) .
By selling his products directly to his loyal customers , he makes a white - collar income from his 100 + acres of grass .
The Farm Bill is likely the biggest energy policy the U.S. has .
It pays farmers to refuse the free gift of solar energy by subsidizing short - season annual row crops such as corn and soybeans , and a style of agriculture that keeps mostly bare ground between plants and between crops .
Nebraska and Iowa look impressively green in July and August , but much of the rest of the year they are brown , with few perennial plants growing .
Soil is America 's biggest export , far surpassing even empty shipping containers .
Much of our agricultural “ production ” is really consumption .
The Farm Bill encourages the heavy use of fossil energy in agriculture by favoring high - yielding monocultures dependent on nitrogen extracted from the atmosphere by fossil fuels , plus herbicides and pesticides .
This nitrogen ( usually anhydrous ammonia ) contributes to the “ burning ” of soil organic matter , compounding the debt .
It does n't have to be this way .
People have figured out how to raise excellent food using mostly solar energy while building soil --- but this is n't at all popular with fossil carbon lobbyists , or with their many influential friends .
Water
Among greenhouse gases , water vapor is the gorilla .
While carbon dioxide may be the primary driver of global warming , there 's more water vapor than other greenhouse gases , and it traps lots more heat .
Yet the world 's soils , even in their currently dried - out state , hold five times as much water as the atmosphere .
With the loss of sponge - like organic matter , soils lose much of their ability to absorb and retain water .
At the soil particle level , it 's like the difference between a brick and a balloon .
You can wet a brick , but you can put a liter in a balloon .
For the difference over an acre , add lots and lots of zeroes .
Large - scale land clearing and tillage , along with the continued desertification of rangeland soils , lets an invisible Columbia River 's worth of water evaporate skyward from the soils of the American Southwest .
The Rafter F
After taking a course in the Holistic Management decision framework , Roger Bowe made big changes on his ranch in eastern New Mexico by transforming his grazing management .
Instead of continuously grazing his herd over a wide area , he bunched them so as to intensify grazing and then give the plants an adequate recovery period .
Careful monitoring of the soil surface conditions enabled him to adjust his grazing for best results .
Over ten years , plant cover doubled , undesirable snakeweed declined by 90 % , and pounds of beef produced per acre more than doubled .
His costs decreased significantly , giving him more profit .
“ The words water cycle , mineral cycle , energy flow , and succession became the words we used to describe the landscape , ” Roger says .
“ This is like a foreign language to most ranchers and it is sure not what I was taught in school . ”
With less bare soil , rain infiltrates better , less of it evaporates , and more is available to grow plants and recharge groundwater .
A well on the property that ran dry in the 1950s came back with 10 feet of water in it .
Roger says that during a heavy rain from a thunderstorm , his rangeland soils can absorb two inches of rainfall before it begins to flow across the surface .
On similar land , managed in a more conventional way , rain began running off after only half an inch .
Legal protections prohibiting human use wo n't fix this situation , at least not on a timescale that matters to us or our descendants .
What has proven to get more water in the soil in these environments is intensive grazing , carefully managed .
The opportunities
We 've got to reduce fossil fuels .
In their new book Breakthrough : From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus have pointed out how transforming both our energy systems and efficiency is a huge opportunity to create millions of good jobs and revitalize our industrial base , and to move toward a positive future rather than merely try and avoid a negative one .
But to really address the problem , we will need to look beyond technology to the way we manage land .
We do not have , nor will we be able to afford , technological replacements for photosynthesis , for water cycling , or for the majority of carbon cycling --- all of which support and sustain our life .
Transforming human land management is also a tremendous opportunity .
It promises multiple , simultaneous benefits : more and better water for all , revitalization of rural economies , a more sustainable food system , and enhanced human and environmental health .
Taking full advantage of this opportunity will involve new paradigms and a new politics .
If we regard nature as a kingdom or category separate from humanity , the human is often seen as a habitual criminal who can be counted on to vandalize nature for personal gain .
Many prosperous developed countries have adopted a policing role intended to protect nature from the human criminal .
Zoetvlei
Near Vryburg , South Africa , rancher Sandy Speedy has been keeping records of rainfall and kilograms of beef produced since 1972 .
Using the Holistic Management framework , Speedy and his family have tripled the amount of beef they produce from an inch of rainfall --- by managing grazing to increase soil cover , water infiltration , and soil moisture .
“ The limiting factor is not rainfall , as we have been told , but management , ” Sandy Speedy says .
The South African government has done away with agricultural subsidies , which Sandy says will be “ better for the soil , for the water cycle in a country short of water , and for the agricultural community .
It is an opportunity for sound agricultural management . ”
Though it may be a necessary stage of development or a process of maturity , this cops and robbers game offers little opportunity for creating the kind of land management we need on our working landscapes .
For this we need to move in the opposite direction --- toward the results we need rather than just punishing what we do n't want .
This means incentives and opportunity for the farmer , the villager , the grazier , the peasant to enhance these basic biospheric processes .
By tying incentives to results , rather than practices , we could empower people to come up with their own creative , locally adapted , low - cost methods .
The land management we need , and that provides such an opportunity for addressing both desertification and global warming , brings with it a new paradigm , a new understanding of the foundation or center of gravity of what we regard as nature .
This new understanding is totally at odds with the scarcity - based , zero - sum beliefs and behaviors of both industrial agriculture and protectionist environmentalism , and with their associated academic traditions .
Future installments will explain this new understanding through solar energy flow , water cycling , nutrient cycling , and community dynamics and succession .
Then we 'll practice with issues : biofuel crops , the Farm Bill , urban sprawl , invasive species , and more .
I will also outline the new politics that we need to take advantage of these opportunities , and how to practice it .
自宅兼オフィ ス
大学院卒業を目前に控えたある日。携帯電話が鳴った。父からだ。「お前の実印、どこだ？」。何のことか分からないまま答えた。「机の2番目の引き出しにあるよ」
その実印で父は、1つの会社を登記した。「株式会社ワディット」。名字の「和田」
と「 IT 」をひっつけた。父の和田正則さん（59）と息子の裕介さん（26）、2人だけのIT企業。所在地は神奈川県鎌倉市。自宅だ。
社長は裕介さん。 「 大学院を卒業したら、いきなり社長になっていた。特に会社でやりたいこととか、なかったんですが……」。2006年9月、24歳のころだった。
Webの 「 あちら側 」 「こちら側」という考え方がある。梅田望夫さんが「ウェブ進化論」（ちくま新書）で提唱して広まった。あちら側とはGoogleやAmazonなどがサービス展開するWebの世界。こちら側とは、企業内の情報システムなどローカル環境のことを指す。
「 あちら側とこちら側をつなぐ試みは、これまでほとんどなかった」と正則さんは言う。「あちら側」に詳しい裕介さんと、「こちら側」に詳しい正則さん。2人一緒なら、間をつなぐことができるはずだ。
「 スーツだのギークだの、言ってる場合じゃない」（正則さん）
ニートになるつもりが、社長になっていた
裕介さんは06年9月に慶応義塾大学政策・メディア研究科修士課程を修了し、いきなり社長になった。
研究室で は“ 映像の万華鏡 ” 「 mooo-pong」などメディアアートの作品制作に取り組んだり、ほぼ独学で覚えたプログラミングでネットサービスを作った。楽曲ライブラリを通じてコミュニケーションできる音楽再生ソフト「VACUUN！」はIPAの2003年度未踏ソフトウェア創造事業未踏ユース部門にも採択された。
「 子どものころ か らBASIC をいじっていたとか、そういうのは一切なくて」。プログラミングそのものよりも、ネットやPCが伝える音楽や映像に、わくわくしたという。
始めて触れたPCは、中学生のころ家にやってきた富士通「FMV」。Windows 3.1でパソコン通信やゲームに興じた。ネットを始めたのは高校生のころ。Windows 98を積んだソニー「VAIO」で、体育祭の仮装用の音響を編集したり、海外のWebサイトからMP3ファイルをダウンロードし、MDウォークマンに詰め込んだ。
99年のフジロックフェスティバル。新潟県・苗場の会場から鎌倉の自宅に、映像がリアルタイムストリーミングで届いた。途切れ途切れの粗い映像だったが、はるか遠くで演奏しているロックバンド・ブラーの姿が鎌倉の自宅のPCで見られたことに、衝撃を覚えた。
慶応進学の決め手もネットの映像だった。高校3年生のころ、慶応が配信していた、村井純教授の講義のストリーミング映像。ゲストとして招かれたマイクロソフトのCTO（当時）古川享さんが語るネットの近未来像に夢と可能性を感じた。映像制作、プログラミング、メディアアート――大学と大学院でITの面白さに浸かり、研究に打ち込んだ。
就職活動はしていない。何となく行きたい会社がなかった。脱サラを考えていた父と「2人で会社を作ろう」と話もしていたが、しばらくはニートにでもなるつもりだった。
だから 「卒業していきなり社長」は想定外。「ネットの企業だから、社長は若い方がいいでしょう」。正則さんはそう考え、息子を社長にしたという。
仕事がな い
事業計画も収益見込みもないまま、社長という肩書きを持った24歳の裕介さん。「
Webサイトを作るぐらいのリテラシーはあるから」と、まずはWebサイトの受託制作をしようと考えた。
友人知人、いろんな人に声をかけ、仕事をもらおうとした。「今度お願いするよ」。そう話には上っても、なかなか今度が来ない。仕事がない。収入がない。「どうしよう……」
思いついたアイデアは付せんに書いてべたべたと貼っている
ある時突 然「いいや」と吹っ切った。必死で仕事を探すのは辞め、面白そうなものをひたすら作り、ブログに書いた。「お金はどうでもいいから、好きなことをやって発信していこうと思って」
新しい技術を学んではサービスを練り、次々に公開した。YouTubeに投稿された楽曲のプロモーション動画をオリコンのランキング順に掲載する「CDTube」や、「 YouTube」のお気に入り動画リストを「iTunes」のポッドキャストとして取り込めるサービス「ListPod」――新サービスは発表するたび、ネット上で大きな反響を呼んだ。
ハンドルネームはあだ名から取った「ゆーすけべー」。ブログは「ゆーすけべー日記」。「裕介日記じゃアイデンティティが薄いから、身を削った」という。その名に恥じず“ すけべ” なサービスも作った。
アダルトサイトの更新情報を集める「エロリスト」や、投稿サイトからアダルト動画を抽出し、AV女優名で検索できる「YourAVHost」など。YourAVHostは想定外の反響でアクセスが集まりすぎ、自宅のサーバが反応できなくなったほど。「ゆーすけべー」の名前は、Webエンジニアの間に知れわたっていく。
普通の人に楽しいサービスを
自宅で1人で開発する裕介さん。先輩社員もいないが、PerlやPlaggerの開発者コミュニティーで先輩エンジニアに助けてもらっている。分からないことにぶつかるとIRCで教えてもらう。Webで知り合った技術者と実際に会う機会も増えてきた。
最近 「ネットサービスの進化は限界に達したのでは」という議論もある。だが裕介さんは「まだまだ可能性がある」と話す。「ネットにへばりついている人が使うサービスは限界に来ているかもしれないが、たまにしかネットを使わない人向けのサービスは、まだまだ出せる」
アルファギークの最先端サービスでなくていい。普通の人に響くサービスを作りたい。「僕が欲しいものは、普通の人が欲しいものだから」
不思議なことに、仕事が入るようになった
疲れたらいつでも眠れる
作りたい物を作り、書きたい物を書いて発表しているうちに、受託開発やコンサルの仕事が順調に入り始め、仕事も軌道に乗ってきた。「やりたいことをやっていたら、不思議なことに、仕事が入るようになった」
オフィスは自宅2階の自室。通勤ストレスもなく、時間を有効に活用できるのが気に入っている。朝は7時半〜8時に起き、午前中には2時間ほど読書。父と昼食を採りながら話し、少し昼寝し、しゃっきりした頭で午後の仕事に打ち込む。
メールで依頼を受け、都内で会って打ち合わせる。週1日は都内に出かける。約2時間の道のり。そう遠くはない。
父・正則さんのオフィスは、隣にある祖母の家の1階。普段はSkypeでやりとりしているが、込み入った内容なら隣に出向いて直接話す。ネットの動向を教え、企業システムや経営について教えてもらう。
60 歳定年なんて 「 そんなの関係ない！ 」
正則さんが、勤めていた総合化学企業を辞めたのは56〜7歳のころ。あと4年も勤めれば定年だった。

Almost immediately in his article , Mr Shane indirectly justifies torture and paints a fantastic picture of the interrogator :
" Mr. Martinez came in after the rough stuff , the ultimate good cop with the classic skills : an unimposing presence , inexhaustible patience and a willingness to listen to the gripes and musings of a pitiless killer in rambling , imperfect English . "
He then goes on to describe the " rapport " that Martinez built up with KSM , as well as the " ad - hoc nature of the [ CIA interrogation ] program , " and even painting the CIA as " nearly devoid of expertise in detention and interrogation . "
The rest of this article is more of the same .
He gives a brief bio of Martinez that sounds like it might have been plagiarized from a Clancey novel 's introductory bio of Jack Ryan .
Next , he goes on to describe , in glowing fashion , Martinez ' work - even concluding the article by describing Martinez doing " more lucrative work with government contractors " at " a consulting company run by former military psychologists who advised the C.I.A. on the use of harsh tactics in the secret program . "
Mr Shane never mentions the CIA Kubark manual from 1963 , which encourages the use of psychological torture , nor the updated version from the 1980s that was widely used in Central America .
The CIA 's knowledge of " detention and interrogation " goes back to at least 1950 , when they started funding academic studies - and it can easily be argued that it goes back to the end of WWII when they were still the OSS recruiting Nazi scientists .
Mr Shane never mentions that the CIA manuals say that " all coercive techniques are designed to induce regression " and that :
" The deprivation of stimuli induces regression by depriving the subject 's mind of contact with an outer world and thus forcing it in upon itself .
At the same time , the calculated provision of stimuli during interrogation tends to make the regressed subject view the interrogator as a father - figure .
The result , normally , is a strengthening of the subject 's tendencies toward compliance . "
It 's clear to me that Mr. Martinez was playing the role of the " father - figure " here .
The idea that Martinez is some kind of hero because " He chose to leave the infliction of pain and panic to others , the gung - ho paramilitary types whom the more cerebral interrogators called “ knuckledraggers ” , " is absurd .
Martinez , intentionally or not , was playing a role in a method of interrogation that has been laid out by the CIA for over 40 years !
I did n't look all of this up after I read the NYT article - it has been freely available for years .
The CIA manuals have been public since 1997 , and there has been plenty of analysis by folks far more knowledgeable than myself .
Stephen Soldz has written many understandable - to - the - layman articles discussing both the psychological and moral aspects , both on OEN and his own blog .
For those with short attention spans ( like myself ) , there was this article published almost two years ago on KOS that explained the basics of CIA torture !
Over the last few days I ’ve been “ tagged ” a few times from “ tagged.com ” .
I hid the names to protect the guilty , though I ’m not actually sure why I would want to do such a thing .
Anyway , a Google search revealed some people posting unbelievable things about it .
One person even suggested that it required users to give it their email account ’s password – and that they do it !
This had to be verified .
I set up a Yahoo mail account , and signed up for Tagged .
Turns out it did n’t ask you to give your email password .
It requires you to give your email account ’s password .
It actually checks , as you ’re doing this , that it is the right password .
Wow .
People really are idiots .
After this , you get to click through – I kid you not – 10 , count ’em , 10 , offers , at after which you get to do whatever , I guess .
Meanwhile , having gained access to your email account , it logs and sends emails to spams everyone in your address book .
Presumably it will then sell every address it finds to spammers .
The really shocking thing is , some of the people “ tagging ” me with this work in IT .
They seem reasonably intelligent people , even .
Yet they ’re still giving the password for their primary ( yes , their primary ) email account to some site they just found on the internet , presumably because it spammed them !
Social engineering will never be solved .
How can it be , if even so - called - professionals will surrender their passwords that easily ?

A few weeks ago I reported to you about the surprise victory of Bob Kelleher in the race for the US Senate seat in the Montana State Primary .
Kelleher , an 85 - year old Butte lawyer , defeated five other Republican candidates in the June primary despite being a liberal whose only stance in common with the Republican Party seems to be his opposition to abortion .
Kelleher has run for office 16 times in the last 44 years , primarily as a Democratic candidate , but with a few Green Party runs as well .
He won only once before : in 1971 , when he was elected to Montana ’s Constitutional Convention .
There , he assisted in modernizing Montana ’s century - old Constitution , helping create one of the most progressive governing documents in the country .
Despite his party - hopping and his ultimate decision to run in this year ’s election as a Republican , Kelleher ’s stance on major political issues tend to lean even further left than most Democrats : he supports FDR - style government work programs to reduce poverty , he advocates nationalizing American oil and gas industries , and he ’s in favor of implementing a government - run , socialized healthcare system .
Another dramatic leap from the traditional Republican stance – and frankly a dramatic leap from anything endorsed by any other American politician I am aware of – is his advocacy of a “ nonviolent revolution ” to overthrow the foundation of American government , replacing our legislative and executive branches of government with a parliamentary system .
Kelleher believes that true government accountability can only be achieved when politicians stop “ passing the buck , ” stating that we would be better served with a parliamentary system like that of the United Kingdom , with one party in power , headed by a Prime Minister ( not to be confused with the other popular parliamentary system in Europe , that of proportional representation ) .
As we have all observed , with separate legislative and executive branches the President and Congress continually fight each other to pass legislation , forcing compromises and causing each to blame the other for what was or was n’t accomplished during their respective tenures .
With a parliamentary system , voters vote for a party rather than individual candidates , and the party with the most votes wins .
Because the party has the exclusive power to pass legislation and does n’t have to compromise with any other party , the members of the party must take responsibility with the Prime Minister for the legislative and policy outcomes of their tenure , be they positive or negative .
While I think there is something to be said for weighing the pros and cons of a parliamentary system , overhauling our political system is not a popular concept in Montana .
At the Republican Party state convention in Missoula this past Friday , Kelleher was denied the opportunity to speak , and although he got a separate room in which to meet with other Republicans and discuss his message , more reporters showed up to listen than party members .
Mike Lange , who Kelleher beat in the state primary a few weeks ago , and who just last week announced that he would continue his bid for the Republican US Senate seat through a write - in candidacy , got more traffic at the party ’s state convention than Kelleher .
Lange is infamous for his angry outburst at the end of the 2007 legislative session , when he called Gov. Brian Schweitzer an “ S.O.B. ” and told him that he could go “ straight to hell . ”
He was subsequently ousted from his role as majority leader by the GOP , but he contends that his mainstream Republican stance on issues will give voters a conservative choice in November .
At this point I do n’t see Kelleher managing to overcome Max Baucus in the fall , but it is possible that his primary victory is a sign that Republicans in Montana are ready for a change in party issues .
U.S. Rep. and ( former ? )
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul managed to secure 22 % of the Montana vote , indicating a potentially widespread disapproval of the Republican Party .
Time will tell if his unusual opinions will make any mark on the November election , but Kelleher ’s persistence for nearly half a century has paid off .
For this long - shot candidate , the sixteenth time was the charm .
House prices are down 6 % in just the last five months , and the worst of the credit crisis - all that still lies ahead
Michael Saunders , Citigroup
Negative equity : Your stories
More than 23,200 people who took out 100 % mortgages in the year to 31 March could face negative equity , according to figures obtained by the BBC .
Falling house prices mean the amount borrowed could be greater than the value of their properties .
The data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders comes as figures show the housing market is slowing down further .
Separate housing figures suggest the number of transactions per estate agent has hit a 30 - year low .
These figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( Rics ) come as banks are imposing stricter requirements on borrowers , in the wake of the credit crisis .
However , the 23,200 people who 've taken out these 100 % mortgages represent only around 2.5 % of the total mortgages given out in that period , and a much smaller percentage of the overall number of mortgages in the UK .
Turned away
If a house loses its value it is not necessarily a problem unless the owner has to move , or can not afford to pay the mortgage .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In a rising market banks are prepared to lend 100 % mortgages as there is little risk of them not getting their money back .
But as prices have been falling , the risks have increased and lenders are turning borrowers away if they do n't have a deposit .
There is a warning that the situation may deteriorate further .
" House prices are down 6 % in just the last five months , and the worst of the credit crisis - all that still lies ahead , " said Michael Saunders , head economist at Citigroup .
He had predicted that house prices would fall by 15 % in 2008 and 2009 but now he says that drop could be even greater .
Record low
The Rics survey showed that very few homeowners were moving house , with only 17.4 transactions per estate agent made in the three months to the end of May .
This was the lowest figure since Rics started collecting the data in 1978 .
But , for the first time in 10 months , there was a decrease in the proportion of surveyors reporting house price falls .
Some 92.9 % more surveyors said house prices had fallen during May , compared with those who thought they had risen .
This showed a slight fall from the record 94.7 % more who reported falls in April .
But Jeremy Leaf , of Rics , said that the slowing pace of decline could point to better news for homeowners .
" Maybe we are reaching the bottom of the market , " he said .
Government survey
There was further cheer for homeowners with the publication of a house prices survey by the Department of Communities and Local Government ( DCLG ) which is based on sale completions , unlike other surveys .
The current issue affecting the market is fundamentally about the supply of credit
DCLG spokesman
That showed that UK house prices rose by 0.7 % in April compared with March , although annual house price growth was down from 5.2 % to 4.9 % over the same period .
The survey showed that UK house prices fell by 1 % in the three months to April .
The average cost of a home in England in April was £ 226,194 , in Wales it was £ 164,994 , in Scotland £ 165,546 , and in Northern Ireland £ 224,664 .
A DCLG spokesman said it was important to remember that UK house prices were 44 % higher than five years ago .
" The current issue affecting the market is fundamentally about the supply of credit - a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment , " he said .
The cost of borrowing is continuing to rise .
Bank of England figures show that the average interest rate for a two - year fixed - rate mortgage , with a 25 % deposit , was up to 6.27 % at the end of May - the highest level since September 2000 .
The DCLG spokesman added : " The long - term demand for housing remains high and the fundamentals of the economy are sound with low unemployment and historically low interest rates . "

IT IS , quite simply , the European Union 's greatest achievement .
The offer of EU membership to its neighbours in the east and south has proved a masterly way of stabilising troubled countries and inducing them to make democratic and liberal reforms .
The contrast with the United States , which despite spending billions of dollars has failed to find an equivalent policy for the countries of the Caribbean rim , is striking .
Enlargement is , however , unpopular in many older EU members .
It is accused by some of making the club unwieldy .
Others blame it for an unwelcome inflow of cheap labour and an outflow of jobs .
Still others complain that too many countries have been let in before they were ready .
Indeed , the recent wave of EU enlargement has precious few defenders in western Europe .
Even fewer stand up for the principle of letting in anyone else :
France is poised to confirm that any big country 's membership must be put to a national referendum .
Yet scare stories about enlargement have led to false alarms .
Several studies confirm that the club functions as well with 25 ( now 27 ) members as it did with 15 .
Cheap labour helps hosts as well as new members .
Fears of job losses and rising competition have more to do with China than eastern Europe .
The economies of several old EU members , notably Germany and Austria , have gained massively from enlargement — making their hostility especially perverse .
As our special report this week argues , far from joining too soon , most of eastern Europe arrived in the nick of time .
This is not to say that enlargement has been trouble - free .
Some countries may have come in unprepared , notably Bulgaria and Romania .
The EU mistakenly guaranteed these two , plus Cyprus , a membership date in advance , instantly losing leverage for more reforms ( or , in Cyprus 's case , for a deal with the north of the island ) .
The eurocrats have learnt that , once a country is in , they have less influence on it .
But less is not none .
Bulgaria and Romania now face sanctions for failing to fight hard enough against corruption and organised crime .
Catching a Ukrainian wave
In any case , teething troubles with a few new members should not become an excuse for slamming the door on others .
It is right for the EU to be tough in negotiating entry terms , as it is being with Croatia and Turkey , the two countries now engaged in membership talks , even if that causes delay .
But to suggest that these places , or others such as the western Balkan countries , should be kept out indefinitely , regardless of their progress with reform , risks provoking instability or even downright hostility from places smack on the EU 's borders .
In reality , the case for eventual EU membership of the western Balkan countries is widely understood .
Turkey is more controversial , as a big and mainly Muslim country — but it is sui generis .
In many ways the bigger test of the EU 's commitment to enlargement lies to its east , in countries like Moldova and , above all , Ukraine .
Ukraine matters : it is the largest European country after Russia , with around 46 m people , a lot of fertile farmland and significant industrial capacity , including in large aircraft and steelmaking .
The recent story of Ukraine seems , at first blush , depressing .
The country 's political leaders have been squabbling among themselves almost since the heady “ orange revolution ” in the Kiev snow during the winter of 2004 - 05 ( see article ) .
Inflation is worryingly high and corruption is rife .
Yet some encouragement can be found behind the headlines .
The country 's political chaos and its vigorous media are testimony to a healthy democratic debate .
Although Ukraine has no oil or gas , its economy has been growing strongly .
It has just joined the World Trade Organisation , ahead of Russia .
Nobody could pretend that Ukraine is ready for membership of the EU .
That could take a decade or more .
But it would be wrong permanently to bar it as a candidate .
It is as much a part of Europe as Bulgaria , and arguably more so than Turkey .
Although many Ukrainians have doubts about joining NATO , almost all — even in the Russian - speaking east of the country — want to get into the EU .
If Ukraine were kept out , it could easily fall back under the sway of a newly resurgent Russia ; and the knock - on effects for other vulnerable places , such as Georgia and Moldova , could be serious .
If , on the contrary , it were welcomed as a candidate , that would hugely encourage liberals who hope to bring proper democracy to Russia as well .
It is high time that western Europe 's political leaders began explaining to their voters just why both past and future enlargement of the EU is so much in their own interests .
For all of Microsoft 's denial , the Xbox 360 Blu-ray console rumors just will not die .
In fact , they are getting more and more specific .
The Chinese language Economic Daily News is reporting that Pegatron , an OEM subsidiary of ASUS , has won the order from Microsoft to assemble the Xbox 360 with Blu-ray Disc ROM drive -- shipments are expected to being in Q3 of this year .
Now come on Microsoft , just come clean on the matter , we wo n't tell anyone .
Less than six months from the November election , Sen. John McCain is tied with Sen.
Hillary Clinton among rural voters in battleground states while the Arizona Republican holds a nine point lead over Sen. Barack Obama .
McCain leads Obama 50 percent to 41 percent among rural voters polled in 13 states that are expected to be closely contested in November .
McCain and Clinton are tied , each with 46 percent of the vote .
Only four percent of the people polled said they were undecided .
Full poll results can be found here .
The poll was conducted in mid-May by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for the Center for Rural Strategies , the Kentucky nonprofit organization that publishes The Daily Yonder .
The poll interviewed 682 likely voters in 13 states ( Colorado , Florida , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , Missouri , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Mexico , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Wisconsin ) .
The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.75 percent .
Rural voters see stark differences between McCain and Obama on the issues of the economy and “ values . ”
More than half of rural voters ( 54 percent ) agree that McCain “ does not seem to understand my economic problems . ”
A nearly equal percentage of rural voters ( 52 percent ) agreed that Obama “ does not share my values . ”
The outcome of the election may depend on which of these issues will have become more important to voters by November , according to Republican Bill Greener and Democrat Anna Greenberg , who conducted the poll .
The findings of this poll are strikingly similar to the results of a poll taken four years ago .
In June of 2004 , President George W. Bush led Sen. John Kerry 51 percent to 42 percent — the same nine point gap that now separates McCain and Obama .
Bush went on to win rural voters by 19 percentage points , a margin he needed from rural America to insure his re-election .
( See also Karen Crummy ’s story on the rural poll in the Denver Post , and Howard Berkes ’ story on National Public Radio . )
The election in November is likely to be determined by whether McCain can raise his level of support in rural areas to Bush ’s margins , according to the two consultants who devised the poll .
A sign that greeted Sen .
John McCain when he visited a sporting goods store this week in St. Albans , West Virginia .
Republican strategist Bill Greener and Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said this poll showed that “ rural America will be competitive in the 2008 presidential election … .
This competitiveness reflects the on - going problems facing the Republican brand , as well as the deep economic anxiety large numbers of rural voters feel .
Concerns about the cost of living are intense , particularly gas prices in a part of the country where many must drive long distances to work . ”
The poll reveals that none of the three candidates finds particular favor among rural voters .
In 2004 , 35 percent of rural voters in swing states felt “ cool ” toward President Bush and 43 percent felt “ cool ” toward Sen.
Kerry .
Today , 59 percent of voters feel “ cool ” towards the President .
Reporting their feelings about the 2008 candidates , 47 percent of those polled felt “ cool ” toward Sen.
Clinton , toward Sen. Obama — 42 percent , toward Sen. McCain — 40 percent .
“ ( W ) e see real ambivalence about all of three presidential choices — each candidate has a real opportunity to define the race on his or her terms , ” write Greenberg and Greener .
Greener and Greenberg say rural voters “ express doubts about both McCain and Obama . ”
For instance , 60 percent of women without a college education believe McCain does not understand their economic problems .
Meanwhile , 48 percent of white Democrats agree that Obama does not share their values .
Nearly a fifth of those in the polls ( 18 percent ) do not know which candidate would do a better job of solving rural America ’s problems .
Obama appears to face a particularly hard time hanging on to rural Democratic voters .
Of rural voters who identified themselves as Democrats , 90 percent said they would vote for Senator Clinton ; only 70 percent said they would vote for Obama .
McCain wins only 7 percent of the Democratic rural vote in a hypothetical race against Clinton .
When the Arizona Republican is matched against Obama , however , McCain is supported by 20 percent of those who call themselves Democrats .
Nine out of ten Republicans support McCain when he ’s matched against either Obama or Clinton .
In the 12 contested states polled , there are large regional differences in rural support for the candidates .
Obama loses to Clinton by 24 points in the rural South ; by 16 points in the eastern Midwest and by about five points in the Northeast and western Midwest .
Obama loses all these regions to McCain , too , and by similar margins .
Obama is particularly weak in the eastern Midwest , a region that includes the swing states of Wisconsin and Ohio .
Obama is down by 15 points to McCain in this part of the country , a deficit nearly as large as the 17 - point margin enjoyed by McCain in the South .
Sen .
Obama ’s strongest support is centered in the western states , Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada .
There , Obama runs ahead of Clinton by 16 points among rural voters , and he is beating McCain by 13 points in these western swing states .
Nationally , when asked who would do a better job on the economy , Obama runs 8 points ahead of McCain .
On the same question in the West , Obama is ahead of McCain by 36 points .
Among the subset of rural residents who derive all of their income from agriculture , McCain trounces both Clinton ( by 24 points ) and Obama ( by 28 points ) .
Rural residents by far believe the most pressing problem in the economy is high energy costs — the primary factor , they say , in the rising cost of food .
The Global Seed Vault opened in 2008 on Svalbard , Norway , above the Arctic Circle .
It 's been years in the making .
Finally , humanity 's biological plan B , the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , is open in the Arctic Circle .
Buried deep in a frozen mountain on Norway 's Svalbard island , the vault houses the world 's most comprehensive and diverse collection of food crop seeds .
Should disaster befall us , humanity can rely on the vault to provide a spare copy of the genes of our most important agriculture .
The vault opened today to receive shipments from more than 100 countries of 100 million seeds , ranging from varieties of maize , rice and wheat to lettuce , barley and potato .
“ With climate change and other forces threatening the diversity of life that sustains our planet , Norway is proud to be playing a central role in creating a facility capable of protecting what are not just seeds , but the fundamental building blocks of human civilization , ” said Norway ’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg .
The vault was established by Norway as a service to the world .
Michelle Obama ’s eyes flicker tentatively even as she offers a trained smile .
As her campaign plane arcs over the Flathead Range in Montana , she is asked to consider her complicated public image .
Conservative columnists accuse her of being unpatriotic and say she simmers with undigested racial anger .
A blogger who supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton circulates unfounded claims that Mrs. Obama gave an accusatory speech in her church about the sins of “ whitey . ”
Mrs. Obama shakes her head .
“ You are amazed sometimes at how deep the lies can be , ” she says in an interview .
Referring to a character in a 1970s sitcom , she adds : “ I mean , ‘ whitey ’ ?
That ’s something that George Jefferson would say .
Anyone who says that does n’t know me .
They do n’t know the life I ’ve lived .
They do n’t know anything about me . ”
Now her husband ’s presidential campaign is giving her image a subtle makeover , with a new speech in the works to emphasize her humble roots and a tough new chief of staff .
On Wednesday , Mrs. Obama will do a guest turn on “ The View , ” the daytime talk show on ABC , with an eye toward softening her reputation .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday July 1 2008 .
The article below was wrong to say that a household survey by the World Health Organisation and the Iraqi health ministry found that the rate of violent deaths had doubled in Iraq after the invasion .
The survey did not make this finding .
Figures that were unadjusted for under - reporting showed a doubling of the rate of all deaths and a violence - related death rate about 11 times higher .
The article said the survey estimated that 151,000 civilians had been killed since the invasion .
That figure included combatants .
An estimated 151,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in the violence that has engulfed the country from the time of the US - led invasion until June 2006 , according to the latest and largest study of deaths officially accepted by the Iraqi government .
The figures come from a household survey carried out by the World Health Organisation and the Iraqi health ministry .
They are substantially lower than the 601,027 death toll reported by US researchers in 2006 in the Lancet using similar study methods , but higher than the Iraq Body Count 's ( IBC ) register - based on press reports - of 47,668 .
The authors of the WHO / Iraqi study , published last night in the New England Journal of Medicine , say that the new number , which could be anywhere between 104,000 and 223,000 allowing for misreporting , " points to a massive death toll in the wake of the 2003 invasion and represents only one of the many health and human consequences of an ongoing humanitarian crisis " .
The Iraqi health minister , Dr Salih Mahdi Motlab Al - Hasanawi , said it was very important for the government to have reliable data on violent deaths .
" There is controversy about reports from the media , " he said .
Some of the information that has been published " may be used or misused for political reasons and so on " .
The survey also collected data on the health of the population and availability of healthcare needed by the government .
The survey from the Iraqi Family Health Survey Group was carried out by trained employees of the health ministry who visited 10,860 households - 10 from each of more than 1,000 clusters across the 18 provinces of Iraq .
Because of the insecurity , 115 ( 11 % ) of the clusters could not be visited - mostly in Anbar and Baghdad - so calculations were made to account for the probable number of deaths in those places .
Researchers asked heads of households if there had been any deaths in the two years before or three years after the invasion in 2003 .
Account was taken of under - reporting of deaths , which is usual in household surveys , not least because families often move when somebody dies .
The survey also allowed for the out - migration of up to 2 million people between March 2003 and June 2006 .
It found that 151,000 civilians died due to the conflict , which does not include accidents , suicides or deaths from disease .
Unlike the Lancet study , it found no big increase in mortality across the three years .
In 2003 - 4 , 128 people died every day , in 2004 - 5 it dropped to 115 and in 2005 - 6 it rose again to 126 .
The daily death rates , according to the Lancet study , rose from 231 to 491 to 925 .
Although the new figure is four times lower than the Lancet study , its authors , Gilbert Burnham and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University , believe their count of more than 600,000 is correct .
Les Roberts , one of the US authors who is now a professor in forced migration and health at Columbia University , said he was delighted to see the Iraqi government had accepted higher mortality figures .
In June 2006 the government was relying on the IBC figure , which was 41,000 .
" For this to be coming from the Iraqi government is really healthy , " he said .
It was also good for science that new studies were being carried out .
" But I think there is overwhelming evidence that their estimate is too low . "
The WHO / Iraqi study showed a doubling of the rate of violent deaths while the Lancet study showed a trebling .
" Fundamentally , these studies are less different than people are thinking . "
But the US team 's data was more accurate because all deaths were validated with death certificates .
The health ministry admitted in the new paper that its figures before the invasion were too low , he said , which had also led to insufficient adjustment .

Scientists at IBM , Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , have taken another major step towards sending information inside a computer chip by using light pulses .
Rather than using conventional electrons , the team has built the world ’s tiniest nanophotonic switch .
Its ’ footprint is approximately 100 times smaller than the cross section of a human hair .
The switch is an important building block that can direct the flow of information inside future chips and is capable of considerably accelerating the chip ’s performance while using much less energy .

integrated photonic and electronic circuits

routing of mutliple N optical channels

The switching device enables pulses to be directed within a network and thus efficiently transverse between different processor cores on the chip .
“ This new development is a critical addition in the quest to build an on -chip optical network , ” says Yurii Vlasov , Manager of Silicon Nanophotonics at IBM ’s TJ Watson Research Center .
“ In view of all the progress that this field has seen for the last few years , it looks that our vision for on - chip optical networks is becoming more and more realistic ” .
IBM ’s silicon broadband optical switch is an integral component in enabling on - chip optical interconnections .
Drawing on the existing electrical signals available in the chip , the switching device performs the key role of “ directing traffic ” within the network by converting these electrical signals to light pulses .
Subsequently , the switch devices are set into the necessary positions , and the optical messages are routed from the transmitting core to the receiving core .
The IBM team was able to show that the switch has advantages for on - chip applications .
Firstly , the switch is incredibly compact .
This complies with integration requirements for future multi-core processors .
As many as 2,000 switches are able to be mounted densely in an area of one square millimeter .

represented by the black boxes
in the figure , performs the key role of
“ directing traffic ” within the on-chip
optical network ( Credit : IBM )
To add to this incredible space saving characteristic , the device is capable of transmitting data of high bandwidths .
A bandwidth of light holds a multitude of different colors , which are scientifically distinctive wavelengths .
Data can then be transmitted through every individual light wavelength .
Seeing as one wavelength is able to carry data at up to 40 Gb/s , the switch can supply a bandwidth exceeding 1 Tb/s .
To fully exploit this fantastic attribute , the switching device should be utilized in methods for routing large messages between distant cores .
The most novel aspect of the finding is that the IBM team has demonstrated for the first time that their device functions within a realistic on - chip environment .
Depending on the manner in which the processors function , temperature “ hot - spots ” may invariantly cause the temperature of the chip to alter dramatically in different areas .
The results show that the switching device is able to tolerate these temperature - drifts .
This represents a most critical requirement for on - chip optical networks .
As the users ’ demand continues to grow , chip manufacturers race towards increasing parallelism in computation by multi-threading .
This increases the number of cores on a single chip by building large scale multi-chip systems .
Currently , the IBM Cell Processor , which powers Sony ’s PlayStation 3 gaming console , consists of nine “ brains , ” or cores ( capable of a combined theoretical bandwidth of just over 200 GB/s ) , on a single chip .
The optical switching device is expected to revolutionize the speed of the next generation of processors .
Today , the individual cores located on multi-core microprocessors communicate with one another over millions of tiny copper wires .
At the estimated performance level of the optical switching device , the copper wiring would simply use up too much power and would be incapable of transmitting the enormous amount of information required in multi-core processors .
IBM researches are exploring an alternative solution to the problem associated with copper wires by connecting cores using pulses of light in an on -chip optical network based on silicon nanophotonic integrated circuits .
Like a long - haul fiber - optic network , this miniature on - chip network will transmit , receive , and route messages encoded in light pulses , between individual cores .
It is estimated that using light instead of wires will enable transmitting 100 times more information between cores , while using 10 times less power , and consequently , generating less heat .
The idea is that each core will receive and transmit large amounts of data between the other processor cores on the chip simultaneously .
Like all products on the market , IBM is expected to have stiff competition from other large scale chip manufacturers such as Intel , who in March 2008 , discussed cutting edge microprocessors and technologies including the next generation “ Tukwila ” .
Intel ’s Tukwila chip ( Credit : Intel )
Tukwila is Intel ’s next - generation Itanium processor with four cores , a 30 MB total cache , QuickPath Interconnect , dual Integrated Memory Controller , and mainframe - class RAS features .
It is the world ’s first 2 billion transistor microprocessor and is projected to deliver more than double the performance of the current generation Itanium processors .
Tukwila is targeted for production towards the end of 2008 .
With Tukwila looming on the horizon , IBM needs to develop their silicon broadband optical switch to a commercial level , if they want to keep up with their competitors .
TFOT has also covered other ‘ nano ’ related topics , such as the use of nano - diamonds in quantum computing by scientists at the University of Melbourne , who used the diamonds ’ properties in an attempt to create quantum computers capable of performing parallel computing tasks .
TFOT also reported on a new nanoscale technology for memory storage developed by researchers at Arizona State University ( ASU ) .
The researchers used a new type of computer memory called ‘ programmable metallization cell ’ ( PMC ) , which is low - cost and more power - efficient than conventional memory storage systems .
Additional information on this development and on the IBM ’s nanophotonics project can be found on IBM ’s website ( and more here ) .

California 's blueprint for slashing greenhouse - gas emissions could transform the world 's seventh - largest economy – and be a model for a nationwide plan in 2009 .
The state presented its plan Thursday morning to cut greenhouse - gas emissions by about 30 percent by 2020 .
Based on legislation passed in 2006 , the state is proposing a slate of changes including a cap - and - trade system for greenhouse gases , a requirement that renewable sources power one - third of the state 's grid , and taxes on gas - guzzling cars .
The state 's approach could become a model for the nation , if climate - change legislation of some sort gets passed by Congress and is signed by the next president in 2009 – as is widely expected .
The state anticipates that implementing the plan will not only attack climate change , but also provide a net benefit to the California economy .
" Setting California ahead of the curve on global warming will give our state a competitive advantage , " said Mary Nichols , chair of the Air Resources Board .
That conclusion flies in the face of conventional wisdom that the costs of combating climate change will be high , perhaps several percent of a country 's total economic output .
That said , most of the debate over the costs of climate change and mitigation has been until now slightly more sophisticated than back - of - the - napkin calculations .
California 's Air Resources Board , on the other hand , undertook a detailed , near - term look at the state 's infrastructure to decide exactly how to get emissions cuts without economic pain .
It was required to do so by the groundbreaking AB32 , the " Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 , " signed into law in September of that year .
If California 's numbers hold up to scrutiny , it could be a major boost for the proponents of fighting climate change .
" The key thing with the AB32 scoping plan is that it really helps California create green jobs , green dollars and a clean environment , " said Spencer Quong , a Union of Concerned Scientists analyst .
Quong also noted that consumers stand to economically benefit .
The state estimates that car owners will save about $ 30 per month if all the plan 's car regulations are deemed legal .
One intriguing way that California made the numbers look prettier was to include the health benefits of reducing greenhouse - gas emissions .
Cutting down emissions could save over 300 lives and up to $ 2.4 billion dollars , ARB staffer Edie Chang said .
The savings would come mostly from decreasing asthma and lost - work days .
Despite the overall triumphant tone that colored the unveiling of the long - awaited plan , there are some areas where environmentalists , green - tech types and old - line industries continue to disagree .
As with national legislation battles , the issue of emission permits is looming large .
In a cap - and - trade system , the government sells or gives away permits to discharge a certain amount of CO2 into the air .
As you might expect , utilities and industry want to get these permits for free , while most public advocates and environmentalists want the state to sell the permits , then use the proceeds for green - tech investment or taxpayer refund .
" We think that auctioning is a key element of a plan " that maximizes the public interest , said Chris Busch , another Union of Concerned Scientists analyst .
Meanwhile the industry countered that they would need the permits given to them so that they could make the necessary changes to their businesses to keep costs for consumers low .
" Auction revenues , which are a very scary thing for us ... should be left 100 percent in the hands of those utilities , " Bruce McLaughlin , representing the California Municipal Utility Association , told the board .
The issue is unlikely to go away , but most seem to expect somewhere between 25 and 75 percent of the permits to eventually be auctioned .
That number could be the standard that John McCain or Barack Obama looks to when he signs a bill that puts a price on carbon , as either is expected to do if elected .
In that way , the nitty - gritty details of a board meeting in Sacramento could end up having a major impact on the entire globe .
" We believe that this scoping plan is going to be an important milestone , an important framework for other states , " said Nichols , the board chair .

Okay , so estimates of Senator Barack Obama ‘s current pledged delegate lead seem to be around 125 delegates .
There are 12 contests remaining with a total of 611 pledged delegates up for grabs .
I posted previously about the Obama campaign ’s accurate estimates of the March 4th results .
I think it ’s time to take a look at what they believe will happen next .
Vote % Pledged Delegates State Date Delegates Obama Clinton Obama Clinton Wyoming 3/8 12 60 % 40 % 7 5 Mississippi 3/11 33 62 % 38 % 20 13 Penn . 4/22 158 47 % 52 % 75 83 Guam 5/4 4 55 % 44 % 2 2 Indiana 5/6 72 53 % 46 % 39 33 N. Carolina 5/6 115 53 % 45 % 61 54 W. Virginia 5/13 28 43 % 55 % 13 15 Kentucky 5/20 51 42 % 56 % 23 28 Oregon 5/20 52 52 % 47 % 28 24 Montana 6/3 16 55 % 44 % 9 7 S. Dakota 6/3 15 57 % 42 % 8 7 Puerto Rico 6/7 55 45 % 54 % 25 30 Totals 310 301
The Obama campaign thinks they ’ll be beaten in Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Kentucky and Puerto Rico .
The two largest remaining states , in terms of delegates available , are Pennsylvania ( 158 ) and North Carolina ( 115 ) .
Obama ’s team believes they ’ll split those two with an 8 delegate win to Clinton in Pennsylvania and a 7 delegate win to Obama in North Carolina .
Pollster.com ‘s most recent Pennsylvania polling data seems to indicate that a 5 point Clinton win looks about right for Pennsylvania .
Likewise the numbers for North Carolina show Obama ahead by roughly the numbers listed above .
Adding Indiana into that mix with 72 delegates available means that those three states alone have well over half the remaining delegates .
The predictions above show that there will be almost no change in the relative delegate differences .
So basically , as far as I can see , unless something monumental happens , there ’s very little chance of Obama losing the pledged delegate race .
The pledged delegate race will , in turn ( and in this case almost necessarily ) drive the superdelegate numbers .
I ’m still waiting to read more about the noise I expect Senator Clinton ’s posse to start making about the delegates from Florida and Michigan .
I would be a lot of money that it ’s a play she ’s going to make .
Assuming that Howard Dean and the DNC stand tall and stick to their rules , it would appear that Senator Barack Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee for President of these United States .

Google Versus Rails
Economics of Scale
Does Twisted Scale ?
No .
Yes .
Maybe .
What about Divmod ?
Does Mantissa scale ?
Almost ...
... but not quite .
Why Now ?
More Later ...
It seems that everyone on the blogosphere , including Divmod , is talking about " scaling " these days .
I 'd like to talk a bit about what we mean ­— and by " we " I mean both the Twisted community and Divmod , Inc. , — when we talk about " scaling " .
First , some background .
Everyone knows that Scaling is a Good Thing .
It 's bad that Rails " does n't scale " — see Twitter .
It 's good that the Google App Engine scales — see ... well , Google .
These facts are practically received wisdom in the recent web 2.0 interblag .
The common definition of " scaling " which applies to these systems is the " ability to handle growing amounts of work in a graceful manner " .
And yet ( for all that I 'd like to rag on Twitter ) , Twitter serves hojillions of users umptillions of bytes every month , and ( despite significant growing pains ) continues to grow .
So in what sense does it " not scale " ?
While that 's going on , Google App Engine has some pretty draconian restrictions on how much an application can actually do .
So it remains to be seen whether GAE will actually scale , and right now you 're not evento scale it .
Why , exactly , do we say that one system " scales " and the other does n't , when the actual data available now says pretty much the opposite ?
A GAE application may not scale today , but when Our Benefactors over at the big " G " see fit to turn on the juice , you wo n't have to re-write a single line of your code .
It will all magically scale out to their demonstrably amazing pile of computers — assuming you have n't done anything particularly dumb in your own code .
All you have to do is throw money at the problem .
Well , actually , you throw the money at Google and they will take the problem away for you , and you will never see it again .
It accomplishes this by providing you with an API for accessing your data , and forbidding most things that would cause your application to start depending on local state .
These restrictions are surprisingly strict if you are trying to write an application that does things other than display web pages and store data , but that functionality does cover a huge number of applications .
Rails , on the other hand , does not provide facilities for scaling .
For one thing , it does n't provide you with a concurrency model .
Rails itself is not thread safe , nor does it allow any multiplexing of input and ouptut , so you can't share state between multiple HTTP connections .
Yet , Rails encourages you to use " normal " ruby data structures , not inter- process - communication - friendly data structures , to enforce model constraints and do other interesting things .
It 's easily to add logic to your rails application which is not amenable to splitting over multiple processes , and it's hard to make sure you have n't accidentally done so .
When you use the only concurrency model it really supports , i.e. locking and using transactions via the database , Rails strongly encourages you to consider your database connection global , so " sharding " your database requires significant reconsiderations of your application logic .
These technical details are interesting , but they all point to the same thing .
The key difference between Rails and GAE is the small matter of .
If you write an application with Rails , you probably have to write a whole bunch of new code , or at least change around all of your old code , in order to get it to run on multiple computers .
With GAE , the code you start with is the code you scale with .
The key feature of " scalability " that most people care about is actually the ability of a system to efficiently convert money to increased capacity .
Nobody expects you to be able to run a networked system for a hundred million users on a desktop PC .
However , a lot of business people — especially investors — expect you to be able to run a system for a hundred million users on a data - center with ten million cores in it .
Especially if they 've just bought one for you .
Coding is an activity that is notoriously inefficient at converting money into other things .
It 's difficult to predict .
It 's slow .
But most unnervingly to people with money to invest , pouring money on a problematic software project is like pouring water on an oil fire : adding more manpower to a late software project makes it later .
If you have a hard software problem , you want to identify it early and add the manpower as soon as possible , because you wo n't be able to speed things along later if you start running into trouble .
So , the thing that pundits and entrepreneurs alike are thinking about when they start talking about " scalability " is eliminating thisrisky phase of programming .
Investors ( and entrepreneurs ) do n't mind investing some money in a " scaling solution " , but they do n't want to do it when they are in the hockey - stick part of the growth curve , making first impressions with their largest number of customers , and having system failures .
So we 're all talking about what hot new piece of technology will solve this problem .
At a coarse granularity , this is a useful framing of the issue .
Technology investment and third - party tools really can help with scaling .
Google and Amazon obviously know what they 're doing when it comes to world - spanning scale , and if they 're building tools for developers , those tools are going to help .
As you start breaking it down into details , though , problems emerge .
Front and center is the problem that scalability is actually a property of a , not an individual layer of that system , infrastructure or no .
Even with the best , sexiest , most automatic scaling layer , you can easily write code that just does n't scale .
As a soon - to - be purveyor of " scalability solutions " myself , this is a scary thought : it 's easy to imagine a horror story where a tiny , but hard to discover error in code written on top of our infrastructure makes it difficult to scale up .
That error need not be in the application code .
The scaling infrastructure itself could have some small issue which causes problems at higher scales .
After all , you can do extensive testing , code review , profiling and load analysis and still miss something that comes up only under extremely high load .
Just about any answer to this question that you can imagine is valid , so I 'll go through them all and explain what they might mean .
Applications written using Twisted can very easily share lots of state , require local configuration , and do all kinds of things which make them unfriendly to distribution over multiple nodes .
Since there is no ' canonical '
Twisted application ( in fact , you might say that the usual Twisted application is simply an applicationenough to be unsuited to a more traditional LAMP - type infrastructure ) , there 's no particular documented model for writing a Twisted application that scales up smoothly .
None of the included services do anything special to provide automatic scaling .
There are no state - management abstractions inside Twisted .
If you talk to a database in a Twisted application , the normal way to do it is to use a normal DB - API connection .
When I discussed Rails above , I said that the reason it does n't scale is that it 's too easy , by default , to write applications that do n't scale .
Therefore we must conclude that Twisted does n't scale .
Twisted is mainly an I/O library , and it uses abstract interfaces to define application code 's interface with sockets and timers .
Twisted itself includes several different implementations of different strategies for multiplexing between these timers , including several which are platform - specific ( kqueue , iocp ) , squeezing the maximum scale out of your deployment platform , even if it changes .
I said above that infrastructure is scalable if it lets you increase your scale without changing your code .
It would make sense to say that Twisted scales because it allows you to increase the number of connections that you 're handling by changing your reactor without changing your code .
You could also say that Twisted is scalableit is an I/O library , and communication between different nodes is almost the definition of scale these days .
Not only can you write scalable systems easily using Twisted 's facilities , you can use Twisted as a tool to makesystems scale , as part of a bespoke caching daemon or database proxy .
Several Twisted users use it this way .
Being mostly an I/O library , Twisted itself is rarely the component most in need of optimization .
Being mostly an implementation of mechanisms rather than policies , Twisted gives you what you need to achieve scale but does n't force , or even encourage you , to use it that way .
For the most part , it 's not really interesting to talk about whether Twisted scales or not .
The field of possibilities of what you can do with Twisted is too wide open to allow that sort of classification .
Mantissa , lest you have not heard of it already , is the application server that we are developing at Divmod .
Mantissa is based on Twisted , among other components .
However , there 's a big difference in what the answer to the " scaling " question means than it means to Twisted .
Twisted is very general and can be used in almost any type of application , from embedded devices to web services to thick clients to system management consoles .
It 's almost as general as Python itself — with the notable exception that you can't use Twisted on Google App Engine because they do n't allow sockets .
As part of being general , Twisted does n't dictate much about the structure of your application , except that it use an event loop .
You can manage persistent state however you want , deal with configuration however you want .
Mantissa , on the other hand , is only for one type of application : multi-user , server - side applications , with web interfaces .
You might be able to apply it to something else but you would be fighting it every step of the way .
( Although if you wanted to use Mantissa 's components for other types of applications , the more general parts decompose neatly into Nevow and Axiom .)
So the question of " does it scale " is a bit more interesting , since we can talk about a specific type of application rather than a near - infinite expanse of possibilities .
Does Mantissa scale to large numbers of users for these types of " web 2.0 " applications ?
Unfortunately , the fact that the question is simpler does n't make the answer that much simpler , so here it is : Mantissa has a few key ingredients that you need to build a system that scales out .
The biggest one is a partitioned data - model .
Each user has their own database , where their data is stored .
A very common " web 2.0 " scaling plan — perhaps the most common — is to have an increasing number of web servers , all pointed at a single giant database with an increasingly ridiculous configuration — gigabytes of RAM , terabytes of disk , fronted by a bank of caching servers .
This works for a while .
For many sites , it 's actually sufficient .
But it has a few problems .
For one thing , it has a single point of failure .
If your database server goes down , your service goes down .
Your database server is n't a lightweight " glue " component , either , so it 's not a single point of failure you can quickly recover if it goes down .
Even worse , it means that even in the good scenario , where you can scale to capacity , your downtime is increased .
Each time you upgrade the database , the whole site goes down .
This problem gets compounded because a lot of sites are append - only databases with increasingly large volumes of data to migrate for each upgrade .
Another issue is that it increases load on your administrators , because they are responsible for an increasingly finicky and stressed database server .
This may actually be a good thing — administrators are not programmers , after all , and are therefore a more reliable and easier resource to throw money at .
Unfortunately there are ( almost by definition ) fewer things that admins can do to improve the system .
Because the admins can't actually solve the root problems that make their lives difficult , it 's easier for them to get frustrated and leave for an environment where they wo n't be so stressed .
The reason websites choose this scaling model is that popular frameworks , or even non-frameworks like " let 's just do it in PHP " , make it easy to just use a single database , and to write all the application logic to depend on that single database as the point of communication between system components .
So the scaling plan is just working with the code that was written before anybody thought about scaling .
If you write an application with Mantissa today , it 's easiest to toss the data into different databases depending on who it is for , so when you get to dealing with the " scaling " part of the problem , you can put those databases onto different computers , and avoid the single point of failure .
Moreover , when you write an application with Mantissa , you get " global " services like signup and login as part of the application server , so your application code can avoid the usual schema pitfalls ( the " users " table , for example ) which require a site to have a single large database .
There 's only one problem with that plan .
In my humble opinion , Mantissa offers some interesting ideas , but there are a few reasons you wo n't get scaling " for free " with Mantissa if you use it right now , today .
You may be noticing about now that I did n't mention any way to communicatethose partitioned chunks of data .
This is what I 've been spending most of my last few weeks on .
I have been working on an implementation of an " eventually consistent " message - passing API for transferring messages between user databases in a Mantissa server .
You can see the progress of this work on the Divmod tracker , where the ticket is nearing the end of its year - long journey , and already in its ( hopefully ) final review .
I 'm particularly excited about this feature , because it completes the Mantissa programming model to the point where you can really use it .
It 's the part of the system that most directly impacts your own code , and thereby allows you to more completely dodge the bullet of modifying a bunch of your application 's logic when you want to scale .
There might be some dark corners — for example , a scalable API for interacting with the authentication system — but those should only affect a small portion of a small number of applications .
Unfortunately communication between databases is not the only issue we have remaining .
There 's more to the scaling problem than getting the application code to be the right shape .
The infrastructure itself needs to present a container that does the heavy lifting of scalability for the code that it contains .
For example , Mantissa needs a name server and a load balancer that will direct requests to the appropriate server for the given chunk of data .
It also needs a sign - up and account management interface that will make an informed decision about where to locate a new user 's data , and be able to transparently migrate users between servers if load patterns change .
Finally there are enhanced features , like replicating read - only data to multiple hosts , for applications ( for example , a blogging system ) which have heavy concentrations of readers on small portions of data .
Finally there are problems of optimization .
We have n't had much time to optimize Mantissa or Athena , and already on small - scale systems we have seen performance issues , especially given the large number of requests that an Athena page can generate .
We need to make some time to implement the optimizations we know we need , and when we start scaling up our first really big system , I 'm sure that we 'll discover other areas that need tweaking .
I'm fond of saying that programming is like frisbee , and predictions more specific than " hey , watch this ! " are dangerous .
So you might wonder why I 'm talking about such a long - running future plan in such detail .
You might be wondering why I would think that you'd be interested in something that is n't finished yet .
Perhaps you think it 's odd that I 've described the challenges in such detail rather than being more positive about how awesome it is .
While I certainly do n't want to publicly commit to a time - frame for any of this work to be finished , I do feel pretty comfortable saying that it 's going to happen .
The design for scalability I 've discussed here has been a core driving concern for Mantissa since its beginning , and it 's something that 's increasingly important to our business and our applications .
I 'm being especially detailed about Mantissa 's incompleteness because I want to make sure that potential users ' expectations are set appropriately .
I do n't want anyone coming to the Divmod stack after having heard me say vague things about " scalability " , believing that they 'll get an application that scales to the moon .
I do think that this is an exciting time for other developers to get involved though .
Mantissa is at a point where there are lots of bits of polish that need to be added to make it truly useful .
Starting to investigate it for your application now will give you the opportunity to provide feedback while it 's still being formed , before a bunch of final decisions have been made and a lot of application code has been written to rely on them .
I 've got more to say about scaling , Twisted , and Mantissa , of course .
In particular I 'd like to explain why I think Mantissa is an interesting scaling strategy and how it compares to the other ones .
At this rate , though , I 'll only write one blog post this year !
I 'm sure you hope as much as I do that the next one wo n't be so long ...

If it was n’t bad enough that stores were already tracking the purchase decisions and buying patterns of their customers , it now seems that Philips is developing a way for stores to track the interests of people who have n’t even come inside .
Using a set of video cameras and eye tracking software the system will be able to tell what someone looking at a window display has been staring at the longest , and will then provide more detailed information about the product via a passive or even interactive video display in hopes it will push them towards making a purchase decision .
The system is also useful for keeping track of gazing trends for large groups of people .
The data can help a store determine what type of layout or window display design is most effective for selling a given product .
If you ’re looking for a way to make your Monday even duller than it already is , you can read the full patent application for the gaze tracking system on the World Intellectual Property Organization website .

THE Democratic
Party has long been mocked as the Mommy Party for its soft , nurturing governing style and its paralyzing patience for listening to dissent from every quarter , no matter how small or irrelevant .
The Republican Party is the Daddy Party – always tough , determined and willing to do whatever dirty work is necessary to get the job done .
Democrats want Oprah Winfrey .
Republicans want Jack Bauer .
But now that Barack Obama has taken over the Democratic Party , he ’s bending these “ genderizations . ”
He ’s taking Mommy out of the Mommy Party .
Now , it ’s the party that strides past a female reporter and calls her “ sweetie ” to dismiss her silly little question .
And if you ’re wondering who ’s in charge , do n’t .
Within days of winning the nomination , Obama moved party headquarters to his home town of Chicago and started pushing party heads around , telling them they can’t raise money from PACs and Washington lobbyists .
Yet when it comes to raising his own money , he tossed overboard his campaign promises to participate in the public financing system so he can maintain his massive cash advantage over the Republicans .
And in the ultimate display of testosterone , Obama unsheathed a new campaign emblem that looked emarkably like the presidential seal .
( He has since dropped it . )
All - inclusive to the point of absurdity ?
Not anymore .
Obama operatives last week rooted out a couple of Muslim women and ordered them to keep away from the bleachers behind the candidate unless they removed their head scarves .
Coddler of criminals ?
Not anymore .
Obama – rated the most liberal member of the US Senate - now sides with the most conservative members of the Supreme Court in supporting a state ’s right to execute someone who rapes a child .
The candidate of anti-gun sissies ?
Nope .
Obama may as well have strapped on his John Wayne chaps and holster yesterday to announce his support of the Supreme Court ’s decision that the Second Amendment guaranteeing gun rights actually means what it says .
Are the Democrats now the party of states ’ rights , gun rights and the death penalty ?
This wild election just keeps getting wilder .
As Obama moves rightward and gets tougher , Republicans are desperately trying to portray him as some sort of arrogant flip - flopper .
But these audacious moves by him are not signs of weakness ; they ’re signs of a man who will win at any cost .
Is n’t that what they used to say about the Clintons ?

Around 1.5 years ago , we got wind of researchers in the UK working up a battery - free pacemaker .
Fast forward to now , and we 've got yet another breakthrough in the field .
Purportedly , a crew of Osaka University scientists have created the " world 's first optical pacemaker , " and in an article published in Optics Express , the team details how " powerful , but very short , laser pulses can help control the beating of heart muscle cells . "
In theory , this discovery provides the means for dictating said cells within a controlled setting , which could help researchers " better understand the mechanism of heart muscle contraction . "
As amazing as we 're sure this is to the science world , throwing " lasers " and " heart " into the same sentence just does n't elicit warm / fuzzy feelings .

How to Go Paperless in Your Office
When it comes to paper use in the office , you may be surprised to learn just how much waste is created .
The average office worker generates two pounds of mixed paper product waste each day .
Between junk mail , excessive print jobs , and packaging , we often consume more paper than we should .
Unfortunately , it tends to end up in a landfill .
If you want to improve your company and help the environment , it could be time to switch to a paperless office .
By removing paper from the office , your company can be more eco-friendly , save space , spend less money , and embrace the modern age .
Although it may seem overwhelming , it ’s actually easier than you think to go paperless .
If you ’re ready to get started , keep reading to learn how to go paperless in the office .
A Paperless Office Starts with Getting Staff on Board
To have success , you need to convince all staff and workers that ditching paper is the way to go .
Many workers find this tough , as they have worked their whole career with printers , signed documents , and traditional paper offices .
You may want to work out your objectives of paperless office conversion , to help convince them why and how they can go paperless .
Host meetings and training workshops where you let workers know exactly what to do instead of using paper , and help to ease their concerns or answer questions .
You may want to bring in other initiatives to be more eco-friendly in the office as well .
You could try switching to renewable energy sources , bringing in more natural light and plants , and encouraging workers to walk , cycle , or carpool to work .
Move to a Cloud - Based Platform
If you ’re moving away from paper , you need to come up with a new filing and storage system that all workers can access .
For many companies , a cloud - based platform is the best paperless office software .
Programs like Dropbox or Google Docs allow workers to access company documents from anywhere in the world , as long as they ’re connected to the internet .
You can create copies , collaborate on drafts , and easily save files to your drive .
This has many advantages , in addition to removing paper from the office .
It also frees up storage space in the office and makes it possible for your company to switch to remote working .
With cloud computing , you no longer need to have a physical server on - site in the office , which saves space and reduces the risk of files being damaged from flooding or fire .
Use Electronic Payroll Software
The HR and payroll departments are often big users of paper , but the good news is that they can also make the switch to going paperless .
Using electronic payroll software , you can create payslips that are sent directly to staff ’s email , instead of printing out payslips each week .
For a large company , this by itself can make a huge difference in your paper use .
HR files and documents can also be securely saved online , so there ’s no need anymore for giant filing cabinets full of employee records .
Storing payroll and HR files online can create an added layer of security as well , as you can password protect all documents .
This is more secure than leaving them in an office filing cabinet .
Make Recycling Easy
When you ’re switching to a paperless office , accept that there will need to be a transition period , at least for a few weeks or months .
Staff will need time to change habits , clean out their desks , and embrace going paperless .
During the transition , make it as easy as possible for staff to recycle paper products .
Consider bringing in extra recycling bins so you can ensure the paper is recycled .
One of the best reasons for going paperless is to help the environment , so companies should make sure as much paper as possible gets recycled , helping to stop it ending up in a landfill .
Switch to Paperless Marketing
Your paperless office strategy should encompass not internal office practices , but also your external .
One top consideration is your marketing strategies — can you go completely paperless with marketing ?
It ’s easier than you think to do away with letter drops , brochures , and printed materials .
With so many great digital marketing options , such as social media , Google Ads , and SEO , you can grow your business without ever needing printed collateral .
If this is all new to you , there are plenty of digital marketing agencies that can help your company make the switch .
Sign Documents Digitally
One large consumer of paper in offices is signed documents .
We sign documents when new staff are hired , when employees are promoted , with external suppliers , and when contracts are signed .
However , electronic signatures are just as good as the real thing , with many companies embracing digital signing to cut down on paper .
If you ’re looking for a way to sign documents digitally , this tool can help .
Spread the Word
To be successful with going paperless , you need to let everyone know , internally and externally .
Ask your suppliers to send digital invoices , rather than putting them in the mail .
You can also cut down on magazine or journal subscriptions , remove the company from mailing lists , and switch to e-newsletters .
Printed mail coming into the office each day can add up quickly , and it often gets tossed away .
By changing your preferences when it comes to receiving mail , you can reduce clutter and enjoy less mail coming in each day .
Consider drafting an email that you can send to all clients , suppliers , and stakeholders , letting them know the company has gone paperless and asking them to adjust their communications accordingly .
Reduce the Number of Printers in the Office
Sometimes , cutting down on the numbers of printers in the office can help when going paperless .
For example , do staff have their own printers at their desk ?
If so , is this really necessary ?
You may want to centralize printing with one larger printer for each office .
Larger , industrial - sized printers tend to be more efficient with ink and power as well , helping to reduce your company ’s carbon footprint .
As motivation , why not create a tally each month of how many pages were printed by the company ?
As you start to go paperless , staff can watch this number drop , month by month .
It ’s a fun way to encourage people to think before they print , helping to reduce unnecessary print jobs .
Often , staff get distracted and forget to even pick up the job they printed , so you want to make sure only essential documents are sent to the printer .
Bring in Digital Scanners
Digital scanners let you turn paper documents into electronic documents .
Your staff will definitely need to use scanners as they move from paperless to digital , as it ’s an easy way to save copies of files online .
You can also use scanners to help with archiving .
Instead of having boxes of files and documents sitting in a storage room , collecting dust , you can archive them digitally and destroy the originals .
The files will be safe online and easily accessible whenever needed .
Encourage Laptop and Tablet Use
To go paperless , staff need to have technology at their fingertips — which is tough if staff are still using desktops .
Using laptops and tablets makes it much easier to stay connected , especially during meetings .
In the old days , staff would print out meeting agendas and take notes .
However , if they take their tablets into the meeting , they can read the agenda online , take notes digitally .
They can en save copies of the meeting notes for anyone who was n’t in attendance .
For staff to succeed in a paperless office , they need the right tools to do their jobs .
Moving away from desktops also makes it easier for staff to collaborate and work in teams , without needing to be bound to their desks at all times .

Mrs Sabhnani kept the women as " modern - day slaves " A wealthy New York woman has been sentenced to 11 years in jail for keeping two Indonesian women as slaves .
Varsha Mahender Sabhnani , 46 , and her husband Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani , 51 , kept them as slaves and abused them physically and psychologically .
The couple had been found guilty on 12 charges in December , including involuntary servitude , harbouring aliens and forced labour .
Mr Sabhnani is to be sentenced later on Friday and may get a shorter term .
In addition to prison , his Indian - born wife was fined $ 25,000 ( £ 12,600 ) .
" I just want to say that I love my children very much , " she told the federal court in Central Islip , on New York state 's Long Island , as two of her grown children looked on .
" I was brought to this earth to help people who are in need . "
Her husband wept as his wife 's sentence was announced .
The wealthy couple , who run a perfume business and have four children , had brought the women to their large house to work as housekeepers , and forced them to work up to 18 hours a day .
The couple were arrested after one of the women was found wandering the streets dressed in only trousers and a towel .
Regular beatings Prosecutors had described the case as " modern - day slavery " .
They described how the two Indonesian women had been punished for misbehaviour such as sleeping late and stealing food from the dustbin to supplement their meagre meals .
Domestic workers held a protest during the sentencing of Mrs Sabhnani
The women said they had been beaten with brooms and umbrellas , slashed with knives , made to take freezing showers and climb stairs repeatedly .
One said she had been forced to eat several hot chillies and then her own vomit .
US District Judge Arthur Spatt called the testimony " eye-opening , to say the least - that things like that go on in our country " .
He postponed a decision on the amount of back pay owed to the two women .
Prosecutors have suggested they were due more than $ 1.1 m .
Lawyers for the accused had argued that the housekeepers practised witchcraft and may have abused themselves .
They had said the couple spent a lot of time abroad and that the two Indonesian women would have been free to leave whenever they wanted .
The pair were described as " model citizens " who wanted only to clear their names .
The women , identified as Nona and Samirah , arrived in the US legally in 2002 but had their passports confiscated by the Sabhnanis , officials said .
Their visas have since expired .

A gay priest who angered conservative Christians by exchanging rings and vows with his partner in a church ceremony for his civil partnership in London last month has resigned , it emerged last night .
The Rev Dr David Lord , a New Zealander who tied the knot with English clergyman Peter Cowell on May 31 , " felt it appropriate to lay down his clergy license " , according to a statement released through the Anglican church in New Zealand .
His decision will debar him from officiating as a priest .
It comes amid a furore over the ceremony at St Bartholomew the Great church in the City of London .
The Bishop of London , the Right Rev Richard Chartres , said services of public blessings for civil partnerships were not authorised in the Church of England or the diocese of London and has asked the Archdeacon of London , Peter Delaney , to investigate .
Much of the anger toward the couple came after details of the service were revealed .
Traditionalists were angry that the men were able to enjoy a ceremony almost identical to a traditional church wedding , with readings , hymns , a Eucharist and a version of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer 's Solemnization of Marriage .
Conservatives , especially from Africa accused the couple of undermining the authority of the Bible and the sanctity of marriage .
But the Rev Martin Dudley , who led the service , downplayed the event 's political significance .
" I am surprised and disappointed by the fuss .
It was a joyful , godly occasion .
Why turn it into a controversy ?
It was not a rally or a demonstration , " he said .
" Nor is it the first time there have been prayers , hymns or readings following a civil partnership .
It may be that this ceremony had rather more knobs on .
It may also be the only one we know about . "
He wrote to the Bishop of London two years ago asking for the official position on blessing civil partnerships .
The bishop said he would be grateful if Dudley did not offer this service .
Dudley added : " We should not allow the cultural position of bishops from other countries to affect our response to the very large number of gay people and gay clergy in the Church of England . "
Dudley is the freeholder of St Bartholomew 's , making it virtually impossible for him to be ousted .
But he could face procedures which would involve someone proving there had been an irrevocable pastoral breakdown or that Dudley had acted in a manner unbecoming of a clergyman of the Church of England .
Nigel Seed , a church lawyer , said there was no prohibition on having a service after a civil partnership , provided it was not contrary to church doctrine .
" If you do not purport it to be a service of blessing there is nothing to stop couples from having prayers , hymns or a service of prayer and dedication , " he said .
Liberals reacted with disappointment to the news of Lord 's resignation .
The Rev Dr Giles Fraser , vicar of Putney and president of Inclusive Church , a campaign group working for equal rights for gay Christians , said : " This is disgraceful .
It 's amazing this church cannot celebrate what little love there is in this world .
It was supposed to be the happiest day of their lives and they have been turned into outcasts . "
Others said they hoped the event would help the church modernise .
The Rev Richard Kirker , chief executive of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement , said : " I hope it nudges the church into the 21st century .
There are so many gay clergy in civil partnerships , whose integrity leads them to wanting to have their relationships affirmed by their faith . "
A breakaway Christian group , unhappy with the liberal agenda of western churches meets next weekend in Jerusalem to decide whether it can still retain links with the Anglican communion .
Liturgies , such as the one Dr Lord and Mr Cowell participated in , have been taking place in New Zealand , Scotland and Canada .
The presiding bishop of the US Episcopal Church , Katherine Jefferts - Schori , said : " Those services are happening in various places , including the Church of England , where my understanding is that there are far more of them happening than there are
in the Episcopal Church . "
The provost of St Mary 's Cathedral , Glasgow , the Very Rev Kevin Holdsworth , described the experience of performing a same sex blessing as a " new addition to the range of things that human beings have wanted to mark . "
On his blog he wrote about celebrating a Eucharist in circumstances which were new to him but which felt old and traditional all the same .
As he helped the two men through their vows and then served communion to them and their friends in thanksgiving , he remarked : " People like me have been waiting for services like the one I celebrated today for so long .
Armed police stood guard outside Park Lane Safe Deposit , Mayfair Police have raided a safety deposit box firm 's offices which they suspect have been used to store criminal assets .
The company is believed to be a front for organised crime gangs operating in firearms , money laundering , human trafficking , drugs and prostitution .
The Met Police said that 300 officers took part in the raids in London , codenamed Operation Rize .
Assistant Commissioner John Yates said : " Each box will be treated as a crime scene in its own right . "
' Tirelessly and methodically ' Scotland Yard said that Met 's Specialist Crime Directorate raided seven properties : three safe depositories , an office and three residential addresses .

One of the offices was identified as Park Lane Safe Deposit , Mayfair .
The homes searched were in London and Hertfordshire and belonged to people who are directors of the firm Safe Deposit Centres Limited , Mr Yates told reporters .
Two people were arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences after search warrants were secured at Croydon Crown Court , he added .
The individuals were taken to central London police stations , the Met said , and a number of people were being interviewed as potential witnesses .
Cordons at the business site are being guarded by armed officers because of the potential value of their contents .
Mr Yates said that the police investigation had been under way for two years , but the searches has been finalised in the previous eight months .
Officers believe the boxes were being used to store criminal assets
He added that Rize is the first operation of its scale that the Met has carried out against criminals using this method of storage .
" This is an unprecedented operation and my officers have worked tirelessly and methodically , advised throughout by leading counsel , to ensure that this is the right action to take , " Mr Yates told reporters .
" Operation Rize seeks to preserve the integrity of London as a world - wide financial centre where only legitimate business can operate .
" Criminal enterprises will not be tolerated in London . "
He added that boxes would be carefully handled by trained staff and stored at a secure location .
A call centre has been set up to help restore depositors to their property on 0800 030 4613 .

TUCSON , Ariz . -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Mission generated an unusually high volume of spacecraft housekeeping data on Tuesday causing the loss of some non-critical science data .
Phoenix engineers are analyzing why this anomaly occurred .
The science team is planning spacecraft activities for Thursday that will not rely on Phoenix storing science data overnight but will make use of multiple communication relays to gain extra data quantity .
"
The spacecraft is healthy and fully commandable , but we are proceeding cautiously until we understand the root cause of this event , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Usually Phoenix generates a small amount of data daily about maintaining its computer files , and this data gets a high priority in what gets stored in the spacecraft 's non-volatile flash memory .
On Tuesday , the quantity of this data was so high that it prevented science data from being stored in flash memory , so the remaining science data onboard Wednesday , when the spacecraft powered down for the Martian night after completing its 22nd Martian day , or sol , since landing , was not retained .
None of that science data was high - priority data .
Almost all was imaging that can be retaken , with the exception of images taken of a surface that Phoenix 's arm dug into after the images were taken .
To avoid stressing Phoenix 's capacity for storing data in flash memory while powered off for overnight sleeps , the team commanded Phoenix Tuesday evening to refrain from any new science investigations on Wednesday and to lower the priority for the type of file - housekeeping data that exceeded expected volume on Tuesday .
"
We can continue doing science that does not rely on non-volatile memory , " Goldstein said .
Most science data collected during the mission has been downlinked to Earth on the same sol it has been collected , not requiring overnight storage , but on some sols the team has intentionally included imaging that yields more data than can fit in the afternoon communication passes .
This has been done in order to take advantage of the capacity to downlink additional data during communications passes on the following Martian mornings .
In the short term , while the root cause of the unexpected amount of housekeeping data is being determined , the science team will forgo that strategy of storing data overnight .
Meanwhile , extra communication - relay opportunities have been added to Thursday 's schedule , so the science plan for the day will be able to generate plentiful data without needing overnight storage .
Trench - digging , imaging and weather monitoring are in the plan .
The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of the University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , located in Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus , Denmark ; Max Planck Institute , Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

Looking at the draft flow chart that ICANN has posted for the process of obtaining new extensions , it looks like it may not be a quick and easy process as the press described .
Certainly you can count next year out .
An extension can be knocked out by if it is “ too similar to reserved names or existing TLD ’s and / or likely to cause instability . ”
If it passes that test it still can be knocked out if someone files an objection , on any one of 4 grounds :
String Confusion Existing legal rights Morality and Public Order Community Objection

It ’s not anything new and revealing that America has gone insane .
We all know that .
But now our favorite bloated Federal Bureaucracy ( as if we could pick one over any other ) , the Transportation Security Administration has taken one step beyond common decency .
It ’s bad enough that TSA has turned the experience of flying into a total nightmare .
But now they want to ogle our private parts !
Yes , that ’s right voyeurism is part of the TSA " experience . "
No you do n’t get to uh … enjoy it .
They do .
In the interests of providing even more " security " TSA is installing charming scanning booths that see - through clothes !
Oh boy , now the filthy little TSA pervs can see what goodies you have hidden .
Of course , they claim they are looking for weapons , explosives … toothpaste .
But I do n’t buy it .
Are we seriously to believe that the happy snickering face , safely hidden in another room , drooling over the scanner would n’t be arrested as a Peeping Tom … in a " normal " world that is ?
I thought sex offenders went to the slammer and then had to register their whereabouts after they were released .
Why bother ?
They ’re down at the airport .
And they are getting paid to do it !
Do the inspectors have to put in a quarter to view the passengers ?
If so , who supplies all the quarters ?
Oh … let ’s be democratic and let the victims pay for their own " security . "
Sorry miss , you are going to have to give us a quarter so we can check out your … check out your … uh… naughty bits .
The TSA perverts will get to see a lot more than those nail clippers they ’re going to confiscate !
Oh but not to worry .
While the TSA dirty old men … and women , let ’s be fair … examine your " features " your face will be blurred out .
Oh right !
That makes me feel real secure !
It ’s not my face I want to keep private !
Come on , they do n’t call them " privates " for nothing .
And we thought the pat - down search was humiliating .
Now , I ’m no constitutional expert or lawyer .
But then that probably allows me to understand the constitution rather than become totally confused while seeking ways to reinterpret it to suit some diabolical agenda .
But , it seems to me , security scanners that see through clothes are mighty close to violating the Fourth Amendment .
Here it is .
What do you think ?
Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
Hm … would you feel secure in your person while standing in a peep booth at the airport during your holiday trek across country to grandmother ’s house ?
Do you think see through scanners might be unreasonable searches ?
And where ’s the probable cause , warrant and oath or affirmation describing the place to be searched ?
Do we have to go to the dirty bookstore to find it ?
Do you suppose you might feel violated ?
Rest assured wayfaring strangers , TSA promises that there will be no dirty pictures stored in their computers banks .
Oh yeah ?!
Do they think we ’re stupid ?
In these days of domestic spying in the Rabidly Paranoid States of America , it ’s only a matter of time before some Democratic Dictator decides that we need to keep all photos of everybody ’s tattoos , surgical scars , colostomy bags and genitalia on file .
One never knows what evils lurk inside a colostomy bag !
As things are right now , the pat down or peep show humiliation exam is a random check .
Hm … you do n’t suppose that attractive women with large breasts just might be " randomly " chosen at a slightly higher " random " rate than grandmothers ?
Possibly TSA Peep Show Booths will inspire a revolution in fashion .
Let ’s go retro and bring back Valkyrie breastplates and chastity belts for women and codpieces for men … all made out of metal of course .
That ’ll put the kibosh on their jollies .
For now , travelers beware .
If you ’re not the type to display your " assets " to total strangers , choose the pat - down option while you still have the choice .
Or , better yet , avoid the big airports where TSA is installing their adult toys , like Los Angeles or Miami or New York or Washington or Dallas or … pick one .
It ’s a safe bet they have TSA Peep Show Booths .
Best to fly to Podunk and hitch a ride … do n’t forget to chip in for the gas .
Oh heckers !
I ’ve got the solution !
In the future all airline passengers will be required to fly naked .
There .
That should make TSA happy … the filthy little preeverts !
