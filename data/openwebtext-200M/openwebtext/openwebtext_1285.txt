The descendants of Charles Darwin , his publisher – and his pigeons – met this week on the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species
" That 's the fireplace where Byron 's memoirs were burned after his death because they were thought too salacious , " my host Virginia Murray casually throws into the conversation as she shows me around the upstairs drawing room of number 50 Albemarle Street , just a few steps from Piccadilly in London 's Mayfair .
I am here on something of a scientific pilgrimage : to see the place where Charles Darwin and his publisher , John Murray III , discussed drafts of arguably the most important book in scientific history – On the Origin of Species .
I had hoped to get a sense of the heritage of the book on the 150th anniversary of its publication , but I was not prepared for a fascinating all - round history lesson .
" This was the meeting place in England for literary and political types at the beginning of the 19th century , " said Murray ( the great great grandson of Darwin 's publisher ) .
At Murray III 's soirees , Darwin rubbed shoulders with his great intellectual influences , the economist Thomas Malthus , the botanist Joseph Hooker and the geologist Charles Lyell .

And in its 234 - year history , which began 21 years before the French revolution but sadly ended in 2002 , the publishing house played host to the likes of Benjamin Disraeli , John Betjeman , Kenneth Clark , David Livingstone and James Watt .
Busts of the latter two glower down at us from either side of a massive portrait of Lord Byron that hangs above the fireplace where the poet 's diaries met their end .
Tonight 's soiree is touched by a more modern twinkling of stardust , with the novelists AS Byatt and Ian McEwan , and broadcaster Andrew Marr on the guest list .
We are here to see a unique collection of Darwin artefacts that have been brought together for the anniversary – the climax of a year of Darwin - related events that began with the great naturalist 's 200th birthday on 12 February .
On display is the publisher 's original " file copy " of On the Origin of Species , one of 1,250 copies in the first print run , which earned Darwin £ 180 .
This copy , which would now probably fetch something north of £ 100,000 at auction , is now part of a collection held by the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh .
The collection includes other treasures such as Darwin 's submission letter to Murray and the entry for the Origin in Murray 's financial ledger .
Across the room is a collection of six live fancy pigeons – the same varieties that Darwin used as examples in the first chapter of his book to demonstrate the power of selection by human hand .
" This is a world first , " said Randal Keynes , one of Darwin 's great great grandsons , who explains that this is the first time that the six varieties have been brought together since the publication .
" If you gave them to an expert ornithologist he would say that they are not only different species but also different genera . "
Letter from Darwin to John Murray III , his publisher , dated 31 March 1859 .

And he 's right .
The tall , proud English pouter with its puffed - out chest looks nothing like the dainty Almond Tumber , while the scandaroon 's massive beak and upright posture could hardly be more different from the fantail with its splayed plumage .
These varieties would have been very familiar to people in the 19th century , but it was Darwin 's genius to point out that they were all closely related to the rock dove ( essentially the same as the pigeons in Trafalgar Square ) and had all been created in a few generations by breeders selecting the characteristics they liked .
His message : if people can do this , what could nature achieve with plenty of time on her hands ?
The most valuable thing in the room , at over £ 200,000 , is a single leaf of Darwin 's original manuscript owned by Keynes 's father ( pictured at the top of this article ) .
The text reads :
" Finally then , the facts too briefly given in this chapter , do not seem to me opposed , but rather to support the view that there is no fundamental difference between species and varieties . "
Darwin did not value the manuscript and gave it to his children to use as writing paper .
It ended up forgotten in a cupboard at Down House , where Darwin wrote
On the Origin of Species , but some of the leaves survive today .
Thank goodness they did not end up in the fireplace .
When it comes to air strikes against the Taliban , there ’s something about the number 30 , says the Security Crank blog .
The unnamed military affairs blogger has published a list of recent air strikes against militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and an amazing pattern has emerged :
It seems that just about every time an air strike is reported in the news , the Taliban casualty figure cited is 30 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing the Moon of Alabama blog , which made a similar argument this spring , Security Crank linked to 12 news reports of separate air strike incidents since the start of the year in which the number of Taliban or insurgent casualties was reported to be 30 , in most cases citing US military officials .
Not 29 , not 31 .
Thirty .
What does this mean ?
For the Security Crank , it means we just should n’t believe the numbers .
How could we possibly have any idea how the war is going , here or anywhere else , when the bad guys seem only to die in groups of 30 ?
The sheer ubiquity of that number in fatality and casualty counts is astounding , to the point where I do n’t even pay attention to a story anymore when they use that magic number 30 .
It is an indicator either of ignorance or deliberate spin … but no matter the case , whenever you see the number 30 used in reference to the Taliban , you should probably close the tab and move onto something else , because you just wo n’t get a good sense of what happened there .
Megan Carpentier , writing at Air America , believes there ’s more to this than just fudged numbers .
Carpentier points to a story in the Los Angeles Times this past summer that reports that the US has , or at least had , during the Bush administration , a policy of requiring the secretary of defense to sign off on any air strike that was likely to kill more than 30 civilians .
The Times reported :
In a grisly calculus known as the “ collateral damage estimate , ” US military commanders and lawyers often work together in advance of a military strike , using very specific , Pentagon - imposed protocols to determine whether the good that will come of it outweighs the cost .
We do n’t know much about how it works , but in 2007 , Marc Garlasco , the Pentagon ’s former chief of high - value targeting , offered a glimpse when he told Salon magazine that in 2003 , “ the magic number was 30 . ”
That meant that if an attack was anticipated to kill more than 30 civilians , it needed the explicit approval of then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld or President George W. Bush .
If the expected civilian death toll was less than 30 , the strike could be OKd by the legal and military commanders on the ground .

Carpentier posits that 30 remains the magic casualty number for the Pentagon to this day , and implies that the casualty numbers are being fudged so that they are “ acceptable ” to the public .
“ That PR calculus of how many deaths matter to the average American has apparently carried over from the Bush Administration to the Obama Adminstration , at least insofar as ground commanders are concerned , ” she writes .
But Carpentier ’s argument raises as many questions as it answers .
For one , the Rumsfeld - era casualty policy applied to civilian casualties , not insurgent casualties .
Yet the series of news reports this year cite the 30 number for Taliban casualties , and cite varying figures for civilian casualties , if any are cited at all .
It would be hard to argue that the Pentagon believes the American public can only stomach 30 Taliban casualties at a time .
ADVERTISEMENT
So the likelier explanation is that the Pentagon does n’t know how many insurgents were killed — perhaps because distinguishing insurgents from civilians is no easy task .
And the 30 number seems like a safe bet :
High enough to justify the air strike , but not so high as to seem suspicious or overblown .
Of course , that ’s all just speculation .
So long as military officials continue to insist that it ’s destroying the Taliban exactly 30 insurgents at a time , there wo n’t be much the public will be able to glean from the gory reports of death and destruction in Central Asia .
What do you do when you 've got two disused shipping crates , some photovoltaics , and a couple buckets of toxic green paint ?
Why , you make a solar electric vehicle charging station , the first in New York as it happens .
It was created by Beautiful Earth Group , which whipped up this self - contained charging station to juice the company 's car , a similarly painted BMW Mini E that just so happens to fit nicely inside -- so long as you do n't want to open the doors too wide .
About three hours charges the little sucker up for its maximum range of 100 miles , which ought to be just enough to get you out to the Hamptons .
Not that you 'd want to go there this time of year . :
We searched for an earlier solar station and came up empty , but vyper0 commented to let us know that this is indeed not the first for NY state , just the first for NYC .
There was one installed out on Long Island earlier this year , which would mean you could not only get out to the Hamptons , but get back !
GARDA Commissioner Fachtna Murphy is concerned at the effect that civil claims for damages against gardai could have on the funds available for policing .
Over the past five years , the gardai have paid out a shocking € 20 m in compensation and a further € 12 m in legal fees as a result of civil claims taken against them .
Figures provided by the Department of Justice show that the gardai paid compensation to 57 individuals for allegedly assaulting them .
The claimants received over € 1.5 m in compensation but the total cost to the gardai was closer to € 4m .
A further € 5.7 m was paid out to 38 individuals who successfully claimed against An Garda Siochana for unlawful arrest .
The rest of the successful claims were for miscellaneous incidents such as alleged malicious prosecution , alleged harassment , judicial reviews and habeas corpus or unlawful detention applications .
Responding to a parliamentary question asked on the subject by Labour TD Brian O'Shea , Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said that due to the nature of the work that the gardai were involved in it was ' inevitable ' that the state would be liable for damages in a small number of cases .
" Members of An Garda Siochana are called upon to interact with members of the public on a 24 - hour basis in a wide variety of situations -- many of which are unavoidably stressful and contentious .
" In the vast majority of cases , these interactions are handled in an exemplary and professional manner and do not give rise to subsequent difficulty from a litigation point of view .
" However , inevitably , there is a small number of cases which give rise to the question of a legal liability on the part of the State . "
The minister also revealed that the Garda Commissioner was concerned at the effect that making these payments could have on the funds available to An Garda Siochana in the current economic climate .
He said : " The Commissioner , as accounting officer for An Garda Siochana , is concerned about the impact of the cost of these cases on the funds available to An Garda Siochana .
In all cases , the advice of counsel , the chief state solicitor and the Attorney General inform the approach taken in addressing the issues involved .
" In most cases , the advice leads to settlement of the cases but the question cannot be decided on a fiscal basis alone .
" The commissioner must ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the benefits that might accrue for the public purse in the event of prudent settlement agreements and the necessity to vigorously defend the right and duty of the gardai to carry out their functions . "
The Garda Press Office refused to elaborate on the commissioner 's concern at the impact that these cases could have on An Garda Siochana .
Fine Gael Justice spokesman Charlie Flanagan said that there had already been a huge reduction in spending on policing and that it was important that gardai work to keep claims to a minimum .
" The figures for the Department of Justice spending next year will show that there will be a reduction in monies available for full - time policing , " he said .
" Already this year , we have seen a cut back in excess of € 30 m in garda overtime that will manifest itself in fewer gardai on the street and its essential , therefore , that great care is exercised by gardai in the course of their duties in order to minimise the claims .
" I think its important to insure that such claims are kept to an absolute minimum . "

Joseph McCarthy U.S. Senator from Wisconsin
From : January 3 , 1947 – May 2 , 1957 Predecessor Robert M. La Follette , Jr. Successor William Proxmire Information
Party Republican
Spouse(s ) Jean Kerr McCarthy
Religion Roman Catholicism
Joe McCarthy ( Joseph Raymond McCarthy , November 14 , 1908 – May 2 , 1957 ) was a two - term Republican United States Senator from Wisconsin .
He dominated the anti-communist movement in the United States , 1950 – 54 , until his career receded after censure by the Senate .
" McCarthyism " is the aggressive exposure of Communist influences in America and the people who protect them .
Beginning in 1950 , McCarthy became the most visible public figure to object to Communist infiltration of the United States government .
A 1954 Gallup poll found that Joe McCarthy was the fourth on its list of most admired men . [ 1]
He is now considered an American hero by many , though liberals still seek to tarnish his name . [ 2] [ 3 ]
He was noted for claiming that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers , engaged in a conspiracy to undermine the United States , inside the federal government .
He was proven correct by government documents and inquiry , including decrypted Venona files .
McCarthy lost support in 1953 when he started attacking the U.S. Army and suggesting that Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower was protecting subversives .
Eisenhower signaled Republicans to stop his attacks on the Army .
Although McCarthy had strong support among Catholics , such as Joe Kennedy , in 1954 the Senate censured him on charges of attacking fellow Senators ; this caused his influence to collapse abruptly .
The term " McCarthyism " was coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy 's aggressive attempts to ferret out suspects .
Early life
Joseph McCarthy was born to a poor Irish Catholic farm family in Appleton , Wisconsin .
A hyperactive , extroverted youth , he dropped out of school after eighth grade to start his own poultry business .
After the chickens all died , he enrolled in the local public high school .
Thanks to enormous energy and a retentive mind , he finished his coursework in less than a year at age 20 .
After two undergraduate years at Marquette University , a leading Jesuit school in Milwaukee , McCarthy entered Marquette Law School , acquiring the rudiments of the profession that he soon used to knit together a statewide network among Irish and German Catholics .
McCarthy was a practicing Catholic his entire life , but rarely referred to religion or ethnicity in his speeches .
He actively supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Young Democrats , but did not join Irish organizations .
Although defeated in his 1936 race for district attorney , McCarthy displayed remarkable campaign abilities and an astonishing memory for faces .
He had the energy and determination to meet every voter in person , exuding charm and a concern for the voter as an individual .
The same tactics paid off in 1939 , when he was successful in a nonpartisan contest for a regional judgeship .
The youngest judge in state history , he worked long hours to clear up a large backlog .
He administered justice promptly and with a combination of legal knowledge and good sense .
He was still a Democrat , but that party was very weak statewide at the time .
Military service
Joseph McCarthy in the U.S. Marine Corps
In 1942 McCarthy , volunteered for the Marines ( as a judge he was draft exempt ) , becoming an intelligence officer in an aviation unit heavily engaged in combat in the South Pacific .
Although assigned a desk job McCarthy flew numerous combat missions as a tail gunner — he exaggerated the number to qualify for a Distinguished Flying Cross .
During his 30 months of military service , McCarthy 's record was unanimously praised by his commanding officers and Admiral Chester Nimitz , commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet .
Admiral Nimitz issued the following citation regarding the service of Captain McCarthy :
“ For meritorious and efficient performance of duty as an observer and rear gunner of a dive bomber attached to a Marine scout bombing squadron operating in the Solomon Islands area from September 1 to December 31 , 1943 .
He participated in a large number of combat missions , and in addition to his regular duties , acted as aerial photographer .
He obtained excellent photographs of enemy gun positions , despite intense anti-aircraft fire , thereby gaining valuable information which contributed materially to the success of subsequent strikes in the area .
Although suffering from a severe leg injury , he refused to be hospitalized and continued to carry out his duties as Intelligence Officer in a highly efficient manner .
His courageous devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service . [ 4 ] ”
Elected to Senate , 1946
McCarthy had his name entered in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1944 , opposing a well - entrenched incumbent Republican , Alexander Wiley .
The absentee war hero ran a strong second , making a name for himself statewide and making himself available for the 1946 Senate contest .
Why McCarthy suddenly changed parties was never explained , but prospects for ambitious Wisconsin politicians were dim inside the poorly organized Democratic party , for most New Dealers supported the state 's Progressive party .
During the war , however , that party collapsed , torn apart between its New Deal domestic liberalism , and its intensely isolationist opposition to Roosevelt 's foreign policy .
Increasingly out of touch with Wisconsin , its leader Robert LaFollette Jr. looked to his family 's past glories and made the blunder of trying for reelection to the Senate in 1946 as a Republican .
" Tail Gunner Joe , " as his posters called him , endlessly crisscrossed Wisconsin while LaFollette remained in Washington , offered an alternative in the Republican primary to old guard Republicans who had opposed the Lafollettes for a half century .
McCarthy brilliantly captured the frustrations citizens felt about massive strikes , unstable economy , price controls , severe shortages of housing and meat , and the growing threat of from the far left in the CIO .
He nipped LaFollette in the primary .
The slogan “ Had Enough ? — Vote Republican ” gave the Republicans a landslide all across the North , electing a new junior senator from Wisconsin .
Communist Issue
In Washington , McCarthy was a mainstream conservative in domestic policy , and , like many veterans , was an internationalist in foreign affairs , supporting the Marshall Plan and NATO .
His speeches rarely mentioned domestic Communism or flaming issues like the Alger Hiss espionage case , but that suddenly changed in early 1950 when his vivid anti-Communist rhetoric drew national attention .
" The issue between the Republicans and Democrats is clearly drawn .
It has been deliberately drawn by those who have been in charge of twenty years of treason . ”
Alleging there were many card - carrying Communists in U. S. President Harry S. Truman ’s State Department , McCarthy forced a Senate investigation led by Millard Tydings , Democrat of Maryland .
McCarthy named numerous suspect diplomats but failed to convince the three Democrats on the panel ; they concluded his allegations were “ a fraud and a hoax , ” while the two Republicans dissented .
McCarthy retaliated by campaigning against Tydings , who was defeated for reelection in November 1950 .
What the senator himself called McCarthyism was a factor in key races across the country ; all his candidates won and his stock soared .
A few weeks later American forces were crushed by the Chinese in Korea , and in spring 1951 Truman tried to shift the blame by firing General Douglas MacArthur .
Support from Catholics and Kennedys
The great majority of Catholics were anti-Communist , but they were also loyal Democrats , so to enlarge his base McCarthy , a Republican , needed an alliance with anti-Communist Catholics .
[ 5 ]
The Catholic bishops and the Catholic press was " among McCarthy 's most fervid supporters . " [ 6 ]
A major connection was with the powerful Kennedy family , which had very high visibility among all Catholics in the Northeast . [ 7 ]
Well before he became famous McCarthy became closely associated with Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. .
He was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port and at one point dated Joe 's daughter Patricia .
After McCarthy became nationally prominent , Kennedy was a vocal supporter and helped build McCarthy 's popularity among Catholics .
Kennedy contributed cash and encouraged his friends to give money .
Some historians have argued that in the Senate race of 1952 , Joe Kennedy and McCarthy made a deal that McCarthy would not make campaign speeches for the Republican ticket in Massachusetts , and in return , Congressman and future U.S. President John F. Kennedy would not give anti-McCarthy speeches .
In 1953 McCarthy hired Robert Kennedy as a senior staff member .
When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy in 1954 , Senator Kennedy was in the hospital and never indicated then or later how he would vote ; he told associates he could not vote against McCarthy because of the family ties . [ 8 ]
Political dominance
In 1950 , McCarthy discussed his upcoming 1952 campaign with three fellow Catholics ( Father Edmund A. Walsh and Charles H. Kraus of Georgetown University and Washington attorney Wiliam A. Roberts ) .
Kraus had recommended Father Walsh 's recent books dealing with Communism to McCarthy , and was hoping to interest McCarthy in the problems of Communism in the world .
McCarthy 's reputation among the voters was not good at that time , due to various ethical and tax violation problems , and he needed an issue that would help improve his chances of re-election .
He latched enthusiastically onto the idea of attacking Communists in the government . [ 9 ]
Subsequently , McCarthy called Willard Edwards of the Chicago Tribune asking for assistance with a speech on Communism .
Edwards sent some materials , including a copy of a letter written on July 26 , 1946 , by James F. Byrnes , Secretary of State under Truman .
This letter was the central support for McCarthy 's subsequent claims to have a list of Communists in the government .
" Pursuant to Executive Order , approximately 4,000 employees have been transferred ...
Of those 4,000 employees , the case histories of approximately 3,000 have been subjected to a preliminary examination , as a result of which a recommendation against permanent employment has been made in 284 cases by the screening committee ...
Of the 79 actually separated from the service , 26 were aliens and therefore under " political disability " with respect to employment in the peacetime operations of the Department .
I assume that factor alone could be considered the principal basis for their separation . "
This document was repeatedly cited by McCarthy as the basis for his accusations ; unfortunately , there was no list at that time .
McCarthy now became one of the dominant leaders in American politics , with strong support among both Republicans and Catholic Democrats , as he alleged that Truman 's top people had betrayed America .
He singled out Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of Defense George Marshall .
Liberals were aghast ; Truman had picked General Marshall to head the State and Defense departments precisely because he thought the elderly statesman would always be above criticism , no matter that China turned from a staunch ally to a bitter enemy on his watch .
McCarthy 's blistering attacks on Marshall as “ part of a conspiracy so immense , an infamy so black , as to dwarf any in the history of man ” fueled the belief he was a wild - man , a pathological liar who overstepped the bounds of political discourse .
With Dwight D. Eisenhower crusading against “ Korea , Communism and Corruption ” in 1952 , Republican victory was assured .
As a senior member of the majority party McCarthy for the first time became a committee chairman , with control of staffing and agenda .
He used his Government Operations Committee to open highly publicized hearings in 1953 - 54 alleging disloyalty in the State Department , the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , the U.S. Information Agency , and finally the Army .
His furious attacks on the Army led to the televised “ Army - McCarthy ” hearings in spring 1954 , which exposed his bullying tactics to a national audience .
As McCarthy 's poll rating plunged , his enemies finally pulled together to introduce a censure resolution focused on charging McCarthy with contempt for the federal government , and especially for his fellow senators .
Backlash
McCarthy 's charges that over - educated liberals tolerated Communism at home and abroad had stung the liberals .
He alleged that they had corruptly sold out the national interest to protect their upper class privileges , and were so idealistic about world affairs that they radically underestimated the threat posed by Soviet dictator Stalin , his spies , and the worldwide Communist movement .
Instead of refuting the allegations , Liberals tried one of two approaches .
Some became intensely anti-Communist and claimed they were more effective than McCarthy and the Republicans in eliminating Communism in the unions and Democratic party , and in containing the Stalinist menace in Europe .
The other approach was to counterattack , to charge that “ McCarthyism ” never found a single spy but hurt innocent people in hunting for nonexistent witches ; thus it represented an evil betrayal of American values .
In an appeal to upscale conservatives and liberal intellectuals , critics ignored the Communist infiltration of labor unions and liberal causes and focused on stereotyping anticommunists as ill - mannered ignorant troglodytes , oblivious to American traditions of free speech and free association .
McCarthy 's exaggerations and false charges encouraged opponents to stress the second approach , but it escalated the controversy to a pitch of hatreds and fears unprecedented since the days of Reconstruction .
Loss of influence
McCarthy 's superb sense of timing and his media instincts kept his partisan attacks on the front page every day ; his willingness to do battle in the hustings with Democratic opponents across the country strengthened his base in the Republican party .
His religion and ethnicity , refreshed with highly visible friendships with leading Irish Catholics , especially the Kennedy family , bolstered his standing among Democrats .
According to Gallup , McCarthy 's popularity crested in January 1954 , when he was endorsed by all voters 50 - 29 ( with 21 having no opinion ) .
His core support came from Republicans and Catholics who had not attended college .
McCarthy , however , failed to create any sort of grass roots organization .
He had no organizational skills ; he did not effectively use his talented staffers ( such as Robert Kennedy ) .
He was a loner who lurched from issue to issue , misled by the enormous media publicity into believing that a one - man crusade was possible in an increasingly well - educated complex society honeycombed with local , regional and national organizations .
By operating within the Republican party apparatus he lost the opportunity to create an independent grass roots political crusade in the style of Teddy Roosevelt , Huey Long , or Ross Perot .
He never launched his own magazine or radio show or formed alliances with publishers who agreed with him .
McCarthy 's strained relations with Senate colleagues created a trapdoor .
It was sprung after many Republicans realized that he had shifted the attack away from the Democrats .
What use was his slogan “ 20 Years of Treason ” once Eisenhower was in office ?
McCarthy 's answer was “ 21 Years of Treason ! ”
Eisenhower 's supporters could no longer tolerate such a loose cannon , and as McCarthy unwisely shifted his attacks to Eisenhower 's beloved Army , his cause was doomed .
While many Americans distrusted Ivy League , striped pants diplomats , soldiers were held in high regard ; McCarthy 's charges of subversion were flimsy ( one Communist dentist had been automatically promoted ) ; he sabotaged his own reputation by finagling favors for an aide who had been drafted .
The televised hearings proved fatal to an ill - prepared bully .
After the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 1954 elections , the censure motion carried , 67 – 22 .
McCarthy 's appeal , so widespread yet superficial , evaporated overnight and the Senator faded into the shadows .
The term " McCarthyism "
McCarthy is permanently associated with the use of the word " McCarthyism " ( a word which he did not coin , but of which he did make use according to a sense more aligned with his actual philosophy ) to mean an aggressive attack on Communists who had infiltrated America and on the liberals who protected them — an attack , however , without regard for due process .
Although the left was unable to make heroes of the people who supported and sometimes were controlled by Stalin , they did make heroes of opponents of McCarthy , painting him as the internal menace to American values that was far worse than Communist subversion .
Schrecker ( 1998 ) sees McCarthyism as anti-Communist political repression of the early Cold War , and explores its mechanisms through , and what she considers the exaggerated public fears on which it depended .
During the 1940s - 1950s , McCarthyism took on a variety of forms with an array of agendas , interested parties , and modes of operating .
Despite its widespread and popular character , it started with the federal government and was driven by a network of dedicated anti-Communist crusaders such as J. Edgar Hoover , director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
McCarthyism 's repression both responded to and helped create widespread fears of a significant threat to national security .
Margaret Chase Smith , Republican senator from Maine , gained a national reputation as one of the earliest critics McCarthyism with a Senate speech on June 1 , 1950 , called " the Declaration of Conscience . "
It was an attempt by Smith to address the excesses of McCarthyism , and was widely hailed as a call to reason by McCarthy 's opponents .
Smith gave a critique of the American political process and political institutions in the responses to dissent on the left and the right .
Smith , like other McCarthy critics , sought to bring a level of civility to political protest and dissent .
She and many others who objected to the tactics of McCarthy actually believed in the underlying tenets of his anti-Communist crusade .
Their responses to his excesses reflected a desire to narrow the scope of acceptable political dissent . [ 10 ]
Impact on government
Rausch ( 2000 ) argues McCarthy 's campaign
“ had a lasting impact on the conduct of U.S. foreign relations , particularly among professional diplomatic institutions like the State Department and its Foreign Service personnel , and McCarthyism did not disappear with the senator 's censure in 1954 .
The 'ism ' in a broad sense was a set of ideas not only about internal subversion but also about the outside world , including a simplistic , isolationist anti-communism and a deep suspicion about social reform movements abroad .
It stood in open opposition to a more complex , even accommodating , view of communism .
Instead of ending the hunt for subversives begun under Truman , Eisenhower made the search systematic , universal , and more broadly defined .
McCarthyist Scott McLeod took over security and personnel functions of the State Department and became one of the most famous and despised men in the executive branch .
McLeod brought McCarthyist methods and assumptions to bear in ridding the department of what he defined as security risks .
Oral history sources provide key evidence for the destructive atmosphere within the department in these years , and they shed valuable light on McLeod 's impact on the foreign affairs bureaucracy .
In the short term , the Foreign Service declined in morale , prestige , and influence .
By 1954 , professionally trained diplomacy , with nuanced , internationalist views lost ground to more simplistic , strictly anticommunist views .
During Eisenhower 's second term , the Foreign Service and the more moderate approach experienced a resurgence but still faced opposition from hard - liners who survived the McCarthy years .
The Latin American branch of the department embodied the changes in professional diplomacy towards one region of the world .
Within the division were the institutionalized tensions of the Eisenhower administration , between career diplomats and political appointees , conservative and moderate anti-communists , and trained diplomats and other specialists .
The U.S. embassy in Cuba showed this internal conflict in a microcosm , as the administration 's response to Latin American revolution evolved after 1954 .
McCarthyism accompanied Eisenhower into office , and its effects continued into his last foreign policy crisis and beyond . " [ 11 ] ”
In California McCarthyism began before the Senator was famous .
In 1946 in the Los Angeles schools two teachers from Canoga Park High School were called before the Tenney Senate Investigating Committee on charges of communistic teaching .
The two teachers were exonerated of all charges , but a campaign to rid the LA district of dissident teachers was effectively launched .
The target of the campaign was a group of teachers who belonged to the Los Angeles Federation of Teachers ( LAFT ) , formerly known as Union Local 430 and chartered under the American Federation of Teachers , until 1948 , when the AFT revoked the charter .
By 1954 , Los Angeles teachers were required to take five loyalty oaths , although not one teacher was ever charged with or convicted of subversion .
In 1953 , the Los Angeles City School Board announced that 304 teachers were to be investigated because of alleged Communist affiliations .
The Dilworth Oath , made law in 1953 , required teachers to answer questions posed to them by the Investigating Committees .
Teachers who refused to answer the Committee questions by claiming their Fifth Amendment rights could then be fired by the Board for insubordination . [ 12 ]
Media and popular culture
Historians have debated the degree to which McCarthyism permeated the American mood and popular culture .
Anti-Communist liberals at the time said it played to isolationism ( especially strong in McCarthy 's Wisconsin ) by diverting attention away from the real threat , Stalin 's Soviet Union as an external power .
The Left said that they had a First Amendment right to their beliefs and that McCarthyism had a chilling effect .
Dussere ( 2003 ) shows that comic strip artist Walt Kelly in " Pogo " parodied McCarthyism and promoted leftist politics as old - fashioned American common sense , representing a time when concerns about art and politics with respect to popular culture were in the forefront .
Hoover 's FBI targeted retired film comedian Charlie Chaplin because of his status as a cultural icon and as part of its broader investigation of Hollywood .
Some of Chaplin 's films were considered " Communist propaganda , " but because Chaplin was a British citizen and was not a member of the Communist Party , he was not among those investigated by the House Un- American Activities Committee in 1947 .
Nevertheless , he was vulnerable to protests by the American Legion and other patriotic groups because of both his sexual and political unorthodoxy .
Although countersubversives succeeded in driving Chaplin out of the U.S. , they failed to build a consensus that Chaplin was a threat to the nation .
Chaplin 's story testifies to both the power of the countersubversive campaign at mid-century and to some of its limitations . [ 13 ]
Strout ( 1999 ) looks at The Christian Science Monitor during the McCarthy era ( 1950 - 1954 ) ; it was a highly influential newspaper at home and abroad .
Strout asks : ( 1 ) Was the Monitor a consistent critic of McCarthy ?
( 2 ) How did the coverage compare to other elite and popular press newspapers ?
( 3 ) How did the pressures associated with McCarthyism effect individuals at the Monitor and its news product ?
An extensive review of editorials and news articles suggests that it was thorough and fair in reporting , yet outspoken and responsible in editorial criticism .
Mary Baker Eddy 's original 1907 statement that , " The purpose of the Monitor is to injure no man , but to bless all mankind , " was referred to repeatedly in interoffice correspondence during the McCarthy era .
The Monitor did not attack McCarthy personally as other papers did ; rather , its criticism centered on the actions of the senator and the negative effects they were having at home and abroad .
The Monitor served as a voice of moderation , yet at the same time , remained a persistent critic of McCarthy 's tactics .
Individuals were affected by the pressures of McCarthyism .
For instance , veteran Washington correspondent Richard L. Strout was suspended from covering McCarthy for eight to 12 months after being mentioned in McCarthy 's book , McCarthyism : The Fight for America .
I have in my hand ...
FBI Master Chart of distribution in 1945 - 46 of investigative reports to the White House , Attorney General , and employing agencies of Communist agents in the Federal government .
It was McCarthy 's charges of Communist , security , and loyalty risk infiltration of the State Department that shot him into prominence in 1950 .
At a Lincoln Day speech , on February 9 , 1950 , before the Republican Women 's Club of Wheeling , West Virginia , at the Colonnade Room of Wheeling 's McClure Hotel , he stated :
“ I have in my hand 57 cases of individuals who would appear to be either card - carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party , but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our foreign policy . [ 14 ] ”
McCarthy compiled a list of 57 security risks and publicly named John S. Service , Gustavo Duran , Mary Jane Keeney , Harlow Shapley , and H. Julian Wadleigh [ 15 ] as being on the list . [ 16 ]
These names came from the " Lee List " of unresolved State Department security cases compiled by the earlier investigators for the House Appropriation Committee in 1947 .
Robert E. Lee was the committee 's lead investigator and supervised preparation of the list . [ 17 ]
In a six - hour speech on the Senate floor on February 20 , 1950 in which McCarthy was constantly interrupted by hostile Democrat senators ; four of whom — Scott Lucas ( 61 times ) , Brien McMahon ( 27 times ) , Garrett Withers ( 22 times ) , and Herbert Lehman ( 13 times ) — interrupted him a total of 123 times , McCarthy raised the issue of some eighty individuals who had worked in the State Department , or wartime agencies such as the Office of War Information ( OWI ) and the Board of Economic Warfare ( BEW ) .
McCarthy sought to avoid naming names publicly when possible , using numbered cases instead of names in public session .
He preferred to name his suspects only in executive session , in order to protect those who might have been erroneously identified by the FBI , State Department Security , Army counterintelligence , etc . " [ I ]t would be improper to make the names public until the appropriate Senate committee can meet in executive session and get them , " explained McCarthy .
" If we should label one man a Communist when he is not a Communist I think it would be too bad . "
But when McCarthy began reading his numbered cases to the Senate , the Democrat Majority Leader , Illinois Senator Scott Lucas , interrupted , " I want him to name those Communists . "
In response to McCarthy 's desire not to name names publicly in order to protect the innocent , Lucas bizarrely referred to the fact that statements in Congress are privileged against defamation suits , saying , " if those people are not Communists the senator will be protected . " [ 18 ]
( This was hardly germane : McCarthy 's expressed concern was not about protecting himself , but protecting suspects who might be innocent . )
McCarthy responded :
“ The Senator from Illinois demanded , loudly , that I furnish all the names .
I told him at that time that so far as I was concerned , I thought that would be improper ; that I did not have all the information about these individuals ...
I have enough to convince me that either they are members of the Communist Party or they have given great aid to the Communists : I may be wrong .
That is why I said that unless the Senate demanded that I do so , I would not submit this publicly , but I would submit it to any committee — and would let the committee go over these in executive session .
It is possible that some of these persons will get a clean bill of health ... ”
Democrat Senator William Benton of Connecticut introduced a bill to eject McCarthy from the Senate .
His first charge was that at Wheeling , McCarthy had said that he had a list of 205 names , rather than 57 names .
The Senate ( then under Democrat control ) sent staff investigators to Wheeling to try to substantiate Benton 's charges .
The investigation found no evidence to support Benton 's charge .
According to one investigator :
“ The newly unearthed evidence demolished Senator Benton ’s charges in all their material respects and thoroughly proved Senator McCarthy ’s account of the facts to be truthful . [ 19 ] ”
Senate Democrats quietly buried the 44 - page staff memo summarizing these findings , but the charge that McCarthy had said “ 205 ” was likewise dropped .
Thus the Congressional Record to this day records that McCarthy said " 57 , " not " 205 . "
Nevertheless , many on the left continue to promote Benton 's discredited claim as gospel . [ 20 ]
Benton made this allegation only about McCarthy 's speech in Wheeling , West Virginia and not in the other cities where he made the speech .
The 205 number actually came in another part of his speech ; on February 20 , 1950 , in a speech made on the floor of the Senate , McCarthy officially clarified the issue :
“ I have before me a letter which was reproduced in the Congressional Record on August 1 , 1946 , at page A4892 .
It is a letter from James F. Byrnes , former Secretary of State .
It deals with the screening of the first group , of about 3,000 .
There were a great number of subsequent screenings .
This was the beginning .
The letter deals with the first group of 3,000 which was screened .
The President — and I think wisely so — set up a board to screen the employees who were coming to the State Department from the various war agencies of the War Department .
There were thousands of unusual characters in some of those war agencies .
Former Secretary Byrnes in his letter , which is reproduced in the Congressional Record , says this : Pursuant to Executive order , approximately 4,000 employees have been transferred to the Department of State from various war agencies such as the OSS [ Office of Strategic Services ] , FEA [ Foreign Economic Administration ] , OWI [ Office of War Information ] , OIAA [ Office of Inter - American Affairs ] , and so forth .
Of these 4,000 employees , the case histories of approximately 3,000 have been subjected to a preliminary examination , as a result of which a recommendation against permanent employment has been made in 285 cases by the screening committee to which you refer in your letter .
In other words , former Secretary Byrnes said that 285 of those men are unsafe risks .
He goes on to say that of this number only 79 have been removed .
Of the 57 I mentioned some are from this group of 205 , and some are from subsequent groups which have been screened but not discharged .
I might say in that connection that the investigative agency of the State Department has done an excellent job .
The files show that they went into great detail in labeling Communists as such .
The only trouble is that after the investigative agency had properly labeled these men as Communists the State Department refused to discharge them .
I shall give detailed cases . [ 21 ] ”
McCarthy was able to characterize President Truman and the Democrat Party as soft on or even in league with the Communists .
McCarthy 's allegations were rejected by Truman who was unaware of Venona project decrypts which corroborated Elizabeth Bentley 's debriefing after her defection from the Communists .
According to Gallup , McCarthy 's popularity crested in January 1954 , when he was endorsed by all voters 50 - 29 ( with 21 having no opinion ) .
His core support came from Republicans and Catholics who had not attended college . [ 22 ]
On March 9 , 1954 , CBS broadcasted Edward R. Murrow 's See It Now TV documentary attacking McCarthy .
Venona files
In 1995 , when the Venona transcripts were declassified , further detailed information was revealed about Soviet espionage in the United States .
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was among only a handful of people in the U.S. Government who was aware of the Venona project , and there is no indication whatsoever Hoover shared Venona information with McCarthy .
In fact , Hoover may have actually fed McCarthy disinformation , or dead end files , in an effort to put pressure on relatives , friends , or close associates of real Venona suspects by threatening to reveal embarrassing information about them in a public forum if they failed to cooperate and reveal what they might have known about someone 's else 's activities and associations . [ 23 ]
And there is no indication McCarthy might have known he was being used by Hoover in this way .
On February 7 , 1950 , three days before McCarthy 's acclaimed Wheeling , West Virginia speech , Hoover testified before House Appropriations Committee that counterespionage requires " an objective different from the handling of criminal cases .
It is more important to ascertain his contacts , his objectives , his sources of information and his methods of communication " as " arrest and public disclosure are steps to be taken only as a matter of last resort . "
He concluded that " we can be secure only when we have a full knowledge of the operations of an espionage network , because then we are in a position to render their efforts ineffective . " [ 24 ]
McCarthy is said to have made the claim , " I have here in my hand a list of 205 — a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party . "
The famous " List " , as it has come to be known , has always engendered much controversy .
The figure of 205 appears to have come from an oral briefing McCarthy had with Hoover regarding espionage suspects the FBI was then investigating .
The FBI had discovered on its own five Soviet agents operating in the United States during World War II ; defector Elizabeth Bentley further added another 81 known identities of espionage agents ; Venona materials had provided the balance , and by the time a full accounting of true name identities was compiled in an FBI memo in 1957 , one more subject had been added to the number , now totaling 206 . [ 25 ]
Much confusion has always surrounded the subject .
While the closely guarded FBI / Venona information of identified espionage agents uses the number of 206 , McCarthy in his Wheeling speech only referred to Communist Party membership and other security risks , and not espionage activity .
Being a security risk as a Communist Party of the United States of America ( CPUSA ) member does not necessarily entail or imply that a person was or is actively involved in espionage activity .
Venona materials indicated a very large number of espionage agents remained unidentified by the FBI .
When McCarthy was questioned on the number , he referred to the Lee List of security risks , by which it appears Hoover was attempting to match unidentified code names to known security risks .
Hoover kept the identities of persons known to be involved in espionage activity from Venona evidence secret .
Hoover in the very early days of the FBI 's joint investigation with the Army Signals Intelligence Service in May 1946 did precisely the same deception with a confidant of President Truman using Venona decryptions .
Hoover reported that a reliable source revealed “ an enormous Soviet espionage ring in Washington . ”
Of some fourteen names , Soviet agents Alger Hiss and Nathan Gregory Silvermaster were listed well down the list .
The name at the top was “ Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson ” and included others beyond reproach , thus discrediting the Hiss and Silvermaster accusations , which actually were on target .
Hence the Truman White House always suspected Hoover and the FBI of playing partisan political games with accusations of various administration members ’ complicity in Soviet espionage . [ 26 ]
The Venona project specifically references at least 349 pseudonyms in the United States — including citizens , immigrants , and permanent residents — who cooperated in various ways with Soviet intelligence agencies , however not all were ever identified .
In public hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ( PSI ) conducted by McCarthy , 83 persons pled the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination .
An additional nine persons refused to testify on constitutional grounds in private hearings , and their names were not made public . [ 27 ]
Of the 83 persons pleading the Fifth Amendment , several have been identified by NSA and FBI as agents of the Soviet Union in the Venona project involved in espionage .
Several prominent examples are :
Venona transcripts confirm the Senate Civil Liberties Subcommittee , chaired by former Senator Robert LaFollette , Jr. , whom McCarthy defeated for election in 1946 , had at least four staff members working on behalf of the KGB .
Chief Counsel of the Committee John Abt ; Charles Kramer , who served on three other Congressional Committees ; Allen Rosenberg , who also served on the National Labor Relations Board , Board of Economic Warfare ( BEW ) , the Foreign Economic Administration ( FEA ) and later argued cases before the United States Supreme Court ; and Charles Flato , who served on the BEW and FEA , all were CPUSA members and associated with the Comintern .
While the underlying premise of Communists in the government was true , many of McCarthy 's targets were not complicit in espionage .
Recent scholarship has established of 159 persons investigated between 1950 and 1952 , there is substantial evidence nine had assisted Soviet espionage using evidence from Venona or other sources .
Of the remainder , while not being directly complicit in espionage , many were considered security risks . [ 38 ]
Known security / loyalty risks
In June 1947 , a Senate Appropriations subcommittee addressed a secret memorandum to Secretary of State George Marshall , calling to his attention a condition that developed and was continuing in the State Department .
The memo stated that
“ it was evident there was a deliberate , calculated program being carried out not only to protect communist personnel in high places , but to reduce security and intelligence protection to a nullity .
On file in the department is a copy of a preliminary report of the FBI on Soviet espionage activities in the United States which involved a large number of State Department employees , some in high official positions . ”
Robert E. Lee was the committee 's lead investigator and supervised preparation of the list .
The Lee list , also using numbers rather than names , was published in the proceeding of the subcommittee . [ 39 ]
The memorandum listed the names of nine State Department officials and said that they were " only a few of the hundreds now employed in varying capacities who are protected and allowed to remain despite the fact that their presence is an obvious hazard to national security . "
Ten persons were removed from the list by June 24 .
But from 1947 until McCarthy 's Wheeling speech in February 1950 , the State Department did not fire one person as a loyalty or security risk . [ 40 ]
In other branches of the government , however , more than 300 persons were discharged for loyalty reasons alone during the period from 1947 to 1951 .
Most but not all of Senator McCarthy 's numbered cases were drawn from the “ Lee List ” or “ 108 list ” of unresolved Department of State security cases compiled by Lee for the House Appropriations Committee in 1947 . [ 41 ]
The Tydings subcommittee also obtained this list .
In addition to some of the person involved in espionage identified in the Venona project listed above , there are other security and loyalty risks identified correctly by Senator McCarthy included in the following list :
Attacks on McCarthy
One of the most prominent attacks on Senator McCarthy was an episode of the TV documentary series See It Now , hosted by Edward R. Murrow , which was broadcast on March 9 , 1954 . [ 94 ]
By the time Murrow produced his See It Now assault on Senator McCarthy in 1954 , the senator had been under almost constant vicious attack for four years .
According to McCarthy biographer Arthur Herman , Murrow and his staff had spent two months carefully editing film clips to portray McCarthy in the worst possible light .
There were no clips showing McCarthy in a professional manner .
Despite Murrow 's claims , this " was not a report at all but instead a full - scale assault , employing exactly the same techniques of ' partial truth and innuendo ' that critics accused McCarthy of using . "
The episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy in the most unflattering context , including " belching and picking his nose " . [ 95 ]
In these clips , McCarthy accuses the Democrat Party of " twenty years of treason " because of the Democrat Party 's concessions to the Soviet Union at the Yalta conference and Potsdam conference , describes the American Civil Liberties Union as " listed as ' a front for , and doing the work of , ' the Communist Party , " and berates General Zwicker for Zwicker 's claim that he would protect any other general who promotes Communists within the military .
Murrow also portrays a Pentagon coding room employee , Annie Lee Moss as an " innocent victim " of McCarthy even though it was later established that the FBI had warned the Army and the Civil Service Commission about her Communist Party connection . [ 96 ]
However , even some McCarthy critics were outraged by this one - sided presentation .
Consistent McCarthy critic , John Cogley of Commonweal , " sharply attacked Murrow and his producers for their distorted summary and selected use of video clips . " [ 97 ]
Cogley commented that a different selection of footage could have easily portrayed McCarthy in an extremely positive light and then further warned against the misuse of television in this fashion .
He and another McCarthy critic from the Saturday Review agreed that it " was not a proud moment for television journalism " . [ 98 ]
To counter the negative publicity , McCarthy appeared on See It Now on April 6 , 1954 , and presented his case in order to clarify the misconceptions that Murrow had televised .
McCarthy countered that his committee , " has forced out of government , and out of important defense plants , Communists engaged in the Soviet conspiracy . "
McCarthy went on to say , " For example , 238 witnesses were examined [ in ] public session ; 367 witnesses examined [ in ] executive session ; 84 witnesses refused to testify as to Communist activities on the ground that , if they told the truth , they might go to jail ; twenty - four witnesses with Communist backgrounds have been discharged from jobs [ in ] which they were handling secret , top - secret , confidential material , individuals who were exposed before our committee . "
McCarthy also exposed Murrow 's left - wing background and previous associations with Communist organizations . [ 99 ]
The Murrow report , together with the televised Army - McCarthy hearings of the same year , and four years of consistent anti-McCarthy media reporting were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy .
However , well - known broadcaster Eric Sevareid said the Murrow assault " came very late in the day ....
The youngsters read back , and they think only one person in broadcasting and the press stood up to McCarthy , and this has made a lot of people feel very upset , including me , because that program came awfully late . " [ 100 ]
Even Murrow discounted his role in the decline of Senator McCarthy 's popularity .
Murrow stated , " My God , I did n't do anything .
( Times columnist ) Scotty Reston and lot of guys have been writing like this , saying the same things , for months , for years .
We 're bringing up the rear . " [ 101 ]
Nevertheless , despite the deceptive nature of the See It Now program and the late date in which it appears , anti-McCarthy historians have credited and celebrated Murrow as playing a major role in damaging Senator McCarthy 's campaign to remove security risks from the U.S. government .
Senate opposition to McCarthy
While over the previous few years , Senator McCarthy had withstood countless biased and unsubstantiated attacks by Liberals , Communists , etc. , who sought to prevent him from damaging their causes any further ; the organized and co-ordinated effort between the two groups to remove McCarthy from his Chairmanship and officially condemn him began in March 1954 .
Senate opposition
On March 9 , 1954 a fellow conservative and anti-communist Republican Senator , Ralph E. Flanders of Vermont , gave a speech criticizing what he felt was Senator McCarthy 's " misdirection of our efforts at fighting communism ” and his role in “ the loss of respect for us in the world at large . ”
Flanders felt the nation should pay more attention looking outwards at the “ alarming world - wide advance of Communist power ” that would leave the United States and Canada as “ the last remnants of the free world . ” [ 102 ]
Eisenhower Administration cabinet officials told Flanders to “ lay off , ” while President Eisenhower sent Flanders a brief note of appreciation for his speech , but did not otherwise confer with him or explicitly support him .
[ 103 ]
In a June 1 , 1954 speech , Flanders emphasized how the Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men , and said this nation was witnessing " another example of economy of effort ... in the conquest of this country for communism . "
He added , " One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other . " [ 104 ]
Flanders told the Senate that McCarthy 's " anti-Communism so completely parallels that of Adolf Hitler as to strike fear into the hearts of any defenseless minority " ; he accused McCarthy of spreading " division and confusion " and saying , " Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them . " [ 105 ]
On June 11 , 1954 Flanders introduced a resolution charging McCarthy “ with unbecoming conduct " and calling for his removal from his committee chairmanship .
Upon the advice of Senators John Sherman Cooper , a Moderate Republican from Kentucky and J. William Fulbright , a Democrat segregationist from Arkansas and legal assistance from the National Committee for an Effective Congress , a liberal organization , he modified his resolution to “ bring it in line with previous actions of censure . ” [ 106 ]
After introducing his censure motion , Flanders had no active role in the ensuing Watkins Committee hearings .
Flanders bore McCarthy no personal animosity and reported that McCarthy accepted his invitation to join him at lunch after the hearings had taken place . [ 107 ]
Watkins Committee
Ultimately , McCarthy was accused of 46 different counts of allegedly improper conduct and another special committee was set up , under the chairmanship of Senator Arthur Watkins , to study and evaluate the charges .
This was to be the fifth investigation of Senator McCarthy in five years .
This committee opened hearings on August 31 , 1954 .
After two months of hearings and deliberations , the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on only two of the original 46 counts .
The committee exonerated McCarthy on all substantive charges . [ 108 ]
On November 8 , 1954 , a special session of the Senate convened to debate the two charges .
The charges to be debated and voted on were : 1 ) That Senator McCarthy had " failed to cooperate " in 1952 with the Senate Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections that was looking into certain aspects of his private and political life in connection with a resolution for his expulsion from the Senate ; and 2 ) That in conducting a senatorial inquiry , Senator McCarthy had " intemperately abused " General Ralph Zwicker .
The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy 's conduct was arguably " induced " by Zwicker 's own behavior .
Many senators felt that the Army had shown contempt for committee chairman McCarthy by disregarding his letter of February 1 , 1954 and honorably discharging Irving Peress the next day .
So , for this reason , the Senate concluded that McCarthy 's conduct toward Zwicker on February 18 was justified .
Therefore , the Zwicker count was dropped at the last minute and was replaced with this substitute charge : 2 ) That Senator McCarthy , by characterizing the Watkins Committee as the " unwitting handmaiden " of the Communist Party and by describing the special Senate session as a " lynch party " and a " lynch bee , " had " acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute , to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate , and to impair its dignity . " [ 109 ]
On December 2 , 1954 , even though more than a dozen senators told McCarthy that they did not want to vote against him but had to do so because of the enormous pressure being put on them by the Eisenhower Administration and by leaders of both political parties , the Senate voted to " condemn " Senator Joseph McCarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22 .
The Democrats voted unanimously in favor of condemnation and the Republicans split evenly .
Resolution condemns McCarthy
The resolution condemning Senator McCarthy has been criticized as a ridiculous attempt to silence the strongest voice in the Senate investigating security and loyalty risks in the U.S. government .
When examined closely , the two counts used in condemning McCarthy were hopelessly flawed .
In analyzing the first count , " failure to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections " , the fact is that the subcommittee never subpoenaed McCarthy , but only " invited " him to testify .
One senator and two staff members resigned from the subcommittee because of its dishonesty towards McCarthy .
In its final report dated January 2 , 1953 , the subcommittee , stated that the matters under consideration " have become moot by reason of the 1952 election . "
Up until this moment in U.S. history , no senator had ever been punished for something that had happened in a previous Congress or for declining an " invitation " to testify .
Therefore , the first count was a complete fraud and nothing more than a trumped up charge in order to damage Senator McCarthy .
The second count was even more flawed than the first .
McCarthy was condemned for opinions he had expressed outside the Senate when he criticized the Watkins Committee and the special Senate session .
In an editorial by David Lawrence in the June 7 , 1957 issue of U.S. News & World Report , other senators had accused McCarthy of lying under oath , accepting influence money , engaging in election fraud , making libelous and false statements , practicing blackmail , doing the work of the communists for them , and engaging in a questionable " personal relationship " with Roy Cohn and David Schine .
However , these other Senators were not censured for acting " contrary to senatorial ethics " or for impairing the " dignity " of the Senate .
Only Senator McCarthy would be held responsible for his words . [ 110 ]
Final years

Senator McCarthy 's power and clout to continue the search for Communists in positions of power in America was severely curtailed .
After the Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1954 , McCarthy , now a member of the minority Party , had to depend on public speeches to continue his campaign of warning the American people to the danger of Communism .
He did this in a number of important addresses during those two and a half years .
In January 1957 , McCarthy and his wife , Jean , adopted a baby girl and named her , Tierney .
Unfortunately , several months later , McCarthy died of acute hepatitis , likely brought on by his lifelong struggle with alcoholism , in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2 , 1957 , at the age of 48 .
McCarthy was given a state funeral attended by 70 senators .
McCarthy was the first senator in 17 years to have funeral services in the Senate chamber .
Thousands of people viewed the body in Washington D.C. and it is estimated more than 30,000 people from Wisconsin filed through St. Mary 's Church in the senator 's hometown of Appleton , Wisconsin , where the clergy performed a Solemn Pontifical Requiem before more than 100 priests and 2,000 others .
Three senators , George Malone , William E. Jenner , and Herman Welker , had flown from Washington D.C. to Appleton on the plane carrying McCarthy 's casket .
Robert Kennedy attended the funeral in Wisconsin .
McCarthy was buried in St. Mary 's Parish Cemetery in Appleton and was survived by his wife , Jean , and their adopted daughter , Tierney .
Retrospective views on McCarthy
In her popular book , Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism , Ann Coulter said of McCarthy :
" A half century later , when the only people who call themselves Communists are harmless cranks , it is difficult to grasp the importance of McCarthy 's crusade .
But there 's a reason ' Communist ' now sounds about as threatening as ' monarchist ' -- and it's not because of intrepid New York Times editorials denouncing McCarthy and praising Harvard educated Soviet spies .
McCarthy made it a disgrace to be a Communist .
Domestic Communism could never recover . " [ 111 ]
When Ann Coulter asked Fox News ’ Bill O'Reilly to identify a McCarthy - tormented innocent , O'Reilly responded with Dalton Trumbo , one of House Un- American Activities Committee 's ( HUAC ) “ Hollywood Ten ” , not realizing HUAC investigated CPUSA infiltration in Hollywood and called “ the Hollywood Ten ” of writers , directors and producers to testify in 1947 .
McCarthy did not start his crusade against Communism until 1950 .
In 1953 – 54 , McCarthy had been investigating lax security in the top secret facility at Ft. Monmouth , New Jersey .
He was attacked by liberals and Communists on the grounds that there were no security problems at Ft. Monmouth .
Years later , in addressing the reason why the U.S. Army 's top - secret operations at Fort Monmouth were quietly moved to Arizona , Senator Barry Goldwater , in his 1979 book With no apologies :
The personal and political memoirs of United States Senator Barry M. Goldwater , Goldwater stated :
" Carl Hayden , who in January 1955 became chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee of the United States Senate , told me privately Monmouth had been moved because he and other members of the majority Democratic Party were convinced security at Monmouth had been penetrated .
They did n't want to admit that McCarthy was right in his accusations .
Their only alternative was to move the installation from New Jersey to a new location in Arizona . " [ 112 ]
Even though McCarthy 's investigations proved that his suspicions were right , for many years afterward and continuing to this day , liberals have spread the falsehood that McCarthy had found nothing at Fort Monmouth .
Before the 1989 release of Carl Bernstein 's book , Loyalties : A Son's Memoir , Albert Bernstein , Carl 's father , expressed dismay at the revelations that the book would make regarding Communist infiltration of the U.S. government and other sectors of American society .
Albert Bernstein stated :
" You 're going to prove [ Sen. Joseph ] McCarthy was right , because all he was saying is that the system was loaded with Communists .
And he was right .
... I 'm worried about the kind of book you 're going to write and about cleaning up McCarthy .
The problem is that everybody said he was a liar ; you 're saying he was right .
... I agree that the Party was a force in the country . " [ 113 ]
Both Albert Bernstein and Sylvia Bernstein , Carl 's mother , had both been Communists since the 1940s .
Albert Bernstein was a Union activist , while Sylvia Bernstein was a secretary for the War Department in the 1930s and , during the Clinton Administration , volunteered in the White House , answering letters that were addressed to Hillary Clinton .
During the 1950s , Sylvia Bernstein invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid revealing her party ties to Congress but worked openly in assisting convicted spies Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg , who were executed in 1953 for espionage .
It should be pointed out how many people followed McCarthy on his crusade , and that many pro-Americans still do .
The majority of the sources that discredited Senator McCarthy originated from a large assault by the liberal media that managed to sway the majority of Americans against him at that time .
While many Americans – liberals and conservatives – use McCarthy 's name in a negative connotation , such references are unfair to McCarthy . [ 114 ]

Pulp Fiction ( 1994 )
4 Stars ( out of 4 ) Tweet By the Book By Jeffrey M. Anderson
In the minds of most people , Pulp Fiction is a collection of recycled movie scenes , punctuated by extreme violence , 70's music , and pop culture references .
That 's supposedly all it takes to make a Quentin Tarantino movie .
Yet , how many movies have there been since which have copied this " formula " that are as fresh , energetic , alive and exciting ?
None .
Pulp Fiction remains the best movie of the 90's .
First , to address the detractors .
Yes , Pulp Fiction is an extraordinary catalog of movie references .
The glowing suitcase is a reference to Robert Aldrich 's Kiss Me Deadly .
Harvey Keitel 's " cleaner " character is a reference to Luc Besson 's La Femme Nikita and its American remake , Point of No Return .
Uma Thurman 's haircut is a reference to silent actress Louise Brooks .
The hypodermic scene ( with Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette ) was lifted from Martin Scorsese 's American Boy .
The Ricky Nelson singer in the diner is a reference to Tarantino 's favorite movie , Howard Hawks ' Rio Bravo .
Other scenes and lines of dialogue were lifted from Don Siegel 's Charley Varrick , Jean - Luc Godard movies , Brian De Palma movies , John Woo movies , Jack Hill movies , and an entire video store more .
Tarantino 's passion is not a snobbish one .
He reserves the same enthusiasm for both respected movies and trash movies .
He is smart enough , though , to escape doing simple homages or remakes .
He takes the scraps from these old movies and weaves an extraordinary new cloak out of them .
As for the violence , most of it , in fact , takes place off - screen .
Tarantino expertly toys with us in a way that only Hitchcock did before him -- letting the scene play drag on , slowly , making us believe that we have experienced more violence than we actually have .
Vincent Vega ( John Travolta ) shooting Marvin 's head off in the back of the car is played out to the point of gruesome comedy , but very little is actually shown .
Likewise Butch 's ( Bruce Willis ) run-in with the sodomizing rednecks .
There is more violence in any summer explosion blockbuster you could name .
It 's just that you 're pummeled with it instead of being tingled , and your senses are less aware of it .
As for the pop culture references , some of it is relevant ; Jules ( Samuel L. Jackson ) and Vincent discuss hamburgers just before going into the hotel room in which the three clean - cut youths are eating hamburgers ( at 7 AM ) , which lends a strange mystical property to the scene .
Likewise , the " foot massage " talk is meant to emotionally heighten the power of Marcellus Wallace ( Ving Rhames ) without actually showing any violence .
Some of the talk is designed to throw you ; the character of Tony " Rocky Horror " is brought up several times , and he becomes a character to us , even though he is never shown on screen .
Butch and Esmerelda Villalobos talk about death during their cab ride .
Is n't Butch about to face certain death several times ?
Butch and his girlfriend ( Maria De Medeiros ) talk about various things ; potbellies , Spanish , etc .
All of it is designed to relax you more and more until the point when Butch realizes his watch is missing .
It would be one thing to keep us in suspense during this whole time , but it takes a great artist to make us relax totally before building us back up again .
The dialogue itself is brilliant stuff .
It 's not that it sounds like the way people actually talk , but it has a movie - rhythm that just sounds good .
It may be Tarantino 's greatest gift .
The actors love it , too .
Every actor in Pulp Fiction gives a career - topping performance in every role ( has Bruce Willis ever been better ?
Uma Thurman ? ) .
Travolta especially shines , back in top form after years of bad movies .
His smooth , underconfident junkie Vincent Vega is our link to all three stories .
He " plays " a different character depending on who he's on screen with .
He talks jivey when on screen with Jules , cool when with Mia Wallace , and tough in his brief scene with Butch .
He does n't have the confidence to be himself at any time .
It 's a great performance .
When Vincent and Jules begin the movie by hassling the three young cons , they " get into character " before entering the room .
Jackson is mesmerizing as Jules , fearsome and religious .
Frank Whaley , Steve Buscemi , Peter Green , and Christopher Walken also appear in bit parts .
The main thing about Pulp Fiction that people miss is its theme of redemption .
Pumpkin ( Tim Roth ) and Honey Bunny ( Amanda Plumme ) are redeemed because they call off their restaurant holdup .
Jules is redeemed after he believes he has seen the miracle of the bullets missing him .
Vincent witnesses the same " miracle " , refuses to believe it , and is dead the next day ( in Butch 's apartment ) .
Butch is redeemed by going back to help Marcellus against the greater evil ( of the rednecks ) .
Marcellus lives because he sends Jules and Vincent after his " soul " ( the contents of the briefcase ) .
He is redeemed when he decides he needs his soul back .
It is also a movie about pairs .
Every scene is about the give - and - take of two people .
There is also a running theme of men losing power to women .
Jules mentions that he 's a vegetarian because his girlfriend is .
Jimmy ( Tarantino ) is afraid of what his wife will do if she catches him helping criminals in their house .
Even when Butch goes back alone for his watch , he is " with " his father .
Yet another trick is that the movie contains no musical score , only carefully selected pop songs .
A good deal of the songs are instrumentals and work very well to convey mood .
And the songs are all over the map -- funk music and surf music are fully integrated .
We even have white soul ( Dusty Springfield ) and black surf ( Chuck Berry ) .
So many filmmakers need to learn the value of a quiet scene rather than drenching them in drippy music .
Pulp Fiction is a movie about the in - between spaces that Hollywood movies do n't show .
in a normal movie , every gesture , every prop , every line of dialogue is related somehow to the final outcome of the story .
" Pulp Fiction " shows us people sleeping , taking showers , going to the bathroom , the scenes where characters get ready for scenes , and the scenes afterwards .
The boldest move is not showing Butch 's big fight in which he supposedly kills his opponent .
Instead , we see the cab ride afterward .
This is really quite a dangerous move giving us talk instead of action .
But , after Raging Bull , how good could this fight scene have really been ?
And is n't it interesting how the background out the window of the cab is unrealistic black and white footage ?
Somehow , this ploy works .
I could go on and on .
Pulp Fiction has endless puzzles and pleasures that are still to be discovered .
It 's a movie that says more about the nature of film and the thrill of making movies than any other film in the 90's .
It 's a movie that is truly alive , made with spirit and energy ; intelligence , and gamesmanship .
I do n't expect any movie in the remaining months of the millennium to top it .
In 2011 , Lionsgate , which owns the Miramax back catalog , released Pulp Fiction on Blu- Ray , and it's one of the best I 've yet seen .
Tarantino supervised the new transfer , and it's astoundingly bold and clear ; the Jackrabbit Slim 's sequence especially pops .
It also comes with a new lossless soundtrack .
There are two new extras : a discussion among five film critics about the film 's impact , and new interviews with some of cast .
The other extras are the same as on the DVD : much - coveted deleted scenes , including one with legendary character actor Dick Miller , a " Siskel & Ebert " TV special on Tarantino , short documentaries , and much more .

While all of the gentiles ( or goyim ) are celebrating a holiday where all the gifts are opened at once – after being delivered through the chimney by an overweight icon in a red suit – I 'll be lighting a candle and opening one gift a night .
Starting tonight at sundown .
That 's right folks , I celebrate Chanukah .
Or Hanukah , Hanuka , Hannukah , Hanukkah , Channukah or just חֲנֻכָּה .
Basically , the spelling is up in the air as it's a translation of sounds like any language based on symbols .
I like to use Chanukah for some reason , maybe because the CH sound at the beginning forces me to make it sound like a Klingon word .
Now that we 've established my religious preference ( though if my wife would let me I 'd convert to Pastafarian in a heartbeat ) let 's take a look at eight random ways you can make Chanukah as geeky ( or at least as fun ) as humanly ( or robotically ) possible whether you celebrate it or not .
Light ' Em Up ! — — — — —-
Jewish or not , you probably know that Chanukah is traditionally called " The Festival of Lights " and includes the tradition of lighting the Menorah , one candle a night .
How can lighting candles be geeky ?
Well , even if you 're not sitting in a giant LEGO menorah the lighting of the candles does n't have to be boring .
You could build your own flamethrower to light the candles , or my personal favorite - just use your craft torch !
Plate Full of Latkes — — — — — ——
–
One of the foods consumed ( in great quantities in my house ) around this time of year are Latkes .
Simply put , they are fried potato pancakes .
Imagine chopped up french fries , covered in onion rings and deep fried in hot oil .
I like a little beer batter on mine .
Latkes make the perfect all - night gaming snack , and go great with a Mountain Dew and an 8 - hour session of WoW .
Everyone Can Sing — — — — ——
–
Jews do n't just say prayers , we sing them .
Seriously .
Over the years I 've learned something – no - one in my family can sing .
When reciting the blessings every night while lighting the candles , I cringe .
Thanks to the magic of the iPhone and the genius of T - Pain , we have the I am T - Pain iPhone app , so you can simply record the blessing into your iPhone and auto - tune it !
Amazing !
Also , it can be used for all the other blessings , as well as Nana 's kvetching about how things were when she was young and poor .
Chanukah Viewing Party — — — — — ———-
Similar to the tradition of viewing A Christmas Story over and over and over on Christmas Eve , in my household we like to view Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights every night after we open gifts .
It 's a hilarious animated movie that teaches a great lesson to kids about behavior and charity .
Recently my brother suggested we add a new film to the Chanukah viewing rotation , for after the kids are in bed .
Adam Goldberg 's The Hebrew Hammer .
Probably the strangest and most original holiday film ever made .
Though I 've always preferred The Frisco Kid .
Go Read Comics — — — ——
–
It 's well known that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby are both Jewish and are responsible for creating a lot of the comic book characters out there .
But those guys are real .
Here 's a short list of some comic book characters that you may be familiar with that are lighting the Menorah this Chanukah .
Except for Magneto , as he was born Jewish but turned his back on religion .
Iceman ( his mom is Jewish ) , Marvel Boy ( Justice ) , Microchip ( the Punisher 's assistant ) , Prime and of course , Shadowcat ( Kitty Pryde ) who wears her faith around her neck .
Chanukah Through Music — — — — — ———-
While we all are familiar with Adam Sandler 's now infamous Chanukah ballads , delighting in naming all the famous Jews and making pot jokes , fellow GeekDad Z helped me compile a list of some other great Chanukah - related music you may not have heard .
From nerdcore to TMBG to Sarah Silverman , there is some good stuff here that you can easily find a place to download from ( like iTunes , Amazon , etc. ) and make yourself the perfect Chanukah mixtape .
Erran Barron Cohen ( brother of Sasha ) released an album of traditional Chanukah songs called Songs In The Key Of Hanukkah .
A great mashup from DJ Flack called " Dreidl - Bells . "
Senator Orrin Hatch wrote a Chanukah song .
Go figure .
It 's called " A Melody Fit for a Maccabee . "
A bit of musical comedy from the group Da Vinci's Notebook ( two of whom went on to become Paul and Storm ) , with their Alice in Chains - inspired cover of " Dreidel Dreidel Dreidel . "
Wicked .
Music group
The LeeVees put out an excellent album of modern Chanukah songs , Hanukkah Rocks .
Among the songs are the very funny " At the Timeshare " and " Kugel . "
The Barenaked Ladies holiday album , Barenaked for the Holidays contains some Chanukah songs in that distinctive BNL style .
Side note :
Their song " Hanukkah Blessings " made it onto Rock Band .
They Might Be Giants also released a holiday EP a couple years back , with one Chanukah song on it , called " Feast of Lights . "
In the chiptune category , 8 Bit Weapon has included a Chanukah song on their new holiday album , It 's a Chiptune Holiday .
Let us also not forget the timeless Christmas Jews album released by the hilarious 2 Live Jews comedy music duo .
It 's a contradiction of sorts , since it 's Jews ripping apart Christmas music with some Chanukah songs sprinkled in .
Finally , for your viewing pleasure ( though not all safe for the geeklets ) there is Sarah Silverman 's " Give the Jew Girl Toys " and the less inappropriate though still classic Kyle Broflovski's " Lonely Jew on Christmas " ballad .
Record It All — — — — —-
As geeks , it 's our duty to get in everyone 's face with the new video camera .
It 's our obligation to Twitter while opening gifts .
It 's also in our best interest to take hundreds of pictures to then upload to Flickr to share with the world .
It is then in our best interest to upload the video to YouTube so your family in another state can see your kids singing the Chanukah blessings as though they were wrought with the spirit of T - Pain .
Do n't forget to set up the continuous slide - shows on the digital picture frames scattered throughout the house .
But you already knew all that , you do it every weekend .
If You Build It , Presents Will Come — — — — — — — — — —
——
–
Whenever possible , a true geek does n't buy it .
A true geek builds it .
That rule holds for the centerpiece of the Chanukah holiday , the Menorah .
For you gentiles , that 's the thing that holds the candles .
For the kids , might I suggest a D.I.Y .
Menorah kit ?
Just remember , whatever you build the Menorah out of , try not to make it flammable .
Personally , I like a good solid metal one or one made out of old computer parts .
If you are feeling lazy however , you can head over to Thinkgeek and buy one made from a motherboard with LED lighting .
Pretty .
Though if you want to get really hardcore geek with your Menorah , go with the Star Trek Pez LED Menorah .
If you think making a Menorah is too tough , then go make a Droidel .
That 's it !
So from all of us here at GeekDad have a fun and geeky Chanukah !
Hope you get all eight gifts you asked for and more !
I know I 'm getting a handful of giftcards .
L'Chaim y'all !

• Jarno Trulli expected to sign a contract in the next few days • 34 - year - old Italian has won one grand prix at Monaco in 2004
Jarno Trulli , the Italian driver who scored his sole Formula One victory at Monaco in 2004 at the wheel of a Renault , is expected to be named within the next few days as the number one driver for the re-emergent Lotus team .
Lotus team principal , Tony Fernandes , the Malaysian aviation tycoon who founded the budget airline AirAsia , last week hinted that Trulli was " definitely on the list " of preferred drivers and it now appears that the 34 - year - old from Pescara is poised to finalise a contract to drive the new Cosworth - engined machine next year .
If so , Trulli will be picking up the threads of a long - established partnership with Mike Gascoyne , the former Renault and Toyota technical director who has been appointed to the same role with Lotus .
After the 9/11 attacks , members of Congress set aside bitter , partisan disputes – at least for a season – in a show of unity and resolve on the steps of the US Capitol .
They linked arms .
They sang God Bless America .
Democrats pledged support to the President Bush , a Republican .
Much of the post - 9/11 reform agenda in this previously gridlocked Congress passed with unanimity .
But the Christmas attack on Northwest Flight 253 has produced no such bipartisan moment .
Instead , it ’s amplified the partisan sniping on Capitol Hill on issues ranging from national security policy to end - of - year fundraising .
After losing bids to block healthcare legislation , Republicans are seeking traction on national security .
“ Anything that forces the focus of attention on security issues naturally favors the Republicans , ” says GOP pollster Whit Ayres .
Flight 253 and fundraising
With hours to go on closing the books on fundraising for 2009 , GOP campaign committees in both the House and Senate are using Flight 253 as a reason for supporters to refill party coffers by Thursday midnight .
President Obama ’s post - inaugural reference to " man-made disasters , ” instead of terrorist acts , " showed a remarkable lack of understanding of the threat America faced , but in the face of what nearly happened a couple days [ ago ] , it is even more infuriating , ” wrote National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer in a fundraising appeal on Wednesday .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R ) of Michigan , the top Republican on the House intelligence committee , riled Democrats by a reference to “ the Obama / Pelosi efforts to weaken our security ” in a fundraising letter in his campaign for governor .
“ It ’s sickening to see the Republican leadership has decided to exploit the attempted terrorist attack on Americans for crass political purposes , ” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D ) of Maryland , who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ The Obama administration has been far more aggressive against Al Qaeda in the years since it has taken office than the Bush administration was since they took their eye off Al Qaeda and focused attention and resources on Iraq , ” he added .
In Michigan , GOP primary rival Rick Snyder today called on Hoekstra to return any funds raised from that appeal .
“ Congressman Hoekstra crossed the line by using terrorism as a fundraising tool , ” he wrote .
Hearings ahead
Three congressional panels have already announced hearings on US when Congress returns next month .
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for a closer look at protocols and procedures that allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to board Flight 253 allegedly with high explosives .
“ We should see what existing procedures have broken down , ” says Rep. Thaddeus McCotter ( R ) of Michigan in an interview .
“ We should n’t add to the crisis atmosphere . ”

( CNN ) --
In the shimmering fantasy realm of the hit movie " Avatar , " a paraplegic Marine leaves his wheelchair behind and finds his feet in a new virtual world thanks to " the link , " a sophisticated chamber that connects his brain to a surrogate alien , via computer .
This type of interface is a classic tool in gee - whiz science fiction .
But the hard science behind it is even more wow - inducing .
Researchers are already using brain - computer interfaces to aid the disabled , treat diseases like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's , and provide therapy for depression and post - traumatic stress disorder .
Work is under way on devices that may eventually let you communicate with friends telepathically , give you superhuman hearing and vision or even let you download data directly into your brain , a la " The Matrix . "
Researchers are practically giddy over the prospects .
" We do n't know what the limits are yet , " says Melody Moore Jackson , director of Georgia Tech University 's BrainLab .
Adds Emory University neuroscience professor Michael Crutcher , " Anything can happen . "
At the root of all this technology is the 3 - pound generator we all carry in our head .
It produces electricity at the microvolt level .
But the signals are strong enough to move robots , wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs -- with the help of an external processor .
Harnessing that power " opens up a whole new paradigm for us as human beings , " says neuroscientist Rajesh Rao of the University of Washington .
Brain - computer interfaces ( BCI ) come in two varieties .
Noninvasive techniques use electrodes placed on the scalp to measure electrical activity .
Invasive procedures implant electrodes directly into the brain .
In both cases , the devices interact with a computer to produce a wide variety of applications , ranging from medical breakthroughs and military - tech advances to futuristic video games and toys .
Much of the research focuses on neuroprosthetics , which offer a way for the brain to compensate for injuries and illness .
Jackson helped develop an intelligent wheelchair called the Aware Chair , which can be guided by neural activity .
She is also working on communication programs for people who have been paralyzed by strokes or spinal - cord injuries .
Implanted electrodes allow " locked in " patients to spell out messages by manipulating a computer cursor with their thoughts alone .
Rao is tapping into that same concept to help paralyzed people manipulate robots to fetch items or move things around the house .
With cameras to provide visual feedback , the patients and robots do n't even need to be in the same room , or the same city .
Rao says the technology " frees the mind from the constraints of the body . "
Cochlear implants are the most common neuroprosthetic .
They help the brain interpret sounds and are sometimes called " bionic ears " for the deaf .
Other researchers are looking for similar ways to help blind people see .
Neurobiologist Ed Boyden of MIT says miniature optical devices can be implanted to convert photoreceptors into workable cameras for the brain .
None of this comes cheap .
Most research is funded by deep pockets such as the National Institutes of Health , the defense department and NASA .
But every breakthrough brings the most advanced BCI technologies closer to the mass market .
Jackson says she foresees a day when people with disabilities can spend a few hundred dollars instead of $ 20,000 on a workable system .
Mainstreaming the technology raises some troubling issues for Crutcher , who teaches a course at Emory in neuro - ethics .
He fears that expensive eye and ear implants could produce a computer - enhanced elite .
" If only the rich can afford it , it puts everyone else at a disadvantage , " says Crutcher , who believes many aspects of BCI are ripe for abuse .
Just the idea of mucking about with a person 's brain " raises questions about safety and efficacy , " he says .
One of the more controversial uses under development is telepathy .
It would require at least two people to be implanted with electrodes that send and receive signals back and forth .
DARPA , the Pentagon 's technology research division , is currently working on an initiative called " Silent Talk , " which would let soldiers on secret missions communicate with their thoughts alone .
This stealth component is attractive , but naysayers fear that such soldiers could become manipulated for evil means .
Telepathy implants wo n't replace Facebook and Twitter anytime soon , but that possibility is problematic as well .
" You can imagine communicating with your friends through the devices , and that opens up a lot of ethical issues , " Rao says .
Would you want your friends and family to know everything you are thinking ?
Would little white lies become obsolete ?
These questions of morality and liability are not a huge factor for the toy makers and video game developers who are already bringing the most basic BCI technology to consumers .
Games like Mindflex and the Star Wars Force Trainer use headsets with simple electrodes to monitor levels of concentration and relaxation .
The signals trigger a fan that can move a ball up or down , depending on how hard you 're thinking .
Jackson calls it a " fascinating application of a very sophisticated technology in a very cheap package . "
The headsets used in both games were designed by the California company Neurosky .
Its corporate partners are working on games that help Alzheimer 's patients improve memory techniques , teach concentration skills to kids with ADHD and let stressed - out CEOs work on relaxing .
Software entrepreneurs and executives are streaming into Boyden 's neuro - ventures class at MIT , looking for ways to capitalize on the array of potential uses for brain - computer interfaces .
Some ventures are already up and running .
NeuroVigil in California is working on iBrain , designed , in part , to help provide instant feedback to drivers who start falling asleep at the wheel .
Eos Neuroscience is developing light - sensitive protein - based sensors that can treat blindness .
Numerous companies are developing video games based on direct brain - computer interfacing .
Neurosky sells a wireless headset that connects to any computer for a series of brain - training games .
NeuroBoy lets you set targets on fire just by concentrating on them .
Relax , and your character levitates .
Another application lets you see a colorful visualization of your brain - wave activity .
Boyden expects to see many more such products hitting shelves sooner rather than later .
He says the possibilities are endless if just a " fraction of the business leaders " taking his class start " bringing the technology into the world . "
Jackson , of Georgia Tech , agrees : " Nothing is out of the realm of possibility . "
Named one of the Best Novels of 2009 by the " Wall Street Journal " Marcela Valdes , " The Washington Post " A haunting , deadpan tale set vaguely in the Scandinavian future Holmqvist s spare prose interweaves the Unit s pleasures and cruelties with exquisite matter - of - factness [ Holmqvist ] turns the screw , presenting a set of events so miraculous and abominable that they literally made me gasp .
Jessa Crispin , NPR.orgEchoing work by Marge Piercy and Margaret Atwood , " The Unit " is as thought - provoking as it is compulsively readable .
" The New Yorker "
This haunting first novel imagines a nation in which men and women who haven t had children by a certain age are taken to a reserve bank unit for biological material and subjected to various physical and psychological experiments , while waiting to have their organs harvested for needed citizens in the outside world Holmqvist evocatively details the experiences of a woman who falls in love with another resident , and at least momentarily attempts to escape her fate .
" Psychiatric Services " Eerie , chilling , yet almost plausible Holmqvist gives us a lesson in human nature and social engineering through a story that is spare , compelling , and all too human .
" TimeOut ChicagoHolmqvist handles her dystopia with muted , subtle care ... Neither satirical nor polemical , " The Unit " manages to express a fair degree of moral outrage without ever moralizing it has enough spooks to make it a feminist , philosophical page - turner .
Tim Gebhart , Blogcritics.org
" The Unit " raises issues of love , gender , freedom , and social mores through the perspective of how we assess an individual 's contribution to society Holmqvist 's ability to invest the reader in both the story and the characters is exceptional .
It is a book you hesitate to put down .
In fact , I consumed it in the space of a couple separate sittings in less than a day the book is reminiscent of Margaret Atwood 's " The Handmaid 's Tale . "
Yet to classify or judge it as a feminist work alone is unfair .
It certainly surpasses Kazuo Ishiguro 's widely praised " Never Let Me Go " Hopefully , the fact this is a translated work and tends to be billed as feminist literature will not adversely affect the book 's ability to make it to bookstore shelves .
" The Unit " deserves a wide readership .
Kelly Fitzpatrick , " The Orlando Sentinel This is one of the best books I ve read over the past two years ... Thought - provoking and emotionally - moving , The Unit is a book you ll be discussing with others long after you re done reading it .
" Booklist "
" Chilling stunning Holmqvist s fluid , mesmerizing novel offers unnerving commentary on the way society devalues artistic creation while elevating procreation , and speculation on what it would be like if that was taken to an extreme .
For Orwell and Huxley fans . "
" More Magazine "
" Like Margaret Atwood s The Handmaid s Tale , this novel imagines a chilling dystopia : single , childless , midlife women are considered dispensable .
At 50 the narrator , Dorrit , is taken to a facility where non-vital organs will be harvested one by one for people more valued by society ; she knows that eventually she ll have to sacrifice something essential like her heart .
Dorrit accepts her fate until she falls in love and finds herself breaking the rules . "
Confessions of an Idiosyncratic Mind
Holmqvist s marvelous book doesn t browbeat her thesis into the reader and smartly expands her ideas to look at the plight of all marginalized folk , women and men alike , and how the promise of comforts can be the most horrifying of all .
Prepare to be disturbed , but prepare further to think about the ramifications .
" Kirkus Reviews
"
" Pricey shops that require no money .
Gardens that trump Monet s. Creature comforts galore .
But Swedish ace Holmqvist s English - language debut soon discloses a catch .
The shelf - life for inhabitants of this paradise is about six years .
This is the Second Reserve Bank Unit , into which the State herds women 50 and up , and men 60 and over , to use for biological material .
They re fattened like calves , but there s civic - duty payback : mandatory organ donation , culminating in the final gift of their lungs and hearts .
Big Brother doesn t take every oldster , just those termed dispensables : the cash - strapped , underachieving or , worst of all , childless .
Dorrit Weger , freelance writer , dog - lover and free sprit , is initially mesmerized by her new surroundings .
She feels a sense of community , a closeness never offered by Nils , the inadequate lover who would never leave his wife .
And she takes pride in being needed when she s enlisted in one of the Unit s many medical experiments .
It s a benign investigation into the effects of exercise , but in the cafeteria and on the lush grounds Dorrit soon notices other campers sleepwalking like zombies or displaying weirdly blotched skin .
As her roommates are ushered off one by one to their final donations , she panics into the arms of Johannes , a fellow Unit resident who actually manages to impregnate her .
Dazzled by upcoming motherhood , Dorrit is certain her bulging belly will gain her freedom .
Proven at last productive , she s bound to be rewarded by the State .isn t she ?
In her first novel , short - story writer Holmqvist echoes political - science treatises like Hobbes Leviathan and Rousseau s The Social Contract ( gone decidedly mad here ) , as well as the usual dystopian novels from Brave New World to 1984 .
Orwellian horrors in a Xanadu on Xanax creepily profound and most provocative . "

A haunting , deadpan tale set vaguely in the Scandinavian future Holmqvist s spare prose interweaves the Unit s pleasures and cruelties with exquisite matter - of - factness [ Holmqvist ] turns the screw , presenting a set of events so miraculous and abominable that they literally made me gasp .
Jessa Crispin , NPR.org
Echoing work by Marge Piercy and Margaret Atwood , The Unit is as thought - provoking as it is compulsively readable .
The New Yorker
This haunting first novel imagines a nation in which men and women who haven t had children by a certain age are taken to a reserve bank unit for biological material and subjected to various physical and psychological experiments , while waiting to have their organs harvested for needed citizens in the outside world Holmqvist evocatively details the experiences of a woman who falls in love with another resident , and at least momentarily attempts to escape her fate .
Psychiatric Services
Eerie , chilling , yet almost plausible Holmqvist gives us a lesson in human nature and social engineering through a story that is spare , compelling , and all too human .
TimeOut Chicago
Holmqvist handles her dystopia with muted , subtle care ... Neither satirical nor polemical , The Unit manages to express a fair degree of moral outrage without ever moralizing it has enough spooks to make it a feminist , philosophical page - turner .
Tim Gebhart , Blogcritics.org
The Unit raises issues of love , gender , freedom , and social mores through the perspective of how we assess an individual 's contribution to society Holmqvist 's ability to invest the reader in both the story and the characters is exceptional .
It is a book you hesitate to put down .
In fact , I consumed it in the space of a couple separate sittings in less than a day the book is reminiscent of Margaret Atwood 's The Handmaid 's Tale .
Yet to classify or judge it as a feminist work alone is unfair .
It certainly surpasses Kazuo Ishiguro 's widely praised Never Let Me Go Hopefully , the fact this is a translated work and tends to be billed as feminist literature will not adversely affect the book 's ability to make it to bookstore shelves .
The Unit deserves a wide readership .
Kelly Fitzpatrick , The Orlando Sentinel
This is one of the best books I ve read over the past two years ... Thought - provoking and emotionally - moving , The Unit is a book you ll be discussing with others long after you re done reading it .

Confessions of an Idiosyncratic Mind
Holmqvist s marvelous book doesn t browbeat her thesis into the reader and smartly expands her ideas to look at the plight of all marginalized folk , women and men alike , and how the promise of comforts can be the most horrifying of all .
Prepare to be disturbed , but prepare further to think about the ramifications .

In her first novel , short - story writer Holmqvist echoes political - science treatises like Hobbes Leviathan and Rousseau s The Social Contract ( gone decidedly mad here ) , as well as the usual dystopian novels from Brave New World to 1984 .
Orwellian horrors in a Xanadu on Xanax creepily profound and most provocative . "

One of the great ironies of the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago is that the East German protest leaders who led the uprising did not want unification with West Germany .
It ’s important on this anniversary to distinguish between two entirely different events : first , the fall of the Berlin Wall , on November 9 , 1989 ; and then German unification , on October 3 , 1990 .
Americans often conflate the two into one process .
But for Germans and those who were there , it ’s a much more complicated story .
The fall of the Berlin Wall became a poisoned memory for a certain set of Easterners , thanks to the events that followed that event .
The movement to overthrow the totalitarian regime in East Germany and tear down the wall was led by a relatively small number of activists and rejectionists whose aim was n’t unification , but rather an independent , free , idealistic socialist East Germany .
These people were very different from the institutional opposition that had success elsewhere in the East Bloc , which arose after Gorbachev eased Soviet pressure and allowed a kind of top - down reform in places like Hungary and Poland .
But in East Germany , the government was too hardline and unwilling to reform , so opposition arose from underground operators .
The groups that got the ball rolling for the mass street protests that eventually convinced the ruling SED party to depose dictator Erich Honecker , install the more moderate Egon Krenz , and liberalize travel restrictions , largely operated from under the protective umbrella of the Lutheran church , which enjoyed special status in East Germany .
These groups included human rights activists , environmental activists , peace activists , and underground artists and musicians–in other words , they were secular , but they still took refuge in the churches .
Much of the church leadership itself was also heavily involved in the opposition .
Most of these people , the ones who did the legwork to bring down the wall , often paying a dear personal price , were too leftwing and idealistic for those Americans who were looking for self - affirmation in Germany ’s revolution .
They were n’t protesting for McDonald ’s and Western pop music ( not even David Hasselhoff ’s “ Looking for Freedom ” ) , and they sure as hell were n’t inspired by Ronald Reagan .
But our inability to distinguish the fall of the Berlin Wall from Germany ’s unification means this awkward twist is lost in American coverage anyway .
Take Thomas Friedman writing about the fall of the wall a few weeks ago , celebrates a Dunkin Donuts branch at the Brandenburg Gate , which served as the backdrop for some of the most stirring images from November 9th : “ Normally , I am horrified by American fast food brands near iconic sites , but in the case of this once open sore between East and West , I find it something of a balm .
The war over Europe is indeed over .
People power won .
We can stand down–pass the doughnuts . ”
Unfortunately for Friedman , the hamburgers - and - Hasselhoff set had fuck all to do with the fall of the wall .
They did , however , bring about unification , much to the chagrin of the folks who facilitated the breach .
The people who brought down the wall at the risk of being beaten , jailed , fired , sent off to military service , or expatriated lost control of the process as soon as the stakes for participation dropped to nil .
At that point–and it was only days after the fall of the wall –the chant in the streets of the GDR changed from “ we are the people ” to “ we are one people . ”
It also turned out that many of the East German church leaders who had harbored the hardcore rejectionists and activists did not share their vision for post - wall East Germany , and quickly struck alliances with the West German Christian Democrats , Helmut Kohl ’s right - of - center pro-unification party .
Kohl ’s party funded an Eastern sister party and literally passed out bananas to woo Eastern voters .
In hindsight , it ’s often seen as inevitable that the two Germanys would reunite .
But this , too , is a somewhat revisionist view .
The territories that made up East and West Germany had previously been properly united for only a relatively brief period , from 1871 to 1945 , from Kaiser Wilhelm ’s consolidation following the Franco - Prussian War until the dissolution of Germany after World War II .
( Nobody would advocate a Germany based on the Holy Roman Empire , another period when the two Germanys were under common rule - along with Switzerland , Austria , the Czech Republic , Holland , Belgium , Slovenia , and parts of Poland , France , and Italy . )
The southern border of East Germany - with Bavaria - was also a religious fault line , with the Oktoberfest state traditionally Catholic and the GDR ’s Thuringia mostly Protestant from a few years after the Reformation .
So again , on the face of it , there was no overriding logical necessity for reunion .
Look at it this way :
When Canada gained independence from Britain in 1931 , nobody thought it inevitable that the US and Canada–nations that share a 3000 - mile border , virtually integrated economies , a common language , and a common origin as British colonies –would unite .
Nevertheless , the 1990 election that determined East Germany ’s path forward was indeed won with promises of BMWs and bananas ( which , incidentally , is n’t the same as Dodges and doughnuts ) , as the reactionary hamburgers - and - Hasselhoff voters carried the day .
But this is the ugly part of the story - the part where money buys elections , the part where shrill sloganeering drowns out nuanced discussion , the part where an abstract pleasant - sounding goal beats any platform detailing the nuts and bolts of how to get there .
In short , the election that led to unification was rife with exactly the sorts of things we bemoan in our own country , but with unimaginably high stakes : the continued existence of the voters ’ country .
It is a great disservice to the brave East Germans who brought down the wall to confuse its fall with unification and to see , for instance , the proliferation of American fast food joints at the Brandenburg Gate as somehow fitting tribute to the events of November 9 .
Doing so allows the perpetuation of some of the biggest lies we–we , as in Americans–tell ourselves .
These lies - about the motivation of the people who brought down the wall , about the inevitability of their embrace of the West , about rock and roll and Coca Cola and fucking doughnuts - are so insidious because they inform our ideas about freedom and the ostensible US role in spreading it .
Nothing could be more ignorant and ahistorical –except perhaps crediting Reagan , which much of the rest of the US media was busy doing this week .
Tim Mohr writes for the Daily Beast and the Huffington Post .
Obama goes back to his Wall Street - bashing rhetoric in today 's 60 Minutes on CBS , after he has already doomed this country to tens of trillions in excess debt to make sure that Wall Street not only thrives , but prospers , courtesy of Bernanke 's vertical bond curve and the daily destruction of the dollar .
With statements such as " I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street " which the WSJ disclosed will be uttered by Obama shortly , only the most clueless viewers will find empathy with Obama 's latest message of banker " anti-hope . "
And it is not only Obama , but Wall Street protege Larry Summer himself who continues the banker bashing :
White House economic adviser Larry Summers also voiced aggravation with Wall Street on Sunday .
" Here is what I think they do n't get …
It was their irresponsible risk - taking in many cases that brought the economy to collapse , " Mr. Summers , who chairs the National Economic Council , said on CNN's " State of the Union . "
" And they do n't get in some cases that they would n't be where they are today , and they certainly would not be paying the bonuses they are paying today , if their government had n't taken extraordinary actions . "
" For them to be complaining about serious regulation directed at making sure this never happens again is wrong .
For $ 300 million to be spent on lobbyists trying to gut serious efforts at financial reform is not how this country should be operating , " Mr. Summers said .
" For firms that have benefited from taxpayer support to be complaining about the government burdening them is , frankly , a bit rich . "
First you bail them out , and now you bash them ?
It is one thing to dash criticism upon rhetoric but at least be consistent .
If people can not read between the lines of this administration 's endless hypocrisy , they deserve all they get .
And if Matt Taibbi's latest controversial piece in Rolling Stone " Obama 's Big Sellout " needed any final validation , you just provided it Mr. President .
Because while your Wall Street - centric policies can be explained by your lack of financial comprehension and private - sector experience ( thereby justifying your desire to be " advised " by those who are an integral part of the banker syndicate ) , your complete disdain for the average American 's intellectual level exemplified by your most recent , upcoming 7 pm TV appearance is what is truly insulting .
Maybe you can put Mr. Geithner up there next to you on the TV screen , and he can justify his reasoning for why incremental " fat cat " bonuses are such a bad idea .
Come to think of it , why not make it into a round table , and include Larry Summer and Robert Rubin : we are confident they will have no problem distancing themselves from the very bankers they talk to 10 hours a day , telling them ( and thus you ) how to run national policy .
You say " Some people on Wall Street still do n't get it " ...
The problem , Mr. President , is that more and more people on Main Street , do get it .
They now realize just whose agenda you have at heart .
And said Main Street expects nothing but merely more theatrics during your upcoming meeting with Wall Street " fat cats " tomorrow .

Google touts its new , free , Public DNS service as a speedier , safer version for accessing the Web .
There 's some truth to Google 's claims , and its speed advantage may be compounded when a site your browser loads has to access several different URLs to load all of its content .
dns is the switchboard of the internet : type in a text url like www.pcmag.com , and it finds the numeric ip address to get you there .
google , which seems to be releasing something in just about every consumer - facing software space , has now entered this behind the scenes networking space with its .
i set up a couple of pcs using google public dns , both inside and outside of our corporate network , to see if there was any real advantages to using google 's dns servers .
the results were mixed , although google dns did offer some benefits that neither your default dns server or competitor opendns do .
why google dns ?
when i saw that google had begun offering a free public dns service , i had two thoughts : one , that google wanted to thwart isps ' common practice of intercepting mistyped urls with a page of ads ; and two , that google intended to gather still more and more data on the internet usage habits of the world 's users .
google has , claiming only to store data tied to particular users for a short time , and only anonymized , aggregated data on a permanent basis .
the benefits of using this dns service , according to google , are speed and security , with a minor benefit of avoiding the redirection alluded to above .
the company 's blog post claims that it provisions its dns servers more robustly , making them resistant to dos attacks ; provides better cache and server load - balancing ; and uses geographically distributed servers .
the last really wo n't be an advantage over an isp 's own dns servers , but will over other public servers .
your isp 's location will most likely be physically closer to you than the google server .
to address security threats , google has implemented a few strategies , such as validity checking , adding entropy to requests through randomization , and rate - limiting queries to prevent crippling denial - of - service attacks .
unlike the other big public dns server , opendns , google does n't filter phishing sites and block the domains of known malware - distributing sites .
( the last feature is only in the paid version of opendns . ) also lets you specify sites to block , and lets you create url shortcuts and can correct address typos .
i set up a couple of machines , both inside and outside our corporate network , to see if there was any real advantages to using google 's dns servers .
i'll take you through the setup and run some speed tests to see whether the new service lives up to its claims of a faster web experience .
setting up the google dns service on your computer
google 's page on the public dns service gives instructions on how to implement this service , but there are a couple of key considerations to keep in mind .
you should change the dns entry on your router , rather than the pc , if you 're using a router .
that way , any machines you add to your local network will use your chosen dns server .
on one test setup , i found that setting the dns server on the pc did n't actually change the mistyped - url site behavior , while changing it on the router did .
second , you should n't use this for your work pc , because it could interrupt or slow down your network access , as it did for me , at least temporarily .
it also took down my outlook / exchange e-mail .
and nothing is as fast as an on - site dns server , which most companies use .
note too , that google 's dns does n't work for internet protocol version 6 , which even google admits as being a key to the growth of the internet .
to set up your system to use google dns , the best way is to adjust your router 's dns settings .
type in your router 's ip address .
( if you do n't know it , one way is to enter a command line prompt from windows , then type " ipconfig " and look at the ip address for the router . ) you 'll need to enter your router 's username and password .
then , hunt down the dns screen , as our slideshow indicates .
be sure and note your existing dns settings , and write them down .
then enter 8.8.8.8 as the preferred dns server and 8.8.4.4 as the alternate dns server .
your router will probably need to reboot , which will sever your internet connection momentarily .
if it does n't connect , restore your old dns addresses you copied down .
( another method you can use in windows 7 and vista : open the control panel , choose network and internet , then network and sharing , then " change adapter settings " on the left panel in windows 7 or " manage network connections " in vista .
in xp , just go to control panel | network connections .
find your network adapter in the resulting dialog , right - click it , and choose properties .
in this dialog , highlight internet protocol version 4 , and click the properties button .
in the bottom half of this dialog , click the " use the following dns server " button , and enter 8.8.8.8 as the preferred dns server and 8.8.4.4 as the alternate dns server . )
i was pleased to see that changing your dns server to google 's did n't redirect to search results when i typed a nonexistent url .
to test this , try typing a nonsense address like " www.adfdfsiuio.com " and see if your isp hijacks the bad url to its own search results .
some browsers will display a page from the default search provider : in internet explorer , i got a bing " not found " page and in chrome i got a page suggesting i search with google , but in firefox , i got a simple " server not found " error : the correct result !
is google dns faster ?
google claims that its dns service is faster than others , so i tested by running the nslookup command at the command line in a simple batch file that also displays start and finish times to see how long it takes to complete using a specified dns server 's address .
i tested on a pc located in new york city using verizon as the isp .
the differences are in tenths and hundredths of a second , but over the course of a day's web surfing , that can add up , especially for sites that require multiple dns lookups .
i noticed that more obscure sites , such as www.atomische.com, took longer than popular sites on the first trysince the dns server being used would have to fetch the ip address from another authoritative server the first time , and after that , my chosen dns server would usually have cached the address , making subsequent lookups much quicker .
strangely , after this first lookup , the more obscure sites actually were faster than the popular ones .
here are my results :
regular isp connected machine ( seconds to url lookup )
another way to check speed is to use fastnext .
com 's dns timing test .
i tested this with my three dns server on several sites as well , and the differences were even less significant than my test with nslookup :
fastnext ( ms ) google isp opendns radiouslerand.com 91 91 90 races.com 90 94 91 adobe.com 86 82 80 blippr.com 81 79 80 cooliris.com 61 58 58 purpletrail.com 45 45 45 average 75.67 74.83 74.00
i can't imagine the vast majority of users will bother changing their dns settings , or even know what they areunless of course they 're peeved by their isp hijacking " not found " pages with unwanted search results .
that 's one nice , if minor , benefit of google dns .
as far as the privacy of your surfing habits goes , either you trust that google is doing what it says it is or you do n't .
overall , i do n't see speed as a reason to switch to google dns , as local isp dns servers will usually be adequate , and opendns is marginally faster than either .
still , if you 're given to tweaking your computer and suspect that you 're not getting all the speed you could ( and who does n't , sometimes ) you might want to point to a different dns server .
personally , i'd recommend opendns , based on my tests .
if you do change dns servers , let us know about your experiences in the comments section of this story .
i Phone developer ?
Had your app rejected for unfathomable reasons by Apple ?
Hey , there 's an app - well , actually a website , though we'd have thought it 's a logical next step to make it an app - for that .
The site you 're looking for is apprejections.com , set up by British iPhone app developer Adam White who describes himself as " games developer specialising in online games ... usually at a senior level " .
( Oh look , we interviewed him on the Gamesblog in 2007 . )
Anyhow , he feels that Apple " has a secret , undocumented , unquestionable , random process for deciding which applications to ' allow ' onto the deck . "
The rejection of Google Voice did change things , by prompting an FCC investigation into Apple 's business processes for app approval .
That , though , meant that " the invisible submission process changed radically shortly after - and in particular the number of truly ' unfair ' rejections soared , " Martin asserts .
I 'm not sure if that is correct ; even though we 've written about Apple banning Macworld 's ebook that had the word " iPhone " in the title , and appearing to delay the 0870 app , there 's a fairly clear list of things that get you banned .
Using private APIs , that sort of thing .
In fact I wrote back in July about a Tumblr blog that was collecting feedback on precisely this : the Application Submission Feedback blog , which seems to be up - to - date ( there are n't dates , but the latest recorded feedback is recent ) .
Perhaps the two could somehow figure out a way to collaborate so that the " mysterious " rejections can be logged against topics in the App Submission Feedback blog ?
It might be a plan .
( If you 've had your app rejected from the App Store , then tell Adam Martin on Twitter .
And tell us , of course . )
In the meantime , we sincerely hope that someone will turn the App Store Rejection site into an app .
We 'd love to know if that will then be accepted or rejected , and whether that would be like Russell 's Paradox - which is whether a book that lists all the books that do not list themselves should list itself ( or who shaves the barber who shaves everyone who does n't shave themself - though that 's easy : hire a female barber ) .
Should an app that lists rejections be rejected ?
Only time will tell .
Bioware 's Dragon Age : Origins promises to be the most exciting new computer RPG release of the year .
But Dragon
Age is n't just coming to computers and consoles :
It 's a tabletop RPG as well .
We sat down with Chris Pramas , the designer of the upcoming pen-and - paper version of Dragon Age by Green Ronin Publishing , and talked tabletop .
How long have you been doing tabletop games , Chris ?
I 've been working in the hobby game industry since 1993 .
I have worked on many RPGs over the years , from the Whispering Vault to Dungeons & Dragons , and I designed games like Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2nd edition , V for Victory , and Dragon Fist .
Today I 'm the president of Green Ronin Publishing , which will be celebrating its 10th anniversary next year .
And Green Ronin is , arguably , the most successful new entrant into the tabletop roleplaying game industry since White Wolf .
You 've published Freeport , True20 , and Mutants & Masterminds , and secured two very sexy licenses , A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying and Dragon Age RPG , at a time when even long - established companies have been on the decline .
Any advice for readers interested in entering the tabletop gaming industry ?
If you have the passion , just go for it .
The industry has changed a lot since I got into it , largely as a result of technological innovation .
It 's much easier to get your own company going than it used to be because you can start publishing electronically with little more than a copy of Adobe Acrobat .
When I started my first company , you could n't do an economical print run of under 1,000 books and then you had to get your stuff into distribution if you wanted anyone outside con attendees to see it .
Now print on demand technology is such that you can take your PDFs and make nice looking printed versions in small numbers with little risk .
You can sell those books and the PDFs direct to consumers or through sites like RPGNow and Lulu .
So if you are willing to do the work , you can get your own company going .
Then concentrate on putting out quality material and building a reputation for it .
So many of the opportunities that have come along for Green Ronin have followed from that .
Speaking of opportunity , tell us a bit about how you secured the Dragon Age RPG license and what we can expect from the game .
It was pretty simple .
BioWare came to us and said , " How 'd you like to do a tabletop RPG based on our upcoming Dragon Age : Origins game ? "
I had enjoyed the hell out of games like Baldur 's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic , so of course we said yes .
The computer game has been described as BioWare getting back to its roots , and I think they saw having a tie - in tabletop RPG as a way of reinforcing the " old school " feel of the property .
I had been doing a lot of thinking about the roots of RPGs and how the games have changed over the years , and I had started writing notes on a theoretical class and level fantasy game based on my analysis .
It was really just a thought exercise that I did n't expect to actually make into a game .
When the Dragon Age project came along though , I realized that a lot of my ideas would work perfectly .
So instead of using one of Green Ronin 's existing systems like True20 or A Song of Ice and Fire , I thought we should create something new and that I would do the game myself .
Let iit Snow December 25 , 2009
Posted by Patrick in Muzak Tags : andrew wyatt
[ Originally published in flashback ‘s December 2009 issue ]
First , let ’s get one thing straight .
Miike
Snow is not one musician , it ’s actually a group of three .
And that misspelling of ‘ Mike ’ is no typo .
Yes , this is slightly confusing , and Pontus Winnberg , one third of the band , is well aware of this .
“ Yeah , we get that a lot and I guess it ’s our fault because we called the band Miike Snow .
We try to put it out there as much as possible .
It was kind of randomly picked , the name , but we also liked the fact that it could be anything – it could be a guy , a DJ , a band – whatever .
So I guess we just have to deal with that problem for a while . ”
The trio are made up of Swedish production duo , Pontus and Christian Karlsson , and American singer / songwriter Andrew Wyatt .
You might n’t know it but you ’ve almost definitely danced along to a song created by Pontus and Christian in the past .
Better known as production team Bloodshy & Avant , they are the brains behind well - known tracks like Britney Spears ’ Toxic and Christina Milian ’s AM to PM .
They ’ve also worked with artists like Kylie Minogue , Madonna and Sugababes .
But , at least for the foreseeable future , Miike Snow is the trio ’s priority .
“ It is definitely a full time thing for us .
It ’s probably going to stay that way , I mean we have shows booked until October next year and they keep coming , so I do n’t think we ’ll have time to do anything else but this . ”
A full - time band may not have been in the grand plan for the production duo , but after meeting Andrew , their priorities changed .
“ I guess it was just the timing and the fact that we met Andrew .
When we met Andrew we cleared our schedule .
We had n’t done it earlier because we had n’t really cancelled everything in our schedule because it takes up a lot of time . ”
The band have enjoyed exposure with two tracks from their debut featured on trendy television show Gossip Girl , which has opened them up to a wider audience .
While Pontus says they ’re grateful for the exposure , he ’d rather people had a more complete view of the band .
“ I guess the ideal way for us to get to people would be through live shows .
I think that that shows another side of us , it ’s more like a complete picture with that and the CD .
But without the live show it does n’t really show the whole spectrum . ”
And indeed , in the short time that the band have been together , they ’ve become known for creating this live ‘ experience ’ that includes tracks from their debut self - titled album , but also incorporating a sense of spontaneity into the mix .
“ We ’ve been touring off and on since June and I still feel like we ’re in a development stage of the live show and the live sound .
I think that the whole live experience has been influencing us a lot , so I think that will definitely play a bigger role in creating the new album .
Whatever that means , we do n’t really know yet .
We ’ve been talking about it , but I think that it will probably be slightly more ambitious when it comes to creating sounds . ”
Last month , the band played their first Irish gig as part of Heineken ’s series of Green Spheres concerts .
The concert was n’t in the country ’s capital however , but rather in the Dinn Ri entertainment complex in Carlow ( read our review here ) .
While this gig was a great success for the group , things have n’t always gone so smoothly .
“ Our first show , it was n’t a disaster , but it was still at a very experimental stage , so it was too many gadgets and not enough thought put into it .
We pulled it off but it was extremely stressful . ”
Since then , they ’ve had the chance to travel around the globe , with highs and lows and a few surprises thrown in along the way .
“ The biggest surprise so far , in a good way , was probably when we played in Mexico City a couple of weeks ago .
It was just a fantastic night and I really want to go back there .
We did a really good show and it was fun .
That was probably the highest point .
We had n’t really thought about where we have a following or whether we have a following .
In North America it ’s been growing and now it ’s on a pretty nice level .
But then just by accident , I do n’t know why but we got a request from a promoter in Mexico City . ”
Adding to the sense of mystery around the strangely named band is the fact that they wear masks in photoshoots and during live shows .
“ It ’s kind of , we just came up with it as a fun thing , and also it ’s much easier to make photoshoots when we can wear masks . ”
The group ’s symbol is what appears to be a rabbit with antlers attached , and indeed appears as the cover of their first album .
While Pontus says it has no specific meaning to the band , it turned out that they were not the first to come up with this strange creature .
“ We asked Christian ’s tattoo artist to come up with something and we told her that we wanted something with antlers .
And then she came back with a rabbit with antlers .
And when Andrew saw it he was like , ‘ That ’s a jackal . ’
We did n’t know what it was and apparently it ’s a mystical creature from Wyoming , kind of like the Yeti , and he scares the kids .
Even small towns there have the jackal up in their symbols .
It was a pretty funny coincidence . ”
With two - thirds of the group hailing from Sweden and the lead singer from the US , the group draw influences from both of these countries and Pontus says the mash - up of cultures probably has an effect on their music .
“ All of us have kind of travelled for years , so we have kind of a more international way of communicating , but there is always a degree of where you belong , and what your values are and so forth .
It ’s hard to pinpoint , but whatever it is , it feels like it ’s a positive thing , just makes our lives a little bit more interesting . ”
The band ’s music videos are quite high - concept , their video for previous single Black & Blue ( see end of post ) features an old man making music in his apartment , encountering the band along the way .
Pontus says the band have quite a strong influence on the direction their videos take .
“ It ’s kind of like we bounce ideas back and forth and it usually starts off with us saying like in very big terms , we want it to have this vibe .
When we talked about the Black & Blue video we wanted to have someone having a lead role in it and then that we did n’t really want to be in it , but then they put us in there anyway as a small kind of part . ”
Although ending up in Miike Snow might have happened by chance , it ’s not as if Pontus stumbled into music by accident .
He says that it has long been a passion of his , and from an early age he was surrounded by it .
“ My dad was a music teacher and we always had a bunch of instruments at home so , to me it ’s come very naturally .
I have n’t even thought about anything else to do . ”
If music had n’t worked out for him , however , maybe a career working on the high seas would have beckoned .
“ I guess maybe it would probably have something to do with working on a boat or something , because I really like the water .
I would probably take care of someone ’s sailboat or something – whatever that job is called . ”

CLEVELAND --
As businesses brace for the great unknowns that will come with the spread of H1N1 , retailers , shopping centers and restaurants are emphasizing the importance of hygiene .
" We 've just become more vigilant about cleanliness , reminding employees to wash their hands more often , and use hand sanitizer , " said Lawrence Shibley , president of Yours Truly Restaurants .
Each of the company 's eight restaurants has eight to 10 dispensers available for employees and customers .
" We 've also gotten a little more careful about packaging of food products .
We wash every item of produce that 's used .
Even if it 's being cooked , it 's still washed , " he added .
The H1N1 , spread primarily when an infected person sneezes or coughs , can survive on surfaces for up to two hours on cafeteria tables , desks and doorknobs .
Infected people can continue spreading the virus for seven days after they get sick .
Fighting the spread of H1N1 is , to use a football analogy , " all about the fundamentals of blocking and tackling , " said Jeff Heinen , co-president of Heinen 's Fine Foods .
" What that means for us is reaffirming our standard sanitation practices of hand washing , cough / sneeze control and work - station sanitation .
It also means carefully monitoring our associates ' health and making sure they do not report to work if they feel ill , and are sent home if they have any flulike symptoms .
" We believe the simple steps of frequent hand washing and proper coughing and sneezing etiquette will go a long way toward minimizing the risks , " he said .
" In addition , since we are better staffed than most , our managers and associates will not hesitate to make the appropriate decisions if someone should not be working . "
Aldi Inc. has a plan that will kick in if the World Health Organization advises additional precautions .
" As they raise the level of response , so will we , " said Thom Behtz , vice president of Aldi's Northern Ohio division in Hinckley .
" As things get worse , there 'll be more frequent cleaning . "
At Giant Eagle Inc. , " we continually stress the importance of proper team - member hygiene , as well as effective equipment , utensil and food - service sanitation , " said spokesman Dan Donovan .
" Ongoing training helps ensure that all team members are aware of the importance of their personal health and the appropriate ways in which they operate equipment and maintain store cleanliness . "
Ashtabula Towne Square has installed antibacterial stations throughout the mall and is trying to obtain doses of the H1N1 vaccine for a flu clinic .
Mall employees also have been told that if they 're not feeling well or look noticeably ill , " it 's mandatory that you go home , " said Michelle Lefkowitz , director of marketing .
" We do n't want anybody who 's sick working here . "
Westfield SouthPark mall in Strongsville carries alcohol wipes for parents who want to wipe down their strollers and disinfects the children 's play area near Sears twice a day .
The mall also has information on H1N1 from the Cleveland Clinic at its concierge desk near J.C. Penney , said marketing director Andy Selesnik .
Beachwood Place mall is following the Ohio Department of Health 's recommendations and plans to install more hand sanitizing stations throughout the mall , in addition to those in the mall restrooms and at the customer service desk , said Heidi Yanok , senior marketing manager .
At Cincinnati - based Macy's Inc. , the nation 's largest department store chain , " We communicate with our associates about the importance of hand washing and not coming in to work if they feel ill , " said spokesman Jim Sluzewski .
" We closely monitor the flu season and act accordingly . "
Through the 1980s , the Democrats struggled over abortion .
But by the 1990s , the share of Americans supportive of abortion rights had grown .
Democrats lost their majorities for 12 years , leaving the most liberal and pro-abortion rights members in office .
As a result it seemed to fade as a public issue .
Now , however , Democrats once again have a large and diverse
House majority , with more members from conservative - leaning districts where anti-abortion rights groups are active .
It was that division that played out behind the scenes late last week , and into the weekend , and came powerfully in the open as the issue .
Earlier Friday , Ms. Pelosi and her supporters thought they had a deal that would quiet the fight between abortion foes .
Representative Bart Stupak , Democrat of Michigan , an anti-abortion leader , said he thought so , too  until , that is , Ms. Pelosi called to tell him it was dead .
“ We had an agreement at 7:30 , 8 o’clock , ” said Mr. Stupak , who added that he had called nearly 40 other lawmakers favoring tighter abortion restrictions to make sure they would back the deal .
But then Ms. Pelosi called .
“ The deal ’s off , ” he quoted her as saying .
“ It ’s not my choice .
I ca n’t hold my side together . ”
The sensitivity around the abortion fight  and the likelihood that it would not disappear from the health care debate  was evident from the start of floor proceedings on the health care bill on Saturday .
And it was part of the drama outside the Capitol as well .
Roughly 300 protesters who rallied against the health care bill included a number of anti-abortion demonstrators with large placards showing grisly photos identified as aborted fetuses .
Inside the building , House Democratic leaders had hoped to spend the day rallying their members around a historic vote .
President Obama , visiting the Capitol to make a personal appeal to lawmakers , likened the bill to two of the party ’s greatest achievements : Social Security under Franklin D. Roosevelt and Medicare under Lyndon B. Johnson .
Instead , Ms. Pelosi found her caucus still caught up in the fierce dispute over abortion .
On Friday , Ms. Pelosi met twice with Democratic lawmakers from the Pro-Choice Caucus .
In between , she huddled with staff members from the bishops conference , Mr. Stupak and two other leading Roman Catholic lawmakers , Representative Mike Doyle , Democrat of Pennsylvania , and Representative Brad Ellsworth , Democrat of Indiana .
Stanza , the iPhone e-book reader so good that Amazon bought it , has just released v2.0 , and it improves on 1.x in almost every way .
Stanza was the first good e-book reading application for the iPhone , and this release keeps it at the top of the bunch .
At first glance , the new feature list looks short , but when you start to poke around you discover that the polish that has been applied to the app makes every part easier to use .
First , the official list :
Tabbed navigation
This simply adds a row of buttons along the top of catalog and settings screens to help find you way around .
It does n’t apply when reading , nor should it .
Copy to Clipboard in Annotation View
This single line hides a revamped annotation engine .
Sure , now you can copy chunks of text , but you can also zoom pictures , share your notes ( or the copied text ) via Twitter or e-mail ( or Facebook , if you have to ) , and easily define words via online dictionary .
Sharing
You can also show off how far you are into a book via Twitter and Facebook .
Lord knows why , but it is there if you want it .
Unified Setting Screen
This is partially true .
Those of you who learned to navigate the labyrinthine sections of the old Stanza will not be wasting that practice .
It seems that the settings are , far from being unified , still scattered all over the place .
More
Not mentioned in these notes is a new text - resizer , which actually resizes the whole page as you pinch until you are happy , and then only reformats the text when you click to confirm .
If you were ever frustrated by the old way which would reformat after every pinch , and always seemed to get the size wrong , you will be very happy .
In fact , this kind of polish is what marks the 2.0 update .
You can now assign custom categories to your books easily , as well as creating your own collections ( think playlists for books ) .
You can assign artwork , either by searching on the web ( it is automatic ) or by importing from your iPhone photo library .
Further , the online catalogs have been separated into official and unofficial , so if you have added any ( ahem ) third - party repositories , they are kept away from the legit stuff .
One pain , and something nobody seems to have worked out yet , is that you have to leave the application to buy anything , getting dumped into Safari to input credit card or login details .
A minor point , we suppose , but it certainly stops the candy - store buying approach we ’re used to with iPhone applications and music .
It is probably inevitable with Stanza , though , as it supports so many different online stores .
Should you download it ?
If you are already a Stanza user , it ’s likely you already did as soon as you heard about the update .
If you ’re not a Stanza user , go get it now .
It ’s free .

Most big banks , however , are now free to pay their employees as they see fit , now that they have repaid their bailout funds .
To Wall Street critics and , indeed , many ordinary Americans , the prospect of a new era of Wall Street wealth , so soon after the financial collapse , and with so many people out of work , seems shocking .
Some see the coming round of bonuses as evidence that policy makers failed to reform pay practices that in , some cases , fostered the risky businesses that lead to the financial crisis in the first place .
“ There ’s a universal discomfort with the levels of compensation we ’re seeing in the financial system , ” said Jonathan Koppell , a professor of public policy at the Yale School of Management .
“ The idea that private institutions should be walled out from government intervention is harder to swallow when in the last year government intervention was quite welcome in the form of billions of dollars in bailouts . ”
Many on Wall Street were waiting anxiously to see what Goldman would do .
Goldman is enjoying one of the most profitable years in its 140 - year history , and its rapid recovery has made the bank a lightning rod .
Much of the resentment has been directed at Goldman ’s chief executive , Lloyd C. Blankfein , who after first staunchly defending the bank ’s profits and pay , and then bristling at calls for restraint , apologized for mistakes that led to the financial crisis .

Mr. Blankfein declined a bonus last year .
In 2007 , he was paid about $ 67.5 million , a Wall Street record .
This year , he and 29 other top executives will receive bonuses that could be quite large , but they will be in the form of what Goldman called “ shares at risk , ” or stock that can not be sold for five years and can be retracted if the executive does something that hurts the firm .
Goldman has long paid a portion of bonuses in stock .
Goldman also announced on Thursday that , for the first time , it would give its shareholders a say in determining compensation .
The vote would be nonbinding , however .
Hacking Higher Education , Part 1 - CLEP
“ There is always The Hacker Ethos
All education - even college education - is fundamentally self - education .
The purpose of the Personal MBA has always been to direct you to resources you can use to improve your business skills on your own time , without quitting your job and mortgaging your life .
In the five years I ’ve been running the Personal MBA , I ’ve seen far too many people give away their power and responsibility to a simple piece of paper by saying something like the following :
“ You need a good ( read : prestigious / expensive ) degree to get a good job . "
“ No one cares about what you know , they just care about where you went to school . "
“ No one will interview me without a credential . "
Having a credential is not ( and has never been ) equivalent to being an educated person - education is about what happens in your head , not in a classroom .
It is true , however , that many employers use credentials as a screen to weed out candidates for available positions .
If you ’re committed to self - education but find yourself uncertain about whether or not hiring managers will give you a second look without a degree , this post is for you .
For the moment , let ’s ignore the fact that you do n’t need a credential to provide value to other people - starting your own business is a much better way to achieve material success than getting a job , and you do n’t need a degree to get started .
( For proof , read The Millionaire Next Door . )
Let ’s assume that you ’re resigned to going through your career the traditional way by earning a high school diploma / GED , getting a college degree , and interviewing for a job .
How should you go about getting your degree ?
I have nothing against college education per se - I went to college , and it was a good experience .
( I was able to finance my degree completely via scholarships . )
What really irks me is that so many people mindlessly assume that sitting in a classroom for 4 + years and racking up tens ( or hundreds ) of thousands of dollars of debt = getting a useful education , and that it ’s always a good investment .
It is n’t , and it ’s not .
The return on every investment is always directly related to how much the investment costs .
The more you spend ( in terms of both money and time ) , the lower your return .
College education is one of the most expensive things you ’ll ever purchase , so finding ways to get the benefits of a credential without breaking the bank pays off handsomely in both the short and long term .
My goal is not to dissuade you from attending college if that ’s what you decide to do .
My purpose in writing this is to help you get the best possible educational return on investment by maximizing the value of your credential and minimizing the cost .
Never forget that higher education is itself a business , and has a vested interest in maximizing the amount you pay for a credential .
The more classes cost and the longer the program takes to complete , the more you ’ll pay , particularly if you finance your degree with debt .
The more you pay , the more limited your options and the lower your return .
What Does the Optimal Undergraduate Degree Look Like ?
Let ’s assume you want to maximize the value of getting an undergraduate degree , and that you ’re open to options regarding how you actually obtain that degree .
Here ’s a list of criteria the optimal solution must satisfy :
Highest possible signaling value - since the purpose is to get a job , the more the option makes you stand out as a motivated , intelligent , and reliable employee , the more valuable it is .
( Diploma mills are not an option . )
Lowest possible cost - lower costs result in higher ROI .
Lowest possible time investment - less time decreases the opportunity cost of getting the credential and increases the time and energy you can spend doing something else .
Fewest potential barriers - approval processes like admissions and bureaucracy are a significant risk : they can increase both time and monetary costs with little notice or recompense .
These criteria very quickly eliminate traditional college programs as the best option .
Most undergraduate collegiate - level programs take a minimum of 4 years of full - time effort to complete , which is a huge opportunity cost .
Programs with low signaling value ( community colleges , etc. ) tend to cost less , but the perceived lack of distinction undermines the reason you ’re getting the degree in the first place .
Programs with high signaling value ( Ivy League private universities , etc. ) cost a huge amount - several hundred thousand dollars , in some cases , which often requires you to mortgage the next 20 - 30 years of your life by taking on massive amounts of student loan debt .
All programs have huge potential barriers as well : admissions , strict curricula , and bureaucracy , which essentially require you to get someone else ’s permission before getting started and increases the risk you ’ll have to stay enrolled longer and pay more .
Fortunately , I ’ve discovered an option that ’s the polar opposite - a low - bureaucracy way to graduate with an accredited undergraduate college degree in 1 year for about $ 4,000 , in a way that will make any potential employer interested in interviewing you .
The DIY College Degree : Testing Out Via CLEP Examination
The College - Level Examination Program ( CLEP ) is a series of examinations created by the College Board , the same organization that administers the SAT college entrance examinations .
There are 34 different CLEP examinations offered , each of which is the equivalent of 3 to 12 college credits .
Most accredited universities fully recognize passing scores on CLEP tests as full credit in their program .
To graduate with an undergraduate degree , you ’ll need to accumulate a minimum of 120 credits .
Official CLEP examination study guides are available for about $ 20 , which includes the material you need to know and sample tests to judge your proficiency before you take the real test .
To save money , you can borrow these texts from most public libraries .
Each exam is approximately 90 minutes long , and costs $ 72 dollars to take .
If you pass , you get full credit for the equivalent college requirements .
If you do n’t pass , you can take the exam again - there ’s no limit on how many times you can take any given test .
CLEP itself does not offer degrees - once you get to 120 credits , you ’ll have to transfer them to an accredited college or university to be awarded a degree .
Excelsior College is an accredited institution that does not have a residency requirement , which means that 100 % of your credits can be taken via CLEP examination .
In order to graduate , you ’ll have to pay ~ $ 1,500 to become an Excelsior student and have your credits transferred .
Once the transfer is complete , you ’ll be awarded an accredited undergraduate degree .
Evaluating the CLEP Approach
The total cost of pursing an undergraduate degree in this fashion is ~ $ 4,000 .
The cost of examinations is approximately $ 2,500 for 120 credits , plus the $ 1,500 for transfer to Excelsior .
Even if you plan to purchase the CLEP exam books and add some padding if you need to re-take a test , you should spend no more than $ 5,000 total .
It ’s possible to complete this process in less than a year .
Assuming you studied full - time , it ’s possible to study for and pass a CLEP examination once every two weeks .
If you focus on tests that award higher amounts of credit ( 6/12 vs. 3 ) , you can accumulate 120 credits in less than a year .
Bureaucracy and barriers to entry are extremely low .
You do n’t have to worry about an admissions process , student affairs offices , course offering schedules , or other bureaucratic issues .
All you need to do to get started is to pick up a CLEP prep book at the library , start studying , and schedule the test .
Getting your degree in this way will almost certainly impress most hiring managers .
Completing your undergraduate studies in less than a year for $ 4,000 is a very real achievement that proves your intelligence , ingenuity , drive , and persistence .
I do n’t know about you , but I would much rather hire a person who got their degree this way than someone who spent a lot of money and time attending a traditional college program , assuming both candidates had the skills to do the job .
Graduating in this way also gives you more time to develop economically valuable skills outside of college , giving you a huge edge .
If you ’re considering getting an undergraduate degree , it appears that the CLEP option is well worth considering .
If you already have an undergraduate degree , this is an excellent case study in the value of doing things differently : there ’s always better way , and it pays to find it .
I have more to say about hacking higher education , which will have to wait until the next post .
Up next , we ’ll discuss a little - known way to obtain a bachelors or masters degree from a world - renowned university for less than the cost of attending a 4 - year program at a mediocre state school - without suffering through the dreaded over - the - top admissions process .

Tonight Jewish kids will light the menorah , spin their dreidels and get their presents , but Hanukkah is the most adult of holidays .
It commemorates an event in which the good guys did horrible things , the bad guys did good things and in which everybody is flummoxed by insoluble conflicts that remain with us today .
It ’s a holiday that accurately reflects how politics is , how history is , how life is .
It begins with the spread of Greek culture .
Alexander ’s Empire , and the smaller empires that succeeded it , brought modernizing ideas and institutions to the Middle East .
At its best , Hellenistic culture emphasized the power of reason and the importance of individual conscience .
It brought theaters , gymnasiums and debating societies to the cities .
It raised living standards , especially in places like Jerusalem .
Many Jewish reformers embraced these improvements .
The Greeks had one central idea : their aspirations to create an advanced universal culture .
And the Jews had their own central idea : the idea of one true God .
The reformers wanted to merge these two ideas .
Urbane Jews assimilated parts of Greek culture into their own , taking Greek names like Jason , exercising in the gymnasium and prospering within Greek institutions .
Not all Jews assimilated .
Some resisted quietly .
Others fled to the hills .
But Jerusalem did well .
The Seleucid dynasty , which had political control over the area , was not merely tolerant ; it used imperial money to help promote the diverse religions within its sphere .
The internet has clearly been a boon for news junkies , LOLcats and the makers of goofball videos .
But it 's also proven to be a powerful international force for peace .
That 's the message of Internet for Peace , a campaign launched this week by Wired Italy to nominate the net for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 .
" The internet can be considered the first weapon of mass construction , which we can deploy to destroy hate and conflict and to propagate peace and democracy , " said Riccardo Luna , editor - in - chief of the Italian edition of Wired magazine .
" What happened in Iran after the latest election , and the role the web played in spreading information that would otherwise have been censored , are only the newest examples of how the internet can become a weapon of global hope . "
Those wishing to sign the petition nominating the net can do so on the just - launched Internet for Peace website .
The site will include a planisphere that scrolls down the names and countries , in real time , of all those supporting the initiative .
Early backers include 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi , professor Umberto Veronesi and stylist Giorgio Armani .
Ebadi , the first Iranian Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , said the internet 's free - speech power outweighs any negative use of the international network .
Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi is first to sign on for the Internet for Peace initiative .

" The internet can be also used to fuel war and terrorism , as Taliban proselytism clearly shows , " she told Wired Italy .
" The spreading of the news about the Tehran riots , however — that raced at a pace of 220,000 tweets per hour — was way too overwhelming to make us doubt that it would have been possible without the internet .
It is not a coincidence that during the first trials against the protesters , the attorney general accused Google , Facebook and Twitter of conspiring against the establishment . "
The Internet for Peace manifesto , which will be translated into more than a dozen languages on the Internet for Peace site , outlines the reasons for the nomination :
We have finally realized that the internet is much more than a network of computers .
It is an endless web of people .
Men and women from every corner of the globe are connecting to one another , thanks to the biggest social interface ever known to humanity .
Digital culture has laid the foundations for a new kind of society .
And this society is advancing dialogue , debate and consensus through communication .
Because democracy has always flourished where there is openness , acceptance , discussion and participation .
And contact with others has always been the most effective antidote against hatred and conflict .
That 's why the internet is a tool for peace .
That 's why anyone who uses it can sow the seeds of nonviolence .
And that 's why the next Nobel Peace Prize should go to the net .
A Nobel for each and every one of us .
Wired Italy will promote the initiative in each issue through September 2010 , telling the stories of " those who — thanks to the web — have tried and still try to give peace a chance . "
Current TV will produce videos about the stories for U.S. , British and Italian audiences .
The Internet for Peace project was announced Friday during the Science for Peace conference organized by the Umberto Veronesi Foundation .
" Should the web win the Nobel , we would demonstrate two things to future observers :
That we had grasped the importance of the global revolution represented by the internet , and that we were determined to channel its power in the right direction , to make the most out of it in the interest of mankind , " Veronesi writes in the December issue of Wired Italy .
The project will also be backed by the U.S. and British editions of Wired magazine .
" People want peace , and when given a voice , they 'll work tirelessly for it , " said Wired U.S. Editor - in - Chief Chris Anderson .
" In the short term , a Twitter account may be no match for an AK - 47 , but in the long term the keyboard is mightier than the sword . "
Wired British Editor - in - Chief David Rowan called the internet " the strongest transforming force of the modern era . "
" It gave all of us the chance to take back the power from governments and multinationals , " Rowan said .
" It made the world a totally transparent place . "
Many companies have already accepted Wired Italy 's invitation to support the nomination of the internet for the Nobel Peace Prize .
Sony Ericsson , Tiscali , Fineco , Fastweb , Microsoft Italy , Telecom Italia , Unendo Energia , Vodafone Italy , Citroën and H3G have created 10 different creative pages to support Internet for Peace , to be published in Wired 's December issue .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
An influential Iranian leader suggested on Monday Iran should quit the Non-Proliferation Treaty in protest against a U.N. censure over its nuclear activity , but its atomic energy chief dismissed such a move .
Tehran caused an international outcry on Sunday when it announced plans to build 10 more uranium enrichment sites in retaliation for a rebuke by the U.N. nuclear agency for covering up an enrichment project for at least two years .
Russia said it was “ seriously concerned ” by Iran ’s gambit to massively expand enrichment , criticism that could raise Western hopes for Russian backing for harsher sanctions against Tehran .
Washington condemned the plans as a serious violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Parliament speaker Ali Larijani said there was little point in Iran staying in the treaty if it was liable to be reprimanded by the International Atomic Energy Agency for exercising its right to develop peaceful nuclear energy .
“ I believe that their moves are harming the NPT the most ...
Now , whether you are a member of the NPT , or pull out of it , makes no difference , ” Larijani told a news conference .
However , Ali Akbar Salehi , head of Iran ’s atomic energy agency and seen as a relative moderate , told Reuters later Tehran had no wish to leave the NPT .
“ Our spiritual leader says that to obtain nuclear weapons is a sin -- if we wanted to obtain nuclear weapons we would leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty , ” he said through an interpreter .
“ We are naturally enduring a lot of pressure but we will remain in the treaty . ”
TENETS OF ISLAM
Iranian officials have previously said Iran had no intention of leaving the NPT , under which its nuclear sites are subject to IAEA inspections , or to use enrichment to produce fuel for nuclear weapons , which it says violate the tenets of Islam .
Analysts believe Iran would think twice before quitting the NPT since this would betray weapons ambitions and could provoke a pre-emptive attack by Israel and possibly the United States .
It could take Iran many years to equip and operate 10 new enrichment plants .
Iran dismissed skepticism voiced by some Western analysts about its ability to execute the plan .
“ They will see in the future that what we have said is no bluff , ” First Vice - President Mohammad Reza Rahimi told Fars news agency .
If Iran expands enrichment as it says , suspicions that it plans to develop nuclear weapons will grow since it lacks the technology needed to convert low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) it is making into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants .
Such technology is not needed to refine LEU into the fissile material used for nuclear warheads .
Larijani said there was still room for diplomacy .

Referring to the six world powers pressing Iran for steps to prove it does not seek nuclear weapons , he said : “ It would be useful for them also to use this diplomatic opportunity to let Iran work in the framework of the IAEA and international supervision to assure them that Iran ’s activities are peaceful .
“ Of course they are free to choose another method and Iran will act accordingly . ”
The IAEA board angered Iran when it censured it for covertly building a second uranium enrichment plant near the holy city of Qom , in addition to its main IAEA - monitored one at Natanz , and calling for a halt to construction .
“ STRONG MESSAGE ”
Salehi , quoted by state broadcaster IRIB , said the decision to go ahead with 10 new enrichment sites was spurred by the IAEA resolution , adding : “ Iran ’s government sent a strong message . ”
Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said Iran ’s plans were unacceptable and might lead to increased pressure on Tehran to comply with U.N. resolutions .
“ We view the Iranian announcement , if it is in fact accurate and implemented , that they intend to build 10 additional facilities as completely inappropriate and further isolating Iran from the international community , ” she told reporters .
Russia , which has so far refused publicly to support U.S. suggestions that broader economic sanctions may be needed to restrain Iran , said it was “ seriously concerned by the latest statements of the Iranian leadership . ”
France said Iran should be given a “ last chance ” in talks over its atomic program and it must heed IAEA warnings .
“ The fact that Iran persists in ignoring the demands of a big independent agency like the IAEA , that ’s very dangerous , ” Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said .
Germany ’s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Iran ’s announcement “ clearly goes in the wrong direction .
Iran is urged to cooperate with the IAEA without ifs and buts ...
It is clear that if Iran rejects the outstretched hand of the international community , it must expect further sanctions . ”
It was early last year when Joby Morris , a 33 - year - old floral designer in Pacifica , heard about the housing market ’s crash .
Soon she and her fiancé began dreaming of finally buying a home in the East Bay .
But for 18 months , Ms. Morris watched helplessly as time and again , an investor with an all - cash offer and no intention of moving into the property swooped in and snapped up a house she was bidding on .
Last year , she entered a bidding war for a home at 2208 41st Avenue in Oakland .
It was listed at $ 149,000 ; she bid until the price topped $ 180,000 , her real estate agent said .
The winning bid was $ 265,000 .
Last month , after the same thing happened a sixth time , Ms. Morris gave up .
“ The idea of ownership was a falsehood , ” said Ms. Morris , who was planning to finance the purchase with a loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration .
“ It ’s not going to happen . ”
Ms. Morris and her fiancé , Justin Womack , with a combined income of more than $ 100,000 , are among hundreds of qualified , aspiring homeowners in the Bay Area baffled and frustrated by the difficulties they face , local Realtors say .
As Ms. Morris ’s Oakland - based real estate agent , Charles Wright , said , “ Everyday homeowner occupants are having a serious problem finding anything because there ’s such a frenzy out there . ”
It seems Mr. Cheney will have some explaining to do .
The Gitmo detainees were sent to Saudi Arabia , where they underwent “ art therapy , ” and then were set free .
But now the Republicans have a problem with President Obama wanting to try suspected terrorists in US courts .
Maybe if we promise the maximum sentence will be “ art therapy , ” the Republicans will come on board .

Our goal is to help simplify your selection process .
By providing you with accurate and updated information we give you the tools to make the best decision for your particular circumstances .
If you or a loved one has been involved in a car accident , motorcycle accident , or truck accident , we provide tips on steps you can take now to protect your legal rights , information on fault issues in motor vehicle accident cases , and an overview of what to expect in a lawsuit arising from a vehicle accident .
Automobile accidents probably account for more deaths each year than any other type of accident , and cost people and insurance companies billions of dollars in losses each year .
All you have to do is listen to the radio .
Even non-fatal crashes yield hospital expenses , loss of work , loss of enjoyment of life and loss of property .
If someone is severely injured or killed or if one or both of the drivers was intoxicated at the time of the accident , your state is likely to prosecute the person at fault .
However , basic automobile accident personal injury lawsuits are the most common type of court case .
How much you can be awarded when you ’ve lost property , have extensive injuries and sky - high medical bill is most often determined by the court .
There are a number of documents that you will need prior to filing your claim , and there are also certain things that you must do before the case against the other side is commenced .
Prior to filing your claim it is vital that you have checked your insurance policy to ensure that you know the extent of your coverage .
This will inform you as to whether or not the insurers will pay for a replacement vehicle , if necessary , whether they will pay your medical expenses ( dependent on state laws ) , and the extent of the information you will need to disclose to them in relation to your employment and medical histories .
After suffering a car accident injury , an attorney might be the last place you would look for assistance .
However , an attorney can provide more help than most individuals realize .
Attorneys and doctors who treat auto accident victims often work closely together .
While this relationship is often criticized , it exists for the good of the patient .
Doctors know how to best treat a patient and attorneys understand how to obtain compensation for the patient ’s treatments and the doctor ’s findings on permanent disability and future medical care .
Because of this , many attorneys are able to refer their clients to physicians in the area that will address their needs in a manner that will later be usable as evidence in negotiations or litigation .
Similarly , attorneys are able to refer their clients to experts that are able to evaluate and later testify about the patient ’s injuries .
In many states , experts must be certified as such by the bar or medical associations as well as the court prior to being able to provide testimony .
An attorney will know which physicians in the area are recognized experts that will later be usable in court , if necessary .
Furthermore , experts often charge high up - front fees for their evaluation and testimony which an attorney might be able to negotiate to a lower rate to save the patient money .
Another important task that falls within attorney expertise is the valuation of a client ’s injuries .
An attorney will consider the type of injury , its location and permanence , the amount of fault attributable to the party himself when making a preliminary value estimate of the case .
Subsequently , an attorney will research to determine the average damage awards for similar injuries in your area to better identify the value of your injuries and potential compensation .
Few physicians will provide services for free , making it essential that an injured party have adequate funds to finance his treatment .
An attorney can assist his client with obtaining interim compensation to pay doctors for his treatment prior to the finalization of his case .
If you have been injured in an auto accident and are considering filing a claim or lawsuit , seek legal advice .
A car accident lawyer will review the facts of your case and identify those issues with which his expertise may be helpful to you .

Ellen says , " I need a budget estimate for my project , but I do n't have a scope or a design for it yet . "
Dilbert says , " Okay , my estimate is $ 3,583,729 . "
Ellen says , " You do n't know anything about my project . "
Dilbert says , " That makes two of us . "
Following my last column , in which I sought to stem the distressing tide of disbelief in the very concept of global warming , a frequent ( and thoughtful ) Camera letter writer responded by saying the real problem is overpopulation and finite resources .
June Warwick wrote that the “ column failed to address what to me is a much more pertinent issue .
Namely , fossil fuels are a finite entity , whereas the number of Homo sapiens shows no inclination to subside . ”
She is , of course , right .
But talking about overpopulation is taboo in many circles .
When a New York Times green blogger recently wrote about the connection between climate change and population — the more people there are consuming more resources , the more carbon goes into the atmosphere — Rush Limbaugh , the Grand Dragon of the new GOP himself , decided to weigh in .
“ This guy from the New York Times , if he really thinks that humanity is destroying the planet , humanity is destroying the climate , that human beings in their natural existence are going to cause the extinction of life on earth , Andrew Revkin , Mr. Revkin , why do n’t you just go kill yourself and help the planet by dying ? ” Limbaugh said .
Rush ’s larger claim may have been to say that environmentalists are hypocrites .
But the acidity of his advice to Revkin — go kill yourself — reflects the sensitivity of the topic of overpopulation .
Why is it so verboten ?
“ There is a moral component , ” says Boulder ’s Al Bartlett , professor emeritus of physics at the University of Colorado and nationally renowned lecturer on the dangers of overpopulation and resource depletion .
“ It starts with ‘ be fruitful and multiply . ' ”
But that “ morality ” is a funny one .
We live in a society that makes a celebrity out of a woman who has 14 kids by artificial means and views every birth as a joyous one , regardless of the circumstances .
The taboo is , of course , tied up with sex .
And government .
And the privilege of the Baby Boom generation .
How , exactly , should a society go about limiting its birth rate ?
China ’s example of government - enforced birth - rate policy is clearly not the answer , and has led to unforeseen ( or perhaps not so ) consequences , including female infanticide , selective abortion and a surplus of males .
Here in America , we talk with a straight face about the need for families to have more children so that Baby Boomers and the World War II generation can maintain their cushy benefits .
“ Social Security is a real problem .
It ’s not a long - term solution to say we need more young people to pay for us old folks , ” Bartlett says .
“ We have to realize it ’s fiscally not sustainable .
Eventually we will have to do the obvious : raise the Social Security tax , raise the retirement age or cut benefits . ”
But such problems are paltry compared to the big picture : Resources are finite and the more people there are , the faster we will deplete them .
A sustainable world population , at today ’s U.S. dietary levels , according to David Pimental at Cornell University , is about 2 billion people .
Current world population is approaching 6.8 billion people .
We could hit ( barring some catastrophic plague or environmental event ) 9 billion by 2030 and 11 billion by 2050 .
That ’s not going to work .
“ Why would any rational person want to go to 9 billion ? ” Bartlett asks .
“ Can you think of any problem on any scale , from the microscopic to the global , whose long - term solution in any demonstrable way is aided , assisted or advanced by having larger populations ? ”
First , Bartlett says , population never pays for itself .
And pipe dreams that technology will save the day are just that .
“ High technology is going to be our undoing , ” he says , because it has enabled insane levels of population growth .
He points out that , like it or not , oil production will decline ( or perhaps is declining ) even as demand rises .
Fanciful notions that we can extract petroleum from , say , oil shale neglect to take into consideration the enormous energy inputs required to get the stuff out and make it usable .
“ I suspect we will see a future marked by rapidly rising costs of fossil fuels , ” Bartlett says .
So what then , I asked him , should we do ?
China ’s approach is morally suspect and has resulted in unforeseen consequences ( Bartlett likes to quote the late newsman Eric Sevareid , who said , “ The chief cause of problems is solutions ” ) .
Nobody likes the specter of enforced population control .
In the United States , Bartlett thinks we just need to start talking honestly .
“ I think we should have a coast - to - coast debate , led hopefully by the president :
How large a population do we want to have ?
What is sustainable ? ” Bartlett says .
“ I think the answer is maybe a half or a third of our present population .
“ But we do n’t even acknowledge it ’s a problem .
The last president to be really concerned about this was Richard Nixon , ” he says .
In 1972 , when Nixon ’s Rockefeller Commission took a look at the issue , U.S. population was about 209 million , and the world had some 3.5 billion souls .
Today we have 305 million in the United States — just about what the commission , which predicted doubling in 70 years ( with a declining birth rate , actually ) , expected .
It ’s still too many .
Meanwhile , world population has alarmingly almost doubled since then .
And more of those billions than ever , understandably , want a high - consumption lifestyle like yours and mine .
That ’s not going to work .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Darren covered this over at ClimateWire , but I ’m not sure a straight news story can really capture the toxicity and absurdity of what the Inhofe is planning to do on the climate bill next week .
Some background : when the Waxman - Markey chairman ’s mark was released , the EPA undertook an exhaustive five - week analysis of its economic impacts .
( It found that the costs to household would be modest and the bill would actually lower electricity bills . )
When the action moved over to the Senate and the Kerry - Boxer chairman ’s mark was released , the EPA determined that the bill was 90 percent identical to the Waxman - Markey bill , and thus that another full , five - week modeling run was unnecessarily duplicative .
Instead , it took two weeks to analyze the differences between the bills and whether they would substantially affect the economic impacts .
( They would n’t . )
That ’s seven weeks of analysis total .
But not enough for Inhofe ( who will , of course , vote against any bill regardless ) .
He ’s demanding that the EPA do another full , five - week modeling run , and unless he gets what he wants , he ’s threatening to lead Republicans in a boycott of the markup next week .
Now , remember : the bills are 90 percent identical , and the 10 percent differences do n’t alter the overall costs .
So we already know exactly what a modeling run would show .
We know !
Everyone knows !
Inhofe knows .
It ’s a pure , unadulterated waste of time and government resources .
Here ’s Boxer ’s response , from E&E :
EPW Chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) is expected to notice the Tuesday markup later today despite the boycott threat .
Boxer yesterday told reporters she is “ going to use every tool at our disposal to get this done . ”
She added , “ My chief of staff and chief counsel tell me that we can go next week , according to the rules , according to what we ’ve got available .
And that ’s our intention .
That ’s our plan .
And that ’s our hope . ”
Boxer did not go into specifics on how she would move the bill , but there appear to be several options .
For starters , Boxer and Senate Democratic leaders could use Senate Rule 14 , which allows the majority to discharge legislation out of a committee and bring it directly to the floor .
Democrats could also break with a long - standing EPW Committee precedent that requires two minority members to be in attendance for a markup to even begin .
According to the committee rules , Boxer appears to have an exception available that would pave the way for votes on both amendments and the overall bill so long as a majority of the committee ’s members are present .
Going this route , according to one former Senate Democratic aide , could spell trouble for the overall legislation as Boxer and her allies continue their search for 60 votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans .
“ That product is totally toxic , ” the former staffer warned .
“ It ’s basically worthless . ”
This last ‘ graph is key : the danger here is not so much that Inhofe can block markup , but he can make the entire process so toxic that any hope of Republican support is lost — and the bill wo n’t pass without some Republican support .
So it ’s classic Inhofe : a petty procedural ratf *ck designed to poison the waters and prevent and reasonable engagement with the issues at hand .
Oh , and do n’t be misled — like Politico was — by efforts to make more moderate Rs like Voinovich and Alexander the public face of this effort .
Voinovich submitted the request to the EPA weeks ago , but this has all the marks of Inhofe , the Wormtongue who whispers poison into his colleagues ’ ears .

Rowan Williams bought himself time for a while in his attempt to hold the Anglican Communion together in its row over gay bishops .
But yesterday it looked like that time is running out .
He had appealed to the liberal church in the United States to impose a moratorium on electing any more gay bishops after the divisive election of Bishop Gene Robinson in 2003 .
But the ceasefire between liberals and evangelicals has effectively been ended by the election of a bishop who has committed a double sin in the eyes of conservatives : Canon Mary Glasspool is a woman priest and has openly been a lesbian for 21 years .
Dr Williams is clinging to one final hope .
Her selection has still to be ratified by the national church before she is ordained next May .
In theory her appointment could be rejected .
But it is a forlorn expectation .
The mood in the US church is that it is time to reject conservative intolerance and affirm that homosexuals are as loved by God as heterosexuals .
The conservative group Reform yesterday said that a schism is now " absolutely inevitable " .
What has irritated liberals is the speed with which Dr Williams has issued his statement requesting " a period of gracious restraint " which is church - speak for urging the ceasefire to continue .

It comes in contrast to Lambeth Palace 's unwillingness to make public comment about the anti-gay laws being proposed in Uganda where homosexuals are already liable to be jailed for life .
A new bill will impose the death penalty on HIV positive gay men for " aggravated homosexuality " .
The law is being backed by at least one Ugandan bishop who has denounced homosexuality as a sign of modern Western decadence .
But though Dr Williams ' office has let it be known that he is appalled by the proposed law , he feels that publicly condemning it will make it more rather than less likely to come into force .
So it has come to this , for a man who made his reputation as one of Anglicanism 's leading liberal catholic theologians : he swiftly condemns liberal Americans for being too tolerant , and yet feels forced to remain silent over a rank and brutal inhumanity .
Critics from both sides have unkindly quipped that Dr Williams has boldly nailed his colours to the fence .
He may find that preferring unity to truth will not be possible much longer .
Fourteen months and counting .
That 's how long S. Joel Chaney has been out of work .
An electrical engineer with considerable IT experience , he continues to send out five resumes a week , even for jobs paying less than half of what he used to make .
" At this point , I just want to work , " said Chaney , 44 , of Avon Lake , one of a record number of long - term unemployed nationwide .
" If I got a job making between $ 30 - 35,000 on a help desk doing tech support , I 'd be happy .
Companies do n't believe you when you say that . "
The average length of unemployment for American workers in October was nearly 27 weeks -- more than six months , the longest since the Labor Department started to keep track in 1948 .
The last time the average was even remotely that high was during the last major recession in the early 1980s .
In July 1983 , the average length of unemployment was 21 weeks .
People like Chaney are considered long - term unemployed because they have been out of work at least 27 weeks .
In October nearly 36 percent of all jobless workers were considered among the long - term unemployed , according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project , or NELP , a research and advocacy group .
The second highest on record was 26 percent in 1983 .
Chaney is part of The Plain Dealer 's Help Wanted series , which is following 88 Northeast Ohioans who spent at least part of 2009 unemployed .
Many of them were elated when they learned that Congress voted this month to extend unemployment benefits .
For high unemployment states like Ohio , where the latest unemployment rate was 10.5 percent in October , that meant adding 20 weeks of benefits to the existing 79 weeks .
For the most part , a person receiving jobless benefits would have to exhaust them by Dec. 26 , 2009 , in order to qualify .
Chaney 's benefits will run out in January .
Nancy Theodosion , 53 , of Newbury Township , who was laid off in November 2008 as a water softener valve assembler , wo n't exhaust her benefits until early next year as well .
So neither is likely to qualify for the extension .
Theodosion believes the extension should have included everyone receiving unemployment compensation at the time the law was enacted , because the economy , especially in places like Ohio , is still sputtering .
But , " I 'd rather work than get unemployment , " Theodosion said .
The benefits of about 500,000 Ohioans are scheduled to expire in 2010 , according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services .
About 70,000 with benefits expiring by the 2009 deadline are expected to be eligible for the extension .
The Plain Dealer is following 88 recently unemployed Northeast Ohioans during an extended series called " Help Wanted " that will explore their hopes and fears , defeats and triumphs as they search for work in this down economy .

Help Wanted Stories
' Help Wanted ' on WCPN , WVIZ
The Plain Dealer is collaborating with WCPN FM / 90.3 and WVIZ Channel 25 Ideastream on the " Help Wanted " series .
Throughout the year , there will be multiple reports , interviews , videos and discussions about the experiences of the jobless .
Hirschel Kasper , an economics professor at Oberlin College , said competing interests must be weighed in deciding whether to extend unemployment benefits , especially with the early signs of a recovery under way .
Does government keep extending them , an official acknowledgement that finding a job is still difficult ?
Or does government let them expire , signaling that the economy is improving and that unemployed workers should consider taking jobs they do n't necessarily want .
Christine Riordan , a NELP policy analyst , said her group believes Congress should extend unemployment benefits through 2010 and continue a $ 25 weekly increase included provided in the stimulus act .
" We need to ensure the safety net , " she said .
" Congress needs to reauthorize extensions before the end of the year . "
The NELP analysis showed that long - term unemployed in this recession had extended to groups usually spared in other economic downturns .
More white men .
More white collar workers .
More people ages 25 to 45 , considered prime working age -- the group employers are most apt to hire .
Most of the Help Wanted participants never thought they would have reached the point when an unemployment check would become so important to them .
The longer you go without work , the greater the chance of depleting savings , severance and even 401 ( k ) accounts .
Theodosion said she relies on her weekly payment of nearly $ 200 to buy groceries .
Chaney said he is able to survive on a check of about $ 375 only because he gave up his apartment and moved in with his girlfriend .
Many had dealt with unemployment over the years , but never for this long .
Chaney , laid off in 1998 and 2004 , was able to find a job in about six months both times .
Richard Yarmusch , 63 , a sales analyst from Parma , has been laid off since March 2008 .
He was last laid off in 2002 and found a job in a few weeks .
The longest he had ever been laid off was for five months in 1988 .
Joe Gordon , 61 , of Cleveland was laid off in December 2008 as an artist / illustrator at American Greetings Corp. , where he had worked for about 40 years .
" I never thought I would be unemployed this long , " he said .
" I thought all I had to do was work for less money or be willing to take a job that was less creative than what I had been doing .
By summer it hit me :
This may go on for some time . "
Their experiences with long - term unemployment have left many of them frustrated .
They had always played by the rules .
They got education or specialized training .
They were loyal employees .
Their reward ?
Secure careers .
Until now .
" I try to be optimistic , behind all of that I am still angry , " Yarmusch said .
He 's angry that all he wanted to do was work a few year before retiring -- and now probably wo n't be able to do that .
He 's angry that prospective employers overlook his experience and dwell on his age .
He 's angry about the whole subprime mortgage meltdown that set the economy into a tailspin and indirectly cost him his job .
He 's even angry that no one seems to be paying the price .
" I do n't know their names , " Yarmusch said .
" I do n't know their faces -- but those on the Hill in Washington , those in banks and mortgage companies and even homeowners who applied for loans and knew they had no money .
I will never be satisfied until someone comes up and says these people are criminals for what they 've done to the honest people in this country ! "
Justice
Hill went to work for MLB.com in 2001 when the Web site , owned by major league baseball , was just getting started .
Back then , he said , it was rare for an experienced sports editor like himself to move from a newspaper to online .
He thought he would have been rewarded for showing such faith .
But in December 2008 , Hill , 57 , was laid off .
" There was no loyalty to people who were there when it started , " he said .
" I 'm not mad about it .
It is a realization that in this economic climate you have to look out for No. 1 because if you look out for the team , you end up getting blind - sided . "
Several say they wonder whether the government could have done anything to have prevented the Great Recession and prevented them from becoming economic casualties .
They wonder whether companies would have been so apt to lay off employees if governmental policies would have been in place discouraging them .
Theodosion said the government should have given companies incentives to offer early retirement packages to workers who only remained in the workplace waiting to reach retirement age .
Kasper , the Oberlin College professor , said it is an idea worth exploring .
That sounds good to Theodosion , but she , like other long - term unemployed , have to first deal with more immediate issues .
Some , like her , are in a race to get a job before their unemployment runs out .
Others are like Gordon , the laid - off artist , fearing that Social Security will be their only option .
He worries that his 62th birthday in February will come before a job offer .
Kasper wants to remind them that during the past 12 months , 50 million people were hired .
But then 55 million others lost jobs .

After all , you can't make all those big donors unhappy , right ?
The amount of corruption in our political system has far outstripped our ability to change it .
The NDC thinks our nation is ill - served by state laws that are more difficult to game on behalf of the financial services industry .
Is there anything they wo n't do to screw us ?
The compromise reached late Wednesday between pro-reform House Democrats and the banker - friendly wing of the party could significantly weaken consumer protection in states where lawmakers support tougher rules against tactics such as predatory lending and excessive ATM fees than historically submissive federal regulators .
Members of the New Democrat Coalition -- whose deference to big banks is reflected in the massive amounts of money they have taken from the financial services industry since 2008 -- temporarily blocked the landmark financial regulatory reform bill from hitting the House floor on Wednesday .
At issue was whether federal regulations should be a floor or a ceiling for consumer protection in the states , particularly as they affect big national banks like JPMorgan Chase , Citibank , Bank of America and Wells Fargo .
The Obama administration , Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , state attorneys general and a coalition of consumer advocates and law professors want states to be able to enforce tougher consumer financial protections .
The big banks , obviously , want federal regulations -- which they have found relatively easy to influence -- to preempt any more onerous state rules for banks operating in more than one state .
Working on behalf of the big banks , the New Dems were able to extract a compromise that will allow federal regulations to preempt state laws on a case - by - case basis .
State regulators have extracted billions of dollars from predatory lenders over the past decade through fines and court settlements , and state legislatures adopted strong anti-predatory lending measures years before Congress .
Federal regulators were largely absent from the fight to protect consumers or acted too late , consumer advocates argue .
Blizzard has two big releases slated for 2010 , in the form of StarCraft II and the WoW expansion Cataclysm .
Being a developer known to patiently hone and sharpen its titles long past projected release dates , having these two game come out in the same year is akin to the stars aligning .
Keeping in mind this miracle , Blizzard executive Rob Pardo ’s confirmation that Diablo 3 wo n’t being arriving in 2010 should come as no surprise .
Speaking to Techland of Diablo III ’s announcement to hungry fans about a year and half ago , and Pardo said “ We always announce all of our games too early .
We realize that and go , ‘ You know what ?
Next time we ’re not going to do that . ’
And then we always fail at that .
But I ’d rather fail at that than fail at making the game great .
I think it ’s safe to say that , yeah , ( Diablo III ) is not going to be out next year . ”
Pardo also insists that this is n’t a case of Blizzard ’s two 2010 games crowding Diablo 3 out of the fiscal - calendar year .
“ We ’re definitely not fiscal calendar - driven , ” says Pardo , citing the delay of 2007 ’s WoW expansion Burning Crusade past the holidays as an example .
“ We ’ve been wrong ( on release dates ) for as long as I can remember , ” admits Pardo .
This news should n’t come as a huge revelation to longtime Blizzard fans , but it should come in handy to those poor souls still holding out hope .
Let ’s cross our fingers for 2011 .
If you followed my previous tutorial on implementing pass - through authentication to LDAP with Authlogic , you might be wondering how it can be extended to give different permissions to members of different LDAP groups .
ActiveLdap and declarative_authorization make this incredibly simple .
As with the first tutorial , I ’ve pushed a branch based on authlogic_example that you can use as a concrete example .
First , let ’s bring in the declarative_authorization gem :
# My example code was written before GitHub decided that they do n't want to # build gems anymore but this line should do the trick .
config . gem " declarative_authorization " , : source = & gt ; ' http://gemcutter.org'
Now , we need to make an ActiveLdap model class like LdapUser but for groups .
We ’ll call this LdapGroup :
class LdapGroup & lt ; ActiveLdap :: Base ldap_mapping : dn_attribute = & gt ; " cn " , : scope = & gt ; : sub , : prefix = & gt ; " ou=groups , o=users " has_many : members , : class_name = & gt ; " LdapUser " , : wrap = & gt ; " member " , : primary_key = & gt ; " dn " , : foreign_key = & gt ; " dn " end
The ldap_mapping part is very similar to the previous one for LdapUser , but the has_many is where the real ActiveLdap magic starts !
We are letting ActiveLdap know that an LdapGroup has LdapUser members , which are defined in the multi-valued attribute member , where each of the values is the DN of an LdapUser .
If you ’re looking for a bit more detail , refer to the ActiveLdap documentation .
Keep in mind that the code above is for the specific schema used by my example application and you may have to change it to match yours .
With that , we should be able to list all of our LDAP groups and find the members of any particular one in the console :
& gt ; & gt ; LdapGroup .
all .
collect { | g | g. cn } = & gt ; [ " super_admin " ] & gt ; & gt ; LdapGroup .
find ( " super_admin " ) . members .
collect { | m | m. dn } = & gt ; [ " uid=ebianco, o=users , dc=example , dc=com " ]
Now we ’ll create an association between LdapUser and LdapGroup so that given a user , we can figure out which groups he / she is a member of .
We ’re going to tell ActiveLdap that a user ’s groups are those groups in which the user ’s DN appears in the group ’s member attribute :
belongs_to : groups , : class_name = & gt ; " LdapGroup " , : many = & gt ; " member " , : foreign_key = & gt ; " d n "
Let ’s check our handiwork in the console :
& gt ; & gt ; LdapUser . find ( " ebianco " ) . groups .

Now why did we go through all of this effort ?
declarative_authorization allows us to provide an instance method for User , #role_symbols , that returns an array of symbols representing the list of roles that the user has .
With our ActiveLdap setup , mapping a user ’s roles to LDAP groups becomes a one - liner :
def role_symbols ldap_entry .
groups .
collect { | g | g. cn . to_sym } end
From here , we can define the authorization rules for our LDAP - based roles .
declarative_authorization reads these from config/authorization_rules.rb :
authorization do role : super_admin do has_permission_on :users , : to = & gt ; : manage end role : guest do has_permission_on :users , : to = & gt ; :read has_permission_on :users , : to = & gt ; [ : create , : update , : destroy ] do if_attribute : id = & gt ; is { user .

" We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending .
I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists , and in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step . "

Jim Callaghan - Speech at the Labour Party Conference , 28 September 1976
Gold prices had been on the rise for weeks , then all of a sudden fell back with a thud as we were told that only 11,000 jobs were lost in the US during November .
Another Brown bounce in the polls left Cameron backtracking , austerity is so last month , instead ' growth ' by government spending is now acceptable as policy is dictated by focus groups .
The Middle Easts version of Las Vegas got a helping hand which was good news for many UK banks , however only a mere $ 80 Billion would have been at stake .
Years ago it would have meant something , not today with Trillion dollar bailouts .
China 's vice governor at the peoples bank declared ' We must watch out for bubbles forming on certain assets , and be careful in those areas ' referring to golds recent upward trajectory .
Nice try , that deceit may wash with CNBC but those of us in the loop know full well that China would love to transfer much of their paper assets into hard assets such as Gold .
It 's sometimes easy to forget what the average person thinks in relation to financial matters .
Articles posted here are certainly not consistent with mainstream thinking .
People are still on the same broken record , ' Buy a house now while prices are cheap before you get priced out ' , ' We are past the worst now and good times are ahead ' , ' The government will make a good profit for the taxpayers with the bank bailouts ' .
Ask people who read the financial sections of broadsheet newspapers about gold and you get told ' The price can go up as well as down ' as though this is a unique quality that does not apply to other assets such as bonds , real estate or stocks .
Indeed it is important to remember just what people are thinking , because you do n't want to be on the same page as them .
' Repeat after me , Gold is a bubble , Central Banks can ' tame ' markets , the sustainable recovery is here and there is no inflation !
There is no spoon !'
There 's no analysis of the thunderstorm that is brewing in the distance .
So what about this Gold bubble then ?
People are right , however they are 5 , 10 , 15 years too early in calling it .
People are buying the stuff because one day it will be a bubble as the Worlds Central Banks are busy blowing the next bubbles as I write .
The currency and Government Bond bubbles will eventually burst causing mass inflation and creating the next bubble , commodities and precious metals .
As Bernanke and Company try to assess how best to deal with bubbles , they fool the public as though these events are some mystical force that no one can control .
I have a simple solution , how about stop printing so much money .
We instead move from bubble to bubble , the Centrals banks policy after one pops is to inject further easy money into the system .
Like some drunk who throws up after a bottle of vodka , ' I best have another to sort myself out ' .
Could the US unemployment figures signal the turn with people getting back to work ?
Maybe in the short term , but I do n't think this will be a long term trend .
You have to remember governments everywhere are printing huge amounts of money and this is bound to give the so called ' prosperity ' effect in the short term but it wo n't last , the free market has n't healed .
During the coming stagflation a lot of conventional indicators will seem to be healing when in fact the underlying fundamentals are deteriorating .
For ten years after the credit crunch in 1973 / 74 the unemployment rate in the UK kept rising .
It did n't move up in a straight line , with periods of consolidation and even movements to the downside .
When the correct path was taken it took years to fall .
Numbered estimates in the news are useless , three million , four million , all have been given as figures for the short term , however no one can say for certain , all we do know is that history says it will keep rising over the long term .
For a developed country the British people sure do love their inflation .
While many other nations inflation indices have plummeting like many a British Banks shares , the UK 's inflation rate has remained remarkably ' sticky ' .
Whether its the appreciation of our assets , our rising incomes , our increased levels of debt or the fallacy that we believe the weak pound is good , we really do want to beat other nations in the race to the bottom .
The yanks scream ' bloody murder ' watching their beloved dollars debasement from the powers that be , not realising that one hundred years ago a British pound used to be worth $ 5 .
Anything you can do across the pond , we can do it much worse .
Over the next decade I 'm sure we will show the developed world what not to do .
The problem I see is that British people want inflation .
We want to see rising prices , we believe that this is a healthy state of affairs and will thus allow a greater level of leniency towards our policymakers compared with other nations when it comes to expansive monetary policy .
Will the BoE raise interest rates when the market forces their hand ?
Contrary to what people believe it is the market that controls long term interest rates .
We may like to think of central banks under a paternalistic viewpoint , our saviours there to insulate us from financial destruction and chaos , to solve economic issues should they arise .
Central bankers are just like their Communist Central Planning counterparts , eventually market forces get the better of them where eventually they follow the market , not set the tempo as they would have us all believe .
In order to understand how markets dictate prices such as interest rates its easier to compare the lowering of interest rates to say lowering the price of bread .
If the government declared rather than liquidity not been easily accessible that the issue was now high bread prices , they therefore set forth a policy to fix the price lowering it below the market one .
As suppliers begin making losses they shut down production , at the same time people consume more as they can purchase more of the product .
Eventually the country runs out of bread with all stocks depleted .
Rather than bite the bullet immediately the government would in all probability resort to rationing rather than admit the error of their ways with bread queues becoming a common occurrence .
A black market may appear as people under their free will and against the governments law begin selling bread to one another for a price set by people , the marketplace .
If however the government wishes to fix the state of affairs they must liberate the price once more , allowing the market to determine the price of production .
As suppliers closed down long ago abandoning their supply networks it takes a short while for supply to meet demand once more .
During this period the price of bread goes into the stratosphere as people bid up the cost of the present scarce bread .
Eventually market forces will drive the cost down over time to a point of equilibrium .
How does bread relate to interest rates ?
Its the same principle .
Governments can set the price low but eventually the market will force its hand to raise the price , with the price going into the stratosphere .
This is why we had 18 % interest rates when Thatcher tried to put things right , or when Paul Volker put US rates above 20 % .
The policy makers were just chasing the market , trying to reign in inflation which was driving the free markets interest rates haywire .
During the 1973/74 credit crunch Central Banks had the same idea as now , that is they lowered interest rates in response to the recession , but the longer and lower you try to hold down these prices the higher and sharper they have to eventually rise as many an older reader will painfully remember .
The BoE could be forced to raise interest rates under a number of scenarios .
They may have to raise rates if there is a currency crisis with the pound falling as investors flee .
Like the bread situation above , they will put off the price liberation , instead they will put currency controls or limits on capital ( like bread rationing ) in order to try and provide a short term fix .
Eventually the market beats them and they have to hike rates as over the long run a lack of foreign investment creates a less dynamic economy and higher inflation .
It could be forced to raise rates if inflation got out of hand with the free market demanding increased real rates of return to negate the depreciation of the currency .
Even if central banks keep buying government debt at artificially low rates , private banks still lend to all of us , with this mortgage rates could rise for example .
Its similar to what we see now , despite base rates at near zero average mortgage rates are far higher as the free market realises there are inflation risks over the medium to long term .
They are also hedging against their potential losses as the government props them up .
However they could do none of the above .
They could keep rates low , spurring on more inflation as the government can no longer afford increased rates on the ever expanding debt .
They by pass the market and lend to individuals themselves at these rates .
They print money directly to cover the shortfall in the various government payrolls .
Currency collapse is ensured at this point as it becomes clear to all that its time to pack your suitcase .
Marc
Faber believes this is the conundrum America will face at some point in which its policymakers will not rise to challenge , instead they will shirk away from the correct action to take , opting for runaway inflation .
At some point the stock market of such a country would be a screaming buy , just at the depths of the seemingly never ending hyperinflation when the average person has lost all confidence .
Could the UK be the Canary down the Western coal mine ?
There are many other nations with serious issues that have faced or will face issues sooner , but I would n't put them in the same tier as Britain , a nation who still has a recent innovative and industrious past .
She could however , be the warning signal for many other Western nations that mass inflation and / or interest rate rises are just around the corner .
Either option ai n't pretty .

The result was a lot of job cutting , not something you might have expected from an administration elected with union support .
The unions lost their generous pay for laid - off workers .
To be sure , the union health plans were not treated as harshly as some creditors were , but in the end creditors and workers all paid for the sins of past managements .

Evidence of what is going on came this week in the consumer price figures for October .
The index for new autos was up 1.6 percent for the month , and 3.8 percent for the last 12 months .
It has been more than a decade since that index rose by nearly that much .
That is what can happen when companies focus on raising margins , no matter what the impact on volume .
The Consumer Price Index numbers need not be viewed as gospel .
They are adjusted for quality , which is no easy job .
( How much more is a 2010 model worth than the previous year ’s ?
How big an adjustment is called for if the engine is larger , or the gas mileage is better , or the interior more comfortable ? )
But that issue has been around for a long time .
There is no reason to think the government is doing a worse job on the C.P.I. than it did in years past .
Then there is the question of how the cash - for - clunkers program may have affected the numbers .
That program may have allowed dealers to raise prices temporarily .
If so , that impact could wear off soon .
Because of such things , many analysts have assumed that rising car prices in recent months were a statistical fluke .
“ This significant price increase does not make any sense at all in an environment in which car sales are close to a 27 - year low , ” wrote Harm Bandholz , an economist for UniCredit Research , after the October C.P.I. numbers were released .
“ To me , ” he told me later , “ it is a statistical anomaly ” that is likely to vanish in coming months .
Another possible explanation is the decline of the dollar since March .
German , Japanese and Korean carmakers need to raise prices here to offset the appreciation of the euro , yen and won , and that gives Detroit some room to raise prices as well .
But as Mr. Bandholz pointed out , import prices for cars are rising , but not that rapidly .
“ Higher import prices can explain part of the increase in selling prices , but by far not everything , ” he said .
What Are Proofs For Anyway ?
How to make a polygon convex and how not to prove it
Paul Cohen was one of the great logicians of the last century , who won the Fields Medal in 1966 for this brilliant work .
He , of course , revolutionized set theory when he proved that the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis were both unprovable in the standard formal system called Zermelo– Fraenkel Set Theory .
The theory ’s history is a bit complex — but the main creators were Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel .
Today I thought , with our Thanksgiving Holiday coming up , I would have a short discussion of “ why we prove theorems ? ”
It is related to Cohen , and contains a “ tasty ” result about polygons that I thought might be a good pre-holiday story .
I only met Paul Cohen once , when we both were at a Royal Society workshop on the nature of proof .
The main questions discussed were : what is a proof ?
why do we prove things ?
and what is the role of machine proofs ?
It was a wonderful experience .
I still do not know the answers to these questions — perhaps I will discuss them in more detail in the future .
I noticed two things about the workshop .
First , the senior mathematicians present — including four Fields Medalists — all agreed that proofs were for explanation .
They said :
The goal of a proof is not to “ check ” that something is true , but rather to give insight into why it is true .
Also they all disliked machine proofs .
Cohen was probably the most extreme in his displeasure at the notion of a machine proof .
Second , I noticed how the presentation technologies changed over the two days of the workshop .
Computer scientists spoke first , and we all used powerpoint .
I even had a short video in my presentation , which included slides with elaborate pictures and diagrams .
Then , the relatively young mathematicians spoke .
They used powerpoint too , but no videos .
Just simple slides , some with a small diagram .
Finally , the more senior mathematicians gave their talks , using just plain overhead slides .
I will not say anything about my talk , but all the other talks were great , even though the styles were so different .
Then , Paul Cohen spoke .
He walked up to the overhead projector with one slide and one pen .
He then gave a great lecture : he spoke and now and then wrote a formula on his single slide .
It was a brilliant talk and performance .
So much for powerpoint .
Convex Flips
The tasty result today is due to Paul Erdös who first conjectured it in 1935 .
I just stumbled across it recently , while doing some research on another problem .
I think it may be connected to an old problem — a disease — that I have had for years .
More on that in the future .
The problem Erdös raised , in the Math Monthly , was the following conjecture : Start with any simple polygon in the plane : that is a polygon that does not cross itself .
Define a pocket as a maximal connected region interior to the convex hull of the polygon .
A flip is the operation of reflecting the pocket across its line of support .
The goal is to reach from any simple polygon , a convex polygon , by using just the flips across various pockets .
Is that possible ?
The following is a figure from a paper on the subject by Branko Grünbaum and Joseph Zaks :
Note , is the result of “ flipping ” the path from the vertex to .
Erdös ’ conjecture was actually too strong , there was a trivial counter - example .
Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy made the statement weaker , proved it , and ever since it has been called the Erdös - Nagy Theorem :
Theorem 1
Starting with any simple polygon , any sequence of flips eventually stops , and the resulting polygon is always convex .
A pretty neat result — no ?
Proof or Insight
The result has been rediscovered many times , and also re-proved many times .
But these proofs are not proofs .
Many , if not all , have subtle errors ; it is also interesting to note that the errors made are not even all the same .
When I read this , I immediately thought of the workshop on proof — where is the fundamental insight why this process stops at a convex polygon ?
Somehow , a large number of authors , some quite famous , had missed it .
There is a neat paper published in 2006 , by Erik Demaine , Blaise Gassend , Joseph O’Rourke , and Godfried Toussaint on the Erdös - Nagy Theorem .
They discuss the history of the problem , the gaps in all the previous proofs , and supply a correct proof .
So the theorem is true : flipping a polygon stops at a convex polygon — always .
Their paper is extremely well written and its title says it all : “ Polygons Flip Finitely : Flaws and a Fix . ”
There are many different problems with the existing proofs — see the paper by Demaine , Gassend , O’Rourke , and Toussaint for the details .
One general approach is to look at the sequence of polygons that occur ,
as the flips are performed .
Most argue via a compactness argument that this sequence has a limit polygon .
One difficulty is proving that this limit is reached in a finite number of steps .
This reminds me of a similar problem I discussed before on the distributive law .
Another difficulty is proving that the limit is indeed a convex polygon : in some of the early proofs it is just stated without any justification , while others gave incorrect arguments .
Open Problems
Given any simple polygon there is a best sequence , and a worst sequence of flips that make it convex .
I believe that getting the tight bounds on these is still open .
Have a safe and happy holiday .

Pre-marital sex carries a strong social stigma in many Arab societies
A leading Egyptian scholar has demanded that people caught importing a female virginity - faking device into the country should face the death penalty .
Abdul Mouti Bayoumi said supplying the item was akin to spreading vice in society , a crime punishable by death in Islamic Sharia law .
The device is said to release liquid imitating blood , allowing a female to feign virginity on her wedding night .
There is a stigma about pre-marital sex in conservative Arab societies .
The contraption is seen as a cheap and simple alternative to hymen repair surgery , which is carried out in secret by some clinics in the Middle East .
It is produced in China and has already become available in other parts of the Arab world .
The device is reported to be on sale in Syria for $ 15 .
Professor Bayoumi , a scholar at the prestigious al - Azhar University , said it undermined the moral deterrent of fornication , which he described as a crime and one of the cardinal sins in Islam .
Members of parliament in Egypt have also called for banning import of the item .

In the original form of publication the Rogue was very favorably received .
" One of these authors , " says another writer , " ( the fellow that was pilloried , I have forgotten his name ) , is indeed so grave , sententious , dogmatical a rogue that there is no enduring him . " *
" Wait till you get across the Oregon line into the Rogue River Valley , " they were told .
As Bradley walked on meditating , the Rogue walked on at his side muttering .
They moved quickly , following my smallest gesture , and they gave him the look of a very thorough rogue .
But at the moment he was all heartiness and good - fellowship .
" Here are hanging the great rogue of the name of John de Witt , and the little rogue Cornelius de Witt , his brother , two enemies of the people , but great friends of the king of France . "
Partridge certainly saw it in that light ; for he testified much dissatisfaction on the occasion , quoted an old proverb , and said , he should not wonder if the rogue attacked them again before they reached London .
" O Zarathustra , " answered the ugliest man , " thou art a rogue !
" Mine is not that , " said Sancho ; " I mean he has nothing of the rogue in him ; on the contrary , he has the soul of a pitcher ; he has no thought of doing harm to anyone , only good to all , nor has he any malice whatever in him ; a child might persuade him that it is night at noonday ; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart , and I can't bring myself to leave him , let him do ever such foolish things . "
The hero 's rogue servant , Chispa , seemed to me , then and long afterwards , so fine a bit of Spanish character that I chose his name for my first pseudonym when I began to write for the newspapers , and signed my legislative correspondence for a Cincinnati paper with it .
One day , two rogues , calling themselves weavers , made their appearance .
The faint tug of the sun and moon on the San Andreas Fault stimulates tremors deep underground , suggesting that the rock 15 miles below is lubricated with highly pressurized water that allows the rock to slip with little effort , according to a new study by University of California , Berkeley , seismologists .
" Tremors seem to be extremely sensitive to minute stress changes , " said Roland Bürgmann , UC Berkeley professor of earth and planetary science .
" Seismic waves from the other side of the planet triggered tremors on the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Washington state after the Sumatra earthquake last year , while the Denali earthquake in 2002 triggered tremors on a number of faults in California .
Now we also see that tides -- the daily lunar and solar tides -- very strongly modulate tremors . "
In a paper appearing in the Dec. 24 issue of the journal Nature , UC Berkeley graduate student Amanda M. Thomas , seismologist Robert Nadeau of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory and Bürgmann argue that this extreme sensitivity to stress -- and specifically to shearing stress along the fault -- means that the water deep underground is under extreme pressure .
" The big finding is that there is very high fluid pressure down there , that is , lithostatic pressure , which means pressure equivalent to the load of all rock above it , 15 to 30 kilometers ( 10 to 20 miles ) of rock , " Nadeau said .
" Water under very high pressure essentially lubricates the rock , making the fault very weak . "
Though tides raised in the Earth by the sun and moon are not known to trigger earthquakes directly , they can trigger swarms of deep tremors , which could increase the likelihood of quakes on the fault above the tremor zone , the researchers say .
At other fault zones , such as at Cascadia , swarms of tremors in the ductile zone deep underground correlate with slip at depth as well as increased stress on the shallower " seismogenic zone , " where earthquakes are generated .
The situation on the San Andreas Fault is not so clear , however .
" These tremors represent slip along the fault 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) underground , and this slip should push the fault zone above in a similar pattern , " Bürgmann said .
" But it seems like it must be very subtle , because we actually do n't see a tidal signal in regular earthquakes .
Even though the earthquake zone also sees the tidal stress and also feels the added periodic behavior of the tremor below , they do n't seem to be very bothered . "
Nevertheless , said Nadeau , " It is certainly in the realm of reasonable conjecture that tremors are stressing the fault zone above it .
The deep San Andreas
Fault is moving faster when tremors are more active , presumably stressing the seismogenic zone , loading the fault a little bit faster .
And that may have a relationship to stimulating earthquake activity . "

Seismologists were surprised when tremors were first discovered more than seven years ago , since the rock at that depth -- for the San Andreas Fault , between 15 and 30 kilometers ( 10 to 20 miles ) underground -- is not brittle and subject to fracture , but deformable , like peanut butter .
They called them non-volcanic tremors to distinguish them from tremors caused by fluid -- water or magma -- fracturing and flowing through rock under volcanoes .
It was not clear , however , what caused the non-volcanic tremors , which are on the order of a magnitude 1 earthquake .
To learn more about the source of these tremors , UC Berkeley seismologists began looking for tremors five years ago in seismic recordings from the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault obtained from sensitive bore - hole seismometers placed underground as part of the UC Berkeley 's High - Resolution Seismic Network .
Using eight years of tremor data , Thomas , Bürgmann and Nadeau correlated tremor activity with the effects of the sun and moon on the crust and with the effects of ocean tides , which are driven by the moon .
They found the strongest effect when the pull on the Earth from the sun and moon sheared the fault in the direction it normally breaks .
Because the San Andreas Fault is a right - lateral strike - slip fault , the west side of the fault tends to break north - northwestward , dragging Los Angeles closer to San Francisco .
" When shear stress on a plane parallel to the San Andreas Fault most encourages slipping in its normal slip direction is when we see the maximum tremor rate , " Bürgmann said .
" The stress is many , many orders of magnitude less than the pressure down there , which was really , really surprising .
You essentially could push it with your hand and it would move . "
In fact , the shear stress from the sun , moon and ocean tides amount to around 100 Pascals , or one - thousandth atmospheric pressure , whereas the pressure 25 kilometers underground is on the order of 600 megaPascals , or 6 million times greater .

Nadeau and colleagues reported earlier this year that earthquakes in 2003 and 2004 near the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault increased both tremor activity and stress on the fault itself .
In addition , Nadeau noted , other scientists have shown small tidal effects on tremors in the Cascadia subduction zone , with increased amplitude during certain periods , though they were unable to distinguish between tugs along the fault and tugs across , or normal to , the fault .
" We were really able to tighten the nuts down on whether it is a normal - fault stress change or an along - fault stress change that is stimulating the tremor , " he said .
The fact that tremors are triggered by along - fault shear stress " means that fluids are probably the explanation . "
It may be that tremors only occur on faults where fluid is trapped deep underground with no cracks or fractures allowing it to squirt away , Nadeau added .
That may explain why tremors are not observed on other faults , despite intense searching .
" There is still all lot to learn about tremor and earthquakes in fault zones , " he said .
" The fact that we find tremors adjacent to a locked fault , like the one at Parkfield , makes you think there are some more important relationships going on here , and we need to study it more . "

It was the third time for me to set out in search of the Hume factory .
The first time was on our inaugural haikyo road trip - we hit up Kappa Pia Theme Park and the Volcano Museum by day and searched for the Hume factory by night .
It was pouring it down and we ended up climbing over a fence into a whole different factory , one that turned out to be live , with motion sensor security lights and big humming grids of transformers .
Fail , but a great bit of adventure .
The second time was solo , I hoped to tack it on as a chaser to the Shrine / Castle I went to a month or so ago .
Fail due to train constraints and fading daylight .
This time it was first on our list , and stood no chance of escaping exploration .
Main Warehouse .
So , a factory .
I ’ve been to factories before , both fairly modern , fairly ancient , and fairly demolished .
There are certain things that you do n’t want to miss , certain things you have to climb on , and certain experiences you ought to have .
Here ’s a loose checklist -
Do n’t Miss
– Rusted heavy industrial equipment ( check - huge wheel , lots of chains , hooks , conveyor belts , chutes )
– Old safety manuals , time - sheets , notebooks , etc.. ( semi-check , while searching for an Allen key to fix my tripod )
– Busted open fuse - boxes ( check )
– Archaic control panels crammed with dials , levers , and complex LED flow charts ( check )
– Vantage points to look down on everything and feel like a sniper in HALO ( check )
Must Climb
– Cement towers and chutes ( check )
– Anything with a workman ’s ladder attached ( check , several walkways onto the roof )
Experiences
– A brief scare from a real or assumed security guard potential ( check , though they turned out to be gardeners trimming trees in the adjacent factory block )
We climbed in over a big concrete block , pow - wowed briefly in the main warehouse , and agreed to meet back in an hour .
The warehouse had a lot of stuff hanging down from the ceiling ( chains , control switches , hooks ) and a lot of stuff on the ground ( long trenches , mostly ) but at first not a lot to explore .
I climbed a walkway and hunted out a controller ’s box .
I stood in a corridor of hanging electrical wires and thought - “ huh , neat . ”
The whole factory block was comprised of a huge open yard with a big yellow A - frame loading crane , the main massive warehouse , and the concatenation of cement chutes and storage / cooling vats lumped together beneath the cement tower .
That ’s one thing I do n’t get about cement .
Does it need to be carried on a lot of conveyor belts to become cement ?
Every cement factory has a tower structure with a lot of roller chutes where the cement would slurry down , dropping invariably into big conical vats .
Perhaps in these chutes they are adding materials , making the cement ?
The first factory I went to had the chutes coming down a cliff - side , and I thought maybe it was just a delivery system , from the top of the cliff down .
Now it seems it ’s a necessary part of the process .
Hmm .
It gets heated up , fired up the furnace , then cools as it comes down the chutes ?
That ’s just a guess .
I moved into the second half of the warehouse and met in sequence the two other Mikes , who both warned me of impeding security guards who turned out to be tree cutters .
My tripod broke , so I spent a while searching piles of garbage / tools for an appropriate Allen key .
No such luck .
I eventually found one later in the Volcano Museum but it was the wrong size :(..
Up a ladder .
I was on the roof .
I walked with maximum stealth along the roof for a while .
It later turned out though that the others , who were still inside the warehouse , clearly heard the ninja - like footsteps overhead and assumed it was me .
Ach , what a shame to be so predictable .
From the roof I had to climb into the cement tower through an open window .
I went to the top , wow , what a view !
I tried to draw a bead on someone with a pretend rifle but nobody presented their head to me .
I took a picture of a stool .
The air smelled of birds nests .
Top floor of the cement tower .
At the bottom Mike and Lee were confabulating and gossiping like a pair of old fish - wives .
I left them to it , preferring to climb up the rickety cement chutes .
I did that .
It was quite scary , teetering with only a thin metal netting between me and a long fall onto machinery .
I escaped unharmed though .
Factories !
The next post is probably the long - awaited return to the Volcano Museum .

M. andamanica , a wood - muncher
Deep under the ocean , there is a species of crab that eats trees .
The crab survives by eating wood that has sunk to the ocean floor , comprising trunks and leaves swept into the sea , as well as the odd shipwreck .
Inside the stomach of the crab , also called a squat lobster , are bacteria and fungi that help digest the wood .
The discovery , published in the journal Marine Biology , adds to evidence that these so - called ' wood falls ' help support special underwater communities .
" At first sight , it seems improbable , " says PhD student Caroline Hoyoux of the University of Liège , Belgium .
" Munidopsis andamanica is a species only found in the deep sea and yet it eats ' terrestrial food ' , " she says .
Sunken wood degraded by wood - boring bivalves Ms Hoyoux and colleagues based at the University of Liege and at the Natural History Museum and Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris , France made the discovery while studying which animals colonise wood falls .
Among worms , bivalves and a host of crustacean species they found Munidopsis andamanica , a species known as a galatheid crab , or squat lobster .
Further investigation of the crabs mouthparts and gut contents revealed they feed exclusively on wood .
" We were surprised , because crustaceans are often regarded as predators or scavengers .
The fact I found M. andamanica consistently feeding on vegetal remains , especially wood , instead of eating molluscs or [ worms ] breaks with the general a priori about the diet of squat lobsters , " says Ms Hoyoux .
Sunken treasure
The importance of wood falls and the communities they host are only just being appreciated .
Although first discovered in the late 19th century , it was not until the late 1970s that scientists began to study the animals that colonise them .
Until this century , these were mainly thought to be wood - boring molluscs .
" However , crustaceans are the second most important group , according to the number of species and individuals , " says Ms Hoyoux .
Another species of galatheid crab clings to a piece of wood
She is studying wood fall crustaceans for her PhD thesis and as part of the international DiWOOD project , which seeks to learn more about animals colonising deep - sea wood .
" The wood falls that we study are principally natural tree debris that have sunk and reached the deep sea floor .
They consist of real wood as well as plant fragments like leaves , seagrass , coconuts etc . "
To collect the animals , Ms Hoyoux and colleagues mimic real wood falls by immersing mesh boxes baited with wood .
The mesh is wide enough to allow crustacean larvae to colonise the wood , but too small the allow the animals to escape as they grow .
After a year , these boxes are brought to the surface and the animals collected .
Animal riches
Among those found are 15 species of decapod , one species of isopod and one amphipod , including hermit crabs , shrimp and galatheid crabs of the genus Munidopsis and Munida .
The squat lobster is thought to bite off small splinters of wood which it then passes through a ' gastric - mill ' of strong teeth used to grind the wood down .
A branch or trunk trawled from hundreds of metres underwater
The crab 's gut then contains bacteria and fungi that produce enzymes that help digest the cellulose in the wood .
The ecological importance of wood falls rivals that of whale falls , where highly specialised communities of deep - sea animals colonise the bodies of dead whales and dolphins that drift to the sea bed .
" Although they are not as quantifiable as whale falls , they could be more important , " says Ms Hoyoux .
" It is strongly assumed that these vegetable debris constitute an important and significant contribution of food to the deep - sea fauna . "
They could even be important stepping stones in the colonisation of more extreme deep - sea environments such as hydrothermal vents , say the researchers .

It was a year stuffed to the gills with egregious behavior from spectacularly ridiculous people .
With so many crude epithets at our disposal to describe these knuckleheads , none is so apropos as the one sobriquet that aptly describes quitters , hecklers , teabaggers , extortionists , and balloon hoaxers alike : douchebags .
Given the explosion of douchiness all around us , we had to dig deep to select these profiles in ignominy , but here they are — our awards for this year ’s 20 biggest douchebags in America .
And the Douchies go to …
1. Glenn Beck
In an era of rampant right - wing paranoia , no one has done more to fan the flames of conspiratorial idiocy than FOX News Channel ’s Glenn Beck .
A faux populist and self - described “ rodeo clown , ” Beck is a champion for reality - impaired Americans everywhere who lack the ability to think , reason , or spell .
Normally , someone fitting Beck ’s psychological profile would simply be left alone on a park bench to shout his unhinged insanity at squirrels and pigeons .
But thanks to FOX News ( and presumably regular injections of Thorazine ) , Beck commands a 2.6 million - strong wingnut army hell - bent on taking back America from all the gay Marxist Muslim illegal immigrant socialists running our government .
Douchiest Achievements : Beck accused Obama of being a “ racist ” who has a “ deep - seated hatred for white people , ” which led to an advertiser exodus from his show ( not to worry , he still has sponsors peddling penis enlargers and egg cookers ) .
In his most laughable moment , Beck claimed he had deciphered a secret code proving Obama was trying to create an “ Oligarhy , ” which is a form of government that steals letters from illiterate morons and gives them to the wealthy few .
Other Beck conspiracy theories include accusations that the Obama administration has secret plans to force abortions and put sterilants in the drinking water to control population ; use health care reform to recreate Nazi eugenics ; and create a “ civilian national security force ” just like Hitler did .
Beck is a man so passionate about his convictions that he wo n’t hesitate to rub on Vick ’s Vapor rub to get the tears flowing so that he can sobbingly proclaim , “ I love my country — but I fear for it ! ”
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Declaring that everyone is Hitler , except for himself .
Quote : “ Satan ’s mentally challenged younger brother . ”

2. Kanye West
Yo Glenn Beck , I ’m really happy for you and Imma let you finish , but Kanye West was the biggest douchebag of 2009 !
Of 2009 !
Despite his talents as a rapper and hip - hop artist , Kanye tends to be known more for his freakishly large ego than his music .
He once said “ God chose me .
He made the path for me .
I ’m God ’s vessel . ”
God ’s vessel ?
More like the Lord ’s douchebag .
Douchiest Achievement : At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , Kanye West cemented himself in douche history when he jumped up on stage to interrupt Taylor Swift ’s award acceptance speech .
“ Imma let you finish , but Beyonce had one of the best videos of the year . ”
Or something like that .
It ’s hard to remember what was actually said since the Internet was quickly flooded with so many spoofs of the event .
No less an authority than President Obama officially declared Kanye a “ jackass . ”
As Conan O’Brien joked , “ Not since ‘ yes , we can ’ has Obama found a slogan so many Americans can get behind . ”
We ’re pretty sure that ’s why he won the Nobel Peace Prize .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Anywhere but the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards .
Quote : “ My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live . ” – Kanye West

3. Jon and Kate Gosselin
Jon & Kate Plus 8 started as a peek into the life of a couple beset ( through fertility treatments ) with sextuplets and twins .
The show quickly became a chronicle of serial emasculation , a testament to birth control , and a horrific meta-vessel of overexposure and gilded mega - breeder entitlement ( e.g. , renewal of vows in Hawaii , hair plugs for Jon / tummy tuck for Kate , McMultiplesMansion in Pennsylvania , shark - jumping crossover with American Chopper ) .
Soon enough , the Gosselins ’ marriage cratered , TLC decided to dump Jon from the show , and then he blew up the whole gravy train – for the sake of the children , of course , and not because Big Daddy was getting cut out .
( Hopefully , the TV residuals can help him cover the costs of the recent psycho-renovation of his Manhattan bachelor pad . )
Douchiest Achievements : Kate : Multiple TV appearances where she expressed her heartbreak , clutched her wedding ring , reaffirmed her devotion to her litter , and turned on the waterworks ; the Access Hollywood outtake where she told her parched daughter to get her own fucking water bottle ; shooting a pilot with Paula Deen ( ?!? ) for an umpteenth clucking - hen coffee - klatch morning show ( working title : Butter and the Beast ) ; and , sweet Jebus , having that hairdo on purpose .
Jon : nailing any 20ish chick within a 500 - foot radius , including schoolteachers , tabloid reporters , the babysitter , and the daughter of Kate ’s plastic surgeon ; taking a couple hundred grand from the joint bank account , presumably to replenish the roofies - and - lube fund ; breaking free from Kate ’s ballbusting shackles , only to submit to the 16 - ton testes - steamroller that is Nancy Grace ; fraternizing with world ’s worst celebrity dad Michael Lohan and Ed Hardy good - taste assassin Christian Audigier , thus ascending to his rightful place in the newly - formed Axis of Douchebag .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Not seen at all .
( This is only Kind of a Lark ’s and the western world ’s most fervent hope .
Actual results may , and likely will , vary . )
Quote :
Any quotes from these losers would only feed the monster .
We ’ve got to draw the line somewhere .
( For the sake of the children ! )

4. Sarah Palin
Most sentient Americans rightly concluded during the 2008 election that Sarah Palin was a blathering idiot .
But in 2009 , we learned that she is also a maniacal , conspiratorial , paranoid douchebag who is here to stay .
This , of course , is bad news for American democracy in general and Republicans in particular , who are still too busy ogling her mavericky caboose to notice she ’s leading them straight off a cliff .
But it ’s good news if you ’re a Democrat who enjoys a spectacular trainwreck or a comedian who likes punchlines that write themselves .
Douchiest Achievements : Palin claimed an Obama “ death panel ” could kill her child .
She publicly trashed her daughter ’s baby daddy ( and fellow douchebag ) Levi Johnston as part of a bitter feud that became so ridiculous , even Vladimir Putin could n’t believe what he was seeing from his house .
She accused David Letterman of being a pervert because of a joke she did not get .
She published a score - settling work of fiction that was best summed up by a former McCain aide who said it contained “ elements of truth underlying a narrative that is completely false . ”
She gave her seal of approval to the “ Birthers ” ( see Orly Taitz below ) who claim Obama was born in Kenya , saying his birth certificate is “ rightfully ” an issue with the American public .
She raised the specter of a Palin / Glenn Beck 2012 ticket , presumably because the world is going to end anyway .
Not to mention the fact that she quit as governor after only two and a half years for reasons that only William Shatner could possibly make sense of .
Quitter Palin somehow managed to out - laughingstock the laughingstock she became during the 2008 campaign , neatly encapsulated by the year ’s best bumper sticker : Palin 2012 – 2014 1/2 .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Writing a second book titled “ Going Shopping ” and quitting halfway through .
Quote : “ Only dead fish go with the flow . ” – Sarah Palin , quitting , July 3 , 2009

5. Nadya Suleman , aka ” Octomom ”
Apparently taking note that when it comes to kids , the number “ 8 ” is a sure - fire laser beam to media success ( “ Eight is Enough , ” “ Jon and Kate Plus Eight , ” “ Eight Men Out ” , etc. ) , Suleman decided that the best thing she could do for her future as an unemployed single mother of six , was to pop out eight additional kids she could n’t take care of .
Douchiest Achievements :
Where does one begin ?
Separated from her husband in 2000 because they could n’t conceive children together …Already had overcompensated in the world of population control by having six kids through in vitro fertilization after the separation … worked in a California state mental hospital from 1997 - 2006 – probably would have benefited from some in - patient services …ran up a hospital bill between $ 1.5 and $ 3 million dollars that she ca n’t pay … was offered multiple deals to star in porno movies … had plastic surgery to look more like Angelina Jolie , then all the kids — all she ’s missing is Brad Pitt and millions of dollars .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : For the love of God , doing anything but having more children .
Quote : “ If I do n’t do what I need to do in the media to take care of and support the kids , I ca n’t take care of them . ”
~ Fathead
6. Michele Bachmann
Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann represents the 6th district of Minnesota in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Those people deserve your pity , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
Perhaps they should also blame God , who apparently told her to run .
The Lord works in mysterious ways .
Douchiest Achievements : Bat - shit crazy often comes up when describing Rep. Bachmann .
She ’s not only against gay marriage , but against gays and lesbians themselves , saying they suffer from “ sexual dysfunction . ”
Intelligent Design sounds so good to her that she believes it should be taught in schools , but if you try to teach volunteerism to kids , you ’re creating reeducation camps .
She called upon her supporters to slit their wrists in order to protest health care legislation , yet how will they pay to get stitched up ?
In a battle of nut jobs , she once took down Glenn “ King Nut Job ” Beck by arguing that taking the national census will lead to putting people in internment camps .
Which makes perfect sense … if you ’re insane .
( Warning : staring at this video could cause you to become stupider , so watch through a pinhole in a piece of cardboard ) .
To Bachmann , socialism might as well be the devil ’s work .
She is against ANY kind of government handout .
She will leap on her high horse and denounce ANYBODY getting aid from the government .
So the discovery of her family farm receiving almost a quarter of a million dollars in government subsides makes you wonder if she is going to denounce herself .
Perhaps call for an investigation into herself .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Wearing an aluminum foil hat to sessions of Congress for fear of Democrats stealing her thoughts .
Quote : “ During the last 100 days we have seen an orgy .
It would make any local smorgasbord embarrassed …
The government spent its wad by April 26 . ” ( On a side note , a 100 - day orgy is not too shabby . )
~ Warren
7. Tiger Woods
While fellow douchie Nadya Suleman felt 14 kids was the right amount , Woods felt 14 mistresses put the tiger in his tank .
The world ’s greatest golfer went from one of the most admired and respected athletes ( if you call golf a sport and not a recreational activity ) to the butt of late night comedians after admitting that he has not been the most faithful of husbands .
Douchiest Achievements : Neighbors found him lying shoeless and snoring on his Isleworth street after he plowed his SUV into a fire hydrant and tree … Tiger Woods ’ website buries any mention of his transgressions , but does advise to “ play the chunk - and - run , ” which in non -golf terms is another way of saying “ bang a Perkins waitress in your Escalade , then dump her on the side of the road ” … to his credit , most of the alleged mistresses look nothing like his hot , blonde wife Elin…lost millions in endorsements as sponsors bailed …real name is Eldrick Tont Woods which would make him a douchebag regardless of any other activities … athletic equipment maker Puma is considering signing Elin as a spokesperson for their new Swedish - inspired clothing line called Tretorn , which roughly translated means , “ Tiger castration . ”
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Golfing on some of the most beautiful courses in the world , earning millions of dollars in prize and endorsement money , and sleeping with a variety of hot brunettes .
What can I say , Americans are a forgiving people .
Quote : “ I need to focus my attention on being a better husband , father , and person . ”
You think ?
~ Fathead
8. Carrie Prejean
Carrie Prejean ’s story is , at the heart of it , the result of a chain - reaction clusterdouche that was too big for the circus tent of the Miss USA pageant to contain .
If Miss USA head honcho ( and first - ballot D - Bag Hall of Famer ) Donald Trump had n’t decided to install Black Eyed Peas punching bag / John Madden of the jizz - telestrator Perez Hilton as a “ celebrity ” judge , Miss California USA Prejean likely would have skated through by the Vaseline on her teeth and claimed the big sash and tiara .
But Hilton laid the gay marriage question on her and thus played midwife to the unholy test - tube spawn of Anita Bryant and Chauncey Gardiner .
Douchiest Achievements :
Her artless defense of “ opposite marriage ” ( a G.W. Bushism - by - Proxy if ever there was one ) and resultant 1st runner - up finish should ’ve been the last we ’d heard of her , outside of a future co-host job on “ Fox & Friends . ”
But in a country that likes its martyrs pretty , telegenic and self - inflicted ( see : Palin , Sarah ) , Prejean of Arc found the gravy train of right - wing celebrity a more appealing option than the actual fulfillment of her Miss California USA duties .
Pageant officials took back their title , St. Carrie sued them for libel , and in the most literal case of tit - for - tat ever seen , they countersued to recover the cost of her breast implants .
Our Lady of Christian Family Values settled out of court when pageant lawyers produced a video of her rowing her little man in the boat ashore .
Combined with all those pesky topless shots that emerged , that put a bit of a dent in the wholesome image deal ( let ’s see if she gets that conservative pin-up calendar gig in 2010 ) .
And when she topped it all off by achieving the impossible – making Larry King look like a hard - hitting interviewer – you knew Carrie Prejean had taken a sow ’s ear of a year and truly turned it into a Golden Douchebag .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : In every Young Republican ’s wet dream , and probably on Vivid Video ’s website .
Quote : “ I do n’t see anywhere in the Bible where it says you should n’t get breast implants . ” – Prejean .
Little did she know that an early translation of John 8:7 read , “ He that is without sin among you let him cast the first synthetic sac of saline fluid at her . ”
~loukip
9. Joe Lieberman
In the long history of the U.S. Senate , never has there been a bigger back - stabbing , flip - flopping , soul - selling , cock - blocking douchebag than Joe Lieberman .
Douchiest Achievements :
As the 60th Democratic vote , Lieberman reveled in his roll as legislative killjoy .
Nowhere was that more apparent than in the health care debate , where Joe-mentia held the bill hostage by threatening to help Republicans filibuster it to death if Democrats refused to meet his demands .
Among them : killing the Medicare expansion , which he had supported three months earlier .
Because that ’s what soulless , hypocritical douchebags do .
His healthcare treachery was a fitting capstone to a decade of douchiness .
In fact , every bad thing that happened during the last 10 years is basically Joe Lieberman ’s fault — from selling out Al Gore during the Florida recount to helping George W. Bush forward his agenda at every turn to being the leading Democratic cheerleader for the Iraq war to ensuring that thousands of Americans will die needlessly because they lack health insurance .
Thank God Al Franken had the good sense to tell him to STFU on the Senate floor .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Being mistaken for Droopy Dog
Quote : “ You know what is worse than being sick and not having health insurance ?
Having to sit through the Lieberman filibuster that kept it from you . ”

10 . Teabaggers
Most people look up to teabaggers , and some gag just thinking about them .
Oh wait , you mean we ’re not talking about men who dip their testicles in your mouth ?
We ’re talking about the right - wing conservative teabaggers ?
Yeah , those guys are dicks .
They are the second most popular right - wing group inadvertently named after a sexual act .
The first being the “ Dirty Sanchez ’s ” famous for their anti-immigration stand .
The problem is Tea Baggers do n’t seem to realize that they are n’t original .
There were people who stood up to an oppressive government , fighting the Big Brother tactics of the previous administration .
Back then we called them “ liberals . ”
Douchiest Achievements :
Here is where you would normally read about all of the douchie things Tea Baggers did this year , but there are almost to many things to talk about .
Someone once said , a picture speaks a thousand words ( although in a douchebag picture , many of those words are spelled wrong ) .
So instead please enjoy the following video from a teabagger rally that occurred this year and take in the full power of their douchieness :

11 . Mark Sanford
Popular governor of South Carolina who suddenly , and without word to any of his staff or security detail , disappeared for four days in June leaving the state without its chief executive .
Thanks to Sanford ’s notorious aversion to having a security staff with him , and the revenge motive of a fellow politician , the governor was discovered to have been carrying on a longtime - affair with a woman in Argentina .
Douchiest Achievements :
Told his staff that he was “ hiking the Appalachian Trail ” when in fact he was “ banging the Argentinean tail ” … Charged with over three dozen ethics violations including using state aircraft to attend one of his son ’s sporting events .. a subcommittee of the State Legislature recommended censuring Sanford for bringing “ ridicule , dishonor , disgrace and shame ” on South Carolina … Wife filed for divorce in December …released holiday message to South Carolina that began “ This time of year offers each of us a chance like no other to refocus on what is really important in life – things like spending time with friends and family ” … was the last governor to accept economic stimulus money for his state nearly missing out on $ 8 billion in aid .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Publishing his memoirs entitled “ Argentina on 10 Ethics Violations a Day ”
Quote : “ I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificently gentle kisses , or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curves of your hips , the erotic beauty of you holding yourself ( or two magnificent parts of yourself ) in the faded glow of night ’s light — but hey , that would be going into the sexual details …. ” – Sanford e-mail to Maria Shapur

12 . Robert Joe Halderman , aka Joe the Dumbass
Oh Joe , to be a schlub of a CBS News producer who ’s struggling to make your child support payments .
Your ex-girlfriend , Late Show staffer Stephanie Birkitt , has broken your heart .
But hey , what ’s this in her diary ?
She banged her old boss , David Letterman ?
Goodbye deadbeat dad , hello alleged master criminal and would - be screenwriter !
Two million simoleons can buy a lot of Happy Meals .
What could possibly go wrong … besides , uh , everything ?
Douchiest Achievements :
Thinking that , after prior run-ins with a dogged and clinically insane stalker and a Montana handyman who plotted to kidnap his son , Letterman would roll over when confronted with evidence that he dipped his pen in Worldwide Pants ’ ink .
Also , asking that the hush money be paid by check , to sidestep any tax issues .
( Well , at least he did n’t ask for an enlarged check delivered by Publishers Clearing House . )
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : As an uncompensated producer of most of truTV ’s daytime programming , when coverage of his criminal trial begins .
Quote : “ I ’m an employee in good standing , but should I be fired , mysteriously …
If my house burns down …
Any number of things that , I do n’t know this person ( Letterman ) , I ’ve never met this person , I have no idea who or what he is or is capable of . ” – Halderman , speaking to Letterman ’s lawyer during “ negotiations ” to sell his “ screenplay . ”
Evidently , Joe suspected foul play in Larry “ Bud ” Melman ’s disappearance back in ’93 .
~loukip
13 . Rep. Joe Wilson
Inspired by the teabaggers who spent the summer shouting down politicians at town hall meetings , Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - Tourette ’s ) attained his one and only note of distinction when he broke with centuries of decorum and heckled President Obama during a joint session of Congress .
After Obama said illegal immigrants would n’t be covered under health reform legislation , Wilson shouted “ You Lie ! ” , apparently believing he was on an episode of The Jerry Springer Show .
Douchiest Achievements : Wilson , who was mentored by notorious racist Strom Thurmond and been affiliated with a neo-Confederate group for years , is passionate about stopping any government - run health care plans , except when he ’s busy being a hypocrite .
As a retired Army National Guard colonel , Wilson receives generous government health benefits , as do his four sons in the armed services .
And in 2003 , Wilson voted to provide federal funds for illegal immigrants ’ healthcare as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug bill .
Way to stay classy , Old Yeller .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Fitted with a strait jacket and restraint mask at the State of the Union Address
Quote : “ What ’s so ironic is that the health care plan that Joe Wilson so angrily opposes would get him the Prozac he so desperately needs . ”

14 . Levi Johnston
High school hockey stud who , in a fit of perfect timing , knocked up Bristol Palin just in time for her mom ’s selection as the Republican nominee for vice president , effectively castrating her “ abstinence only ” campaign platform .
Douchiest Achievements : Agreed to pose for Playgirl magazine after breaking off engagement with Bristol , bringing new meaning to the phrase , “ that ’s one big zamboni ! ” … a high school dropout , he was working as an apprentice electrician before quitting that as well ( seems like he would fit right in with the Palins ) to try and become an actor …attended the Teen Choice Awards with comedienne Kathy Griffin … did a commercial for the Wonderful Pistachio company showing him opening a pistachio with a bodyguard nearby and the voice - over saying “ Now Levi Johnston does it with protection . ”
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Starring in a porn movie entitled “ Johnston and his Johnson ”
Quote : “ I just get naked , that ’s what I do . ” – as told to US Magazine

15 . Richard Heene , Balloon Douche
Fame , to paraphrase the late Rick James , is a hell of a drug .
Even the pale kind of fame , the crummy street - grade shit cut with baby powder from the 99 - cent store , can keep some fiends coming back for more .
For a prime example , look no further than Richard Heene , the failed actor , financially strapped handyman and storm - chasing , UFO - chasing and attention - chasing crackpot with a checkered past .
Heene was n’t satisfied with two appearances on Wife Swap and pulled his family into a ridiculous and unsustainable gambit .
Alas , he neglected to remember the first rule of any dealer , be it Avon Barksdale or ABC : the customer ’s first hit is free , but after that they have to pay and pay dearly .
Douchiest Achievements :
First douchy achievement – naming his youngest son after a bird of prey .
Then six years later , Heene untethered a homebrewed weather balloon in the Colorado sky and told 911 dispatchers that young Falcon had stowed away in the flimsy dirigible .
After a frantic 50 - mile chase , the balloon crashed with no sign of the boy .
Aw shucks , that l ittle scamp had been hiding in a cardboard box in the attic the whole time !
Too bad the tale got blown two miles high when Falcon reminded his dad during a CNN interview that they “ did this for the show ” – the show being a project Heene unsuccessfully peddled to various producers .
( The theme song , however , is a crude garage - rock earworm . )
After three days of a rapidly failing smell test – punctuated by poor Falcon ’s impersonations of a mama bird feeding her nestlings – authorities finally declared the episode a hoax .
Richard and wife Mayumi Heene pled guilty and were sentenced to a combo of jail and work release , with the special proviso that they could n’t cash in with the media for four years .
Special Award for Supporting Douche Nozzle :
A three - way tie between CNN , MSNBC and FOX News for taking the bait big - time on a patently insane non-story that any remedial physics student could have called shenanigans on in three nanoseconds .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Trying to flag down potential new clients in the Fort Collins Lowe ’s parking lot .
Quote : “ It ’s the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down .
Before that , the only way to get from East Germany to West Germany was your dad would have to put you in a balloon . ”

16 . Health Insurance Companies
The health insurance industry , for those of you who do n’t know ( and there are about 45 million of you who do n’t ) is an industry designed to help people in the time when they need it most .
In theory , you pay them so that when you are sick or hurt you will be able to get the medical care you need … in theory .
Of course , in theory , communism works , in theory .
( Apologies to The Simpsons for hijacking that joke . )
Douchiest Achievements :
The health insurance industry fears being regulated and is doing everything in its power to keep from having to do the right thing .
They are crying poor mouth to whoever will listen , saying reform will bankrupt them and hurt business .
Trying to hide the fact that they are making over $ 200 Billion in profits a year … that ’s PROFITS , not revenue , PROFITS !
Just for the uneducated ( like this woman ) , profit is what you take home after you ’ve covered all your costs .
That includes the roughly $ 12.4 million paid to health insurance CEOs ( median annual salary ) .
They propagate lies about made up “ death panels ” using uneducated people to pass along the message ( like this woman ) .
The reality is , “ death panels ” are thriving under the CURRENT system , and the reform is trying to do away with them .
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : Bleeding Americas sick dry ( literally and figuratively ) , in other words , business as usual .

17 . Sen. John Ensign
Another year , another member of Congress caught rocking out with his cock out .
Big whoop , right ?
But this veterinarian - turned - lawmaker added primo vinegar to the water to make himself a douchebag of distinction .
Hypocritical supporter of the Clinton impeachment ?
Check .
Denier of equal access to matrimonial misery for LGBT couples , while giving his own union a Cleveland Steamer ?
Check .
Fucker of a good friend ’s wife who gets his daddy to make it rain strip - club style when the shit hits the fan ?
Somewhere in Florida , Carl Hiaasen wishes he conceived a plot that sleazy and improbable .
Douchiest Achievements : While Doug and Cindy Hampton are houseguests of the Ensigns after a burglary of their own home , Sen. Ensign begins his clandestine filibustering .
After Doug ( not only a friend , but an Ensign staffer ) finds out , Ensign pulls strings to shunt him into a lobbying gig , an apparent Congress ethics violation .
Soon after , casino exec Mike Ensign ( aka Pops the Fixer ) showers the Hamptons with a $ 96,000 “ gift ” that fails to get disclosed to the Senate .
Because they considered him a weak - willed schmuck who would n’t end the affair of his own volition , Ensign ’s C Street / Family brethren watch him compose a hand - written , half - assed breakup note to Cindy Hampton , then chaperone him to FedEx to make sure the missive is delivered .
They keep fucking for another half a year .
Special Award for Supporting Douche Nozzle : Fellow U.S. Senator and C Street / Family crypto-fundamentalist - fascist Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , who counseled Ensign to pay off the Hamptons and then negotiated the details .
When pressed to explain his role in the whole shitshow , Coburn clams up and claims privilege as both an ordained deacon and a physician .
What privileged doctor - patient communications Coburn had with Ensign seem kinda hinky , considering Coburn ’s an OB / GYN .
He ’d have a stronger case if he were a proctologist .

18 . Orly Taitz , aka “ Birther Queen ”
A kind of superhuman who is equal parts lawyer , dentist , and real estate agent , Orly Taitz is the leading figure behind the “ Birther ” movement — the reality - challenged band of conspiracy nuts who claim that Obama is a Muslim who was born in Kenya , and thus is not eligible to be president .
Douchiest achievements :
Taitz went on a media blitz and hysterically waved around a supposed Kenyan birth certificate for Obama , acting as though she had found the Holy Grail .
The document , which was riddled with errors , turned out to be a forgery created by an Internet prankster .
( You , too , can have your very own Kenyan birth certificate , thanks to the magic of the Internets ) .
Undeterred , Taitz went on to file multiple lawsuits in an attempt to overturn Obama ’s election , and was subsequently slapped with tens of thousands of dollars in fines for “ wasting judicial resources ” with her “ frivolous and sanctionable conduct . ”

19 . Dick Cheney
Dick Cheney was President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 .
He was referred to as “ Vice President ” to throw off his enemies , but there was little doubt who was in charge .
Just like with the Sith there is a Master and an Apprentice .
Cheney was the Master .
Douchiest Achievements : Dick Cheney spent the previous two terms in office inside a cone of silence .
He did n’t speak to anybody about anything unless it was carefully thought out talking points .
This year he had an opinion on EVERYTHING .
Obama and the Democrats could n’t cut a fart without Cheney weighing in .
When Obama bowed to the Emperor of Japan , Cheney called him weak .
Although Cheney must have forgotten that his old boss , George H.W. Bush , did the same thing .
Hell , the senior Bush did Obama one better , and puked on the Prime Minister .
Now that ’s strength !
When Obama discussed moving troops out of major cities in Iraq in June of 2009 , Cheney went on record saying what a horrible idea it was .
Lucky for us , Jon Stewart was there to point out that this plan originated with Bush .
Cheney lashed out at Obama when the president promised an end to harsh interrogation techniques , saying it will make America unsafe .
It ’s an odd statement considering those harsh “ torture ” methods were supposedly stopped in 2004 , according to Cheney .

20 . Michael Steele
A fter watching the Democratic Party position an African - American and a woman as their top two candidates for president in 2008 , the Republican Party knew they had to react and react strongly .
Their first move was to make Michael Steele the head of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) and their second move was to elevate “ the douche from Wasilla ” ( see Sarah Palin ) to be their vice presidential nominee .
Both moves have worked out just peachy .
Douchiest Achievements : Attempted to modernize the Republican Party by bringing a “ hip - hop ” makeover to the GOP … after taking his position under the guise that he would bring the conservative philosophy to the young , Hispanics and African - Americans — by far the groups with the highest number of uninsured — he then joined hands with the Tea Party movement in trying to kill health care reform …
Took heat from his own party when it was revealed he was collecting $ 20,000 per speech even while making better than $ 220,000 in his role as chairman of the RNC … claimed that the GOP argument against gay marriage should be that it ’s “ bad for small business . ”
Most Likely To Be Seen in 2010 : As guest host of “ Pimp my Ride ”

Unique Times -- and the future
In various contexts throughout this volume [ GeoDestinies ] it is pointed out that we now live in unique times , unlike any in the past , and unlike what any will be in the future .
Yet many people in developed countries do not realize the unique years we have had since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution .
This fact , as a framework to understand the present and what lies ahead cannot be overemphasized .
We have developed technology by which we have exploited the Earth ’s resources to a degree never before seen and which , in the case of non-renewable resources – fossil fuels , and metals as well as nonmetals , can never be repeated .
We have drawn both from the past , and also mortgaged the next few centuries at least by degrading the vital renewable resources of soil and freshwater , which are not renewable within the span of several lifetimes .
This is in contrast to many centuries of history when , lacking technology of today , things changed very slowly .
All this has resulted in a seismic difference in prospects for future generations .
We , in these industrial centuries , and those seeking now to industrialize , have left very little for those who will exist for the duration of the presumably million years of life of a typical mammalian species .
We have done all this for enjoying ( for some of us ) a brief degree of affluence beyond anything ever before seen , and almost certainly will not happen again .
Think about it as you drive your car to the supermarket with myriad varieties of food from far and near , or to the shops at the mall , on asphalt - paved roads in a vehicle most of which are powered by fossil fuel directly or indirectly .
The future of less will arrive for citizens of industrial and developing countries by small increments of change , but which , in retrospect will combine to be seen as a century of profound changes to a degree of rapidity and consequence as never before .
We now live moment by moment , only moderately aware of these incremental changes .
It is unlikely , although not impossible , that there will be catastrophic changes in lifestyles and economies .
But slowly and inevitably the related problems of resource depletion and population growth will become increasingly apparent .
We have the opportunity in various ways to modify the impact of these events , but so far there is little evidence this is being done .
The industrial world and its political framework seems committed to the road of increased consumption and more people to consume , for that is what keeps the game going – for the moment , but is unsustainable very far into the future .
Walter Youngquist , November 2009
Another skirmish has broken out in the long - running battle between climate scientists and so - called sceptics , with the hacking of email messages between some of the world 's leading researchers on global temperature trends .
But as usually happens in the blogosphere , this episode is generating more heat than light and is likely to lead to more public confusion over the causes of climate change .
For the past few years , a small group of climate change ' sceptics ' have been poring over scientific journal papers that report historical trends in temperatures from around the world , as recorded by directly by thermometers and other instruments , and by ' proxies ' , such as tree rings .
Their primary objective has been to seek out evidence that global warming has been invented by climate researchers who fake their data .
Among their main targets have been papers published by research teams led by Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University and Phil Jones at the University of East Anglia , and particularly those featuring the famous ' hockey stick ' graph , showing that average temperature in the northern hemisphere was relatively stable and constant for most of the last couple of millennia , but rose dramatically upwards in the last 100 years .
This graph appeared prominently in the landmark Third Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2001 , which concluded that " most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations " .
The attacks on the hockey stick graph led the United States National Academy of Sciences to carry out an investigation , concluding in 2006 that although there had been no improper conduct by the researchers , they may have expressed higher levels of confidence in their main conclusions than was warranted by the evidence .
The ' sceptics ' believe they have been vindicated and have presented the hockey stick graph as proof that global warming is not occurring .
In doing so , they have ignored the academy 's other conclusion that " surface temperature reconstructions for periods prior to the industrial era are only one of multiple lines of evidence supporting the conclusion that climatic warming is occurring in response to human activities , and they are not the primary evidence " .
More importantly , these skeptics have not overturned the well - established basic physics of the greenhouse effect , namely that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and increasing its concentration in the atmosphere causes the earth to warm .
They also have not managed to make melting glaciers and rising sea levels , or any other evidence of warming , disappear into thin air .
But they have managed to confuse some of the public about the causes of climate change .
Over the past five years , Mann and Jones in particular have been subjected not only to legitimate scrutiny by other researchers , but also to a co-ordinated campaign of personal attacks on their reputation by ' sceptics ' .
If the hacked e-mails are genuine , they only show that climate researchers are human , and that they speak badly in private about ' sceptics ' who accuse them of fraud .
It is inevitable as we approach the crucial meeting in conference in Copenhagen in December that the sceptics would try some stunt to try to undermine a global agreement on climate change .
There is no smoking gun , but just a lot of smoke without fire .

Abstract
With the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the idea of human rights came into its own on the world stage .
More than anything , the Declaration was a response to the Holocaust , to both its perpetrators and the failure of the rest of the world adequately to come to the aid of its victims .
Since that year , however , we have seen many more cases of mass murder .
Think of China , Bali , Cambodia , Ethiopia , Guatemala , the former Yugoslavia , Rwanda , and now Darfur .
Of course one could always claim that such horrors would have been even more frequent if not for the Declaration .
But I want to argue otherwise .
For I believe that human rights have contributed to making mass murder more , rather than less , likely .
To be clear , my concern is specifically with the language of human rights , not the values it expresses , values which I certainly endorse .
The problem with this language is that it is abstract .
And the problem with abstraction is that it demotivates , it ' unplugs ' us from the ' moral sources , ' as Charles Taylor would call them , which empower us to act ethically .
After showing why , I go on to describe how the rise of human rights has constituted an ironic tragedy of sorts for those philosophers who have attempted to lend it intellectual support .
On the whole , they may be divided into two groups .
One , led by cosmopolitans such as Martha Nussbaum and Thomas Pogge , tries to interlock rights within systematic theories of justice , thus fixing the priorities between them .
The other , led by value pluralists such as Isaiah Berlin , Stuart Hampshire , and Bernard Williams , rejects such theories as infeasible and asserts that the best we can do when rights conflict is to negotiate .
Yet both approaches , I argue , are counter - productive .
LONDON ( AP ) 
Four passenger trains broke down in the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain , stranding more than 2,000 passengers for hours on Saturday , many without heat , light or water .
Eurostar executives suspended service , blaming wintry weather conditions on the French side of the English Channel for the breakdowns in the trains from Paris .
In the afternoon , Eurostar announced on its Web site that there would be “ limited service ” on Sunday and discouraged unnecessary travel .
The company ’s chief executive , Richard Brown , said the problems began because of the abrupt temperature change when trains traveling through extremely cold air in France entered the warm tunnel .
The train service links London to Paris and Brussels .
Fatigued passengers arrived in London 10 hours late after a long night trapped on trains , where they said some people suffered panic attacks because of lack of fresh air in dark , unheated cars .

Burmese Pythons in Florida - Current Status of the " Florida Python "
© 2019 , Brandon Cornett |
All rights reserved
Burmese pythons are one of the largest snakes in the world .
They can be found in the rainforest regions of Southeast Asia , and also in ... the Florida Everglades .
Yes , you read that correctly .
This massive constrictor is now well established in the Everglades National Park and other parts of the Sunshine State .
This article explains the history of Burmese pythons in Florida , as well as the current status of this invasive / non-native species .
A few months ago , a woman emailed me a picture of a large snake moving across her front lawn .
She lived in the suburbs of southern Florida , and the snake was a Burmese python ( Python molurus bivittatus ) .
It was a full - grown Burmese too , probably more than twelve feet long based on the photo .
We had a brief discussion about the snake , by way of email , and the woman told me she sees them in her yard and around her neighborhood frequently -- probably twice a month .
My initial reaction was : " What ?
Burmese pythons are invading Florida neighborhoods !
What is going on here ? "
I had known for years that this non-native snake species was establishing itself in that area , but I had no idea how widespread they had become .
So I did some research and read everything I could find on the subject of Burmese pythons in Florida .
This document is the result of that research .
History of an Invasion
How did Burmese pythons populate the Florida Everglades , anyway ?
Where did these snakes come from ?
How are they thriving in an ecosystem so far from their native habitat ?
To answer these questions , we must go back to the early 1990s .
Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992 , and it damaged quite a few zoos , pet stores , exotic animal warehouses , and wildlife refuges in the process .
Many of the escaped animals -- ranging from monkeys to mountain lions -- were rounded up after the storm .
Some , unfortunately , were put down .
But many animals eluded capture .
It has been documented that a large ( but unknown ) number of Burmese pythons were " liberated " by Hurricane Andrew , escaping into the Florida Everglades and other parts of the state .
It is also likely that irresponsible pet keepers contributed to this problem , though to what extent I can not say .
We have a snake - care Q&A service on this website , and through it I have spoken to hundreds of snake keepers over the years .
On several occasions , I have spoken to Burmese pythons owners who were desperately trying to find new homes for their pet snakes , to no avail .
Based on this experience , I believe it 's possible that a few pet pythons have been released into the wild over the years , in Florida and elsewhere .
And , as you will soon learn , it only takes a single breeding pair to start an " invasion . "
Often , people purchase these animals when they are babies , and small enough to be housed in a 10 - gallon terrarium .
But within a few years , these snakes will be devouring rats like popcorn , and weighing as much ( or more ) than their owners .
I believe that some keepers -- albeit a small minority -- end up releasing their Burmese pythons into the wild , out of sheer desperation .
Many in the reptile industry would dispute this belief , and they are certainly entitled to their opinions .
But I am convinced that a combination of Hurricane destruction and irresponsible keepers have contributed to the current state of Burmese pythons in Florida .
Florida Everglades = Ideal Habitat
So what happens when these animals are released into the wild ?
And why is the problem so isolated to the Florida Everglades and surrounding areas ?
In a word -- climate .
When a non-native animal is released into the wild , there are two possible outcomes :
If the local climate is outside the animal 's tolerance level , it will soon die .
But if the climate is sufficient to support the animal , it may establish itself as an invasive species .
This explains why the Burmese python has thrived in the area .
The climate and ecosystem of Everglades National Park ( and much of southern Florida , for that matter ) are ideally suited for the Burmese python .
These snakes live in hot and humid areas of Asia .
Southern Florida is hot and humid .
They eat a wide variety of birds , mammals and reptiles in their native habitat .
Here too the Everglades deliver , offering plenty of prey animals to sustain the Burmese python .
In short , there is no better place in the United States for these animals to survive and thrive .
That 's why southern Florida has become their new " home away from home . "
Years went by before anyone knew the full extent of the invasion .
It was n't until 2006 that the first Burmese python " nest " was found in Florida .
The females of this species will generally coil around their eggs , using slow muscular twitches to regulate the temperature around the eggs .
Such a nest was found in 2006 , when a female python was seen with a clutch of more than a dozen healthy eggs .
Of course by then , the ecological invasion was already well under way .
How Many Burmese Pythons are in Florida ?
There is no way to know with certainty how many Burmese pythons are in the southern Florida area .
But they likely number well into the thousands .
Some scientists estimate there may hundreds of thousands of these snakes within the state .
How could this happen in only 17 years ?
How could these snakes propagate so quickly ?
The answer to this question lies within the reproductive characteristics of the Burmese python .
Consider the following .
A female Burmese python can lay more than 30 eggs at a time .
In fact , a previous sampling of nest sites in the Everglades National Park found an average of 36 eggs per site .
Larger females can easily exceed these numbers .
One female captured in the Everglades was found to have 85 eggs developing inside her .
A well - fed female python will generally reach sexual maturity in a few years .
On top of that , these snakes can live for more than 20 years in the wild , and healthy females can reproduce annually for much of that lifespan .
Now take that reproductive capacity and spread it over the last 17 years or so , when these snakes are believed to have entered the Everglades in large numbers .
Do the math .
It 's staggering !
It seems to me that these snakes are here to stay .
Ecological Impacts of This Invasive Species
Why are scientists alarmed by the propagation of Burmese pythons in the Florida Everglades ( and beyond ) ?
What kind of ecological impact do they have ?
For one thing , these snakes are nearly apex predators when full grown .
Aside from the alligators in Florida , there are n't any animals that could attack and kill an adult Burmese python .
So they are essentially unchecked in the ecological scheme of things .
In nature , there is nothing to keep their populations in balance .
Teams of snake hunters ( wildlife officials , scientists and volunteers ) have tried to round up as many pythons as possible , but that 's like plugging your finger into a broken dam .

If these snakes continue to propagate and spread , they could cause significant population decline in many native species of animals .
Remember when the snakehead fish made national headlines in the early 2000s ?
This non-native fish began to propagate along the eastern United States .
It was a top - level predator , and it quickly decimated other fish populations .
Despite the efforts of wildlife biologists , these invasive fish still remain in the United States , and they have spread down the eastern seaboard to Florida ( they can actually " walk " outside of water for short distances , spreading from pond to pond ) .
Scientists have the same level of concern about the Burmese python populations that have bloomed all throughout southern Florida .
How Far Can These Snakes Go ?
The Burmese python is well established in the Florida Everglades and other areas in the southern part of the state .
That much is undeniable .
But how far can these animals spread ?
Where will they show up next ?
In general , an invasive species can spread as far as the habitat and climate will support them .
In 2008 , scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey released a future range map for the Burmese python .
It compared climate data from the snake 's native range ( in Asia ) to climate data in the United States .
The report suggested that these snakes could eventually propagate over nearly a third of the United States .
But I dispute this aspect of the USGS report .
I do not see these snakes spreading beyond the state of Florida , due to weather extremes and unsuitable habitats in neighboring states .
Only time will tell .

There is clearly something wrong with ...
Dennis Kucinich takes on man-on - dog Rick Santorum on what America should be doing in Afghanistan .
Par for the course Santorum has nothing but tough talk and meaningless slogans to offer .
Always lots of money to drop bombs on poor people 's heads , but heaven forbid do n't ask anyone to pay for it by taxing the wealthy , or take care of anyone here at home instead .
I think these " Christians " , and I use the term loosely for Santorum , forgot about the part of the Bible that includes Christ .
KUCINICH :
Well , it will have an effect on our national security , and I would suggest that the fight is n't in Afghanistan , it 's here in our own country .
We 're mired deeply in debt .
We 'll go deeper into debt for this war .
Our gross domestic product is down .
Savings are down .
Bankruptcies are up .
Home foreclosures are up .
We 're doing more foreign borrowing .
This war is undermining our nation , and we need to address this issue head on and ask what do we gain from this because I do n't see any up side at all .
Congressman , I 'd love to start with you .
You have great concern , I understand it , about how this Afghanistan situation could possibly affect our national security .
BREAM : Next Tuesday , President Obama is set to address the nation on his proposed policy for the Afghanistan war , a proposal that may come with a $ 50 billion price tag .
Still with us now , former senator and FOX News analyst Rick Santorum and Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich .
ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY :
There are a series of decisions that have to be made , and the president is working through many of those decisions in order to come to what he believes is the best way forward for our national security .
And I think the American people want the president to take the time to get this decision right , rather than to make a hasty decision .
QUESTION : Will the president be ready to roll out a decision in the week after Thanksgiving , or will it take longer ?
BREAM : Senator , what do we gain ?
SANTORUM : Yes , this is sort of the typical argument of the left , which is we need to just withdraw from all of our engagements overseas and we need to spend an enormous amount of money on bigger government here at home , and we need to raise taxes on rich people to pay for it .
I mean , that 's -- that 's sort of the mantra of the folks on the left , from David Obey to Dennis Kucinich .
And you know , he said this is n't the war we 're supposed to fight .
Iraq was n't the war we 're supposed to fight .
There is no war we 're supposed to fight .
We 're supposed to let the Chinese and the Russians and everybody else sort of run the world and we 're supposed to just sort of retreat and build the ever , ever , ever - growing government here in Washington , D.C. , and tax people for it .
I do n't know that 's the vision for America .
I think we want to have an activist America to keep our country safe by being a leader in the free world , and that means to go after to the enemy who has attacked us .
They were in Afghanistan .
They continue to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan .
And we need to continue to go after them , keep them on the defensive , instead of giving them the opportunity to regroup and then project force back here into this country .
BREAM : But Congressman , obviously , you cited -- there is an immense price tag for continuing with this war .
Some of your colleagues have mentioned a possible war tax .
Are you behind that idea or against any further investment in Afghanistan whatsoever ?
KUCINICH : I 'm against any further taxes to pay for this war .
But I think it has to be pointed out this is n't a left - right issue .
I mean , here 's the Cato Institute , hardly a left - wing organization , wrote a piece called " Escaping the Graveyard of Empires . "
And they have a plan -- and I 've met with them -- that gets us out of Afghanistan with advisers and a new approach to intelligence and also a new drug policy .
This is n't a left - right issue , and trying to make it that is just the old , stale argument .
Our country is on the line here .
We 've got the middle class getting destroyed .
And the bureaucracy we 're building up is n't a government generically , it 's the Defense Department .
And we can't keep paying for these wars .
We 're going to break the bank here .
And it 's already being broken .
Then we subsidize it .
Look , forget the left - right .
That 's not what it 's about .
It 's about whether we 're right to stay there and whether we 're going to leave our troops there and whether we 're going to be one of those empires that finds a graveyard in Afghanistan .
Let 's start thinking about things here at home .
That 's what I 'm concerned about .
BREAM : So Congressman , is it your opinion that we should not follow or the president should n't follow the requests of the military leaders there on the ground ?
Do you think it 's time to just completely cut and run ?
KUCINICH :
Well , here we go again , " cut and run . "
You know , that 's what they were saying about Iraq , when you still have n't found the weapons of mass destruction .
We 've got to get out of Afghanistan before we destroy our capacity to take care of things here at home .
I mean , what are they thinking about in the White House ?
You know , they promised a new direction and that direction is n't deeper into Afghanistan with perhaps 35,000 new troops that 's going to cost $ 35 billion more a year .
Where are we going to find that money ?
Who 's going to finance this ?
You 're going to tell the taxpayers we 're going to borrow more money from China so we can fight a war in Afghanistan ?
Come on !
BREAM : Well , Senator , the congressman says we can't we afford to stay .
Can we afford to leave ?
SANTORUM : Well , let me just say the congressmen can afford close to a trillion - stimulus package , about a trillion dollars in health care , another trillion dollars in cap - and - trade .
So he can afford all those things at home , but when it comes to protecting the United States of America , somehow or another , we can't find , you know , a couple hundred billion dollars .
And by the way , if you look at defense spending over the course of the last 50 years , about 60 percent of the America 's budget , 60 percent of our budget in 1960 , JFK 's last budget , was defense spending .
It 's now about 12 percent .
So do n't tell the American public that somehow or another the defense is soaking up all this money , that this war is putting us into the deficit .
That 's just simply not true .
KUCINICH : Really ?
SANTORUM : Entitlements , the things that Dennis Kucinich and the left have supported and have grown in this country to exorbitant cost is what put -- is putting us in debt , and they want to give us more entitlements , which will put us even deeper in debt .
BREAM : All right , Congressman , let me ...
KUCINICH : Well , Dana Rohrabacher ...
BREAM : ... give you a chance to respond .
KUCINICH : ... is hardly -- Dana Rohrabacher is hardly a flaming liberal , and he gave a brilliant speech against staying in Afghanistan , as did Jim Duncan , a Republican .
You know , again , to try to make this left - right is to lock us into old thinking that keeps us in wars that we should n't have fought in the first place , that undermines our national security , that makes it less likely that we 'll be able to have our economy rebound .
I mean , this is something ...
SANTORUM : Are you suggesting ...
KUCINICH : ... we should be thinking ...
SANTORUM : ... we should n't have fought the war in Afghanistan ?
( CROSSTALK )
KUCINICH : ... taking care of things here at home .
I 'm saying that we should have left there after we routed the al Qaeda and their training camps , which I voted for , by the way .
And I voted against that environmental legislation you just cited .
And I voted against the bail - outs for Wall Street .
Do n't do a liberal - and - conservative thing here , Rick .
You 're way off base .
Are we right to stay in Afghanistan ?
What benefits do we get ?
And are the American people going to be able to pay the price not only in taxes but pay the price in the blood of our soldiers ?
I mean , this is something -- we 've got to have a real debate on this ...
BREAM : Not to mention ...
KUCINICH : ... not the phony left - right stuff that means nothing .
BREAM : All right , gentlemen ...
KUCINICH : It means zero .
BREAM : ... we got to wrap it up there .
I thank you both very much for a spirited debate and giving us your time on this holiday weekend .
We wish you and your families the best .
SANTORUM : Thank you , Shannon .
BREAM : Senator Santorum , Congressman Kucinich , thank you very much .
KUCINICH : Thank you .
The first thing you need to understand about healthcare reform is what Jane Hamsher identified long ago : nothing -- absolutely nothing -- is going to trump the White House 's deal with PhRMA and the insurance industry .
The question you need to ask yourselves is : why ?
If you 're intellectually mature enough to get past " personal betrayal " as your best answer , you 'll be on the right track .
While you ponder that one , you might want to also consider why nothing has been done -- nor will anything serious actually be done -- about financial industry reform .
Standing up to the financial industry in the current political environment should be a no- brainer .
So what in the heck is going on here ?
If you can think past shadowy conspiracy theories and possible personal enrichment for the Obama family , you 'll be doing the kind of thinking that will help actually solve the problem .
The problem is people like me , and the people I work for .
I 'm what they call a Qualitative Research Consultant , or QRC for short .

Together with the AAPC , the MRA , the AMA , ESOMAR , and a whole host of other organizations you 've never heard of , we have more power and control than you know .
We 're extremely good at what we do , and we do it all behind the scenes , appealing to and manipulating your subconscious brain in ways that your conscious brain has little to no control over .
Give us a little money to test some things out , and we can work magic .
Our business is persuasion , and we 're very good at it .
Just watch PBS Frontline 's series , The Persuaders to get just a small inkling of what you 're up against .
We can make a company that earns a 38 % gross profit margin manufacturing purely propriety products seem hip , cool and progressive .
We can take sugar water and sell it back to you as a health drink , and even Whole Foods shoppers will believe it .
We can take 30 different brands of vodka with almost exactly the same ingredients , and make you understand instantly just what kind of person drinks which brand , and how much you should expect to pay for each , without a moment 's thought .
For any given category of products , I can show you a bunch of different brands , and you 'll be able to tell me a wealth of information about each one , despite the near absolute similarity of their actual products to one another .
One exercise we QRC's like to conduct involves actually turning a brand into a person in a group discussion ; it 's called personification .
And you would n't believe how effectively and universally we can tailor a brand 's image , right down to what kind of car that " person " would drive , and what music he / she would listen to .
So much attention has been paid to Naomi Klein 's outstanding Shock Doctrine , that few pay much attention anymore to her far more provocative and important work No Logo .
If all Americans truly internalized the message of No Logo , people like me would be out of work , and we could really reform this country .
For a little coin , we can even make poor people hate inheritance taxes , just by using a few little words that work .
The biggest difference between Obama and FDR / LBJ is that people like me were n't really around back then .
As the TV show Mad Men can show you , our industry was just getting off the ground in the mid-1960's .
And while it's true that the Democratic ad consultants of the 1980's and 1990's and early Aughts were wildly ineffective , that says far more about the prevailing consultant class in the Democratic Party than about the power of ad consulting in general .
So here 's what you have to understand .
If the health insurance and financial industries really felt scared by any particular politician or political party , or their lobbying efforts were inadequate , they could throw them out of power in a heartbeat .
With a wave of their hand and a few billion dollars or so in our direction , the pharma companies and Goldman Sachs could absolutely destroy the Democratic Party in 2010 and beyond .
The only reason they do n't do so is that it 's cheaper and easier to buy a few key Democrats off instead , and intimidate the rest .
Plus , they do n't have to run the risk of a right - wing populist backlash , either .
That 's why Barack Obama can't renege on his deal with PhRMA : PhRMA almost singlehandedly destroyed Hillarycare in 1993 , and spent the money to tip the balance of the elections in 1994 .
They can easily do it again .
So could Goldman Sachs and the rest of the financial vampires .
Rahm Emmanuel knows this , too : the deals are in place in return for their holding their fire .
And each and every one of you is being taken for fools .
You work for an election or two to put chosen leaders in place , and expect those leaders to work their " leadership " magic to ram reforms down the throats of the corporate sector , failing to understand just how fully the corporate sector holds the cards .
It 's not the campaign contributions : it 's the persuasion money .
You 're looking for a savior .
And like that Savior of biblical fame , s/he is n't coming , as long as there are people like me out there .
I personally wo n't work for a company or organization that goes against my personal convictions .
But 99 % of us certainly will .
If you want to win , you will ORGANIZE .
You will organize in the same way the Right has done for the last 40 years , and you will spend money on persuasion , where it really matters .
You will , in short , make the politicians as afraid of you as they are of them .
The Right has built vast networks of think tanks , newspapers , periodicals , cable news channels , and political advocacy organizations to spread their finely tuned , well - honed messages .
Their politicians may fail them , and their actual policies may be deeply unpopular , but their message machine nearly always works its magic to get them what they want , even when Democrats are in power .
That 's partly because the American political Right never quits and never gives up .
They know that organization is the key to their success , and they do n't trust politicians to do their work for them .
Democrats , on the other hand , get disappointed and quit when our politicians do n't pan out the way we wanted .
That 's why we lose .
As the healthcare debacle went on month after month , I did n't ask myself why the Democratic politicians were n't pushing single - payer or Medicare for all .
I wanted to know where the Left - leaning organizations were .
Where were the think tanks , the message machine , the newspapers , the whole infrastructure ?
Where were the national , well - tested ad campaigns pushing Medicare for All ?
Where were the free screenings of Sicko at major movie theaters across the nation , complete with sponsored food & drink for those who attended and signed up to take action ?
Where were the mid-cycle ads done by Madison Avenue professionals targeting specific Senators and making them deeply uncomfortable ?
Where , in effect , was the message campaign ?
It did n't exist .
What we had were labor unions and the AARP delivering generic hopeful messages without an ounce of the power or creativity that one might find in a random Budweiser ad .
If you want to win , ORGANIZE .
Develop parallel organizations willing to persuade with the power and intensity of a corporation .
As long as people like me are out there , and most of them are willing to work for the highest bidder , you 'll need to stop looking for saviors , and instead learn to fight fire with fire .
The upcoming battles wo n't wait for us , and there wo n't be anyone coming to save us but ourselves .
Cybersyn was a project of the socialist government of Salvador Allende ( 1970 - 1973 ) and British cybernetic visionary Stafford Beer ; its goal was to control the Chilean economy in real - time using computers and " cybernetic principles . "
The military regime that overthrew Allende dropped the project and probably for this reason when the project is periodically rediscovered it is often written about in a romantic tone as a revolutionary " socialist internet , " decades ahead of its time that was " destroyed " by the military because it was " too egalitarian " or because they did n't understand it .
Although some sources at the time said the Chilean economy was " run by computer , " the project was in reality a bit of a joke especially in retrospect , albeit a rather expensive one , and about the only thing about it that worked were the ordinary Western Union telex machines spread around the country .
The two computers supposedly used to run the Chilean economy were IBM 360s ( or machines on that order ) .
These machines were no doubt very impressive to politicians and visionaries eager to use their technological might to control an economy ( see picture at right . )
Today , our perspective will perhaps be somewhat different when we realize that these behemoths were far less powerful than an iPhone .
Run an economy with an iPhone ?
Sorry , there is no app for that .
Indeed , you do n't have to read far between the lines of Andy " socialist internet " Beckett 's account to get a flavor of what was really going on :
Beer 's original band of disciples had been diluted by other , less idealistic scientists .
There was constant friction between the two groups .
Meanwhile , Beer himself started to focus on other schemes : using painters and folk singers to publicise the principles of high - tech socialism ; testing his son's electrical public - opinion meters , which never actually saw service ; and even organising anchovy - fishing expeditions to earn the government some desperately needed foreign currency .
( Note the classic , ' the visionary failed because others lacked idealism ' story .
Meanwhile the visionary is off on an anchovy - fishing expedition . )
Recently , Jeremiah Axelrod and Greg Borenstein have put together an excellent video essay ( fyi , 25 minutes ) which gets to the heart ( perhaps head would be a better word ) of Cybersyn by focusing on the legendary " control room , " which they delightfully call the " inverted panopticon . "
It is no accident , say Axelrod and Borenstein , that the control room looks like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise because the whole purpose of the room was to exude a science - fiction fantasy of omniscience and omnipotence .
The fantasy naturally appealed to Allende who had the control room moved to the presidential palace just days before the coup .
The control room is like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise in another respect–both are stage sets .
Nothing about the room is real , even the computer displays on the wall are simply hand drawn slides projected from the other side with Kodak carousels .
Ironically , when rumors of the project began to circulate , the illusion of omniscience and omnipotence that Beer had created , the same illusion that so appealed to Allende and that had funded Beer 's visions and experiments , this illusion caused fear that an all - knowing big brother was on the way–and such fear may even have encouraged the coup .
After the coup , rather than destroying the project because of its " egalitarian " nature , the military regime was more likely to have been disillusioned and disappointed to discover project Cybersyn's impotence .

The Final Moonwalk of the 20th Century Subscribe Posted by Michael Pinto on Dec 13 , 2009 in Science
On this day in 1972 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt went out for their third and final Extra - vehicular activity ( EVA ) — which is known to us civilians as a moonwalk .
The Apollo 17 mission would mark the last time in the 20th Century when humans would walk the surface of the moon .
While the close of that century would start a new golden age of astronomy with many planets outside of our solar system being discovered , it ’s been a dark age of space exploration .
And yet least we forget :
The nation that went to the moon was in the middle of an expensive Cold War , was fighting an actual war in Asia and was enacting new healthcare programs — and yet they still had the gumption to go .

GLOBAL TRADE ENVOY : During the American occupation of Japan after World War II , Gen. Douglas MacArthur ( pictured , in sunglasses ) oversaw the creation of export - oriented industries in the war - ravaged country .
I FEEL IT IS past time that something must be said in defense of Pax Americana .
Sure , that phrase fell into disrepute during the era of neoconservative misrule , which left the United States far worse off by every clear metric of national health .
While steering the American ship of state toward too many rocks to count , fellows like Richard Cheney , Richard Perle , Kenneth Adelman and their ilk kept proclaiming imperial triumphalism to the world , extolling an America invested with a perpetual right to planetwide dominance , based upon inherent qualities that were said to be unaffected by any objective - world considerations , like budgets or geography ; world opinion or the end of the Cold War ; science or technology ; rationality or morality ; or the physical well - being of our troops .
Indeed , the only factor that they felt might undermine America 's manifestly destined and eternal pre-eminence might be a failure of will , should the wimpy liberals ever have their way .
But if led with a firm - jawed will to overcome all obstacles , America could stay on top indefinitely , with all the privileges of governing world affairs and few of the responsibilities or cares .
Sure , it has been proper to oppose the policies of such deeply delusional men , who unambiguously brought ruin to the very things they claimed to hold dear .
Capitalism , freedom , fiscal and national health , as well as U.S. influence in the world all plummeted under their rule .
Yet , something is very wrong with the unselective manner in which folks on the other side have allowed the neocons to define the argument .
It is an unfortunate habit of the left to assume that any vocal and assertive appreciation of the American contribution to human civilization must be inherently fascist .
This reflexive self - loathing has given ( unnecessarily ) a huge weapon to the right , allowing them to retain millions of supporters who might otherwise have abandoned them .
By abrogating the natural human phenomenon of patriotic pride , these fools on the left have allowed guys like Sean Hannity to claim love of country as a sole monopoly of the right !
If they get away with pushing simplistic " greatest nation ever " rants and portray themselves as the implicit opposite of homeland - hating liberals , that gift comes gratis from the left .
Moreover , there is another reason for liberals to re-examine this reflex and to find good — and even great — things to proclaim about America .
Because , without any doubt , America deserves it .
Yes , there definitely were crimes committed during our time on top .
But find and name a powerful nation , in all of human history , that was n't far worse .
In fact , the net effects of Pax Americana have been generally positive , compared against every single previous era in human history .
This can be proved , with an example that has spanned an entire lifespan .
Mr. Wu Jianmin , a professor at China Foreign Affairs University and chairman of the Shanghai Centre of International Studies , is a smart fellow whose observations about merit close attention .
In a recent edition of the online journal The Globalist , Wu Jianmin 's brief appraisal of " A Chinese Perspective on a Changing World " was insightful , but it typically misplaced credit for the Asian economic miracle .
" After the Second World War , things started to change .
Japan was the first to rise in Asia .
We Asians are grateful to Japan for inventing this export - oriented development model , which helped initiate the process of Asia 's rise . "
In fact , with due respect for their industriousness , ingenuity and determination , the Japanese invented no such thing .
The initiators of export - driven world development were two military and diplomatic leaders of Pax Americana at its very peak : George Marshall , who was secretary of state under President Harry Truman , and Gen. Douglas MacArthur , during his time as military governor of Japan , in the ravaged aftermath of the Second World War .
Marshall crafted a historically unprecedented , receptively open trade policy called " countermercantilism . "
MacArthur vigorously pushed the creation of Japanese export - oriented industries .
Instead of doing what all other victorious conquerors had done — looting the defeated enemy — Marshall , MacArthur and Truman lifted their prostrate foe , first with direct aid .
And then , over the longer term , with trade .
I am not downplaying the importance of Japanese , Korean , Malaysian , Chinese and Indian efforts to uplift themselves through the hard work of hundreds of millions who labored in sweatshops making toys and clothes for U.S. consumers .
Without any doubt , those workers were far more heroic and directly responsible for the last six decades of world development than American consumers , pushing overflowing carts through Wal - Mart .
Nevertheless , those consumers — plus the trade policies that made Wal - Mart possible — all played crucial roles in this process that lifted billions of people out of grinding , hopeless poverty .
Moreover , it now seems long past time to realize how unique this was , in the sad litany of human history .
The Thing About Empires
Let 's step back a little .
If you scan recorded accounts , you 'll find that most people lived in either a period of imperium or a period of chaos .
A lot of the empires were brutal and stultifying , and I am not defending most of them .
Still , cities did n't burn that often when the empire maintained order .
Most people could work , trade and raise their families in safety , under the imperial peace , or " pax . "
That does n't mean the empires were wise .
Often , they behaved in smug and tyrannical ways that laid seeds for their own destruction .
Whenever a nation became overwhelmingly strong , it tended to forge trade networks that favored home industries and capital inflows , at the expense of those living in dependent areas .
The Romans did this , insisting that rivers of gold stream into the imperial city .
So did the Hellenists , Persians , Moguls and every Chinese dynasty .
This kind of behavior , by Pax Brittanica , was one of the chief complaints of both John Hancock and Gandhi .
In fact , there has been only one top nation that ever avoided the habit , and that was the United States .
Upon finding itself the dominant power at the end of World War II. , the United States had the opportunity to impose its own vision of international trade .
And it did .
At this crucial moment , something special happened .
At the behest of Marshall and his advisers , America became the first power in history to deliberately establish countermercantilist commerce flows .
Nations crippled by war or mismanagement were allowed to maintain tariffs , keeping out American goods , while sending shiploads from their factories to the United States .
Each administration since Marshall 's time , regardless of political party , has abided by this compact — to such a degree that the world 's peoples now simply take it for granted !
Of course , more than pure altruism may have been involved .
Democrat Harry Truman and Republican Dwight Eisenhower both saw trade as a tonic to unite world peoples against Soviet expansionism .
Nevertheless , if you doubt that countermercantilism also had an altruistic motive , remember that this unprecedented regime was instituted by the author of the renowned Marshall Plan — an endeavor that rings in human memory as an archetype of generosity .
Unfortunately , while recipients of the Marshall Plan 's direct aid could immediately see beneficial results , the effects of other parts of the program were slower in coming .
What this amounted to , however , was the greatest aid - and - uplift program in human history .
A prodigious transfer of wealth from the United States to Europe , Asia and Latin America .
A program that consisted of Americans buying loads of things they did not really need .
Does anyone deserve moral credit for this staggeringly successful " aid program " ?
Perhaps not the American consumers , who went on a reckless holiday , spending themselves into debt .
Moreover , as the author of a book called Earth , I 'd be remiss not to mention that all of this consumption - driven growth came about at considerable cost to our planet .
For all our sakes , the process of ending human poverty needs to get a lot more efficient .
Nevertheless , if credit is being given to the Japanese for inventing this export - oriented development model , then I think it is time for some historical perspective .
This view of the present situation may feel satisfying , but it is wholly inaccurate .
Moreover , it could lead to serious mistakes .
Even if America is exhausted from having spent its way from world dominance into a chasm of debt , the United States does have something to show for it the last six decades .
A world saved .
Billions of human beings lifted out of poverty .
That task , far more prodigious than defeating fascism and communism or going to the moon , ought to be viewed with a little respect .
This should be contemplated as other nations consider their time ahead as one of potential triumph .
If they become the next great " pax , " will they start their era with acts of farsighted wisdom , the way Marshall and Truman did ?
In some parallel world , the U.S. after World War II followed every other empire and imposed mercantilist trade patterns .
That version of the U.S. would have no debt today .
Our factories would be humming and the country would be swimming in gold .
But the amount of hope and prosperity in the world would be far less , ruined by the same self - centered , short - sighted greed that eventually brought down empires in Greece , Persia , Rome , China , Britain and so on .
Also , by this point , every American youth would be serving in armies of occupation , and the entire world would by now be simmering , plotting for the downfall of the Evil Empire .
That is the way the old pattern was written .
But it is not how this " pax " was run .
Instead , the greater part of the world was saved from poverty by the same force that rescued it from fascistic imperialism and communism .
Yes , America 's era of uplifting the globe by propelling export - driven growth must be over .
And having performed this task , it cannot expect any credit or thanks .
But that is OK .
We certainly do not need to be thanked .
It simply is done .
And soon it will be time for someone else to start buying , for a change .
The products , the services and especially the ideas .
And just watch .
America will be happy to sell .

Insurance industry insider : ' We win '
With the Senate shifting sharply away from a " pure public option , " an insurance industry insider who has been deeply involved in the health care fight emails to declare victory .
" We WIN , " the insider writes .
" Administered by private insurance companies .
No government funding .
No government insurance competitor . ”
I came across an interesting picture showing a comparison of searches in Japanese on Google for “ husband ” and “ wife ” .
It looks like the women who I assume are searching for “ husband ” related topics are experiencing some dark times , while the husbands searching for “ wife ” related topics are still up beat about things .
Here are some rough translations of what ’s hot .
Searching under “ husband ”
husband , I want him to die
husband , I hate him
husband , allowance , average
husband , verbal violence
husband , allowance
husband , how to call ( his name )
husband , dead , procedures
husband , depression
husband , out of work
husband , dead , pension
Does n’t sound like the wives are that keen on having the husbands around .
Either they are searching for ways to have them dead or looking over procedures for what to do after they have died .
Life is tough !
Searching under “ wife ”
wife , birthday present
wife , birthday present ranking
wife , present
wife , hysteria
wife , how to call ( her name )
wife , depression
wife , present ranking
wife , documents not received
wife , shochu ( sake )
Both lists have the word うつ meaning depressed or depression in them .
Looks like a growing trend in Japanese society at the moment .
The English equivalents I got on my own computer were a little more bright .
and some results from the UK thanks to katiemuffett
What do the searches look like where you live ?
What would your top search be for one of these phrases ?

Bill Maher has been getting a lot of heat lately and seems to be getting a bit defensive .
He was particularly stung by Michael Shermer ’s open letter in which Dr. Shermer thought it necessary to give Maher a basic lesson in germ theory .
Unfortunately , Maher has responded not by thoughtfully engaging his critics , but with a rambling defensive diatribe in which he simultaneously protests the criticism pointed his way while repeating and amplifying the pseudoscientific nonsense that garnered criticism in the first place .
Maher presents what we call a target rich environment for skepticism , so I do n’t think I will be able to address every point , but I will hit the highlights .
Listeners of the SGU podcast are familiar with our “ name that logical fallacy ” segment .
In his second paragraphs Maher offers up enough fallacies to supply this segment for a month .
Take a crack at it yourselves :
I agree with my critics who say there are far more qualified people than me — its just that mainstream media rarely interviews doctors and scientists who present an alternative point of view .
There is a movement to stop people from asking any questions about vaccines — they ’re a miracle , that ’s it , debate over .
I do n’t think its that simple , and neither do millions of other people .
The British Medical Journal from August 25 says half the doctors and medical workers in the U.K. are not taking the flu shot — are they all crazy too ?
Sixty - five percent of French people do n’t want it .
Maybe its not as simple as the medical establishment wants to paint it .
Maher is willing to admit that he is not an expert , but then he follows this statement with a long post in which he feels free to express his views on vaccines and medicine in general .
He should have just stopped after that first sentence .
He seems to be saying – I am not an expert , so do n’t hold me accountable for anything I say , but I am going to say it anyway .
He then follows with a common claim for Maher – that the mainstream media ( apparently he does not consider himself part of the mainstream media ) rarely interviews experts with an alternate point of view .
This is a bold assertion that strikes me as utter hogwash .
I admit perception here is subjective , but it seems to me that the mainstream media gives disproportionate attention to fringe experts and minority opinions .
Look at Oprah , Larry King , just about every talk show and morning show , and Maher himself – the mainstream media loves the fringe .
At best we get token skepticism .
Who is Maher kidding ?
But everyone wants to portray themselves as the embattled minority .
Maher goes beyond that and borrows a page right out of the creationist playbook when he writes : “ There is a movement to stop people from asking any questions about vaccines — they ’re a miracle , that ’s it , debate over . ”
Right – just like we want to dogmatically stop debate about Darwin , and the 9/11 truth movement , and the hollow earth – and every other crackpot claim out there .
Maher confuses concern over the quality of reporting and information with a desire to inhibit free speech .
Calling nonsense what it is does NOT equal attempting to silence it .
When we call Maher on his pseudoscientific rubbish , this is not some big mainstream conspiracy to shut down debate .
Also – his attitude assumes that there is a legitimate debate to be had – just like the creationists in all their whining about “ teach the controversy ” assume a controversy where there is none ( not a scientific controversy , anyway ) .
There is no mainstream controversy over vaccines , not because of dogma but because the science is very solidly in one direction – vaccines are safe and effective .
Repeating long - debunked misinformation does not create a genuine controversy .
It strikes many of us in the skeptical community that Maher is a picture of self - contradiction in this position .
He criticizes 9/11 truthers and creationists , but then commits the identical logical fallacies in attacking vaccines and modern medicine .
Maher finishes off that paragraph with an argument from authority combined with an argument from popularity .
Right – and ( depending upon which highly unreliable poll you want to listen to ) a majority of Americans doubt evolution , and a third of the public thinks Bush had something to do with 9/11 .
This is also a bit of a self - fulfilling prophesy – the anti-vaccine movement scaremongers about vaccines , and then points out that there is a lot of fear of vaccines in the public , so there must be something there .
Along these lines , he gives us some more apologetics :
I ’m just trying to represent an under - reported medical point of view in this country , I ’m not telling a specific pregnant lady what to do .
In addition , my audience is bright , they would n’t refuse a flu shot because they heard me talk about it , but if they looked into the subject a little more , how is that a bad thing ?
This is the same kind of lame excuse for intellectual sloppiness that Oprah gave – hey , my audience is smart enough not to listen to me .
I ’m just putting this out there , asking questions – what , do you want a fascist state that does n’t allow people to ask questions ?
The “ I ’m just asking questions ” gambit is a particularly disingenuous one .
I wonder what Maher thinks when Fox pulls this stunt .
The point Maher keeps missing is that he is making claims that have been debunked – they are not based on a fair reading of the science , and his logic is strained at best .
But let ’s get to some specifics .
He writes :
The point I am representing is :
Is getting frequent vaccinations for any and all viruses consequence - free ?
Nice straw man .
I can see Maher wants to hit as many logical fallacies in one post as possible .
Maybe he thinks it ’s like shooting the moon in hearts – if you get them all , you win .
Who is recommending “ frequent ” vaccinations , or vaccines for “ any and all virsues ? ”
There are thousands of viruses out there , and vaccines for just a few .
I would n’t mind a few more – HIV would be nice .
And who is saying that vaccinations are “ consequence free ” – and what does that mean , exactly ?
Scientists are careful to point out that vaccines are not risk free .
They have side effects , and even rare serious adverse effects – like all medical interventions .
They even go out of their way to report and catalogue all the side effects – that ’s a standard part of science - based medicine .
If that ’s your question , Maher , then the answer is no , but irrelevant .
( A significant sign of intellectual sloppiness or naivete is not being able to ask the right question , or even cogent questions . )
The right question is – what is the risk - benefit ratio of vaccines ?
We have mountains of data on this question , and the answer is – there is significant benefit in excess of risk .
So much so that vaccines are one of the best medical interventions invented by scientific medicine .
Really – it does n’t get much better than vaccines for benefit in excess of risk .
But we wo n’t stop monitoring them , or asking the right questions anyway .
I ca n’t resist pointing out a bit of irony in his post .
He writes :
But apparently it ’s ( Twitter ) taken very seriously , because there was Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services what she thought about the fact that “ Bill Maher told his viewers anyone who gets a flu shot is an idiot . ”
Well , not quite .
It was twittered , which I guess does n’t make a huge difference , but as 60 Minutes is the last bastion of TV journalism , accuracy is appreciated .
So Maher is dinging 60 Minutes for an inconsequential factual error – viewers vs twitter followers .
But then Maher writes :
Is it worth it to get vaccines for every bug that goes around ?
Injecting something into my bloodstream ?

I would think vaccines containing many different dicey substances shot directly into the bloodstream have a slightly greater chance of secondary effects than a piece of fabric lying across your waist .
Maher has been corrected before on the fact that vaccines are intra-muscular injections – they are not injected “ directly into the bloodstream . ”
And what “ dicey substances ” are we talking about , exactly ?
I guess it ’s OK for Maher to play it loose with the facts as long as it is for the purpose of fear - mongering about an effective medical intervention .
While there is much to criticize in Maher ’s style , his substance is worse .
He writes :
What I ’ve been saying is that Western medicine ignores too much the fact that the terrain in which bacteria can thrive is crucial and often controllable , which should n’t even be controversial .
One more style point though – “ Western ” medicine is a euphemism for “ scientific ” medicine and is only used by those with an anti-science agenda .
It is meant to imply that science is not universal , but culturally Western .
Which part should not be controversial – that “ the terrain ” is important or that scientific medicine ignores this fact ?
What evidence does Maher have that modern medicine ignores the immune system ?
I believe there is an entire medical specialty dedicated to the immune system ( several , actually ) .
Infectious Disease specialists routinely consider the host in assessing the best course of action to take in preventing and treating infections .
But Maher wants to pretend he lives in a cartoon world where doctors treat everything simple - mindedly with drugs and surgery , and do n’t consider the patient as a whole .
It really is an annoyingly childish view of modern medicine – about as accurate as a creationist ’s view of evolutionary biology .
It is a product of propaganda from those hostile to science - based medicine .
It also is profoundly arrogant – a product of the casual assumption of moral and intellectual superiority .
Maher apparently has no problem assuming he has a more thoughtful approach to medicine than the entire medical profession .
On this point he also writes :
“ … and if your immune system is already compromised by , for example , eating a typical American diet , then a flu shot can make sense . ”
He is assuming that the American diet compromises the immune system .
I would like to see a reference or twelve to support that claim .
The American diet is far from optimal , but the evidence overwhelmingly shows its defects are in excess , not insufficiency .
Americans are not malnourished , and their immune systems ( in general , of course ) are fine .
Maher has the true - belief that infections can be treated and prevented solely by “ boosting ” the immune system with diet and nutrition .
This , however , is a fantasy of the supplement industry .
The fact is , perfectly healthy people can succumb to a bad infection .
Maher also ignores the fact that the best way to protect those who are not perfectly healthy , or do have compromised immune systems , is through herd immunity – for healthy people to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of disease .
After some reluctant acknowledgment that vaccines maybe are not all bad , Maher writes :
But maybe the immune system does n’t like being tricked so many times .
Maybe we should be studying that instead of shouting down debate .
What ?
The “ being tricked ” thing was a metaphor Shermer used to explain vaccines a bit to Maher .
The immune system responds to vaccines the same way it responds to getting exposed to viruses or bacteria from other sources – getting a cold , or just getting exposed even without mounting an infection .
I sure hope my immune system “ likes ” responding over and over again to immunological challenge , because it is going to have to do just that on a daily basis for the rest of my life .
Maher perpetuates the anti-vaccine fiction that the immune system response to a vaccine is fundamentally different than the response to any infection or exposure to a germ .
It ’s not .
There is so much more nonsense in this post – it is so dense with logical fallacies and misinformation , that I just ca n’t hit it all .
He goes on to conflate issues about overuse of antibiotics with vaccines .
Yes , Maher – we are talking about the overuse of antibiotics .
It is being studied to death , and we are trying to balance our duty to save individual patients with the long term effectiveness of our antibiotics .
Maher then states that the “ experts ” he looks to on this issue are Barbara Loe Fisher , Dr. Russell Blaylock , and Dr. Jay Gordon – anti-vaccine cranks all .
That ’s Maher ’s problem – he might as well take an evolution lesson from Casey Luskin , Michael Behe , and Dr. Egnor .
In the end I think that might resolve part of the paradox that is Bill Maher .
He demonstrates that someone who is generally intelligent , able to form rational opinions on many issues , and has been successful in a competitive profession , is also able to climb inside a bubble of pseudoscience on a particular issue .
It is easy for anyone to be overwhelmed by an organized campaign of misinformation .
I know very bright people who were blown away by Loose Change when they first saw it .
I know otherwise intelligent people who just cannot handle the systematic lies and distortions of the creationists – they do n’t have the background and the volumes of information it would take to tackle each false claim and logical fallacy .
The same is true of the alternative medicine and anti-vaccine movement – they have a highly developed package of propaganda , misinformation , and subtle distortions – wrapped in a feel - good and empowering philosophy , that can easily overwhelm even an intelligent person .
But Maher has now stepped into this controversy , even though he apparently does n’t like it .
I guess he only likes getting praise from his audience , and is chaffing under the harsh criticism some of his view have engendered ( and I do n’t mean from his ideological opponents – something we all enjoy ) .
Also – like it or not – he is a public personality and his views affect the public .
If he is going to tackle medical issues , he needs to do a far better job of exposing himself openly to the “ other ” side , by which I mean science - based medicine .
He cannot hide behind the “ I ’m just a silly comedian , no ones takes me seriously , I ’m just asking questions ” gambit .
He should seriously consider the possibility that he is about as well informed on vaccines and other medical issues as creationists are on evolution .
He should not dismiss his critics ( while he is criticizing others for being dismissive ) and he should take very seriously the fact that he is at odds with the scientific and skeptical community .
Otherwise the criticism will continue – not to shut him up , but to do damage control .
Maher is contributing to the public misunderstanding of science in perhaps the most important area – medicine .
That is very serious , and he needs to start taking it seriously .

Note : Orac has a go at Maher also .
Ben Bernanke 's low - road approach of taking the Fed 's " noble mission " of bailing out Wall Street at any and all costs directly to the people seems to have come at curiously opportune time , a mere week ahead of his December 3 Senate Banking Committee hearing for his second 4 year term nomination .
It also seems to have backfired as some people in high standing seem less than enthused by the oodles of human lactic acid kindness that suddenly overflow from each and every floor ( yes , even the 3rd sub - basement which houses the 10 consistently overheating druckmachinen ) of the Marriner S. Eccles building .
One such among them is Senator Bernie Sanders who earlier said on ABC's " This Week " that Bernanke will be renominated over his dead body ( metaphorically speaking ) :
" No , I absolutely will not vote for Mr. Bernanke .
He is part of the problem .
He 's the smartest guy in the world , why did n't he do anything to prevent us from sinking into this disaster that Wall Street caused and which he was a part of ?
No , I will not vote for Bernanke to stay on as chairman . "
And even as the dollar moves increasingly underwater and is now even more " collateralized " by worthless and completely unwanted ( except by the Fed ) MBS and Agency securities , less and less people buy Bernanke 's strong dollar Kool Aid : it was not enough for Bernanke to launch the greatest bail out in history using the Mutual Assured Destruction threat as the " end of the world as we know it " event that would occur if Goldman Sachs shareholders were to get wiped out .
No , now he has to destroy the US middle class to ensure that Wall Street has one more , maybe two years , of good bonuses , before the main show of commingled feces and precariously balanced cards can collapse with impunity .
As senators consider how much money their Wall Street backers will stuff in their Christmas lobby stockings , we present a modest proposal of 15 or so questions that those in Washington with even half a conscience should ask the Chairman before making sure that nothing ever changes and we are set on a catastrophic bubble collapse of even more epic proportions .
Questions courtesy of The Cunning Realist :
1 . The TARP Inspector General recently disclosed that the New York Federal Reserve did not believe that AIG 's credit - default swap ( CDS ) counterparties posed a systemic financial risk .
In Congressional testimony and elsewhere , you have stated repeatedly that AIG posed a systemic risk based partly on its CDS obligations [ source : Bernanke 's testimony to the House Financial Services Committee , 3/24/09 ] .
Explain this apparent contradiction .
What was your specific role in the decision to pay AIG 's counterparties 100 cents on the dollar ?
2 . On May 5 , 2009 , in front of the Joint Economic Committee , you said the following about the unemployment rate : " Currently , we do n’t think it will get to 10 percent .
Our current number is somewhere in the 9s " [ source ] .
In November it hit 10.2 % , and many economists predict it will go even higher .
This is happening despite enormous fiscal and monetary stimulus that you previously said would help create jobs .
What happened after your JEC testimony in May that caused your prediction to miss the mark ?
3 . It 's now widely accepted that loose monetary policy is at least partly to blame for the credit bubble and subsequent crash .
You played an important role in that policy .
For eight straight meetings of the FOMC , from June 2003 to May 2004 , you voted to keep the Fed funds rate at 1 % .
But transcripts of recently - released FOMC meetings show you wanted the FOMC to consider cutting rates even further .
In the August 12 , 2003 meeting , with the Fed already at 1 % , you said :
Despite the good news , I think it ’s premature to conclude that we should not consider further rate cuts , if not at this meeting then at some time in the near future depending on how the data play out .
[ source : transcript of FOMC meeting on 8/12/03 , page 63 ]
How much worse would the bubble and subsequent crash have been if you had gotten your way ?
What do your comments in that meeting imply about your ability to correctly time the reversal of the Fed 's current accommodative policy ?
4. Forecasts are an important part of the Fed 's work .
Monetary policy by nature depends on forecasts , making predictive ability an essential part of the job description for any Fed chairman .
Yet your record of predictions , including the one about unemployment in ( 2 ) above , is questionable at best .
Some examples [ source ] :
March 28 , 2007 : “ The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained . ”
May 17 , 2007 : “ We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system . ”
Feb. 28 , 2008 , on the potential for bank failures : “ Among the largest banks , the capital ratios remain good and I do n’t expect any serious problems of that sort among the large , internationally active banks that make up a very substantial part of our banking system . ”
June 9 , 2008 : “ The risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so . ”
July 16 , 2008 : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are “ adequately capitalized ” and “ in no danger of failing . ”
Explain this pattern of terrible predictions and forecasts .
What do they imply about your ability to conduct policy going forward ?
Is there some fatal flaw in your economic models or forecasting tools ?
Are you just winging it ?
5 . Derivatives such as credit - default swaps played an important role in the financial crisis , and they are central to the financial reforms currently being contemplated .
During the Senate Banking Committee 's hearing in November 2005 to confirm you as Alan Greenspan 's successor , you had the following exchange with Senator Paul Sarbanes [ source ] :
SARBANES : Warren Buffett has warned us that derivatives are time bombs , both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system .
The Financial Times has said so far , there has been no explosion , but the risks of this fast growing market remain real .
How do you respond to these concerns ?
BERNANKE : I am more sanguine about derivatives than the position you have just suggested .
I think , generally speaking , they are very valuable .
They provide methods by which risks can be shared , sliced , and diced , and given to those most willing to bear them .
They add , I believe , to the flexibility of the financial system in many different ways .
With respect to their safety , derivatives , for the most part , are traded among very sophisticated financial institutions and individuals who have considerable incentive to understand them and to use them properly .
The Federal Reserve ’s responsibility is to make sure that the institutions it regulates have good systems and good procedures for ensuring that their derivatives portfolios are well managed and do not create excessive risk in their institutions .
How did you get it so wrong ?
6 . An important factor in the financial crisis ( and a large part of the ultimate cost to taxpayers ) was the implicit government guarantee of the GSEs .
In part because of decisions you made , there is now an explicit government guarantee of every large firm on Wall Street .
Has moral hazard increased or decreased over the past year ?
7 . Via the FDIC , the American public now explicitly guarantees the bonds of Wall Street firms where bonuses are surging and individual employees can be paid millions of dollars a year .
What is your opinion on the morality of this guarantee ?
8 . The importance you place on the output gap is well known .
You have often cited " excess slack " in the economy to justify loose monetary policy , arguing that a large output gap lowers the risk of inflation .
But economists such as Allan Meltzer have noted that there are " lots of examples of countries with underutilized resources and high inflation .
Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s " [ source ] .
Moreover , in a new paper dated December 2009 and titled " Has the Recent Real Estate Bubble Biased the Output Gap ? " , researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis state the following :
Because this ( predicted ) output gap is so large , several analysts have concluded that monetary policy can remain very accommodative without fear of inflationary repercussions .
We argue instead that standard output gap measures may be severely biased by the bubble in real estate prices that , according to many , started around 2002 and burst in 2007 .
They conclude with a warning that seems directed at you : " We offer a word of caution to policymakers : Policies based on point estimates of the output gap may not rest on solid ground . "
Please comment on 1 ) Allan Meltzer 's point and 2 ) the St. Louis Fed 's research paper .
Why do you continue to put such a high priority on the output gap ?
9 . In a scenario in which unemployment remains uncomfortably high , but the dollar continues to fall and commodities including oil and gold continue to rise , what would the Fed do ?
At what point do market signals take priority over hard - to - measure statistics like the output gap ?
10 . The Fed has a dual mandate : maximum employment and price stability .
But unemployment is at its highest level in decades .
And in early and mid-2008 , with oil at $ 150 a barrel and prices of basic staples skyrocketing , opinion polls showed that inflation was the public 's highest concern , even more so than jobs or the housing market [ source ] .
Why has the Fed failed so badly in its mandate ?
Is employment an appropriate objective for monetary policy ?
Should the Fed have a single mandate of price stability ?
11 . In February 2009 , Janet Yellen , president of the San Francisco Fed , said that the Fed needed to fight back against the argument that its liquidity efforts would eventually lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates , calling the notion " ludicrous " [ source ] .
Since then , the dollar has fallen precipitously , oil has almost doubled in price , and gold has surged to all - time highs .
Do you share your colleague 's view on inflation ?
12 . What does the surge in gold mean to you ?
At what price level would it begin to worry you , if it does n't already ?
Does gold have any impact on the Fed 's policy deliberations ?
13 .
Why does the Fed insist on waiting five years before it releases transcripts of FOMC meetings to the public ?
Should n't someone tasked with evaluating your performance and voting on your reconfirmation have access to transcripts from late 2008 and early 2009 ?
14 . Has the Fed ever had an internal debate about how monetary policy contributes to geopolitical tensions via the rising oil prices caused by a falling dollar ?
15 . Before the financial crisis there was a widespread sense , especially on Wall Street trading desks , that the stock market was strangely resilient .
This encouraged excessive risk - taking in various types of assets .
Do you have direct or indirect knowledge of the Federal Reserve or any government entity or proxy ever intervening to support the stock market ( or any individual stock ) via futures or in any other way ?
If yes , who decides the timing of such intervention and with what criteria ?
How is it funded ?
Which Wall Street firm handles the orders , and who sees them before they are executed ?
The Milquetoasts of this world are the victims of the steamrollers .
I used to be numbered among the Milquetoasts and was periodically used or flattened !
I came to realize , however , that even though Christians are to be humble and cooperative , they also are accountable to God to use their time wisely , to do what He wants them to do , and to stand up for what is right and biblical .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As an insistent stock market rally coasts into the new year , investors are starting to look forward -- raising questions about just what kind of recovery we 're in for .
Investors are mulling two contrary thoughts , said Bernard McGinn , CEO at McGinn Investment Management : " Either we 've turned a corner and things are looking better or it 's still rough out there and we need to be cautious . "
The push and pull between the two ideas has left stocks churning so far this month , with the major gauges barely changed from three weeks ago and trading volume notably low for this time of year .
At the same time , the previously weak dollar has started to come back a little and the economic news has been more positive .
A stronger dollar is good for the country and good for the stock market in the long - term , but in the short term the slight rebound in the greenback has put some pressure on the market .
The weak dollar has played a role in the nine - month old stock market rally , by boosting dollar - traded commodities and the shares of companies that do a lot of business overseas .
On the economic front , recent reports on retail sales , housing and the labor market have added to evidence that the worst recession since the 1930s is over .
That 's raised questions about when the Federal Reserve may step in to remove some of the fuel it has poured on the market and the economy this year .
A slowdown in the pace of job cuts has helped boost investor confidence , which in turn gave a lift to retail sales last month .
But the holiday season is still looking iffy , and with the unemployment rate at 10 % and just shy of a 26 - year high , the Federal Reserve is unlikely to act anytime soon .
" [ Fed Chairman ]
Bernanke has made it clear he 's going to keep interest rates low for a while , but the Fed also need to be careful because of the eventual inflation threat , " said Kevin Mahn , managing director at Hennion & Walsh .
Federal Reserve :
The latest central bank rate policy meeting gets under way Tuesday , concluding Wednesday .
The bankers , led by Chairman Ben Bernanke , are widely expected to hold the federal funds rate , a key overnight bank lending rate , steady at historic lows near zero .
What the bankers say in the statement about the economy will be of the greatest interest to investors , in particular , if they should hint at when they might begin to raise interest rates .
The Fed 's decision to hold interest rates low this year -- as well as to inject billions of dollars into the financial system -- are credited with helping the economy to avert a bigger disaster .
The Fed 's actions also played a role in the big stock market rally of the last nine months .
The week ahead also brings reports on housing , the labor market , and consumer and wholesale inflation .
The direction of the dollar and the movement in commodities will also remain front and center .
On the docket
Monday :
There are no market - moving economic or corporate events scheduled for Monday .

Buffer View
API Monitor can display both input and output buffers .
The amount of data displayed is automatically calculated from other arguments to the API or from the API return value .
The maximum amount of data to be captured is configurable .
The following screenshot shows the buffer after a ReadFile API call .
The length lpBuffer is calculated by looking at the value of lpNumberOfBytesRead after the API call has executed .
In this case , the value returned was 174 and that is the length of the buffer displayed .

Call Tree
API Monitor displays a call tree which shows the hierarchy of API calls .
The following screenshot displays a call tree for a CoGetClassObject call made by a Visual Basic application that loads the Microsoft Winsock ActiveX control .
The ActiveX control MSWINSCK .OCX makes calls to WSAStartup and CreateWindowExA from DllMain .

Breakpoints
API Monitor lets you control the target application by setting breakpoints on API calls .
Breakpoints can be triggered before an API call , after an API call , on API failure or if the API generates an exception .
Pre -call Breakpoints allow you to modify parameters before they are passed to the API , or to skip the API call and specify the return value and last error code .
Post - call and Error Breakpoints allow you to modify parameters , return value and last error code before they are passed back to the caller .
Exception Breakpoints allow you to catch the exception to prevent the target application from a possible crash .
Global breakpoints can also be triggered on API errors and exceptions .
Full Auto - complete support is available for all supported enumerated data types and flags .

Monitoring without creating definitions
API Monitor now allows monitoring of any API from any DLL without requiring XML definitions to created .
The newly added External DLL Filter allows DLL ’s to be added and removed on an as - needed basis .
Once a DLL has been added , the filter works exactly the same as the capture filter ; individual API ’s can be selected for monitoring and breakpoints can be set .
In addition , the number of parameters that are captured from these API ’s can be specified .
The External DLL filter can also be saved to a file allowing multiple set ’s of DLL ’s to be loaded based on the target application .

Process Memory Editor
API Monitor includes a memory editor that lets you view , edit and allocate memory in any process .
The memory editor also allows you to change the protection of memory regions .
During a breakpoint , the memory editor can be used to view and modify buffers in the target process .
Right - click on any process or service in the Running Process window to launch the memory editor .

Call Filtering
API Monitor includes dynamic call filtering capabilities which allows you to hide or show API calls based on a certain criteria .
Over 25 different fields can be filtered upon .
Filtering can be used , for e.g. , to find calls that take more than 50 ms to execute , or to view Unicode API calls that failed and returned error code 2 .

George Washington University ’s National Security Archive has released a series of documents and cables from the US State Department and the CIA on the Taliban .
Titled “ The Taliban Biography , The Structure and Leadership of the Taliban 1996 - 2002 , ” the documents provide interesting background information on the Taliban leadership , and most importantly , show that back in 1998 , it was clear that Mullah Omar was close to al Qaeda and had adopted a view of global jihad :
Three years before al Qaeda ’s attacks on the United States on 9/11 , U.S. officials detected an alarming shift in the ideological stance of Taliban leader Mullah Omar toward pan-Islamism – a change that portended a burgeoning alliance between the Afghan regime and Osama bin Laden .
The report that Omar might be falling under bin Laden ’s “ influence ” is contained in a December 1998 U.S. Embassy cable from Islamabad , Pakistan , one of a number of recently declassified government documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Security Archive and published here today on the eighth anniversary of the Taliban ’s expulsion from Kabul . …
In addition to highly informative biographical materials , the declassified documents in this briefing book contain fascinating new details about Taliban structure , decision - making and evolving ideology .
The December 1998 Embassy cable noted above describes how Mullah “ Omar – perhaps under the influence of bin Ladin and other extremists – may have become more sympathetic to pan-Islamist thinking .
For example , he was quoted at least twice in 1998 as criticizing the U.S. presence in the Gulf , which is not usually a great concern of Afghans . ”
Omar was also keen to purge the so - called “ moderate ” elements of the Taliban , led by Mullah Mohammad Rabbani , from the leadership ranks .
Rabbani believed that al Qaeda was a liability to the Taliban government :
Furthermore , Mullah Omar ’s Taliban ruling style may be even more controlling and brutal than previously reported .
The December 1998 Embassy cable mentioned above notes that Omar “ maintains an idiosyncratic , almost obscurantist , leadership style , ” making policy decisions , “ but generally leav[ing ] the day - to - day matters to his key lieutenants . ”
In order to ensure his deputies remain “ off balance ” and do “ not grow overly comfortable in their positions , Omar also rotates Taliban officials from post - to - post , apparently at a whim . ”
Omar may have felt threatened by his now - deceased deputy , Mullah Mohammad Rabbani .
A “ moderate , ” who reportedly disagreed with Omar ’s decision to protect al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , Rabbani wanted to “ settle the [ bin Laden ] matter before [ the Taliban ] become even more isolated from the international community . ”
By 1996 , Omar had purged Taliban members loyal to Mullah Rabbani in order to prevent his Deputy from gaining popularity and an independent base of power .

The biggest news story of the day is one that has barely begun to break and will continue to reverberate for months or years to come .
Someone hacked into a computer at the University of East Anglia ’s Hadley Climatic Research Centre , one of the main centers of anthropogenic global warming research .
The hacker downloaded over 200 megabytes of data from the server , consisting of around 1,000 emails and a variety of other documents .
He uploaded them to an FTP server , where they were available to the public , apparently , for only a few hours .
The event is described here .
Before the documents disappeared from that location , several people had downloaded them and posted them in other locations .
I downloaded all of the material earlier today and have begun to review it .
The emails are stunning .
They are authored by many of the leading figures in the global warming movement : Michael Mann , James Hansen , Phil Jones , Keith Briffa , Stephen Schneider , and others .
They are remarkably candid ; these individuals talk to each other with the knowledge that they are among friends .
The emails I ’ve reviewed so far do not suggest that these scientists are perpetrating a knowing and deliberate hoax .
On the contrary , they are true believers .
I do n’t doubt that they are sincerely convinced–in fact , fanatically so–that human activity is warming the earth .
But the emails are disturbing nonetheless .
What they reveal , more than anything , is a bunker mentality .
These pro-global warming scientists see themselves as under siege , and they view AGW skeptics as bitter enemies .
They are often mean - spirited ; the web site American Thinker is referred to as “ American Stinker ; ” at one point an emailer exults in the death of a global warming skeptic ; another one suggests that the Ph.D. of a prominent skeptic should be revoked because of an error he made decades ago in his dissertation ; another says that he is tempted to “ beat the crap out of ” the same scientist .
The emails show beyond any reasonable doubt that these individuals are engaged in politics , not science .
They also suggest that pro-global warming scientists fudge data to get the results they are looking for .
Just over a month ago , on September 28 , 2009 , Tom Wigley wrote to Phil Jones of the Hadley Centre about his efforts to get the right - sized “ blip ” in temperatures of the 1940s :
Phil ,
Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partly explain the 1940s warming blip .
If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip ( as I ’m sure you know ) .
So , if we could reduce the ocean blip by , say , 0.15 degC , then this would be significant for the global mean — but we ’d still have to explain the land blip .
I ’ve chosen 0.15 here deliberately .
This still leaves an ocean blip , and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip ( via either some common forcing , or ocean forcing land , or vice versa , or all of these ) .
When you look at other blips , the land blips are 1.5 to 2 times ( roughly ) the ocean blips — higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects .
My 0.15 adjustment leaves things consistent with this , so you can see where I am coming from .
Removing ENSO does not affect this .
It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip , but we are still left with “ why the blip ” .
This and many other emails convey the impression that these theorists are making the “ science ” up as they go along , with data being manipulated until it yields the results that have been predetermined by political conviction .
Left - wing politics is a common theme of the emails .
Thus , Michael Mann , author of the notorious “ hockey stick ” hoax , attacked those who do n’t buy the AGW theory on September 30 , 2009 :
Its part of the attack of the corporate - funded attack machine , i.e. its a direct and highly intended outcome of a highly orchestrated , heavily - funded corporate attack campaign .
We saw it over the summer w/ the health insurance industry trying to defeat Obama ’s health plan , we ’ll see it now as the U.S. Senate moves on to focus on the cap & trade bill that passed congress this summer .
This sort of paranoid thinking is odd , since the vast majority of the money in climate science is on the pro-global warming side .
Among themselves , the pro-AGW scientists make no bones about their desire to get their hands on some of that cash .
Thus , a British scientist wrote last month :
How should I respond to the below ?
[ an article questioning AGW theory ]
( I ’m in the process of trying to persuade Siemens Corp. ( a company with half a million employees in 190 countries ! ) to donate me a little cash to do some CO2 measurments here in the UK – looking promising , so the last thing I need is news articles calling into question ( again ) observed temperature increases –
No wonder pro-global warming scientists are dogmatically committed to their theory , no matter what the data say : their livelihoods , as well as their professional reputations , depend on it .
As a result , they conduct themselves like a secret cabal .
Outsiders –that is to say , independent thinkers–are viewed with suspicion .
One of the most striking emails I ’ve come across so far is from Michael Mann to Phil Jones .
It replies to an email from Jones that was copied to another scientist named Andy , relating to a recent fiasco in which tree ring research that was a basis for the U.N. ’s IPCC report on global warming proved to be inaccurate if not fraudulent .
[ UPDATE : A reader says that “ Andy ” is Andy Revkin of the New York Times .
That ’s possible , but I ca n’t see anyplace in this email or elsewhere where “ Andy ” is identified . ]
Mann included this postscript in his reply :
p.s. be a bit careful about what information you send to Andy and what emails you copy him in on .
He ’s not as predictable as we ’d like
A world in which those who are “ not as predictable as we ’d like ” are viewed with suspicion is a world of politics , not science .
Much more to come .
In the morning , we ’ll see how liberal scientists circled the wagons to stave off criticism of inaccurate or fraudulent tree ring data .
UPDATE : This is the email that has gotten the most attention so far :
The language is certainly suggestive–using a “ trick ” to “ hide the decline . ”
This is one of many emails that suggest pro-global warming scientists manipulate data freely to achieve their desired political ends , but it ’s possible the words used could have a relatively benign explanation .
The surrounding emails do not provide context that sheds any light on what those words mean .
UPDATE : More here .

Advertisement Chancellor Alistair Darling has announced plans for a one - off super - tax on bankers ' bonuses as part of his pre-Budget report .
He introduced a temporary levy of 50 % on any individual discretionary bonus paid above £ 25,000 .
Mr Darling said the banks , rather than the bankers , would pay the levy , with anti-avoidance measures introduced immediately .
The move could raise £ 550 m , which would be used to help reduce unemployment .
The temporary measure comes into effect immediately and will cover bonuses paid between now and April 2010 .
Bankers will still have to pay income tax on any bonus they receive as usual .
Time to rebuild
The new tax is designed to discourage banks from awarding large bonuses to employees in the wake of the major taxpayer support they have received in the financial crisis .
HOW THE SUPER - TAX WORKS
Bank bonuses worth more than £ 25,000 will be taxed Banks will be charged 50 % of the value of the bonus Bankers themselves will not pay the super - tax Bankers will still pay income tax on their bonuses as usual
The tax applies to all bonuses awarded up to April 2010 " There is no bank which has not benefited , either directly or indirectly , from [ government ] help , " Mr Darling said .
" This should be a time for banks to rebuild their capital base and become stronger .
" However , there are some banks who still believe their priority is to pay substantial bonuses to their already high - paid staff .
" So I am giving them a choice .
They can use their profits to build up their capital base .
But if they insist on paying substantial rewards , I am determined to claw money back for the taxpayer . "
Competitiveness concerns
The new measure will not be welcomed by banking chiefs in the City , who have expressed concern over the impact of higher taxation on London 's competitiveness .
Angela Knight , chief executive of the British Bankers ' Association , said she was particularly worried about the reaction of foreign banks operating in London .
Bankers say further taxation could harm London 's competitiveness " Viewed from abroad , those foreign banks which reward their UK staff with contractually - agreed bonuses are likely to be the hardest hit , " she said .
" London may well look to them now like a significantly less attractive place to build a business .
" Only concerted international agreements will succeed in reforming remuneration in the financial sector . "
The UK is the only country so far to impose a super - tax on bank bonuses .
Earlier the president of Barclays , Bob Diamond , warned that measures making London less competitive could see bankers move elsewhere .
" Both financial capital and human capital are extremely mobile , " he warned .
Anti-avoidance measures Concerns over the workability of the new tax have also been raised .

In his speech , Mr Darling said that anti-avoidance measures would be introduced to prevent banks from taking such actions .
But the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , questioned how the government would stop banks simply paying their employees a higher salary instead of a bonus .
Toby Ryland , a partner at the accountants Blick Rothenberg , said he was also unimpressed .
" Those that may be affected can be expected to arrange their affairs so as to fall outside the measures , " he said .
" There is already evidence of bonuses having been paid in advance with a view to avoiding this additional tax . "
However , banks will not be able to avoid the taxes by deferring bonuses until after April 2010 , when the temporary measure ends .
The Treasury says that bonuses promised or paid for work done in 2009 are liable to be taxed .
A senior conservative told the BBC that the party shared concerns over tax avoidance , but said they would not be opposing the new measure .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said that the real test of the new tax would be whether it " curbs bank bonuses instead of bank lending " .

MTV's Jersey Shore , a new reality show about self - described Guidos and Guidettes sharing a house in Seaside Heights , New Jersey , caught my eye .
Not just because I spent the first two decades of my life in New Jersey , but because I 've been looking for something just like this show for a long time , because it finally means we can move on : MTV's Jersey Shore is the Worst Thing to Happen to the East Coast Since 9/11 .
Unlike MTV 's sponsors , New Jersey residents and Italian - American organizations I 'm not worried that normal , thinking human beings will see the show and think " That must be what Jersey is like . "
I 'm worried that idiots will see the show and think " Finally !
A place where I can be with others !
I 'm gonna spend my summers in Jersey now , too ! "
That does n't change the fact that after only two weeks on the air , I friggin love this show .
MTV found eight of the most ridiculously absurd humans on the East Coast , put them in a house together and built a jacuzzi on top of that house .
Whereas the The Real World is usually good for a train wreck or two once it picks up enough steam , from a standing start Jersey Shore impossibly begins mid-train wreck , and promises to only get worse .
By the first night , the young Italian caricatures are all gathering around the kitchen , cooking up homemade Italian food and eating together .
It 's exactly like the Corleone family , except there 's no morality and everyone is Fredo .

Mike " The Situation "
To help you catch up , I decided to get some of the heavy lifting out of the way for you .
Here 's who you 'll meet on Jersey Shore .
Mike " The Situation " is what happens when Luca Brasi tried to have a baby by mating with failure .
( It 's a boy ! )
He describes himself as " sensitive " but also with " a ton of game to back it up . "
" The Situation " is sometimes his nickname , as when he tells people at dinner that " Situation sits at the head of the house . "
It 's also the name he uses to describe his ab muscles , as when he asks strangers if they 've " seen The Situation yet , " and then removes his shirt if they say no .
He also will occasionally use the word " situation " in its traditional sense , which does n't seem to matter because he's an idiot who does n't understand how words work .

Wie man mit Statistik täuschen kann
Die verschaukelte Bevölkerung
Von Hans - Dieter Hey
„ Nicht nur die Zahlen sind wichtig , sondern die beabsichtigte Wirkung und der Mechanismus “ meinte Prof. Dr. Gerd Bosbach , Spezialist für Statistikmissbrauch .
Am 25 .
November machte er in der VHS Köln an Beispielen deutlich , wie die Bürgerinnen und Bürger durch Statistik oft bewusst verschaukelt werden .
Kein Wunder : Dahinter stehen konkrete Interessen .
Kommt drauf an , was man sieht : Steigen oder sinken sie ?

Menschen in der Statistikfalle

Online - Flyer Nr. 174 vom 26.11.2008
„ Was ist die gefährlichste Stadt ? “ , beginnt Bosbach seinen Vortrag .
Es sei nicht New York oder Rio , sondern der Vatikanstaat .
Und warum ?
Weil es dort viele Besucher gibt und entsprechend viel geklaut wird .
Der Vatikan - Staat hat bei vergleichsweise geringer Bevölkerung deshalb die meisten Zivil - und Strafverfahren pro Einwohner .
Das Beispiel mit dem Vatikanstaat ist lustig , dieses Prinzip auf Deutschland bezogen wiederum nicht .
Die in und durch Deutschland reisenden Ausländer , die Straftaten begehen , würden auch bei uns in die Ausländerkriminalität eingerechnet , um sie dann aber auf die Wohnbevölkerung umzurechnen .
Dadurch entstünde das falsche Bild von hoher Ausländerkriminalität .
Und jeder weiß , dass sich manche Politiker dies zu Nutze machen und damit vor allem der rechten Gesinnung eine Steilvorlage für Hetzkampagnen bieten .
Meist sind Bosbachs Beispiele lustig .
Eine Meldung in einer Ausgabe der taz über die Frauenquote eines FDP - Verbandes lautete : „ Wir haben den Anteil unserer weiblichen Abgeordneten um 50 Prozent erhöht “ .
Der Hintergrund : Zuerst waren es vier Frauen , dann sechs .
So leicht können absolute und relative Zahlen eben verwirren .
Statistisches Schindluder wurde auch vom Berlin - Institut für Demografische Forschung betrieben .
Das hatte nämlich vor einigen Jahren verkündet , dass jede deutsche Frau 1,36 Kinder bekäme und Deutschland damit seit 30 Jahren weltweit den niedrigsten Wert hätte .
Diese Statistiklüge wurde von der Journaille selbst noch verkündet , als sie längst aufgeflogen war .
Sogar ein Staatssekretär des Arbeitsministeriums wäre danach noch damit hausieren gegangen , erklärt Bosbach .
Doch tatsächlich lag in dieser Zeit Deutschland im Europa der 25 auf Platz 15 , selbst in Europa gab es also noch 10 Länder , in denen die Geburtenrate niedriger lag .
Die Zahl war also frei erfunden .
„ Man wollte wohl wieder ein bisschen Panik machen “ , so Bosbach , „ vielleicht um demnächst die Rente mit 70 einzuführen . “
Auch der Kölner Stadt - Anzeiger übernahm diese Meldung am 18.3.2006 , die dort ungefähr ein Drittel der ersten Seite einnahm .
Prof. Dr. Bosbach hatte damals das Statistische Bundespresseamt aufgefordert , Stellung zu dieser Falschmeldung zu beziehen , und sie wurde danach auch zurück genommen .
Doch in den Medien kam die Korrektur nicht an , mit Ausnahme einer Sendung des NDR - Kulturradios um 23.17 Uhr. Trotzdem verkündete der Arbeitgeber - Think - Tank „ Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft “ sogar noch am 25 .
September 2008 : „ Wir zeichnen uns bekanntlich durch eine der niedrigsten Geburtenraten auf der Welt aus und erfreuen uns zugleich permanent steigender Lebenserwartung . “
Da wollte auch der Kölner Stadt - Anzeiger am 7 .
Oktober 2008 nicht hintenanstehen und ließ seinen Artikelhelden von Seite 1 prahlen , er kämpfe gegen die „ weltweit niedrigste Geburtenrate “ .
Was Bosbach erbost , ist , dass diese Falschinformationen offenbar unauslöschbar in den Köpfen vieler Menschen hängen bleiben und er zitiert deshalb einen Spruch des Philosophen Voltaire : „ Je häufiger eine Dummheit wiederholt wird , desto mehr bekommt sie den Anschein von Klugheit .
“ Lange hatte es bei uns geheißen , wir seien beim Bruttoinlandsprodukt die drittstärkste Nation der Welt .
Bosbach : „ Wenn wir uns natürlich mit Liechtenstein vergleichen , liegen wir hoch .
Gemessen an der Bevölkerungszahl sind wir aber tatsächlich auf Platz 16 .
Und vor uns liegen Länder wie Quatar , Österreich , Schweden oder Finnland . “
Damit seien wir den Nymbus „ Wir sind die Drittstärksten der Welt “ schon wieder los , wir seien nämlich nur Mittelmaß .
Doch das , sagt Bosbach , wollten die Politiker wohl nie hören .
Zurzeit befinden wir uns in einer tiefen Rezession .
Hierzu , so Bosbach , „ verkündet die Bundesregierung zu deren Bekämpfung ein 50 - Milliarden - Konjunkturprogramm , ohne aber darüber aufzuklären , dass davon nur 12 Milliarden ausgegeben werden .
Die restlichen 38 Milliarden beruhen auf der Hoffnung , dass sie durch die 12 Milliarden erst noch erzeugt werden . “
Und die neueste Statistiklüge : Durch die Wirtschaftskrise sind inzwischen besonders auch die Leiharbeitsunternehmen betroffen .
Sie können demnächst ebenfalls Kurzarbeitergeld erhalten , die das Arbeitsamt zahlt .
Doch die Kurzarbeiter erscheinen nicht in der Arbeitslosenstatistik .
Einst erzählten alle Medien und Vertreter des neoliberalen Lagers , dass die Aktien abgesackt seien , als die Zwillingstürme in New York zusammenbrachen .
Doch die Aktien waren schon ein halbes Jahr vor dem 11.9.2001 auf dem Sinkflug und sanken nach dem Überfall weiter .
So werde aber eine falsche zeitliche Ähnlichkeit hergestellt , um eine bestimmte Meinung zu erzeugen .
Heute passiere das Gleiche wieder .
Der Wirtschaftsabschwung werde mit der Finanzkrise begründet .
Rezession ist dann , wenn ein Land zwei Quartale in der Entwicklung des Bruttoinlandsproduktes hintereinander im Minus ist , das wäre also am 1 .
April 2008 gewesen und dies war eindeutig vor dem Börsencrash .
Die Krise zeichnete sich zudem bereits im Jahr 2007 ab .
Und deshalb werde im Wahljahr die Regierung schon klar machen , dass sie für die Krise nichts könne .
Deutschland sei nach der Weltbevölkerungsstatistik 2006 hinter USA und Russland mit rund 10 Millionen MigrantInnen das drittgrößte Aufnehmerland für Flüchtlinge , wird in den Medien berichtet .
Es heißt : „ Das Boot ist voll “ .
Natürlich hat Deutschland mehr Asylbewerber als die Schweiz oder Liechtenstein .
Doch der Gedanke über die Belastung der deutschen Bevölkerung durch Asylbewerber bekommt eine völlige Drehung , wenn man die relative Anzahl gemessen pro Kopf der Bevölkerung betrachtet .
Danach gäbe es bei uns einen Asylbewerber auf 830 Einwohner , und wir lägen an neunter Stelle in Europa .
Selbst die kleine Schweiz habe einen Asylbewerber auf 170 Einwohner und nähme damit fast fünfmal so viele Asylbewerber auf als Deutschland .
Doch für die meisten Medien gelten wir als Land mit den meisten Asylbewerbern , was gerade von der rechten Szene dankbar aufgegriffen wurde .
In vielen Zeitungen erschienen Grafiken , die so aussahen , als hätten sich unsere Gesundheitsausgaben verdoppelt .
Tatsächlich stiegen sie von 1976 bis 2004 aber nur um ca. 40 Prozent .
Und in diesem Zeitraum seien auch alle anderen Preise gestiegen .
Die Frage sei aber , wie viel wir für die Gesundheit gemessen am Bruttosozialprodukt ausgeben , und dann sieht das weitaus weniger dramatisch aus .
Wichtig wären aber die Gesundheitsausgaben je Kassenmitglied .
Und die hätten sich keineswegs dramatisch entwickelt , sondern im Rahmen des Bruttosozialproduktes .
Ungern diskutiere die Bundesregierung überdies auch die Einnahmeseite .
Und die sei wegen der Erosion am Arbeitsmarkt dramatisch gesunken .
Doch damit könne die Bundesregierung keine „ Gesundheitsreform “ begründen .
Bosbach : Gesundheitsministerin Ulla Schmidt kenne die richtigen Zahlen .
Leider veröffentliche sie diese nicht .
Die meisten Grafiken machen uns vor , die Arbeitslosigkeit sei rapide gesunken .
Man beginnt bei der grafischen Darstellung aber dort , wo die höchste Arbeitslosenzahl ist , so dass jegliches Sinken durchaus erfreulich wirkt .
Das kommt dadurch , dass man ein grafisches Bild nur flüchtig anschaut , aber dieser erste Eindruck bleibe haften .
Sähe man allerdings eine Grafik der Arbeitslosigkeit , die die Wiedervereinigung seit 1989 einschließt , ist sie zwar leicht gesunken , aber immer noch schlechter als 1989 .
Von den prekären Arbeitsverhältnissen , in denen die meisten Arbeitslosen gelandet sind , ganz zu schweigen .
Tatsächlich haben wir über 7 Millionen Hartz - IV - Bezieher .
Gerade beim Problem der Arbeitslosigkeit täte die Politik aber so , als wäre das Problem schon beseitigt .
Es sei übrigens relativ neu , dass auch der Kölner Stadt - Anzeiger diese Zahl nenne .
Bis dahin wurde immer so getan , als hätten wir so 2 oder 3 Millionen Hartz - IV - Empfänger und 500.000 mit Arbeitslosengeld I. ( Anmerkung des Autors : Vielleicht musste der Kölner Stadt - Anzeiger die korrekten Zahlen nennen , weil die Neue Rheinische Zeitung die richtigen schon immer genannt hat . )
Derzeit werde auch verkündet , Erwerbslose würden im nächsten Jahr sechs Euro monatlich mehr erhalten .
Berücksichtige man aber die Preissteigerungsrate , haben Erwerbslose ungefähr sieben bis acht Prozent weniger als vorher .
Das zeige deutlich , wer hier belogen wird .
Immer wieder wird Panik damit betrieben , dass Menschen älter werden und damit angeblich auch die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen steigt .
Auch dies widerlegt Bosbach und zitiert den Finanzwissenschaftler Prof. Dr. Bernd Raffelhüschen aus Freiburg , der gleichzeitig für die arbeitgeberfinanzierte Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) tätig ist .
Der hatte aus Zahlen des Statistischen Bundesamtes ausgerechnet , dass sich „ die Zahl der Hochbetagten bis 2050 gegenüber heute vervierfache .
Dann wären also über 7 Prozent der Menschen hochbetagt , und dies wird einfach mit Pflegebedürftigkeit gleichgesetzt .
Und das würde doch unser System ruinieren .
“ Völlig außer Acht gelassen wird , dass die Menschen bisher älter , aber nicht kränker geworden seien .
Jedenfalls beweise die Statistik des Demografischen Instituts Rostock , dass wir bisher gesund altern .
Doch die korrekten Zahlen veröffentlicht keiner .
Bosbach : „ Ich habe manchmal persönlich das Problem , wie solche Dinge ausgeblendet werden können .
An vielen Stellen beten Politiker leider nach , was so Institutionen wie die INSM oder Bertelsmann in ihren Hochglanzbroschüren ständig wiederholen und sind dann manchmal erstaunt , wenn sie die Fakten sehen “ .
Vorgeführt hat Prof. Bosbach auch den Rechtsanwalt Prof. Dr. Meinhard Miegel , den die Nachdenkseiten als „ Running Gag “ bezeichnen und der seit Jahren als Experte für die Privatisierung der Rente im Fernsehen auftritt .
Miegel hatte den Vorsitz für den privaten Think - Tank Institut für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft ( IWG ) in Bonn , das in diesem Jahr aufgelöst wurde .
Er beriet auch das Deutsche Institut für Altersvorsorge , das von der Deutschen Bank finanziert wird .
Und Miegel hatte berechnet , was jemand , der 2040 geboren wird und bis zum Jahr 2130 lebt , in die gesetzliche Rente einzahlt und wie viel er später rausbekommt .
Im BILD - Jargon hieß es : „ Alte kassieren !
Junge zahlen nur drauf ! “
Danach bekämen Männer pro 100 eingezahlte Euro 89 Euro an Rente , Frauen 111 Euro .
Und dieser Unsinn werde in der Wissenschaft tatsächlich als Fakten dargestellt .
Bosbach : „ Das wäre ungefähr so , als hätte der alte Bismarck 1878 gesagt , wie viel Rente wir heute bekommen .
Das ist schon Schwachsinn an sich .
Miegel hat auch noch nicht einmal den Produktivitätsfortschritt in seine Berechnung einbezogen , was er schließlich auch zugeben musste .
Bei Juristen sollte man sich eben fragen , ob man ihren Zahlen glaubt , aber nicht unbedingt voraussetzen , dass sie damit auch umgehen können “ .
Abschließend erklärte Professor Bosbach , der viele Jahre für das Statistische Bundesamt , das Wirtschaftsministerium und die wissenschaftlichen Dienste des Deutschen Bundestages tätig war , er habe noch mehr zum Thema Statistische Lügen in der Tasche .
Wichtig sei aber vor allem , zu wissen , dass Statistiken immer interessengeleitet seien und deshalb genau und mit Vorsicht betrachtet werden sollten .

MSNBC confirms what every architect in Los Angeles and around the country already knew : 2009 was an absolutely gruesome year for the profession and for related trades .
According to the site 's year - end tally of job losses , no field was hit as hard as architecture .
Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the number of " employed architects " in the U.S. dropped from 230,000 through three quarters of 2008 to 189,000 at the same point in 2009 .
Following architects on MSNBC 's list of job losses were carpenters at No. 2 . Construction workers ranked No. 7 .
There was a long - term glimmer of hope , however : BLS projections suggest that employment in architecture and engineering will grow about 10 % through 2018 .

Initial ghc - 6.12 + hackage build results
All , I 've tried building 1324 out of the ~ 1700 packages from hackage using ghc - 6.10.4 and ghc - 6.12.0 .
This is the subset of packages that I could build in one go .
Compared to the subset that I could build with ghc - 6.10.4 , I had to chuck out 125 packages because their build dependency constraints precluded them from building with ghc - 6.12 .
Of the remaining 1324 packages , 113 packages that built OK previously now do not build .
Amongst that 113 , the ones that cause most knock - on failures are : ( 16 , " packedstring -0.1.0.1 " ) ( 12 , " MissingH - 1.1.0.1 " ) ( 11 , " syb- with-class -0.5.1 " ) ( 6 , " uvector -0.1.0.5 " ) ( 3 , " stringtable -atom-0.0.6 " ) ( 3 , " bindings-common -1.3.4 " ) ( 3 , " binary - strict - 0.4.6 " ) ( 3 , " base64-string -0.1 " ) packedstring fails because it needs base 4 , but only says " build - depends : base " , so cabal uses its compatibility tricks and builds it against base 3 .
It should specify " build - depends : base == 4 . * " .
I need to investigate MissingH further .
It failed because a dependency of its non-buildable test program was not found .
That should not have been a problem .
syb - with - class has type errors , I 'm guessing due to changes in template - haskell package uvector does not compile because of the changes in GHC's Handle implementation .
stringtable - atom now fails with a type error for reasons I do n't quite understand : src/StringTable / AtomMap.hs:320:0 : Occurs check : cannot construct the infinite type : a = ( Int , a ) When generalising the type(s ) for `findMax ' Perhaps some change in a containers function ?
bindings - common and c2hs fail because the CLDouble FFI type has been removed .
binary - strict fails because the export of Control .
Applicative .many now clashes with a local definition .
base64 - string fails because it sets - Werror in it 's .cabal file ( a practise which has been banned for some time for just this reason ) .
Of the remaining 113 : 2 failed at the configure step : MissingH - 1.1.0.1 -- this needs investigation , I smell a cabal bug lax - 0.1.0.0 52 failed at the build step ( including those singled out above ) : ArrayRef - 0.1.3.1 -- ghc Handle changes Boolean - 0.0.0 -- name clash with Control .

The David Rumsey Map Collection has now been online for ten years .
The above selection ofis from the latest batch of material uploaded to the site Rumsey is an internet hero of the first order .
Following the success of his business he was able to afford to indulge his latent interest for all things cartographic and he assembled a massive collection of more than 150,000 items .
That might have been the end of the story : rich dude spends money on secret passion in obscurity .
But Rumsey wanted to share his collection with the world and mere donation of his maps and atlases to a document repository did n't seem like it would fully satisfy his magnanimous urges .
From a five year old interview on SFGate
The site has been in continual development since .
Every nine or twelve months a new cache of maps is added and the delivery system has been upgraded and optimised to a point where the site offers an exceptional model for how large - scale digitisation collections can be hosted and served in multiple formats in a very user - friendly manner .
So it goes that the most recent incarnation of the site is now live and is joined by a new blog ( here 's the announcement post about the newly available material ) together with a twitter feed and facebook page
Bill Sali predicted that God would destroy America , alienating even some Republicans
Republicans in Washington do n’t expect Sali to run for the seat , but the two sides have antagonized each other enough that the party is n’t counting on anything just yet .
A national GOP operative said Friday that Sali has made it known that he will decide on the race in January .
“ He ’s told state and D.C. folks that he wo n’t pull the trigger , but no one trusts him , ” the source said .
Freshman Democrat , Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID ) , has done everything short of switching parties to let his western Idaho constituents know that to him being a ConservaDem is 99 % about being Conservative and 1 % about being a Democrat .
No one thinks he 's likely to be embraced by the KKK and Aryan Nation folks in the Hayden Lake / Coeur d'Alene northern end of the district , but thereactionaries down around Boise , Nampa and Meridian are perfectly comfortable with Minnick 's overwhelmingly Republican voting record -- even if he does n't serve endangered species at his campaign dinners and send coded messages of support to violent right - wing militias about black helicopters the way a former representative from the district , Helen Chenoweth ( the Michele Bachmann of her day ) used to do .
One of the most solidly Republican district's in the country -- Bush won every county in 2000 and 2004 and the folks there gave Gore 28 % , Kerry 30 % and Obama 36 %-- Minnick 's ProgressivePunch score of 22.95 on substantive issues leaves little room for complaint .
The only Democrats who have crossed the aisle to vote with the GOP more frequently than Minnick are seven died - in - the - wool neo-Confederate shitheads , Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS - 14.75 ) , Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL - 16.39 ) , Dan Boren ( Blue Dog - OK - 16.39 ) , Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog - MS - 16.95 ) , Jim Marshall ( Blue Dog - GA - 19.67 ) , Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL - 19.67 ) and Charlie Melancon ( Blue Dog -LA - 21.67 ) .
One of the original Boehner Boys , Minnick can be counted on by the GOP on all the really big issues .
This past week , in fact , he was given the honor -- in much the same way that Bart Stupak carried the right 's anti-choice amendment a few weeks ago -- to present the GOP position against financial reform .
Although Minnick 's amendment that would have left bank customers to the tender mercies of determined Wall Street predators ( who , by the way , have rewarded him handsomely for his undying devotion -- to the tune of $ 566,208 ) , failed 208 - 223 , he was able to persuade 32 Democrats to cross the aisle with him and vote with every single Republican against their own constituents ' interests ) .
Interestingly , that $ 566,208 the Finance / Insurance / Real Estate sector has invested in Minnick is considerably more than they 've given to any other Idaho congressmen ....
His current colleague , Mike Simpson ( R - ID ) , was only given $ 255,650 in his entire career and Minnick 's immediate predecessor , Bill Sali ( R - ID ) only saw $ 155,762 .
The two other Republicans who represented ID - 01 in recent times , Butch Otter and Helen Chenoweth pulled in $ 192,590 and $ 150,464 , respectively .
Yep , Wall Street certainly loves Minnick , but in a district with a PVI of R+19 , he needs all the help he can get .
Last year he beat Sali 175,898 ( 51 % ) to 171,687 ( 49 % ) in a stunning upset , with thousands of Republican voters splitting their ticket , voting for McCain for president , Risch for Senate and Minnick for Representative .
It did n't hurt that the wealthy , self - financing Minnick outspent Sali $ 2,599,953 to $ 1,168,536 .
So far Minnick has raised $ 885,842 this year .
He 'll need it .
Although Minnick seems safe from a Democratic primary opponent , he 's a major target for the Republicans , despite his consistent record of supporting them .
The Boise and the Washington GOP Establishments have largely gotten behind Iraq War vet Vaughn Ward .
A local state Rep , Raul Labrador , is also running but he 's being marginalized as an " immigrant supporter , " a death sentence in Idaho politics .
Both are mainstream conservatives , just slightly to the right of Minnick .
The Hayden Lake crowd wants a birther / deather teabagger in the race .
And it looks like they 're about to get their wish .
One of Congress ' fringiest members since Chenoweth , Bill Sali , is likely to demand a rematch .
Sali is so extreme , in fact , that his presence in the race next year is probably thething that could save Minnick 's neck .
The NRCC is petrified he 'll jump in again -- but also petrified of antagonizing the teabaggers by doing anything to turn Sali into a martyr for fascism .
There 's no good outcome in Idaho for 2010 .

Barcelona earned 110 m euros from winning the Champions League in 2009
Football clubs still in this season 's UEFA Champions League have made on average 50 m euros ( $ 72 m ; £ 45 m ) from the competition , research has suggested .
Commercial revenues are up despite the downturn , the Mastercard study found .
The 50 m euros is made up of participation and prize monies , UEFA and club commercial revenues , ticket sales and increased squad values .
The study also found the competition in the 2009 calendar year generated 6bn euros for the European economy .
This is the same amount as the last FIFA World Cup finals in Germany .
' Guaranteed returns ' " Commercial revenues are up this season , and the reason is the economic downturn , " said Simon Chadwick , professor of sports business strategy at Coventry University , who conducted the research .
There is money in the system .
The transfer market was inflated over the summer with the sales of Ronaldo , Kaka and Ibrahimovic
Simon Chadwick , Professor of sports business , Coventry University
He cited the example of this year 's Superbowl in the US , which generated record advertising revenues .
" In hard times , sponsors need to be careful about what they spend on - they are looking for a guaranteed return .
" They know people will watch the Champions League , so they are just minimising risk . "
TV audiences are also rising , he said .
This means clubs get more money from UEFA 's commercial arrangements , and from their own .
Prize money
The 50 m euros is comprised of 14 m euros in participation and prize money , 12 m euros from UEFA 's commercial deals , 8 m euros from the club 's own sponsors and merchandise sales , and 6 m euros from increased player values .
Professor Chadwick said the increased exposure players get through the Champions League increased their value .
He cited Lyon , which has made no secret of the fact it specifically targets the competition in order to increase the resale value of its players .
" And there is money in the system .
The transfer market was inflated over the summer with the sales of Ronaldo ( Manchester United to Real Madrid ) , Kaka ( AC Milan to Real Madrid ) and Ibrahimovic ( Inter Milan to Barcelona ) , " he added .
French champions Bordeaux have made 11.5 m euros in prize money alone from this season 's competition - more than any other team .
Next come Chelsea and Fiorentina , which have won 11.1 m euros .
Arsenal , Manchester United , Lyon , Real Madrid and Sevilla have all made 10.7 m euros .
The reason for the difference in payments is UEFA pays win bonuses per game - 800,000 euros for a win , 400,000 euros for a draw , and nothing for a loss .
The team which goes on to win this season 's competition in the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium , home of Real Madrid , stands to generate 31.2 m euros from prize money alone , the study said .
Last season 's winners , FC Barcelona , earned 110 m euros in total .
Liverpool may be counting the cost of dropping out of the Champions League Europa League
For those teams that have not made it into the knock - out stages of the competition , the financial implications could be severe , even for clubs that will now play in the Europa League , such as Liverpool and Juventus .
" The Champions League is the premier European football competition , offering commercial revenues far in excess of the Europa League .
In no way are [ the two competitions ] comparable , " said Professor Chadwick .
He said any team would have to go all the way to the final of the Europa League , or even win it , to get similar revenues to those available to teams which get through to the knock - out stages of the Champions League .
In terms of countries , England , Italy and Spain have benefitted from the largest economic boost this calendar year , the report said .
With Manchester United reaching the final and all four representatives reaching the knock - out stage , English clubs benefitted to tune of 129.5 m euros in prize money alone .
Italian clubs , with three teams in the knock - out stages , earned 104 m euros , while Spanish clubs earned 96.9 m euros .

Earlier this week , Smith & Wesson 's stock rallied as Obama announce he would send more of our troops into Afghanistan .
Now , despite the promise of a full out world war , shares are dropping thanks to a horrible outlook .
Smith & Wesson said it expects third quarter revenue of $ 90.0 million to $ 95.0 million .
The current consensus estimate is revenue of $ 104.8 million for the quarter ending January 31 , 2010 .
The stock closed at $ 5.27 yesterday and is currently holding steady at $ 4.37 , a 17 % dip !
When Apple announced new iMacs last month , it included a major step forward amid the subtle - but - welcome refinements in most of the models : the first ever iMac to offer a quad - core processor .
The new high - end 27in iMacs are the first to use Intel ’s Core i5 and Core i7 quad - core processors , and they were not available at the time of the announcement .
But finally , the wait is over , and the Core i5 and Core i7 27in iMacs have arrived – and let us tell you , it was worth the wait .
There are four standard iMac configurations , three of which have 3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo processors and were reviewed recently .
The fourth standard configuration is a £ 1,599 model that has the same 27in screen , 1TB hard drive , and 4GB of RAM as the £ 1,349 27in 3.06 GHz
Core 2 Duo iMac , but features a more powerful ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card with 512MB of GDDR3 memory and Intel ’s Core i5 quad - core processor running at 2.66GHz .
The Core i5 has 8MB of L3 cache shared among the processing cores .
The Core i5 features a technology Intel calls Turbo Boost .
If an application is n’t using every available core , the cores that are idle shut off , and the active cores speed up .
According to Apple , this allows the processor to run up to 20 per cent faster under heavy workloads ; that translates to 3.2GHz in this iMac .
As an upgrade option to the Core i5 iMac , you can swap in a 2.8GHz Core i7 quad - core processor for £ 160 more .
The Core i7 also features Turbo Boost ( for speeds of up to 3.46GHz ) , and it also has Hyper - Threading technology that can present itself to highly threaded applications as having eight virtual cores .
To see how well the new quad - core iMacs perform , we ran our overall system performance test suite , Speedmark 6 , and the results were quite impressive .
In fact , with a Speedmark 6 score of 209 , the 2.66GHz Core i5 iMac is the fastest standard configuration Mac we ’ve ever tested .
It was three per cent faster overall than the 2.66 GHz Quad - Core Mac Pro , and 1.5 per cent faster overall than the 2.26GHz 8 - core Mac Pro .
Comparing the Core i5 iMac ’s Speedmark 6 scores to its iMac siblings , the Core i5 iMac was 27 per cent faster overall than the second fastest iMac we ’ve tested , the recently released 21.5 in 3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo iMac with 1TB hard drive and ATI graphics .
Since the Core i5 iMac has the same hard drive as two of the other three new iMacs , we did n’t see a big difference in our file duplication test , and our unzipping test results were pretty flat across the board .
However , we did see a 25 per cent improvement in the Core i5 iMac ’s Compressor score when compared to the 21.5in 3.06GHz iMac , a 26 per cent increase in Call of Duty frame rates , a whopping 71 per cent improvement in our HandBrake test , an 88 per cent faster performance in our Cinebench multiple CPU test , and the new Core i5 iMac posted a Mathematica score more than twice as high as the 3.06GHz iMac .
That ’s a lot of performance bang for an extra £ 160 .
Comparing the new Core i5 iMac to the Mac Pro models , we see the speed advantage going the iMac ’s way in our Zip , iTunes , iMovie export , Call of Duty frame rates , and Compressor tests .
The Mac Pros stood their ground on our HandBrake , iMovie import test , Cinebench CPU test , and Mathematica trials .
Our tests of the built - to - order Core i7 iMac ( which , other than the processor , has identical specifications as the stock Core i5 iMac ) showed even greater performance prowess .
With a Speedmark 6 score of 225 , the £ 1,759 Core i7 iMac was nearly 8 per cent faster than the Core i5 iMac .
The Core i7 was nearly 11 per cent faster than the £ 1,899 2.66 GHz Quad - Core Mac Pro and 9 per cent faster than the 2.26GHz 8 - Core Mac Pro , which sells for £ 2,499 ( £ 900 more ) .
In our tests , there were a few tasks where having eight physical processing cores was beneficial , like our Mathematica and Cinebench CPU tests .
The new quad - core iMacs are outwardly identical to the 27in 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo iMac released last month .
The quad - core iMacs feature an LED backlit screen covered with glass at a 16:9 aspect ratio , an integrated iSight camera , four USB 2.0 ports , one FireWire 800 port , a Mini DisplayPort , and a new SD memory card slot .
In terms of connectivity all new iMacs offer gigabit Ethernet , 802.11n wireless networking , and Bluetooth 2.1 + Enhanced Data Rate .
The 27in iMacs ship with a 1TB 7200rpm Serial ATA hard drive , with a 2TB hard drive option available for an extra £ 200 .

A report published in the new journalhas made an interesting discovery concerning the relationship between sugar intake and the balance of intestinal flora .
Researchers have discovered that a diet high in sugar and fat substantially alters the bacterial composition in the gut , making it difficult to maintain a healthy weight .
Dr. Jeffrey Gordon of Washington University in St. Louis has been accumulating research for years that highlights the role intestinal bacteria plays in regulating bodily weight .
Intestinal flora , sometimes called " good " bacteria , is vital for the proper digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients into the blood .
When digestive bacteria is out of balance or otherwise altered , the body is unable to convert otherwise indigestible foods into digestible form .
The research , conducted on mice , experimented with implanting various strains of bacteria into mice in order to observe their effects .
The two primary divisions of bacteria , and , compose approximately 90 percent of all bacteria .
Studies by Dr. Gordon have revealed that Firmicutes bacteria are more efficient at digesting food that the body is unable to digest on its own .
With this in mind , Dr. Gordon decided to experiment with the various bacteria in gnotobiotic mice , or mice which had no bacteria in their intestines because they were raised in a sterile environment .
What he found was that gnotobiotic mice who received bacteria from obese mice became obese as well .
Similarly , those gnotobiotic mice who received lean - mice bacteria tended more towards leanness .
The same experiment was tried with human intestinal bacteria and similar results were achieved .
What also became apparent was that mice who received bacteria from lean human intestines had a much higher proportion of Bacteroidetes than they did Firmicutes .
These mice , who began with a low - fat diet rich in healthy plants , were switched to a high - sugar , high - fat diet following the implant of the lean human bacteria .
It was discovered that within 24 hours , the two phyla compositions switched resulting in the Firmicutes bacteria becoming more dominant than the Bacteroidetes bacteria .
This study illustrates the powerful correlation between diet and health in a way that has not typically been studied by researchers .
The foundation of bodily health lies in the gut where bacterial colonies are designed to properly route and process nutrients for use in the body .
When they get thrown out of balance due to improper diet , the entire body becomes susceptible to all sorts of diseases , including obesity .
A strange kind of funk often descends on people , be they from the left or right of the political spectrum .
Many people hold to the equation that state activity = socialism .
What seems so obvious can suddenly become bizarre and endlessly confusing .
People like Barack Obama , Winston Churchill and Gordon Brown are transfigured into revolutionaries .
We end up with not just the workers state but also the degenerated workers state , the deformed workers state and the transitional genocidal workers state .
Its interesting how many historical forms capitalism has had to pass through , how many surrogate regimes it has had to use in order to survive .
Capitalism has rarely existed in the form it was supposed to .
There was less of a problem in ancient and feudal civilisations as political and economic power was more or less the same thing .
Kings and emperors conquered land and took tribute .
Capitalists are people who manage the process of commodity production .
At their beginning especially they were actively involved in the production process .
This created a problem we are familiar with today .
It is impossible to work and rule .
Unlike the working class , which must forcibly redistribute wealth in order to maintain its rule ( and in the process undo all class distinctions ) the bourgeoisie had the luxury of being able to accumulate wealth within the Ancien Regime .
The bourgeoisie created representative systems of its own within the old regime , along with an army of paid intellectuals , representatives and advocates .
It was even able to bring the intellectuals of the old classes over to its cause .
An example : during the rise of capitalism the British aristocracy was recruited into the vanguard of capitalist development , in particular to the armed forces and government .
The development of capitalism in Western Europe the 19th century saw wealth accumulated at steeper and faster rates .
The need for greater resources , more labour and bigger markets sent capital across the globe .
Wherever it set down it transformed the local economy into a commodity economy .
The stakes were constantly raised .
In order to stay in the game you needed more and more wealth in order to bid for the market .
It is no mystery why surviving capitalists began to pool resources and organise .
The typical company went from being private limited to publicly owned .
Perhaps the best illustration of this process can be found in the rewarding final chapters of Rosa Luxemburg ’s work The Accumulation of Capital .
For simplicity I will settle on one factor : transport .
Under the heading International Loans , Luxemburg spent some time talking about the Victorian craze for railway building .
It was a risky , sometimes shady , practice often guaranteed by the state ( example the Transcontinental Railroad in the USA , financed by 30 - year government bonds ) .
Profit was often little and a long time coming , if it ever came at all .
Yet the permanent way was crucial to breaking new frontiers for capitalism .
It not only brought commodities to new , faraway places , but also sped up freight and communication , and thus turnover .
The next great leap forward came with the internal combustion engine , leading to the car and aeroplane .
Everything the steamer and train could do , the car and aeroplane could do more quickly , cheaply ( in terms of running cost ) , and on a greater scale .
But these new developments required a round of new and bigger investment , not to mention planning .
We live with the results of this speed up today , state founded railway networks ( examples : Candian , Japanese and New Zealand National Railways ) , airports and airlines with large state involvement ( name a few : Finnair , Air India , Alitalia , Olympic Air ) .
Let 's not forget the huge subsidies for private firms ( such as the US government 's Air Transportation and Safety and System Stabilisation Act , which guaranteed the US air industry $ 5 billion to cover losses resulting from the 9/11 attacks ) .
Congestion is a major urban issue , wrestled with at city admin level ( Transport for London or Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens ) .
Air congestion is juggled with everyday by networks of national and international controllers .
There is no meaningful free market in transport .
There is a potential new frontier for capitalism in the 21st century .
The cold war saw heated military and industrial competition between the American and Russian empires .
There was another separate but connected competition , the space race .
Incredible amounts of money were thrown at this contest .
All of it was directed through national , central , bureaucratic organisations .
Again there was no meaningful free market involved .
As the Russian empire fell behind during the 70s and 80s in terms of military and industrial competition , so the heat went out of the space race .
With the exception of satellite communication ( and even this is heavily reliant on state help ) the potential of space remains largely untapped .
The point is , as capitalism has developed it has gone from private to public to state capitalist .
The state is now the front man , the organiser and the defender at home ( and crucially ) abroad .
It is the lender of last resort .
The state has become the aggregate capitalist , the perfect personification of capital ’s will .
Most importantly it is the collective frontiersman .
Capital needs a hinterland to expand into , one of Luxemburg ’s most clear and lasting observations .
The state is the last organisation that can collect the resources and cover the cost of establishing new frontiers .
This means that the conflicts of our age will largely be national conflicts .
You cannot have a theory of imperialism without a theory of state capitalism .
Have no illusions in Actually Existing Capitalism .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People who have had repeated flu infections -- or repeated flu vaccines -- may have some protection against the new pandemic swine influenza , U.S. researchers said on Monday .
Three - year - old Charles Clarke Jr. gets an H1N1 swine flu vaccine injection in his leg at an Asthma fair at Children 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts November 14 , 2009 .

They found evidence that the human immune system can recognize bits of the new H1N1 virus that are similar to older , distantly related H1N1 strains .
“ What we have found is that the swine flu has similarities to the seasonal flu , which appear to provide some level of pre-existing immunity .
This suggests that it could make the disease less severe in the general population than originally feared , ” said Alessandro Sette , director of the Center for Infectious Disease at California ’s La Jolla Institute .
The study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , may also help explain why many older people are less likely to have severe disease , said Allison Deckhut - Augustine of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
“ Adults may have some pre-existing immunity for H1N1 , ” Deckhut - Augustine said in a telephone interview .
That does not mean older people are protected from infection , and Deckhut - Augustine stressed that people should still be vaccinated against H1N1 .
Swine flu has infected millions of people globally and killed an estimated 3,900 in the United States alone , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Drug makers are struggling to make vaccines and governments are working to vaccinate their populations .
Bjoern Peters and colleagues at the La Jolla Institute looked at flu epitopes -- molecular markers or structures that the immune system recognizes -- dating back 20 years .
“ We found that the immune system ’s T - cells can recognize a significant percent of the markers in swine flu , ” Peters said in a statement .
DUAL PROTECTION
The human immune system has two kinds of protection .
Antibody response can prevent infection , while T - cells fight infection once it has occurred .
Peters and colleagues found T - cell protection but not antibody response .
“ This T - cell response decreases severity of disease but does n’t prevent infection , ” said Deckhut - Augustine , whose agency helped pay for the study and maintains the public database that Peters used .
The effect could be cumulative , Peters said , which could explain why people over 50 seem to be less likely to get noticeable H1N1 infections .
“ This may also suggest why children are more susceptible to severe infection and why they might need two boosts , ” Deckhut - Augustine said .
“ They have n’t been around as long and they have n’t been exposed to different strains of H1N1 as long as adults . ”
Influenza is a very mutation - prone virus and from year to year the circulating strains drift , or change slightly .
This is why new vaccines must be formulated each year and why people can catch flu again and again .
The new H1N1 was a never - before - seen combination of swine flu viruses , with a sprinkling of human and avian flu virus genetic sequences .
But its long - ago ancestor was an H1N1 virus first seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed upwards of 50 million people .
The researchers found that the new H1N1 swine flu shared 49 percent of its epitopes with older , seasonal H1N1 strains .
Using blood from healthy donors , they found that T - cells could recognize about 17 percent of these markers .
I just got off the phone with Elliott Bay Book Company owner Peter Aaron , and he 's finally confirmed it : Just like we reported back in October , Elliott Bay Book Company will be moving from Pioneer Square to a new location on Capitol Hill : 1521 10th Avenue , right next to Oddfellow 's Hall between Pike and Pine .
View Larger Map
Aaron 's not sure of the exact dates just yet , but the bookstore will close its Pioneer Square location " probably sometime in February " and reoopen " probably mid-March " after two weeks of moving books and fixtures to the new location .
The new location will be 19,000 square feet , slightly smaller than the current store 's 20,000 square feet , but Aaron notes that " the selling area will be about 15,000 square feet , which is bigger than the current location . "
The new space will have 25 parking spaces below street level , and another 60 surface - level spaces around the corner .
Aaron confirms that there will be a cafe in the new space , and he says " I have n't decided yet " if the new bookstore will carry used books in addition to new books .
Aaron sent us a copy of the letter that will be going live on Elliott Bay 's website this evening , and it 's after the jump .
I have fuller analysis right here , and I 'll continue adding my thoughts in the days to come .
After many weeks of speculation about the future of The Elliott Bay Book Company , I am now able to confirm that the book store will be moving to a new location on Capitol Hill in the spring of next year .
The past two years have been a difficult , painful period of exploring and evaluating possibilities in an attempt to determine what would be best — and necessary — to ensure the long - term health and vitality of the store .
And while the thought , and the practicalities , of moving from the site and the locale which have been home for the past 36 years are daunting to say the least , I am convinced that this upcoming relocation will afford us the best opportunity to remain , and further develop as a thriving enterprise .
First — about the new location .
We will be moving into a beautiful vintage building on 10th Avenue between Pike and Pine .
The building dates from 1918 — and was the original Ford truck service center for Seattle .
The space will be comparable to the current store ( in fact a bit larger ) , and will incorporate a café and a room dedicated to author appearances .
It has the fir floor — complete with creaks — we ’re used to treading , and gorgeous high wood ceiling — including massive wood beams — and skylights .
While no space could exactly duplicate the charm of the original store , I can promise that the new building will offer a warm , comfortable and cozy environment that will be true to the beautiful place Walter Carr founded on Main Street .
The building has its own parking below street level — and between this and a nearby lot , we will be able to provide ample validated parking .
In addition the new space will offer something we ’ve never been able to offer before — wheelchair access to all levels .
The neighborhood is one of incredible vitality .
I ’m confident that this move will boost our business to the level necessary to maintain our commercial viability — and to facilitate the ongoing investment necessary to keep any business vital .
It will be sad for us all to leave a building — and a neighborhood — that have been our home for all these years .
For those who ca n’t imagine us anyplace else , believe me — all of us at the store have had to wrestle through that .
Moving the store is the second - last thing I would want to see happen .
Seeing the store close would be the only thing worse .
The fact is that the business has been eking downward for the past several years , and the steeper decline of the past two years has made it clear that if the book store is to survive , it must be in a location that affords the vibrancy ( especially in the evenings ) , parking , population base , and freedom from conflict with the sporting events — all of which characterize the new site .
When I first became involved in the ownership of Elliott Bay eleven years ago , it was because I believed fervently that this gem , which had been “ my ” bookstore since I first moved here twenty - seven years ago , was worth saving — that it was a precious asset that must and , in fact , could flourish in this city — if anywhere on earth .
Since that time I have done my best to be a faithful steward in preserving both the spirit and the body of this unique place which has been built and nourished cooperatively by the generations of booksellers who have worked here over the years and the book - lovers who have supported us — here in Seattle , across the country and indeed around the world .
I ’m inexpressibly grateful for that ongoing support — and most especially for the outpouring of concern and commitment we ’ve received in recent months .
We ’re committed to doing everything in our power to continue to earn your patronage and support .
Even as we work toward this significant change , we will strive to do our best to stay focused day - to - day on our primary calling : putting books in readers ’ ( your ) hands .
This includes the full regimen of author readings .
To us , this is less about ending or beginning than about continuing , developing and deepening what we can offer to a community of devoted readers .
We will post progress reports on the new location and ongoing updates on the exact timing of the move on the website ( www.elliottbaybook.com).
I welcome the opportunity to address any questions or comments you may have .
Sincerely ,
Peter Aaron ,
Owner
Elliott Bay Book Company

Eric Testroete , after his trip to Japan ended up with 3000 + pictures he took , about 46 gigs of files .
He made a video with 2700 + pictures of his trip .
The video is titled “ This is Japan ” and is less than eight minutes in length .
So , if you want to show thousand of pictures in a few minutes , this is a great way to show them .
We never went there with the plan to do this , but one night we were looking at the pictures so far .
We held down the button to get through the pictures faster and we noticed it looked fairly cool .
I figured it would be a good idea to make a video this way .
I used lightroom to crop and process all the images ( its good at doing batch stuff ) , Métamorphose to rename the exported files into a numbered sequence , sony vegas to cut to music , then virtual dub to compress and scale .
The video is running at 6 frames a second .
I originally took 3340 pictures , but doing the math there should be about 2760 images in the video .
The camera was a pentax k20d and I brought an external hard drive to save what ended up being 46 gigs in raw files .
You can watch his video here :
Please let me know what you think of this “ technique ” , and also if you know or have done a similar video , please post a link in the comments .
Large - scale distributions of two important nutrient pools -- dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus ( DON and DOP ) have been systematically mapped for the first time over the Atlantic Ocean in a study led by Dr Sinhue Torres - Valdes of the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton .
The findings have important implications for understanding nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles and the biological carbon pump in the Atlantic Ocean .
Tiny marine plants called phytoplankton living in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans produce organic matter through the process of photosynthesis , thereby drawing carbon dioxide down from the atmosphere .
Much of this organic matter is recycled , but some of it -- the so - called export production -- sinks as ' marine snow ' to the deep ocean .
This is also known as the biological carbon pump , and it helps to significantly reduce the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels ( oil , gas and coal ) , that would otherwise accumulate in the atmosphere .
In addition to light , phytoplankton growth requires nutrients for growth .
However , inorganic nutrients are in short supply in vast areas of the oceans known as oligotrophic regions or oligotrophic oceans .
This means that phytoplankton must get the nutrients from somewhere else and therefore " understanding the sources and distribution of nutrients is of major interest to oceanographers , " says Torres - Valdes .
The new study involved scientists based at the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton and the University of Liverpool .
The scientists studied the distributions of dissolved organic nutrients during eight research cruises in the Atlantic between spring 2000 and autumn 2005 .
Six of these cruises sampled north - south transects between 50 degrees N and 50 degrees S , while the other two sampled east - west transects at 24 and 36 degrees N. In this way , they were able systematically to cover large tracts of the Atlantic Ocean .
" This big effort combines observations and a modelling study in order to understand the role dissolved organic nutrients play in export production " said Torres - Valdes : " The large scale distributions revealed very interesting things :
First , nutrient pools in surface waters are dominated by dissolved organic nutrients , making up typically more that 75 % of the total nutrient pools in the upper 100 metres of the oligotrophic Atlantic Ocean .
Second , patterns emerged showing differences exist between the extensive oligotrophic North and South Atlantic subtropical gyres .
DON and DOP concentrations are lower in the North Atlantic .
These differences are more striking in the case of DOP , which is very low in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre . "
This is important because export production over the nutrient poor , or ' oligotrophic ' subtropical gyres is thought to account for up to half of global oceanic carbon export .
The patterns observed probably reflect differences in how dissolved organic nutrients are recycled , with DON being mostly refractory .
DOP seems more easily taken up by organisms than DON .
In the North Atlantic subtropical gyre , DOP may actually provide the extra phosphorus required by microbes that ' fix ' nitrogen .
The researchers also used a computer model to study the effect of cycling and transport on export production .
The modelling work shows that both DON and DOP are important .
While DON contributes up to 40 % of the particulate nitrogen export , DOP contributes up to 70 % of the modelled particulate phosphorus export .
This also shows that DOP is more easily used by microbes than DON .
The observations and model results are consistent with the hypothesis that DON and DOP are important for sustaining export production in surface layers of oligotrophic gyres .
Specifically , these dissolved organic nutrients are produced as a result of enhanced primary production over upwelling regions -- the tropical Atlantic more or less along the equator , off the Northwest African Coast and the North Atlantic subpolar gyre .
These nutrients are then distributed by the ocean circulation , with a very important eddy component , and are then used and recycled as they are transported .
" It 's very likely that this situation also applies to many nutrient - poor marine systems , including other subtropical gyres , the Mediterranean Sea , and summer , stratified shelf seas , " said Torres - Valdes .
The study was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council .
The researchers are Sinhue Torres - Valdes NOCS ) , V. Roussenov ( University of Liverpool ) , Richard Sanders ( NOCS ) , S. Reynolds , S. ( U. Liverpool ; now at the British Oceanographic Data Centre , Liverpool , X. Pan ( NOCS ; now at the British Oceanographic Data Centre ) , R. Mather U. ( Liverpool ) , A. Landolfi ( NOCS ; now at Leibniz - Institut Fur Meereswissenschaften , Marine ) , G. Wolff ( U. Liverpool ) , Eric Achterberg ( NOCS ) and R. G. Williams ( U. of Liverpool ) .
This one has been making the rounds for a little while now ( including a recent appearance on The Colbert Report , viewable after the break ) , but it has n't received anything near Segway - like coverage , which is all the more curious given that it 's potentially a far more important device .
Dubbed the Slingshot , Dean Kamen 's latest creation promises to do nothing short of producing clean water from virtually any liquid source ( without filters ) and generate enough electricity to power about 70 energy efficient light bulbs .
What 's more , Kamen estimates that the machines would cost between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 which , given the number of people a single one is likely to help , is certainly quite the bargain .

Not all Unlisted ISO 's can be booted ( thus adding Unlisted ISOs is an UNSUPPORTED option ) .
Other Notes :
If MultibootISOs was previously used , you must reformat the drive and start over .
YUMI uses Syslinux directly , and chainloads to grub only if necessary , so it is not compatible with the older Multiboot ISO tool .
Although I do plan to add back most of the capabilities of MultibootISOs as time permits .
If you run YUMI from the same location you store ISO files , they should be auto - detected ( * See Known Issues Below ) , eliminating the need to browse for each ISO .
How YUMI Works : YUMI ( Your Universal Multiboot Installer ) enables each user to create their own custom Multiboot UFD containing only the distributions they want , in the order by which they are installed .
A new distribution can be added to the UFD each time the tool is run .
NOTE : YUMI persistence option is currently broken when using YUMI - 2.0.7.4.exe within WINE .
Do n't choose persistence and set the slider or the process will freeze while trying to build the persistent file and you will be forced to close YUMI .
That 's all there is to it .
You should now be booting your favorite distributions from your custom Multi-Boot USB device !
YUMI Troubleshooting , Known Issues , Bugs :
NOW FIXED in the latest YUMI revision .
– casper -rw Persistence is not currently working for Ubuntu 20.04 and variants due to an upstream filename requirement change .
To fix the persistent feature for Ubuntu 20.04 , simply rename the " casper -rw " file to " writable " without the quotes .
This file can be found on your YUMI USB drive in folder I.E. / Multiboot / Ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64 .
The Persistence feature is currently broken with Newer Debian based distributions due to significant changes upstream .
Debian now requires the persistent block file and label to be named persistence instead of live - rw , and it must hold a persistence .
conf file containing / Union .
I am hoping to make the necessary changes and provide a fix soon .
If you encounter a message stating
An error ( 1 ) occurred while executing syslinux .
Your USB drive wo n't be bootable .
Make sure your USB drive is using a Fat32 or NTFS partition with an MBR ( Master Boot Record ) .
An exFAT formatted Partition will not work .
GPT ( GUID Partition Table ) Fat32 or NTFS Partitions are also not supported .
If you encounter a message stating
Insane primary ( MBR ) partition .
Ca n’t find myself on the drive I booted from
First , replace your chain .c32 file located at multiboot / chain .c32 with ( you 'll need to unzip the file ) ->
This zipped chain .
c32 File
If replacing the chain .c32 file does not fix the problem , your USB drive may be improperly formatted , contains more than one partition or MBR , or your BIOS is not properly detecting the USB drive as USB - HDD , and / or its firmware needs to be updated .
You can try these methods to Format and Restore your USB Drive
Windows to Go/ Installers – Options Explained
The Windows to Go option creates a VHD file that is 20 GB in size .
As such , it requires the drive to be formatted NTFS .
Fat32 cannot support a file more than 4GB in size .
Many flash drives you might find at local department stores wo n't be fast enough .
You 'll need a Very Fast Flash Drive .
When Windows boots from the USB for the first time , it 'll go through the setup process and then reboot .
You 'll need to boot using your Windows to Go menu option a second time to finalize the setup process and finally boot into your full Portable Windows .
The Single Windows Installer / PE options are most likely to work for both stock and modified ISO files .
When using it , you are limited to storing one Windows Installer per USB drive ( I.E. one Win XP and one Win Vista 7 or 10 ) .
The Multiple Windows Installer / PE options allow for storing more than one stock Windows Installer per drive .
Generally , only unmodified Windows ISO files will work with this option .
- wimboot option stores the extracted Multi Windows Installers in their own directory .
- bootmgr option moves the bootmgr and bcd files to root of drive .
( note : - bootmgr option does require a Windows Vista or later host to run bcdedit ) .
Traditional YUMI is not natively UEFI capable .
However , it is possible to boot and run your Windows Installers from UEFI .
To switch between added Windows versions , navigate to the multiboot / win- directory ( replacing win-directory with the Windows version you want to boot ) on your USB .
Once there , move the bootmgr , bootmgr.efi , and entire boot folder to the root of your USB drive .
Then reboot , booting your computer from the UEFI compatible USB .
If all went well , it should boot straight into your chosen Windows Installer .
Try an Unlisted ISO – Options Explained
Try Unlisted ISO ( Grub Partition 4 ) –
This boot option attempts to boot the ISO file using Grub .
Additionally it adds a 4th partition table to the USB device and uses this as a placeholder for the ISO .
This option has been shown to successfully boot almost all Linux based distributions .
Try Unlisted ISO ( Grub ) – Same as boot option 1 , but attempts to boot the ISO without using a 4th partition as a placeholder for the ISO .
Try Unlisted ISO ( Grub From RAM ) – Same as boot option 2 , but attempts to store the ISO in system memory and boot it from there .
Useful for cases where the ISO is small , and you 'd like to boot the OS and then move the USB to different machines and subsequently boot the OS from them as well .
Try Unlisted ISO ( via Syslinux ) – The original default YUMI supported boot option .
Syslinux works to boot many distributions , but not all .
Multiboot folder and volume name .
YUMI tries to store most added distributions within the multiboot folder .
This is also the root directory set for syslinux .
In some cases , YUMI also expects the Volume Label of your USB drive to be MULTIBOOT in order for OpenSUSE , CentOS and several other distributions to boot .
YUMI attempts to automatically create this Volume Label , however it can sometimes fail .
Please ensure that the Volume Label of your USB remains MULTIBOOT if you expect your distributions to boot .
When booting linux distributions such as Ubuntu from some laptops such as the Lenovo Yoga with a touchscreen , the acpi=off boot parameter might be necessary in order to successfully boot .
My PC wont Boot from my Flash Drive , but BIOS supports USB boot !
Some Flash Drives ship formatted ( without a partition ) , and YUMI requires the drive to contain a partition with a MBR ( Master Boot Record ) .
To ensure compatibility , you can use YUMI to format your device as NTFS or Fat32 .
How to force a rebuild of the Syslinux MBR :
This is useful if your YUMI prepared USB drive is somehow no longer bootable .
For Newest version of YUMI :
From the multiboot folder on your flash drive , delete the hidden file ldlinux.sys and then rename the libcom32.c32 file to _libcom32.c32 .
Then use YUMI to install any menu item .
YUMI will notice that the file is missing and will attempt to reinstall syslinux and repair the master boot record .
Once finished , rename _libcom32.c32 back to libcom32.c32 .
For Older versions of YUMI :
Delete the hidden ldlinux.sys file from the multiboot folder , and use YUMI to install any menu item .
YUMI will notice that this file is missing and will attempt to repair it .
Other Known Issues :
TAILS – If your USB is detected as a " fixed " hard drive and not a " removable " disk , ( a few Sandisk drives have the removable bit flipped this way ) , you 'll need to remove occurrences of the boot parameter " live- media=removable " from the Live64.cfg file found at " \multiboot\tails -amd64-3.3\EFI\BOOT\ " or TAILS will fail to find the live filesystem .
Flacon 4 , Hiren 's Boot CD , Trinity Rescue Kit , Backtrack , Avira Antivir , and Dr.Web Live CD files are stored outside of the multiboot folder .
Most other distribution files remain contained within the multiboot folder .
I am open to a simple working solution !
YUMI supports Windows XP Install from USB via ISO .
In order for the Windows XP installation to succeed , you must perform the following steps ;
1. ) To begin an install , select ( Stage 1 )
2. ) Upon first reboot , you must select ( Stage 2 )
3. ) Finally , after ( Stage 2 ) is complete – upon the second reboot , select ( Stage 3 ) to boot the drive where you installed Windows XP .
If this option fails , simply remove the USB and reboot !
* YUMI does support NTFS , however not all distributions will boot from an NTFS formatted device .
NTFS is required for Windows to Go and distributions containing files over 4GB .
Troubleshooting Boot Errors :
While trying to run an ISO from USB , If you get a Boot error saying :
Error 60 : File for drive emulation must be in one contiguous disk area
You 'll need to defragment your ISO using one of the following tools :
contig – Command line tool to defragment ISO files .
wincontig – GUI tool to defragment ISO files .
Additional Notes :
Edit non-booting menu entries for the ISO 's you have added via the " Try and Unlisted ISO ( GRUB ) " options , by editing the corresponding entry in \multiboot\menu\menu.lst
If you do n't have a floppy drive and get fd0 errors while booting , simply add floppy .
allowed_drive_mask=0 to the append line for the troubled entry .
Although the best fix is to simply disable floppy in BIOS .
Persistently Saving Changes : YUMI currently enables the casper - rw persistence feature for some ( but not all ) Ubuntu based distributions .
Yes , you can have multiple persistent Ubuntu based distributions , as each distro utilizes its own casper - rw file .
* Persistence will NOT work on NTFS formatted USB drives .
Some Distributions also will not even boot via NTFS !
Ophcrack Tables :
To load Ophcrack tables when booted in this fashion , the tables folder needs to exist at the root directory of the USB device ; ( example F:\tables\vista_free ) .
Get Ophcrack Tables from the Official Ophcrack site and unzip to your USB .
You can have both XP and Vista / 7 tables working together .
The following is a technique I ’ve used over the last decade or so for distributing web traffic ( or potentially any services ) across multiple services , using just DNS .
Being an old DNS hack , I ’ve called this technique Poor Man ’s Anycast , although it does n’t really use anycasting .
But before we get into the technique , we need to make a brief diversion into the little - known but rather neat feature of the DNS , or more accurately , DNS forwarders , which makes this a cool way to do stuff .
The feature is name server selection .
Most DNS clients , and by this I include your home PC , make use of a DNS forwarder .
The forwarder is the thing that handles ( and caches ) DNS requests from end clients , while a DNS server carries authoritative information about a limited set of domains and only answers queries for them .
These two functions have historically been conflated rather severely , mainly due to the use of BIND for both , and why this is a bad thing is the subject for a whole other post .
Moving right along .
A DNS forwarder gets to handle lots of queries for any domain that its clients ask for .
When you ask for foo .
example .net , it asks one of the root servers ( a.root - servers.net , b.root - servers. net et al ) for that full domain name ( let ’s assume it ’s just come up and does n’t have anything cached ) .
It gets back a delegation from the root servers , saying basically , “ I do n’t know , but the GTLD ( .com , .net ) servers will ” , and tell you where to find the GTLD servers ( a.gtld-servers. net et al ) .
You ask the one of the GTLD servers , and get back an answer that says that they do n’t know either , but ns1.example.net and ns2.example.net do .
You then ask ( say ) ns1.example.net , and hopefully you ’ll get the answer you want ( e.g. the IP address ) .
Now , along the way , the forwarder has been caching everything it got .
Every time it asks a name server for data , it stores the time it took to reply .
That means that when looking up names in example .net , the forwarder has been collecting timing and reliability data which it uses to choose which name server to ask next time , as well as the answers it received .
So if ns1.example.net answers in 20 ms , but ns2.example.net answers in 10 ms , roughly two thirds of the queries for something .
example .
net will be sent to ns2.example.net .
If the timing difference is much greater , the split of queries will be even more marked .
Similarly , if a name server fails to respond at all , that fact will be reflected in the accumulated preference assigned to that server , and it will get very few queries in future ; just enough so that we know we can start sending it queries again when it comes back .
This is a powerful effect , and is of particular use when distributing servers over a wide geographical area .
DNS specialists know about it , because poor DNS performance affects everything , and DNS people do n’t like adversely affecting everything .
( They ’re really quite paranoid about it .
Trust me , I ’m one . )
But it can also be used to pick the closest server for other things as well .
After all , closeness ( in terms of round - trip time ) is very important in network performance ( see my post on bandwidth delay products ) .
The technique is as follows .
Let ’s say we have three web servers , carrying static content .
Call them , say , auckland.example.net , chicago.example.net and london.example.net .
Let ’s say that they ’re widely disparate .
All three servers carry content for http://www.example.com/.
So , we start by configuring , on the example .com name servers :
$ ORIGIN example.com .
$ TTL 86400 www IN NS auckland.example.net .
IN NS chicago.example.net .
IN NS london.example.net .
We then run a DNS server on all three web servers .
We configure the servers with a zone for www.example.com along the lines of :
$ ORIGIN www.example.com
$ TTL 86400 ; Long ( 24 hour ) TTL on NS records etc @ IN SOA auckland.example.net .
webmaster.example.com ( 2009112900 3600 900 3600000 300 ) IN NS auckland.example.net .
IN NS chicago.example.net .
IN NS london.example.net .
$ TTL 300 ; Short ( five minute ) TTL on A record @ IN A 10.0.0.1 ; Set this to host IP address
Now the key is that each web server serves up its own IP address .
When a DNS forwarder makes a query for a www.example.com, it will be directed to one of auckland .example.net , chicago.example.net or london.example.net .
But as more and more queries get made , one of those three will start handling the bulk of the queries , at least if that one is significantly closer than the other two .
And if auckland .
example.net gets the query , it answers with its own IP address , meaning that it also gets the subsequent HTTP request or other services directed to it .
The short DNS TTL ( 5 minutes in the example ) mean that the address gets queried moderately often , allowing the name server selection to “ get up to speed ” .
Much longer TTLs on the name servers mean the data does n’t get forgotten too quickly .
The result is that in many cases , the best server gets the request .
The technique works best if there are lots of domains being handled by the same set of servers , and there are lots of requests coming through .
That way the preferences get set quickly in the major ISPs ’ DNS forwarders .
The down side of the technique is that far away servers will still get some queries .
This non-determinism may be a reason for not deploying this technique .
If you want determinism , you ’ll need to look at more industrial grade techniques .
Now , this is n’t what players like Akamai do , and it is n’t what anycasting is about .
Akamai and ( some ) other content distribution networks work by maintaining a map of the Internet , and returning DNS answers based on the requester ’s IP address .
But this is a fairly heavyweight answer to the problem .
It ’s not something you can implement with just BIND alone .
Anycasting on the other hand relies on advertising the same IP address in multiple places , and letting BGP sort out the nearest path .
This has three disadvantages :
It potentially breaks TCP .
If there is an equal cost path to a given anycast node , it ’s possible one packet from a stream might go one way , while the next packet might be sent to a completely different host ( at the same IP address ) .
In practice , this has proven to be less of a problem than might be expected , but there is still scope for surprises .
Each of your nodes has to be separately BGP peered with its upstream network (s ) .
That ’s a lot more administration than many ISPs will do for free .
Most importantly , being close in BGP terms is not the same as being close physically or in terms of round - trip time .
Many providers have huge reach within a single AS , so a short AS - path ( the main metric for BGP ) may actually be a geographically long distance , with a correspondingly long round - trip .
The other nice thing about poor man ’s anycast is that it ’s dynamic ; if a node falls off the world , as long as its DNS goes away too , it ’ll just disappear from the cloud as soon as the TTLs time out .
If a path to it gets congested , name server selection will notice the increased TTL and de-prefer that server .
And of course you do n’t need to be a DNS or BGP guru , or buy / build expensive , complex software systems to set it up .
It 's possible drugs just might have been a factor in a Southern California rampage that involved a man allegedly jumping out of a third - story window , killing a dog with his bare hands and then pouring coffee all over himself after running naked through a tennis club , say authorities .
Bayron Reyes Lopez allegedly began his busy day at a San Clemente apartment , where deputies responded to reports of a loud radio at 4:30 a.m.
Wednesday , according to the Orange County Sheriff 's Department .
" We get there , go in the room , the guy is gone , " sheriff 's spokesman Jim Amormino told the Orange County Register .
Lopez is believed to have jumped from the third - story window , the newspaper reported .
Around 6 a.m. , Lopez resurfaced nearby and allegedly killed a dog .
Julie Donnelly , 34 , told deputies she was walking her pet miniature Schnauzer , Kokanee , near the 1100 block of Calle del Cerro when a man approached her , picked up her dog , choked it and then slammed the animal into the pavement .
" He got a few feet in front of us and got into an attack - type mode -- aggressive mode -- like he was ready to lunge out at me , but instead my dog went out in front , " Donnelly said .
" I know that human life is much more important than the life of an animal , but she sacrificed her life for me this morning .
She bought enough time so that he did n't attack me , " Donnelly said .
The man fled the area on foot , said Donnelly .
A few minutes later , deputies found Lopez at the Rancho San Clemente Tennis Club , lying naked on the ground , pouring coffee on himself .
Before his coffee break , Lopez was allegedly running around the club naked , said a witness who called police .
Lopez , who was a maintenance worker at the tennis club , was arrested and hospitalized , Amormino said .
" He may have been under the influence of drugs , " Amormino told the Register .

* Run-off cancellation a double - edged sword for Obama
* Obama says Karzai must deliver on promises
* White House presses Karzai to curb corruption
* Decision on sending more troops still weeks away
( Adds Obama comments , analyst , anti-corruption efforts )
By Ross Colvin
WASHINGTON , Nov 2 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama signaled on Monday that Washington 's support for Afghan leader Hamid Karzai would come with more strings attached , including a demand he get much tougher on rampant corruption .
Obama called Karzai to congratulate him on winning a second five - year term after Afghan election officials scrapped a Nov. 7 run -off vote .
Karzai's only challenger , former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , withdrew from the election on Sunday , citing doubts about the fairness of the process .
" I emphasized that this has to be a point in time in which we write a new chapter based on improved governance , a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption ( and ) joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces , " Obama said in the White House Oval Office .
Karzai's re-election capped weeks of political uncertainty that has complicated Obama 's efforts to revamp U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and decide on a request by his top commander there for up to 40,000 more troops to tackle deteriorating security .
But analysts said Obama now faced an uphill battle in convincing a skeptical American public that Karzai deserved continued U.S. support , after a fraud - riddled election that saw millions of ballots favoring the Afghan leader thrown out .
" It is going to be harder to sell domestically .
Arguably the most consequential effect ( of the election ) has been here , " said Stephen Biddle , who helped advise U.S. Afghan commander General Stanley McChrystal in a rethink of U.S. policy there .
" They ( the administration ) are definitely going to attach more systematic strings to the thousands of things we do in Afghanistan every day .
They are going to insist on government reforms , without which the campaign will fail , " said Biddle , a military analyst .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs faced repeated questions at a briefing on how Washington could work with Karzai when his legitimacy had been so widely questioned after the tainted August vote .
" President Karzai has been declared the winner ... so obviously he is the legitimate leader of the country , " said Gibbs , without directly addressing questions on whether the administration also saw him as credible .
DEEDS NOT WORDS
In his comments later , Obama said Karzai had assured him that he understood the importance of improving governance and stamping out corruption , " but as I indicated to him , the proof is not going to be in words , it is going to be in deeds . "
Obama administration officials want Karzai to sign onto measures to combat corruption .
One option under discussion is creation of an anti-corruption commission with the authority to go after top officials .
Washington is also ready to offer practical assistance to the next Afghan government , such as sending more civilian advisers to ministries to help improve services to wide swathes of the country , officials said .
Gibbs said Obama would announce his new strategy " in the next few weeks . "
The timing had never been dependent on the outcome of the election , he said , although administration officials had previously suggested it was a factor .
A senior administration official told Reuters at the weekend that Obama was not likely to announce his new strategy before he embarked on a 10 - day trip to Asia on Nov. 11 .
The cancellation of the run-off is both a concern and a blessing for Obama .
After U.S. troops suffered their bloodiest month in the eight - year - old war in October , his administration would have been reluctant to commit troops to police an election in which there was only one candidate and which the Taliban had vowed to attack .
But it now has to work with a severely weakened leader whose government is viewed by many Afghans as both corrupt and inept .
Relations between Karzai and Washington also soured after the fraud - tainted August election and U.S. officials had to pressure the Afghan president to stand in the run-off .
With the run -off now canceled , Obama is likely to come under more pressure to make a decision soon on his strategy , although the White House has said such an important policy shift requires careful consideration .
Republicans have been particularly critical of Obama , saying he is being overcautious .
The House of Representatives Republican leader , John Boehner , said the scrapping of the run-off had removed the " pretext for delaying the decision on giving General McChrystal the resources he needs to achieve our goals in Afghanistan . "
There are some 67,000 U.S. troops in the country .

There has been no investigation of the shooting by the Afghan government nor any mention of it in the press .
The F.B.I. questioned Hashmat Karzai a month ago , he acknowledged , but it is not clear whether American investigators are pursuing the matter .
An F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment .
Image Waheed Karzai , 18 , a relative of Afghanistan 's president , was shot to death .
While some family members accuse the Karzai government of stonewalling , they do not claim that the president played an active role in blocking an investigation .
Instead , they blame several of his brothers , including Ahmed Wali Karzai , the political boss of Kandahar and southern Afghanistan , for trying to hush up relatives and forestall an official inquiry , perhaps with the president ’s knowledge .
“ Not a single soul has come to investigate , ” Yar Mohammad Karzai , 62 , said in a recent telephone interview .
“ I told one local official , what do you want me to do , knock on Obama ’s door ? ”
Noor Karzai , 40 , a cousin who lives in Maryland , expressed similar disappointment .
“ They are protecting Hashmat , ” he said .
“ He is sitting in Kabul getting money from the U.S. government .
No one will touch him .
We are sending billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Afghanistan , and this is how the government operates . ”
A spokesman for the Afghan president said that the case was a criminal matter and denied that the president sought to interfere .
Reached by telephone on Saturday , Ahmed Wali Karzai declined to comment on the matter , as did officials at the United States Embassy in Kabul .
Frustrated by the seeming inaction on the killing , nearly a dozen family members agreed to be interviewed for this article .
Some , including Yar Mohammad Karzai , Sona Karzai and Zalal Karzai , who witnessed aspects of the shooting or its immediate aftermath , also provided documents about the killing .
They include a complaint that Yar Mohammad Karzai filed with the Dand district police in Kandahar Province naming Hashmat Karzai as Waheed ’s assailant , the boy ’s hospital records and a death certificate stating that he died of gunshot wounds .
Other family members , saying they feared retribution , agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity , as did three witnesses from the Karz mosque .
All three said they heard the shooting across the street ; one identified Hashmat Karzai as the robed man he saw exiting the house .
The NYTimes reported yesterday that Acorn broke no laws .
None .
In the last five years .
But the Democratic Congress still threw them under the bus , with an illegal bill of attainder , banning them from receiving any government money before waiting to see if they really had done anything wrong .
x264 HD Benchmark 5.0
by graysky
updated by Adrian Wong & Dashken
What Is x264 HD Benchmark ?
x264 HD Benchmark is a benchmark that allows you to measure how fast your PC can encode a 1080 p video clip into a high quality x264 video file .
It allows for an easy comparison because everyone running it will use the same video clip and software .
The x264 video encoder has a fairly accurate internal benchmark ( in frames per second ) for each pass of the video encode and it also uses multi-core processors very efficiently .
All these factors make the x264 HD Benchmark an ideal tool in comparing the video encoding performance of different processors and systems .
What 's New In Version 5.0.1 ?
For starters , we are also introducing a new 1080 p video clip with a tougher benchmark script to really stress the newer multi-core processors .
To top it off , the x264 HD Benchmark is now capable of running in 64 - bit mode , as well as 32 - bit mode .
We also updated the benchmark with revision 2200 of the x264 encoder , and CPU - Z 1.60.1 .
The new x264 encoder supports the following features :
Threaded lookahead
8x8 and 4x4 adaptive spatial transform
Adaptive B - frame placement
B - frames as references / arbitrary frame order
CAVLC / CABAC entropy coding
Custom quantization matrices
Intra : all macroblock types ( 16x16 , 8x8 , 4x4 , and PCM with all predictions )
Inter P : all partitions ( from 16x16 down to 4x4 )
Inter B : partitions from 16x16 down to 8x8 ( including skip / direct )
Interlacing ( MBAFF )
Multiple reference frames
Ratecontrol : constant quantizer , constant quality , single or multipass ABR , optional VBV
Scenecut detection
Spatial and temporal direct mode in B - frames , adaptive mode selection
Parallel encoding on multiple CPUs
Predictive lossless mode
Psy optimizations for detail retention ( adaptive quantization , psy - RD , psy- trellis )
Zones for arbitrarily adjusting bitrate distribution
New !
The latest version is 5.0.1 with the following changes :
Solved the problem of the benchmark not generating results if the benchmark folder has a space or spaces in the name .
Solved the problem of the " missing " results.rtf file .
Corrected minor mistakes in the script .
This is a minor update , so the results from this version can be compared with the original version 5.0 benchmark .
Version Numbering
Starting with x264 HD Benchmark 5.0 , we will be increasing the frequency of updates to support ever newer revisions of the x264 encoder .
This requires a logical version numbering for everyone to keep track of .
This is the system we will be using henceforth :
Complete revisions of the benchmark will have full number changes ( 4.0 -> 5.0 ) .
Results of different complete revisions are NOT to be compared !
Major revisions of the benchmark will include new x264 encoders and / or changes to the benchmark files that will affect performance .
These will be numbered after the first decimal point ( 5.0 -> 5.1 ) Therefore , results of different major revisions are NOT to be compared too !
Minor revisions of the benchmark will include new CPU - Z builds and / or changes to the benchmark files that will not affect performance .
These will be numbered after the second decimal point ( 5.0 -> 5.0.1 ) .
The results of different minor revisions can be compared .
As always , please do not just update the x264 encoder by yourself as your results will not be comparable with results from other users .
The usefulness of a benchmark relies not only on its ability to deliver an assessment of a computer 's performance but also the ability to directly compare one set of results with another set of results .
This is only possible if everyone is using the same benchmark , with the same encoder , and the same settings .

It is a cold and snowy night .
The main street is deserted .
The only things moving are swirls of snow .
As I lift the mailbox door , I feel its cold iron .
There is a privacy I love in this snowy night .
Driving around , I will waste more time .

The poem ’s 6 sentences are 5 lines : “ I ” occurs 4 times in the last 3 .
The first 2 lines concern “ things , ” and the only “ things ” are “ swirls of snow . ” “ Night ” and “ street ” are time and place .
“ Cold ” and “ snowy night ” are split when “ I ” emerges : “ cold iron ” is lifted ; the “ snowy night ” is dwelt in , holding privacy .
Our speaker is the landscape : “ The only things moving ” implies , considered with “ driving , ” that he is a swirl of snow .
“ Waste more time ” implies that going to mail the letter itself was a waste – writing it , then , was also a waste ?
So is this just an ode to loneliness ?
Not quite .
The desertion of the main street and the harsh weather ask whether man is by nature a social being .
All of us have times in our lives where we must be alone ; we can also wonder whether the first man ever knew – or could know – anyone else .
If he is not social , he is a swirl of snow , but not simply : “ I lift ” / “ I feel ” / “ I love ” / “ I will . ”
The burden is the absence of burden : he must love the privacy , for any hope of company is merely that – hope .
Each end of his actions in the last three lines is directed to increasingly reduced objects : “ door , ” “ iron , ” “ privacy , ” “ time . ”
From Heidegger , “ What is Metaphysics ? ” –
In anxiety , we say , “ one feels ill at ease . ”
What is “ it ” that makes “ one ” feel ill at ease ?
We cannot say what it is before which one feels ill at ease .
As a whole it is so for one .
All things and we ourselves sink into indifference .
This , however , not in the sense of mere disappearance .
Rather , in this very receding things turn toward us .
The receding of beings as a whole that closes in on us in anxiety oppresses us .
We can get no hold on things .
In the slipping away of beings only this “ no hold on things ” comes over us and remains .
Anxiety reveals the nothing ….
With the fundamental mood of anxiety we have arrived at that occurrence in human existence in which the nothing is revealed and from which it must be interrogated ( 101 ) .
It is not clear our speaker feels anxiety ; it looks like the condition he is in is more like the counterfactual outlined above , “ what if man is not a social being ? ”
He does seem to be indifferent , but he is in motion , not closed - in .
Still , Heidegger ’s discussion of anxiety leading to questions of being and nothing is probably appropriate to consider now .
Our speaker is confronting nothingness and can only communicate through what may be messages in a bottle .
He can only wish to be truly heard .
In a way , this is akin to a philosophic condition , one which logos does complicate .
We note that only the title mentions something about a letter .

SANTA BARBARA , Calif .  Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , said on Monday that Asian nations were pulling the global economy out of its downturn but warned that both Asia and the United States needed to do more to reduce global trade imbalances .
Speaking at a conference on Asia hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , Mr. Bernanke said Asian countries had bounced back from the global recession faster than the rest of the world and had reported “ impressive ” growth .
“ Asia appears to be leading the global economic recovery , ” the Fed chairman said , noting that the region as a whole expanded at an annual rate of 9 percent during the second quarter and that some countries , including China , grew at rates of more than 10 percent .
But Mr. Bernanke also warned that huge trade imbalances between the United States and the rest of the world had played a central role in the global economic crisis and that they could do so again .
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for killing five British troops in Afghanistan guardian.co.uk
The British soldiers unstrapped their equipment as they passed through the mud walls of the police compound , having only recently returned from patrolling the Helmand countryside with the men they were mentoring in the Afghan police .
Inside the walls of the checkpoint , rifles were unslung and body armour put aside as the men drank tea , completed paperwork and relaxed after their mission .
But , unknown to the men , one of the Afghan police – a man named Gulbadin – had clambered on to the flat roof of the building above , armed with a powerful PK machine gun .
When he started shooting , the soldiers barely had a chance .
Sighting his weapon , Gulbadin fired down on the weaponless troops , a mixture of Grenadier Guards , Royal Military policemen and Afghan police .
Some tried to grab for their loaded rifles , but only at the end , with four British soldiers dead , one fatally wounded and eight others injured , including two Afghan police , were those inside the police station able to return fire at the shooter before he managed to escape – aided , it is suspected , by another policeman .
What happened on Tuesday afternoon was a few brief moments of carnage .
They were moments , however , that have been written into the increasingly bloody recent history of Britain 's engagement in Afghanistan as one of the worst single losses of life in a shooting incident .
Among the fallen was Sergeant Matthew Telford of the Grenadier Guards , the first of the dead soldiers to be named .
The police station at Shin Kalay is not much to look at .
A few hundred metres from the rest of the village , it is a low , blocky structure , set behind a wall , guarding a solitary road and a bridge over an irrigation ditch that cuts through Helmand 's tapestry of square green fields .
But in a war whose frontlines are ill - defined , the Shin Kalay checkpoint , say those familiar with the area , is located on one of the conflict 's invisible boundaries , about 100 metres from where Taliban territory begins .
What is significant is that the bullets did not come across the fields from a distant ditch or building but from inside , from the barrel of an ally 's gun .
It comes in a year marked by several such instances , raising serious questions about the loyalty of Afghanistan 's security forces .
With a manhunt under way , it was left to the British army to explain how the attack had been so lethally effective .
Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield , the spokesman for Task Force Helmand , said it was almost certain that the soldiers were not ready to defend themselves .
" The first thing you do when you come back from a patrol is to put down your weapon and helmet , so although we do n't know yet and it 's subject to an investigation , it 's fair to assume they were not ready for the attack . "
As British military and Afghan investigators began piecing together the circumstances of the attack , even as the injured and dead were loaded on to US Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters for evacuation to Camp Bastion , it became clear it would make uncomfortable reading for those involved in training both Afghanistan 's army and police .
There were conflicting reports .
Some said the Taliban had been quick to claim responsibility for the attack , explaining the group wanted to sow mistrust between foreign forces and the Afghan police .
Other information emerging about Gulbadin suggests that the motives behind his attack are likely to be complex .
The reality , it appears , is that Gulbadin was no new recruit , a Taliban infiltrator sent to penetrate the troubled police service for this attack alone .
Instead , it was disclosed today , the gunman joined up three years ago , undergoing his initial police training in the city of Kandahar .
He was a member , however , of the Alozai tribe in an area where the Noorzai tribe dominates the police .
And while tribal elders said after the killing they were aware he had Taliban links despite being in the police , Gulbadin appears to have been conflicted in other ways too .
According to elders , he had recently been involved in a furious dispute with a police officer named Muhammad Wali , his commander for the previous two years .
Unable to work with Wali , Gulbadin had been reassigned to a new unit , the police checkpoint in Shin Kalay , commanded by an officer named Manam .
The tribal elder said Gulbadin's new commander tried to help patch up the relationship between the two men and to persuade him to go back to work for Wali .
The elder said Manam had also been injured in the shooting .
Indeed some reports said he may have been the first target .
What little is known about Gulbadin , who some sources say may have been injured in the exchange of fire , is deeply suggestive .
It indicates – experts and military sources believe – the complex and shifting loyalties among police , Afghan soldiers and local politicians in Afghanistan 's Taliban insurgency .
" The questions we need to ask are much more complex than are apparent at first view , " said one Nato officer in the Afghan mission .
" What is a Taliban ?
What is the threat ?
From our end the concern is the same as the argument laid out by David Kilcullen [ the influential Australian counter - insurgency expert ] .
It is about loyalty .
Even if individuals think ISAF [ the International Security Assistance Force ] is doing a good job , they are still not your own people .
Nowhere is that more true than in Helmand where we are confronted by overlapping webs of association and loyalty .
" The army has been successful because it has been nationally recruited , but the police are recruited locally .
They are still part of a local network of loyalty ... [ They are people ] whose families are vulnerable .
Who have to think about where they live . "
And while British officers in Helmand were quick to characterise the shootings as a " rogue " event , the incident at Shin Kalay has not been unique .
Last year , two American soldiers were shot and killed by Afghan police in the space of about a month .
In October 2008 , a policeman threw a grenade and opened fire on a US foot patrol , killing one soldier , while in September , an officer opened fire at a police station in Paktia , killing a soldier and wounding three before he was shot dead .
In July in the Helmand town of Aynak , police opened fire on a group of around 150 US marines and Afghan soldiers as they approached the police headquarters .
Indeed , serious concerns have repeatedly been raised about the police in Helmand since British forces went there in spring 2006 .
Its police have a particularly bad reputation and are often accused of taking drugs , extorting bribes and turning a blind eye to opium smuggling .
Captain Doug Beattie , a former British soldier who trained Afghan police from 2006 to 2008 , today questioned their loyalty .
" They 're really a militia , a tribal police whose allegiances are not necessarily to the government or even to the provincial governor .
[ Their loyalty ] is normally to their village or tribe or the area they come from , " he said .
" Because they 're militia they can be bought and paid off at will .
If the government 's paying them they 're reasonably happy .
But if they do n't get enough money they 're quite happy to be paid by the insurgency . "
It is an issue that was addressed by Major General Nick Carter after the killings .
" The first point I would make is that we have to trust the uniform of the Afghan police .
The second point I would make is that we will get better at this .
We will make it perfectly possible for us absolutely to understand who we are working with because we will train them , and we will make sure that they are capable of doing the job in the way that they need to do the job . "

Senator Charles E. Schumer , the New York Democrat , is calling on the Obama administration to block the use of stimulus funds for a utility - scale wind farm in West Texas that would make use of turbines manufactured largely in China .
As Green Inc. reported last week , the $ 1.5 billion wind venture — announced by a coalition of American and Chinese companies — was planning to seek $ 450 million from funds set aside in the economic stimulus package for clean - energy development .
The rest of the financing would come from Chinese commercial banks , and the turbines themselves would be manufactured by A - Power Energy Generation Systems of Shenyang , China .
Citing an analysis by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University , which found that 84 percent of “ green ” stimulus funding has thus far gone to foreign companies building renewable energy projects in the United States , Mr. Schumer vowed in a telephone interview to introduce legislation if such funding is n’t reconsidered .
The stimulus money “ is supposed to create jobs in America , ” Mr. Schumer said .
“ We ’re not saying every nut an every screw has to be made in America , but the majority of these manufacturing jobs should be located here . ”
Mr. Schumer said he had sent a letter on Thursday to Energy Secretary Steven Chu , urging him to “ reject any request for stimulus money unless the high - value components , including the wind turbines , are manufactured in the United States . ”
Organizers of the project have estimated that more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs would be created in China as a result of the project , while a little over 300 would be created in Texas .
The purpose of the stimulus program , Mr. Schumer wrote in his letter , “ was to jump start the economy to create and save jobs — American jobs . ”
Walt Hornaday , the president of Austin - based Cielio Wind Power , the largest independently owned wind power developer in the United States and a partner in the Texas wind deal , said in a statement that the project would be unable to move forward without stimulus funding , and that it was vital to “ engineers , contractors and suppliers who will see millions of dollars of work at a time when energy based jobs are difficult to find . ”
“ International partnerships are essential to the development of low cost renewable energy in America , ” Mr. Hornaday added .
China ’s reputation for blocking foreign access to its own burgeoning clean - energy sector has been fueling anger over the planned project in Texas .
China has vexed multinational corporations and American officials by imposing not just a 70 percent “ local content ” requirement for wind projects on its own turf , but by steering virtually all wind contracts issued by the national government to Chinese - owned companies , even when foreign companies meet the 70 percent requirement by opening factories in China .
It set even higher local - content requirements earlier this year for solar - power projects .
World Trade Organization rules allow governments to set high local - content thresholds for what are deemed demonstration projects , and China has labeled its solar projects in particular as such ; with as few as 10 megawatts , they are tiny compared with the 600 - megawatt and 1,200 - megawatt coal - fired plants being built across the country .
The Chinese government has further shielded itself from challenge by never signing the trade organization ’s agreement extending free - trade rules to government procurement .
But this means that the United States government also does not have to follow W.T.O. rules in deciding whether to include Chinese companies in its own government spending programs , according to Alan Wolff , the chairman of international trade practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf , a Washington law firm .
“ If this is government procurement , we do n’t owe the Chinese anything ” under the W.T.O. rules , said Mr. Wolff .
China did ease its local content requirements for wind turbines in a bilateral commitment to the United States government last week , when Chinese and American trade officials met in Hangzhou , China , as part of the U.S. - China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade .
And China ’s top economic planning agency , the National Development and Reform Commission , has moved to remove local - content regulations in the renewable energy sector and has concluded several deals to import equipment .
But Western renewable energy companies have remained skeptical that they will see much change given the way Chinese officials have mentioned in speeches for months the importance of raising the market share of Chinese - owned companies .
And Western executives complain that the same Chinese officials continue to show preference for domestic companies when awarding contracts .
In response to complaints sent to us by readers , Cappy McGarr , a managing partner with the U.S. Renewable Energy Group , a private - equity company and a partner in the Texas wind deal , suggested in an e-mail message that the extended benefits to Texans — and to the wider American economy — were being overlooked .
“ Many of the parts for the turbines will be made by General Electric , an American company , ” Mr. McGarr said .
“ The people of Texas will directly benefit through major increases in tax revenue to support schools , fire departments and local governments .
This wind farm will also generate millions of dollars in royalties for Texas landowners over the next 25 to 30 years . ”
Last week , 200 leaders in the environmental movement gathered in New Orleans for the eighth ecological symposium organized by the Orthodox Christian Church .

It truly blows my mind how generous people are with their weed .
I have friends that wo n’t let their girlfriends borrow their cars but are only too happy to share their pot with the world .
Seriously , think about the last time you were with a group of people eating a pizza .
You get down to that last slice and everyone gets all tense about who gets to eat it .
You start counting off how many slices each person had or how much each person paid .
That shit never happens with weed .
People will easily give up the last hit of a bong .
And how many times have you been eating pizza and one of your idiot friends comes up and asks for a slice ?
It ’s kinda annoying , right ?
Even when he or she offers to give you a few bucks for it you ’re still a little pissed off .
Again , with weed it ’s not a problem .
Sure , take a hit !
What ?
No , you do n’t have to pay me anything for it … free marijuana for everyone !
I have been to countless parties where someone I ’ve just met will say , “ Hey , a few of us are going to burn one outside .
Wanna come ? ”
But I have never – and I mean NEVER – had anyone at a party come up to me and go , “ Hey , a bunch of us are going to fuck my girlfriend .
You want in ? ”
What other drug is like that ?
You never see a crackhead offering up a hit to a fellow fiend – unless that fiend is willing to blow him .
And I ’ve seen enough movies to know that heroine users like to chase the dragon solo .
Even with beer – who the fuck is ever willing to give up their last , frothy , cold one ?
Not me .
But ask a pothead if he can tear a bud off for you and he or she is like , “ No problem .
Let me get you a baggie , too . ”
Which begs the question :
Is it the pot that ’s making the potheads so generous or are potheads just generous people by nature ?
Because if it ’s the latter , we could use a few more potheads running the world .
And if it ’s the former , well , then everyone just needs to get high .
A man who kidnapped and raped five children , one of whom was left in the desert to die , has been sentenced to be beheaded and his body publicly crucified .
The 22 - year - old was caught when he offered a child a lift home from school in his car , the Okaz newspaper said .
One of the victims , aged three , survived after being left for dead in the desert .
The court of appeal in Riyadh approved the death sentence handed down in June .
The man 's victims were aged between three and seven .
Muhammed Basheer al - Ramaly , from the city of Hail , in Saudi Arabia , will be beheaded by sword then his body tied to a wooden cross and his head stuck on a pole as a deterrent .
Al - Ramaly was found guilty in February of abducting and raping five boys , the eldest of whom was 7 and the youngest just 3 , who he left out in the desert to die .
His modus operandi was to pick up the boys in his car and take them off to a secret location and rape them .
Most of them were found a day or two after they were abducted , and told police that they had been abused .
Saudi reports said that police used one of the survivors , a seven - year - old boy , to scour the area where he was molested , looking for the suspect 's vehicle .
Al - Ramaly allegedly confessed to the crime and was sentenced to death by a court in Hail , but appealed to a higher court in the Saudi capital , Riyadh .
That court yesterday upheld the sentence and ordered his immediate execution .
While Saudi Arabia carries out numerous beheadings -- 102 last year , according to Amnesty International -- crucifixions are relatively rare .
The last one appears to have been in May , when the headless body of a sex murderer was displayed in the capital .
Amnesty said there were reports that al - Ramaly may have been suffering from a psychological disorder .
One Saudi web forum claimed that police had been surprised when he laughed as he confessed to the rapes and murder .
Saudi Arabia has come under fire from human rights groups in the past for its high number of executions .
About half of the 1,695 executed between 1985 and 2008 were foreign workers unable to pay the blood money that relatives of murder victims can demand in lieu of the death penalty , according to Amnesty .

Mr. Obama ’s jobs event captured the political and policy vise now squeezing the president and his party at the end of his first year .
It came on the eve of a government report that is expected to show unemployment remaining in double digits , and two days after Mr. Obama emphasized as he ordered 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan that he did not want the financial burdens of the war to overwhelm his domestic agenda .
Both the domestic and the military demands on the administration are raising costs unanticipated when Mr. Obama took office , even as pressures build to arrest annual budget deficits now exceeding $ 1 trillion .
Those demands are also eroding the broad support that swept Mr. Obama into office , especially among independent voters , and igniting a guns- versus - butter budget debate in his own party not seen since the Vietnam era .

One effort offers weatherization incentives for homeowners and small businesses based on the “ cash for clunkers ” program .
Credit ... Jim R. Bounds / Bloomberg News
While liberals are calling for ambitious job - creating measures along the lines of the New Deal and Republicans want to scale back government spending programs , Mr. Obama talked at the White House on Thursday of limited programs that he suggested could provide substantial bang for the buck when it comes to job creation .
Among them was the weatherization program .
Called “ cash for caulkers , ” it would enlist contractors and home - improvement companies like Home Depot  whose chief executive was on the panel  to advertise the benefits , much as car dealers did for the clunkers trade - ins this year .
Yet that relatively modest proposal underscores the limits of the government ’s ability to affect a jobless recovery with the highest unemployment rate in 26 years  and Mr. Obama acknowledged as much .
Just as he said in Tuesday ’s Afghanistan speech that the nation could not afford an open - ended commitment there , especially when the economy is so weak and deficits so high , Mr. Obama emphasized at the jobs forum that the government had already done a lot with his $ 787 billion economic stimulus package and the $ 700 billion financial bailout that he inherited .
“ I want to be clear :
While I believe the government has a critical role in creating the conditions for economic growth , ultimately true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector , ” he told his audience , which included executives and some critics from American Airlines , Boeing , Nucor , Google , Walt Disney and FedEx .

Languages evolve .
Some people want to put closures in Java .
( Set aside the fact that only 10 % of the people I 've seen talk about closures in Java know the difference between first - class functions and closures . )
C++ will eventually get a new specification .
COBOL has OO extensions .
Despite the fact that Microsoft can't seem to support C99 in Visual Studio ( hey , give them a break -- they 're still working on supporting PNG and CSS 1.x , two standards even older than C99 ) , C# gets new features .
You do n't have to use the new versions .
You do n't have to use the new features of the new versions .
You do n't have to like the new features of the new versions , and you do n't even have to know they exist .
You have to delve deeply into delusional solipsism to deny that they exist ... and that 's merely language features .
Consider all of the changes in libraries available for those languages .
In The Replaceable Batteries of Your Standard Library , I argued that change is even more constant when you consider the available libraries for a language .
This is true of standard libraries blessed by the implementors ( try using gets ( ) in a modern C project and see the reactions you get ) as well as libraries made popular by common use ( remember Class : : DBI ? ) .
Change happens .
Language designers and developers and maintainers and patchers and porters and releasers ought to consider how to deal with the inevitability of change .
Should a new Perl project use CGI today ?
Plack seems like a better option .
Should a new Perl project start with Perl 5's basic OO or use Moose ?
Is there any excuse to recommend the use of File : : Find , when the basic API requires the use of features that 90 % of Java programmers ( in my unscientific and unrepresentative experience ) do not understand ?
The best argument for using CGI and bare - bones Perl OO and File : : Find is that they 're available on whichever version of Perl 5 you 're likely to have installed ( even if that 's Perl 5.005 , which has been obsolete for the whole of the 21st century and even if they have bugs which have been fixed in the past several years ) .
The second best argument for using them is that there 's plenty of example code which demonstrates how to use them ( though if you write Perl 5 code based on examples you can find online ... ouch ) .
The third best reason is that , once something is in a language 's core library , only an act of the language designer can remove it .
In theory , you 'll get a lengthy period of deprecation warnings ( if you pay attention to that sort of thing , but convince me that the people not using Moose and sticking with Perl 5.6.1 know how to get deprecation warnings from Perl 5 ) .
In practice , you 're in trouble anyway , unless your language has a specification or a comprehensive test suite and you read it to figure out if specific behavior on which your code relies will always be present in the future .
In other words , change happens .
How can a language designer or release manager or maintainer or porter walk the thin line between providing a bare - bones language with few libraries and cramming everything into a core bursting with subtly - different alternatives and growing less relevant to real - world adept uses because of too - early blessings of approaches which time has proven inopportune for the common uses ?
I 've argued before that the right approach is a small core which contains only those libraries absolutely necessary to bootstrap an intelligent library loading system .
This works for operating systems such as Gentoo GNU / Linux , Debian in its flavors , and many of the BSDs .
Parrot is exploring a similar approach .
The Perl 5 core could do very well to include only a couple of libraries necessary to build and install Perl and to download ( or otherwise build from a download or checkout ) a bare - bones CPAN client .
Perl 6 may do something very much like this .
That leaves one question unaddressed .
What happens to those unfortunate novices who download the core distribution themselves and find out that they can't do much with it ?
What happens to people with cruel , cruel sysadmins who refuse to install anything other than the core ?
The solution comes from realizing that the people who are best at maintaining and porting and releasing a new version of a language and its core are not necessarily the same people who are best at discovering what the language 's community considers most useful , most usable , or most appropriate .
You can already see the solution in something like Strawberry Perl , which unabashedly includes a compiler and is on its way to including an IDE and a GUI toolkit -- not because you can't use Perl 5 effectively without any of those , but because Perl 5 is much more powerful and much more useful with them .
That line of reasoning is very similar to the one which includes any given library in the standard library .
Why not embrace it ?
Let distributions come up with their own lifecycles and deprecation and suppport policies .
Let them identify which libraries people should have available by default for the next eighteen to twenty - four months .
Let them perform the work of integration and testing and bug reporting and working with upstream authors .
Upstream would always remain the same .
If you can access CPAN , you can ignore distributions or install your own additional packages or build your own distribution .
( Strawberry makes its own tools available . )
A similar process works well for operating systems -- and , arguably , operating system users are less savvy than programmers .
Many distributions already package Perl 5 this way .
Could you live with such a change ?
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela on Monday shut down four private banks a day after socialist President Hugo Chavez warned he would not hesitate to nationalize any financial institutions failing to help national development .

Anxious staff and depositors gathered outside bank offices , whose doors stayed shut after Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez called an early - morning news conference to announce their closure due to internal irregularities .
“ How can I pay for my shopping , my boy ’s school ?
How will I survive ?
Who will answer for my money ? ” said employee and depositor Fabiola Martin , among 200 people thronging the Caracas headquarters of one of the banks , Banco Canarias .
The four banks account for just 6 percent of the South American nation ’s deposits , and were taken over by the government on November 20 for violations of solvency regulations and unexplained capital increases .
Their owner , wealthy businessman Ricardo Fernandez who has close ties to the government including supplying state shops with food , is under arrest .
A court has barred 16 of the banks ’
executives from leaving the country .
“ The negative performance of the banks makes their closed - door intervention necessary , ” Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez said , reading a statement .
Two of the institutions -- Banco Provivienda and Banco Canarias -- would be “ liquidated ” , though more than 90 percent of their 725,000 depositors would be protected by the government ’s bank insurance agency Fogade , he said .
The financial problems at the other two -- Banco Confederado and bolivar Banco -- were less severe , and those institutions could be rescued , Rodriguez added .
Analysts said that could likely spell a formal government takeover .

During his decade in power , Chavez has taken over large swathes of the OPEC member nation ’s economy -- including oil projects , telecommunications and power firms , and farmland -- as part of his policies of “ 21st century socialism ” .
But Monday ’s closures appeared to be directly related to the problems of those four banks , and its owner ’s deteriorating relationship with the Chavez government , rather than the start of a major new wave of takeovers , analysts said .
MORE ‘CLEANING ’ COMING ?
The only major private bank to have fallen into state hands under Chavez was Spain ’s Banco Santander unit Banco de Venezuela , sold in July for $ 1.05 billion .
Ten large banks , of a total of near 50 , account for 70 percent of deposits .
Boris Segura , senior Latin American analyst for RBS , said that given problems in some other banks , there could be more “ cleaning up ” of institutions like the four closed on Monday .
“ What we might be seeing is a nationalization of the system little - by - little , ” he said .
“ That could be his ( Chavez ’s ) long - term strategy for the banks .
Let ’s not forget though that Venezuela ’s is a small bank sector .
Most people with money keep it offshore . ”
A senior government source told Reuters that officials were monitoring the bank system closely , but that the big institutions were in “ good shape . ”
In a lengthy speech on Sunday , Chavez said banks that refused to lend to the poor or failed to sufficiently aid Venezuela ’s development could be taken over .
“ I ’m telling the private bankers , ‘he who slips up loses , I ’ll take over the bank , whatever its size . ’ , ” he said .
In his statement , minister Rodriguez gave no specifics of future action , but made clear authorities would be vigilant .
“ The national government will continue acting with the firmness required by this situation , safeguarding all Venezuelans ’ interests , ” he said .
Despite the government ’s reassurances , some people wept and others chanted “ We ’re not leaving ! ” outside Banco Canarias ’ headquarters during Monday morning .
Venezuelans are especially nervous about banking collapses since a crisis in the mid-1990s that wiped out half the nation ’s banks .
Missouri State Representative Cynthia Davis has introduced the  Firearms Freedom Act ( HB1230 )  prefiled for the 2010 legislative session .
The bill  Asserts the right of the State of Missouri to regulate the intrastate use and acquisition of certain firearms pursuant to the reserved powers of the state over intrastate commerce and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms . 
While the bills title focuses solely federal gun regulations , it has far more to do with the 10th Amendments mandate that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states , respectively , or to the people . 
It states :
Amendment X of the Constitution of the United States guarantees to the states and their people all powers not granted to the federal government elsewhere in the Constitution and reserves to the state and people of Missouri certain powers as they were understood at the time that Missouri was admitted to statehood .
The guarantee of those powers is a matter of contract between the state and people of Missouri and the United States as of the time that the compact with the United States was agreed upon and adopted by Missouri and the United States

Some supporters of the legislation say that a successful application of such a state - law would set a strong precedent and open the door for states to take their own positions on a wide range of activities that they see as not being authorized to the Federal Government by the Constitution .

Firearms Freedom
Acts have already passed in both Montana and Tennessee , and have been introduced in a number of other states around the country .
( Click here to see the full list . )
Theres been no lack of controversy surrounding these laws , either .
The Tenth Amendment Center recently reported on the ATFs position that such laws dont matter :
The Federal Government , by way of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms expressed its own view of the Tenth Amendment this week when it issued an open letter to all Tennessee Federal Firearms Licensees  in which it denounced the opinion of Beavers and the Tennessee legislature .
ATF assistant director Carson W. Carroll wrote that  Federal law supersedes the Act , and thus the ATF considers it meaningless .
Constitutional historian Kevin R.C. Gutzman sees this as something far removed from the founders vision of constitutional government :
 Their view is that the states exist for the administrative convenience of the Federal Government , and so of course any conflict between state and federal policy must be resolved in favor of the latter . 
 This is another way of saying that the Tenth Amendment is not binding on the Federal Government .
Of course , that amounts to saying that federal officials have decided to ignore the Constitution when it doesnt suit them . 

The Best of Michael Boldin
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Writer George Monbiot ’s recent Peak Oil article entitled “ If Nothing Else , Save Farming ” included this comment :
There are no obvious barriers to the mass production of electric tractors and combine harvesters : the weight of the batteries and an electric vehicle ’s low - end torque are both advantages for tractors .
I read this and immediately tweeted the question “ Where are the electric tractors ? ”
Well , scientist - turned - farmer John Hewson has responded to Monbiot ’s assertion with an explanation that lacks Monbiot ’s , shall we say , sanguinary spirit :
[ T]o anyone who has worked with farm machinery , especially on smaller and poorer farms , the idea of electric tractors will seem ridiculous .
So far , electric traction has been developed only for transport , and most successfully in railway trains .
The development of batteries and control systems has been directed at the needs of passenger cars , which do not have to pull heavy loads at low speeds for long periods .
Electric tractors do exist , but are light machines similar to ride - on lawn mowers , with power outputs of around 40kW .
Typical farm tractors have outputs of 100 kW - 200 kW , and no currently available batteries could provide anything like this amount of energy , or anything approaching the working life of a diesel engine .
The best lithium - ion electric car batteries and motors work at high voltages ( 500V for example ) .
As an engineer , I would blench at the idea of maintaining a 100KW , 500V system in a damp and muddy farmyard , let alone carrying out running repairs in the middle of a 50 - hectare field , in the rain .
As far as I know , electric traction for farm machines has not yet been even considered as an option .
If it ever reaches the stage of production , it will be very expensive indeed – far beyond the budgets of even large farms .
But here ’s the good news .
Hewson appears to be , to a large extent , wrong !
It did n’t take much digging for me to find an article singing the praises of electric tractors as perfectly suited for small - scale agriculture at least .
It comes from a 2003 issue [ PDF ] of the Northeast Organic Farm Association ’s Natural Farmer newsletter , republished here .
Yes , it ’s true , says the author , electric tractors are designed for mowing and light work .
But people have also been converting diesel tractors to electric for real farm use with great results :
Ron Khosla , a small - scale organic farmer in New York state has converted an Allis Chalmers G to electric and told me “ Our electric ‘ G ’ is absolutely the most important tractor on the farm .
It has three times the power of the original ‘ G ’ which is huge and [ has ] enough battery life to do everything we need to on our diversified 8 - acre farm …
It ’s totally silent .
You can creep along MUCH more slowly than we could with gas .
It ’s silent .
It does n’t smell .
It ’s NO MAINTENANCE …
“ It also has changed the way we operate the tractor .
This is a psychological thing , but it ’s real .
With the gas tractor , we were less likely to stop in the middle of the row to adjust things , or clean a shoe , or whatever .
With the [ electric ] tractor … somehow there is psychologically less inertia …
And we stop ALL THE TIME to make final adjustments which has resulted in a better job .
When you stop , you are stopped .
No engine running .
It ’s just quiet and silent , no cloud of white smoke drifting over your head … nothing …
Perfect silence .
THIS is what sustainable farming is supposed to be about ! ”
His initial conversion was fairly simple , using a common series wound DC motor , golf cart controller , and regular lead - acid batteries .
After learning the hard way how to care for the batteries , he has added meters , deep - cycle golf - cart batteries , and a better charger .
He is planning to do a second conversion as part of SARE grant , which will include documenting the process via a web site .
Photo : cwalker71 via FlickrMaybe Hewson ’s concern about muddy mid-field electric tractor maintenance is a bit misplaced .
An important element in all this ( and overlooked by Hewson ) is this fact that weight and low torque are advantages for tractors .
In practice that appears to mean that heavy , low - voltage “ old- fashioned ” lead acid batteries will do just fine .
No need for high - end , high voltage and pricey lithium ion batteries after all .
Anyway , it does indeed appear that a small farm can manage with an electric tractor .
That said , even the Natural Farmer piece suggests that electric drivetrains are n’t [ yet ] suitable for industrial scale tractors or combine harvesters .
And here we get to modern farming ’s elephant in the field .
Most of the “ innovations ” in industrial agriculture , from diesel tractors to pesticides to GMOs , have been about getting people ( and animals ) off the farm .
But even the International Energy Agency , the group charged with estimating the world ’s oil reserves ( and the one recently accused of inflating these estimates on orders from nations like the U.S. ) admits the possibility of oil production plateauing perhaps as early as 2020 .
In an environment of flat oil production , biodiesel will likely be prohibitively expensive as well — liquid fuel of any kind will be hard to come by .
But the harvest will still need to come in — in a depopulated rural America , how will we manage that ?
It may turn out that the only replacement for the workhorses of industrial ag like the large tractor and the combine harvester will be … workhorses — the four - legged kind .
Would n’t that be something .
Granted , a return to real horsepower is unlikely to come to pass .
But what may happen is that as those enormous thousand acre corporate farms become unmanageable , they get broken down into smaller holdings that more modestly - sized electric tractors can handle .
Would n’t that be something .
Whatever we do , it will take creativity and commitment to come up with a replacement for diesel fuel on the farm — in Monbiot ’s bit of anecdata , a farmer who ’s been trying since the 70s has only managed a fuel - use reduction of 25 percent — and the stakes could n’t be higher .
Though perhaps we do n’t have to reach quite as far back into time as the horse ( or the human hand , for that matter ) to save farming .
According to the Natural Farmer article , farms in Latin America experimented in the late 19th century with stringing catenary , i.e. overhead wires , above fields to power tractors .
Given that buses , not to mention high - speed trains , still run that way , maybe large tractors and combines could manage it .
Old - time streetcar technology saving production agriculture ?
Well , that would be something , too .
At the height of the Cold War , the Central Intelligence Agency paid $ 3,000 to renowned magician John Mulholland to write a manual on misdirection , concealment , and stagecraft .
All known copies of the document – and a related paper , on conveying hidden signals – were believed to be destroyed in 1973 .
But recently , the manuals resurfaced , and have now been published as " The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception . "
Topics include working a clandestine partner , slipping a pill into the drink of the unsuspecting , and " surreptitious removal of objects by women . "
This was n't the first time a magician worked for a western government .
Harry Houdinisnooped on the German and the Russian militiaries for Scotland Yard .
English illusionist Jasper Maskelyne is reported to created dummy submarines and fake tanks to distract Rommel ’s army during World War II .
Some reports even credit him with employing flashing lights to " hide " the Suez Canal .
But Mulholland 's contributions were far different , because they were part of a larger CIA effort , called MK - ULTRA , to control people 's minds .
Which lead to the Agency 's infatuation with LSD , as David Hambling recounted here a few weeks ago :
* In the infamous Operation Midnight Climax , unwitting clients at CIA brothels in New York and San Francisco were slipped LSD and then monitored through one - way mirrors to see how they reacted .
They even killed an elephant with LSD .
Colleagues were also considered fair game for secret testing , to the point where a memo was issued instructing that the punch bowls at office Christmas parties were not to be spiked . *
The Boston Globe has put together a great visual summary of some of Mulholland 's best tricks for the CIA : the shoelace pattern that means " follow me " ; the hidden compartment to smuggle in an agent ; the best ways to appear dumb and non-threatening .
Because there 's no better misdirection than appearing to be a fool .

LuaJIT Sponsorship Program
LuaJIT is open source software and depends on your contributions !
This may be in the form of bug reports , bug fixes and patches — see the status page for details .
Another option is to financially support the project through corporate sponsorship .
Please note :
The main LuaJIT author ( Mike Pall ) is working on unrelated projects and cannot accept new sponsorships at this time .
But other community members may be open to sponsorship offers — please ask on the LuaJIT mailing list for any takers .
List of Previous Sponsorships
Wave Computing has sponsored the MIPS64 r6 ISA variant of the existing MIPS port .
The work is carried out by Wave Computing and RT - RK .
It has been merged into the v2.1 branch of the git repository .
Cisco Systems , Inc. has sponsored the development of a soft - float variant of the existing PPC port .
The work is carried out by RT - RK and has been merged into the v2.1 branch of the git repository .
Cisco Systems , Inc. and Linaro have sponsored the development of the JIT compiler backend for the ARM64 port .
The work is carried out by RT - RK , Linaro and ARM and has been merged into the v2.1 branch of the git repository .
Cisco Systems , Inc. has sponsored the development of a MIPS64 port ( hard - float + soft - float ) .
The work is carried out by RT - RK and has been merged into the v2.1 branch of the git repository .
The existing MIPS port of LuaJIT requires a hardware FPU , but many embedded devices based on MIPS CPUs do n't have ( nor need ) one .
Since only single - number mode is supported , even FPU emulation in the kernel would be unacceptably slow .
Cisco Systems , Inc. has sponsored the development of the missing dual - number + soft - float functionality for the existing MIPS32 port .
The work is carried out by RT - RK and has been merged into the v2.1 branch of the git repository .
With these changes , the MIPS port of LuaJIT can now be used on many more MIPS devices , from tiny routers up to high - performance FPU - less MIPS SoCs .
GIANTS Software GmbH has sponsored the development of a low - overhead profiling functionality for LuaJIT 2.1 in June 2013 .
GIANTS Software develops a variety of simulation games for desktop , mobile and consoles .
These games make extensive use of Lua for scripting and modding .
Switching to LuaJIT was instrumental in reducing the CPU load and sustaining the required frame rates on all platforms .
CloudFlare Inc. is sponsoring various performance improvements for LuaJIT 2.1 , starting in April 2013 .
CloudFlare is operating one of the world 's largest deployments of nginx + LuaJIT .
At this scale , every fraction of a microsecond that can be shaved off for processing a request has a significant impact .
Compared to LuaJIT 2.0 , more built-ins and bytecodes are now compiled and optimized .
Many operations on strings are now improved , too .
A corporate sponsor , who wishes to remain anonymous , has sponsored the development of 64 bit bitwise operations for LuaJIT 2.1 in March 2013 .
A corporate sponsor , who wishes to remain anonymous , has sponsored the development of allocation sinking and store sinking optimizations for LuaJIT in March 2012 .
Avoiding temporary allocations is an important optimization for high - level languages .
The goal of this sponsorship is to research an innovative combination of analysis and optimization techniques .
Taken together these are more effective than the classic techniques and better suited for dynamic languages .
Details can be found here .
Neomantra Corp has sponsored the FFI callback feature for LuaJIT x86/x64 in November 2011 .
As part of its commitment to open source development , MIPS Technologies , Inc. has sponsored a MIPS port of LuaJIT 2.0 in October 2011 .
The port requires a CPU conforming to the MIPS32 R1 architecture ( O32 ABI , hard - fp , little - endian or big-endian ) .
The port has been tuned for the MIPS32 34 K and 74 K cores .
Gehtsoft USA , LLC has sponsored the bytecode loading / saving feature for LuaJIT in June 2011 .
The LuaJIT bytecode format is portable and ~ 40 % smaller than Lua bytecode .
The LuaJIT bytecode loader is 10 x faster than the Lua bytecode loader .
And LuaJIT bytecode loads 30 x - 40 x faster than source code .
Note that this is unrelated to the execution speed of the code itself — it does n't matter how the code was loaded .
QUALCOMM Inc. has sponsored an ARM port of LuaJIT 2.0 in January 2011 .
The initial target for the ARM port have been low - to - middle - end ARM - based devices .
The port requires a CPU conforming to the ARM v5 architecture ( ARM9E cores or better ) with software floating - point ( no FPU needed ) and the classic ARM instruction set .
Another corporate sponsor , who wishes to remain anonymous , has sponsored the VFP support ( hardware FPU ) and the hard - float EABI support for the ARM port .
The ARM port of LuaJIT 2.0 can be built either for soft - float targets , for VFP targets using the soft - float EABI ( armel ) or for VFP targets using the hard - float EABI ( armhf ) .
A corporate sponsor , who wishes to remain anonymous , has sponsored the port of LuaJIT to PowerPC CPUs in July 2011 .
The port has been tuned for the FreeScale e300 cores , but runs fine on all PPC CPUs with a standard hardware FPU .
Another corporate sponsor , who wishes to remain anonymous , has previously sponsored the port of the LuaJIT 2.0 interpreter to PowerPC / e500v2 ( different FPU than standard PPC ) in August 2010 .
The goal of this sponsorship campaign was to raise € 20,000 for the x64 port of LuaJIT 2.0 .
To jump - start sponsorship of LuaJIT , Athena Capital Research has provided an initial contribution of € 5,000 in December 2009 .
As part of their commitment to the open source community , Athena Capital Research has offered to provide up to € 7,000 of matching funds .
All funds offered through corporate sponsorship have been matched one - to - one .
Other funds have been matched two - to - one .
The x64 sponsorship goal has been reached in January 2010 and a total of € 20,167 was raised !
Many thanks to all sponsors for supporting LuaJIT !

WETA /20th Century Fox
A northeaster may have dampened its box - office spirits this weekend , but “ Avatar ” is shaping up as the biggest movie of the year ( in more ways than one ) and , somewhat surprisingly , one of the best reviewed .
The architect of this futuristic epic , James Cameron , took a few moments late last week to discuss the technological leaps that allowed him to make this film , the look of the Na’vi and dealing with bad buzz .
Q .
In the New York Times article that John Anderson wrote on “ Avatar , you joked about doing a sequel based on the positive feelings you had about an early December screening .
If you did make a sequel , where would you want to take this story ?
A .
I ’m not going to give out any story scoops now .
I have a story mapped out that actually spans two films .
Not in the sense that you ’d do a film that ends in the middle , like the typical second - act trilogy problem , but I have enough story arc to cover two more films .
And if we do make some money and I talk to Fox and they want to move ahead with a sequel , then I ’ll sit down and write something .
And you and I can talk again !
Q .
When you wrote the film in 1995 and decided that technology was n’t at a place where you could make it , what specifically did you feel like you could n’t do at that time ?
A .
The big issue was the scale of it .
And by scale , I mean , we were n’t just trying to crack the code of an individual character .
We had to have a system that was going to be able to do hundreds of characters .
And there was nothing like that on the landscape .
In fact , there was no good example at the time that I wrote “ Avatar ” and even a few years later .
I had n’t seen enough movement forward even in the creation of a single human performance - based CG character to give me faith it could be done .
WETA /20th Century Fox
Then along came “ The Lord of the Rings , ” the second picture , and Gollum was alive .
There was no question about it .
And to me , that was the moment .
That was the moment when I said , if they can do that , “ Avatar ” is possible .
Q .
There ’s a unity to the way the N’avi look .
For one they ’re all very physically fit .
How did you come to this physical look ?
A .
When you see an indigenous group , they tend to not have the big variety that we have .
We ’re a cultural melting pot , so we have people that have developed all over the world .
Whereas indigenous populations tend to not travel much so they tend to be more physically alike .
So we applied those rules .
The N’avi have a very attenuated and graceful physique which is slightly pushed beyond human , wider across the shoulders , hyper - developed lats because they ’re supposed to be partially arboreal .
Things are really thought out in this movie to an almost ridiculous level .
Q .
When you were assembling all of these bits and pieces over the past decade , were there times when you thought this just was n’t going to work ?
A .
There was always that possibility .
I would say the early days developing the main characters was the scariest part , because everything hinged on the main characters working .
WETA / 20th Century Fox
We had character designs and WETA had been working for months and months .
And the first stuff they showed us was just heartbreaking to me .
But ( the visual effects supervisor ) Joe Letteri kept telling me this is a normal part of the process .
It takes time to rig the facial musculature of these characters and get them to work .
So what you see is the character , slowly , slowly coming into alignment with the way the actor ’s face works .
And there ’s a kind of amazing moment when , suddenly , the character is real .
Q .
There was the criticism and bad buzz around the blogoshpere when the teaser trailer came out for this movie .
What was your response to that ?
A .
A lot of it is about context .
You look at the image out of context and it seems strange .
It ’s this blue guy .
You do n’t know what it means .
What I always said when discussing the marketing with Fox was , “ I ’m not worried about the movie , I ’m worried about the 30 second TV spot . ”
This is why we did “ Avatar ” Day ( where 40 minutes of footage was screened last summer ) in the first place because I anticipated that problem .
Fox kind of blew it .
They were n’t supposed to release the teaser until after the screenings .
But they released the teaser before the screenings , which was dopey and exactly opposite of the plan .
In a way , it worked out well because it generated this cycle of controversy .
I also said to Fox we gotta get awareness , then we ’ll talk about how good the movie is .
Let everybody in the world know this movie exists and think it sucks is a better condition than having a few people think the movie ’s great before it comes out .
So actually , if we had been smart enough , we would have orchestrated it to be exactly the way it was .
( Laughs . )
Q .
Have you gotten any criticism that the film might be perceived as anti-American ?
A .
It ’s something that I ’ve anticipated the possibility of because people will misinterpret things in certain ways .
You can almost count on people misinterpreting things .
The film is definitely not anti-American .
It ’s not anti-human either .
My perception of the film is that the N’avi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better , that wants to respect nature .
And the humans in the movie represent the more venal versions of ourselves , the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences .
Extreme heat in the U.S. Southwest carried August 2020 into the record books as the country ’s third - warmest August in the 126 - year record .
Despite heavy rain from landfalling tropical cyclones , national average precipitation was in the driest third of the record .

Creating Sovereign Law – Practice and Procedure
Article and sample documents courtesy of Matt
Affidavit process
It troubles me to see so many messing around with PCNs , debt collectors , statutes etc .
The affidavit process below is to hopefully give you an option to free you from all that .
Q. Would you like a lawfully binding way to stop messing around with arguing FIXED PENALTY CHARGES , debt collectors , council tax , utility companies , TV licensing etc ?
A way that creates the lawfully binding and irrefutable void between you and the legal ‘ person ’ and can demonstrate to all parties that you as a man / woman are not lawfully liable for any public entity or public debt / liability ; as well as any other FACTS that you may want to use for a particular purpose ?
I am guessing the answer is yes .
Then Affidavits , I believe , are your way forward .
A ‘ private ’ affidavit , if the whole process is done correctly , creates a ‘ lawfully ’ binding agreement / contract between the parties that rises far , far above any ‘ legal ’ contract / agreement ; in fact as paperwork goes , an affidavit from the ‘ private ’ side is superior to all other documents , full stop !
You could go as far as to term the private un-rebutted affidavit as ‘ Sovereign Law ’ because an affidavit from the private side and sworn under unlimited commercial liability indicates that a sentient living private man / woman is behind it , and therefore a Sovereign .
( Warning – Please make sure that whatever you put on an affidavit is your truth ) .
I have attached an affidavit for you to peruse and use if you wish .
I have actually used this affidavit in a slightly longer format , yet I have removed a few points that I used as they may have been confusing to some , yet as you will see the points on the attached affidavit create an agreement ( law of the parties ) that would cover , I believe , every eventuality between the private ( real ) and public ( fiction ) .
If you cannot stand - under any of the points on the attached affidavit then remove them or research them until you are convinced without a shadow - of - doubt that they are now your truth .
Do NOT use affidavits lightly .
Research what you are doing if you are unsure .
Affidavits are simple and incredibly powerful law documents .
There is nothing to be fearful of whilst using them , but please comprehend what you are doing before firing them off !
Q. How does this affidavit create an agreement of the parties ?
A. Because of Tacit Procuration and Stare Decisis ( see below for more on stare decisis ) .
Tacit Procuration basically means ‘ silent agreement ’ ( agreement through acquiescence ) and this is the reason why ignoring documents is considered a lethal act in Admiralty Law .
If the Respondent does not respond then he / she is simply saying , “ Yes I agree / affirm by my acquiescence . ”
Tacit procuration enables what is commonly known as ‘ self authenticating contracts . ’
Q. Why use a Notary Public ?
A . The reason Notary Public verification on important documents is so powerful is because simply , in effect , by the time you have a Notice of Default signed and sealed by a Notary you have ‘ lawful ’ summary judgement which cannot be overturned , as long as your paperwork and process is correct .
( By the way , if at a later date you discover your paperwork is lacking in some way , then simply create another one with all the corrections on .
Remember , every party has to have the ability to exhaust their administrative remedies , and creating an affidavit is part of that process ) .
Quite simply you now have ‘ STARE DECISIS ’ – Lat ; “ to stand by that which is decided . ”
The principal that the precedent decisions are to be followed by the courts ; and you also have ‘ RES JUDICATA ’ – Lat ; decided or determined by judicial power ; a thing judicially decided ; a judgement that is considered final and bars re-litigation on the same matter .
A Notary is the judicial power !
Also important is the fact that a Notary can act as a conduit between the private and public in regards to ‘ foreign ’ jurisdiction ; a solicitor cannot do this .
Private is classed as foreign to the public .
One of the great deceptions of official agencies is the use of the Stare Decisis doctrine .
Stare Decisis originates from Common Law courts and it is in Common Law that the principles of precedent decisions exist .
Precedent decisions do not have to be used in Admiralty courts : http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Admiralty
So an official agency sends another party a document .
The document gets ignored ( lethal in Admiralty ) , and so the agency sends out a follow up of some kind .
If the document gets ignored again then the Common Law doctrine of ‘ Stare Decisis ’ gives the official agency summary judgement ; the case is now already decided and cannot be argued .
Q. What is a Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure and why do I need to use one ?
A. A Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure is correct procedure and therefore gives the Affiant uncompromised standing .
There may be a very genuine reason why the Respondent could n’t respond ; maybe a death in the family , maybe they were hospitalized etc .
So you are saying , “ just in case there is a genuine reason why you could n’t respond I am kindly granting you a further three ( 3 ) days to respond .
You are being nice , and so you should be , as you want to stay honourable at ALL times .
Q . Do I have to put all the points on my affidavit ?
A . No of course not .
Make sure it is your truth and besides you can always create more affidavits at anytime .
Affidavits create ‘ your ’ law ; law between the parties .
So if you are not happy with their law , create your own .
Yours are far more powerful in every single way if done correctly .
Your affidavit can have one single point or hundreds ; it is your document so you can make it whatever you want and for whatever suits your purpose .
Q. Why is a private affidavit so powerful ?
A. Basically because as a private man / woman you can operate under unlimited commercial liability and public entities cannot .
You see all public entities have what is called a ‘ scope of office ’ – which is basically a job description and conditions for which they have limited liability insurance cover .
For instance , if a Police Officer believes that you are becoming threatening or aggressive he can make the decision to use appropriate force to restrict and arrest you .
Now if in the tussle you fell and broke your arm , the Police Officer does not have to worry about prosecution because using appropriate force in this situation is in his ‘ scope of office ’ and therefore falls under his limited liability insurance policy .
But , if the Police Officer was to punch you in the face whilst you were sat in your car , he can now be prosecuted for a criminal offence .
If the prosecution stands then his insurance would not cover him in anyway .
Therefore he could do jail time , be fined and lose his job as his actions did not fall under his insured ‘ scope of office . ’
EVERY public official , agent and employee has a ‘ scope of office ’ – that ’s worth remembering !
In commerce , the game is won by the party who took the biggest risk , and as you sign under unlimited ( full ) commercial liability , the public entity cannot match that as they are under limited liability ; unless they are willing to forego this and risk losing their own possessions and career ; as far as I know no public entity has ever wanted to take that risk , understandably as they know they are involved in fiction .
This is why it is also worthy of reiterating that you should only put your truth on an affidavit , because if it turns out that you have deliberately lied then you risk your commercial credibility for life ; and anyway it is against EVERY law to use fraud / lies in your contracts , as so it should be , so DON ’T do it !
( I have listed some Maxims of law near the bottom of the page concerning affidavits so you can ascertain yourself why affidavits are seen as so powerful ) .
Q. Can the Respondent just return it ?
A. Yes , but then they have n’t responded to the points raised so they are instantly at fault , so you can continue with the Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure due to non response .
Damned if they do and damned if they do n’t springs to mind .
Q. Can the Respondent just respond with something like , “ I disagree with point 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 17 , and 21 . ”
A . Yes they can , but once again they would be at fault .
A Maxim of Law states , “ An affidavit must be rebutted point - for - point . ”
And any rebuttal must have evidence provided to the Affiant to demonstrate why the Affiant ’s point is n’t true , and the Respondent needs to provide his / her rebuttal in sworn affidavit form .
Now as long as you have your believed truth on the affidavit , they are NOT going to rebut your facts with their fiction , guaranteed !
The process is as follows :
1. Print out your affidavit on very high quality paper .
I would recommend something like ‘ Southworth ’ Cotton paper , but if finances wo n’t allow then try and find the best quality you can afford because this affidavit will become a valuable document to you .
2. Visit a Notary Public to attend an ‘ Affidavit Oath Swearing ’ and make sure you take a valid passport and a current utility bill or bank statement as the Notary will require these for ID purposes .
You will be in the Notaries office for no longer than about 30 minutes .
( I also recommend that you buy a small ink pad so you can put your thumbprint seal next to your autograph for added validity and security , yet if you are uncomfortable with this then simply leave this part out ) .
If you do not want to use a Notary then use two ( 2 ) private witnesses on the affidavit , Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure , but do get the Notice of Default Notarised .
This is still very effective , saves money and you are still getting summary judgement ; although with certain documents I would suggest getting the whole process Notarised if possible for the added weight and your own psychological confidence .
3 . Photocopy the entire affidavit and then use the supplied ‘ Certified Copy ’ template to run the photocopied affidavit back through your printer whilst adding / printing the ‘ Certified Copy ’ details .
( The Holder in due course of a document can lawfully make true , correct and complete copies of the originals ; and the holder in due course in this instance is the Claimant / Affiant ) .
NEVER SEND THE ORIGINALS – THEY ARE YOUR VALUABLE EVIDENCE THAT A LAWFUL AGREEMENT EXISTS !
Sign and date the certified copies .
4 . Post the copies using Special Delivery , and I would suggest within 48 hours of the Notaries verification .
KEEP THE POSTAL RECEPTS SAFE WITH THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS .
Then make another appointment with the Notary for another ‘ Oath Swearing ’ in 14 + days time .
5. Prepare a Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure , again using high quality paper , and continue the same process as above giving the Respondent the set amount of time to respond .
Then make another appointment with the Notary for another ‘ Oath Swearing ’ in 7 + days time .
6. Prepare a Notice of Default and once again continue with the above process .
Once you have a ‘ default ’ judgement from the Notary you now have a bona fide lawfully binding agreement / contract .
Now if you so wish , every time that you need to inform a ‘ public ’ entity that you have a lawful agreement with Gordon Brown , d/b / a Prime Minister ( or whoever ) then simply make another ‘ Certified Copy ’ and send it to them ; the affidavit copy and the default copy .
If they still dare to proceed ( extremely unlikely ) , maybe subpoena the CEO of the UK , in this instance Gordon Brown … it would be a laugh and raise a few eyebrows hey !
In truth once you have a valid and lawful agreement you should n’t even be going to court , that ’s their little playhouse of fairytales , so let them keep it and take care of your business administratively on the private side .
I remember studying what is sometimes ( erroneously in my opinion ) called ‘ Commercial Redemption ’ under Winston Shrout and I would hear Winston say the following statement on many occasions , “ If you do n’t like their law , then create your own . ”
For months I did n’t grasp quite what he meant and Winston is a great teacher ( spiritually as well as commercially ) , and so I believe he was waiting for folk to ‘ have the ears to hear ’ this particular loaded message , yet I received the light - bulb moment early whilst watching and studying Winston ’s ‘ Commercial Lien ’ DVD ( which I highly recommend ) .
My often research buddy and friend , Guy , had the very same light bulb moment a few weeks later whilst watching the exact same DVD without any interaction between us regarding this matter , and so we knew we were on to something when we shared our individual experiences .
Then Guy met with Winston at a private seminar and informed him of what we were currently doing and showed him our private material ; Winston was suitably impressed and informed Guy that our method was absolutely rock solid and the correct and lawful procedure .
To be truly honest we already sensed this but of course it is always a pleasure to receive confirmation from someone who has inspired your learning .
Since then we have had this information confirmed time and time again , yet as stated before , we did n’t really need this confirmation as our confidence in this process felt very solid ; and once you realise who you really are I am sure you will comprehend , or already do comprehend , what I am talking about .
Remember it is the agreement of the parties that is important .
Their law is contract law , and theirs is built on fraud and deception , so create the contracts that you want , not what they want , and yours will be built on fact and truth .
If they do not rebut or reply to your paperwork ( they wo n’t ) then you have a ‘ lawfully binding ’ agreement that no other party can lawfully or legally impair .
By the way , if the respondent violates the contract then you have instant lien right , but that is for another day .
My personal opinion is this ; affidavits and maritime liens ( which are affidavits of obligation from the private side ) wipe the floor of everything in their laughable and weak fictional system .
Maxims of law .
( Affidavit based )
An un-rebutted affidavit stands as truth in commerce .
An un-rebutted affidavit is acted upon as the judgement in commerce .
An affidavit must be rebutted point - for - point .
( Research on Maxims with large sample listing )
If you do n’t like the idea of creating and sending in such an elaborate affidavit as the one provided , and yet you have situations that would benefit from getting the other party into an agreement , then just a very few points can have an almighty effect .
Example :
Affiant is a private living sentient man .
Affiant is not JOHN SMITH or any other artificial entity / legal fiction .
The Affiant is not liable to or for any Government statutes , rules and / or codes , including , without limitation , UNITED KINGDOM Codes and statutes and / or codes of any of Respondents ’ political subdivisions .
The Affiant is not liable for JOHN SMITH or any artificial derivative thereof at anytime whatsoever .
The Affiant is not liable for any public debts / liabilities at any time whatsoever .
The Affiant is not a member of any society whatsoever and therefore the Affiant is not bound by any society ’s statutes , rules or codes .
Now if the above six ( 6 ) points are your truths ( and they should be ) and you put them on an affidavit to the Respondent , the Respondent has to provide evidence to the contrary of all the 6 points if they want to rebut .
I think you can see for yourself that they wo n’t be able to do that .
I think you will also notice that you do n’t even have to use the above 6 points ; 1 would be enough for most cases , but try and think of any situation you are involved with that could n’t be solved by having a lawfully binding agreement / contract such as the above .
Folks ;
Stop messing around in fear , controversy , statutes , and other self limiting ways ; many of the limiting ways I witness on this and many other forums .
Create the law you want with the corporate entities .
Once you realise who you are and why your true identity and power has been kept at bay , you will realise why a private sovereign affidavit is so powerful .
Keep your original affidavits very safe and keep ‘ certified copies ’ on you at all times .
An enforcement agent will only proceed so far after they have checked the validity of your paperwork ; because you will have made sure of the following :
You know who and what you are .
You know what you are not .
You are working through your anger , resentment and blame issues .
You have stopped being a victim in life .
You are realising that only you have the power to make you feel .
You are working towards treating ALL others with understanding , patience , forgiveness , empathy and tolerance .
You offer your self in service to others at some points throughout your day / week .
Your law / agreement documents are correct .
Soon we can all be sending our law to ‘ thingy me - jig ’ d/b/a President of Europe .
Oh what larks .
If you have any questions whatsoever please contact me and I will endeavour to provide you with an answer / opinion .
Warmest regards ,
Matt .

Robert Gibbs mocks
Gallup ’s daily tracking poll earlier this week .
Second poll shows Obama at 47 %
If White House officials were peeved at Gallup Poll for its reporting on President Barack Obama ’s recent slide to 47 percent approval — and they were — imagine the reaction at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to the survey released Wednesday by Public Policy Polling , which also reported the president ’s approval rating at 47 percent , but added this analysis :
“ Perhaps the greatest measure of Obama ’s declining support is that just 50 percent of voters now say they prefer having him as president to George W. Bush , with 44 percent saying they ’d rather have his predecessor .
Given the horrendous approval ratings
Bush showed during his final term , that ’s somewhat of a surprise and an indication that voters are increasingly placing the blame on Obama for the country ’s difficulties instead of giving him space because of the tough situation he inherited .
The closeness in the Obama / Bush numbers also has implications for the 2010 elections .
Using the Bush card may not be particularly effective for Democrats anymore , which is good news generally for Republicans and especially ones like [ former Ohio Republican Rep . ]
Rob Portman who are running for office and have close ties to the former president . ”

On Tuesday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs mocked Gallup ’s daily tracking poll , saying , “ I do n’t put a lot of stake in — never have — in the EKG that is the daily Gallup trend . ”
Gallup Poll Editor - in - Chief Frank Newport responded in a Web posting that “ Gibbs said that if Gallup were his EKG , he would visit his doctor .
Well , I think the doctor might ask him what ’s going on in his life that would cause his EKG to be fluctuating so much .
There is , in fact , a lot going on at the moment — the health care bill , the jobs summit , the Copenhagen climate conference and Afghanistan . ”
On Wednesday , a new Quinnipiac poll found Obama with the lowest approval rating of his presidency : 46 percent .
A new CBS News poll ( . PDF ) shows Americans , by a 2/3 majority , do not want Sarah Palin to run for president in 2010 .
In fact , 38 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Sarah Palin , while only 23 percent of those surveyed think highly of the former VP candidate .
At the same time , 37 percent say they do not know enough to form an opinion .
That ’s hard to believe , if you know that Palin was ignorant enough to believe Africa was a country and not a continent .
It ’s also hard to believe , since there ’s been much publicity around Sarah Palin of late , with her new memoir , “ Going Rogue , ” releasing today .
Among the GOP , only 52 percent give her high approval .
That ’s somewhat surprising , but the number among Democrats is not : only four percent of Dems give her high marks .
Overall , two out of three people surveyed said they do not want her to run for the presidency during the 2012 election .
In fact , a majority of the GOP , by a 48 – 44 percent majority , do not want a Palin candidacy in 2012 .
Unsurprisingly , the survey revealed that Palin ’s greatest support appears to come from white evangelical Christians .
Those would support a Palin 2012 presidential bid , but only by a slim majority , 48 – 42 percent .

Man Involuntarily Becomes Father in Crowded Bus
46 - year old Konstantin Morgachev noticed a strange young woman who sat next to him in a crowded bus .
She was not sober and held a baby wrapped in a men ’s shirt .
Konstantin was worried that the baby would die from cold .
Man Involuntarily Becomes Father in Crowded Bus
When the woman exited the bus , Morgachev decided to follow her .
He offered her to take her to the nearest maternity house by a cab .
She agreed .
It turned out that her name was Nastya , she was 25 years old and “ suddenly ” had a baby 24 hours ago .
In the maternity house , Konstantin decided to stay with the woman and took the baby to a doctor ’s exam .
The baby turned out to be prematurely born and was less than four pounds .
She had to be urgently hospitalized .
While the doctors were examining the baby , the woman disappeared .
Konstantin had to take the baby to a hospital himself .
Victoria Ostrometskaya , chief of children ’s city hospital of Dnepropetrovsk city said she was surprised to see that the baby was brought in by a strange man .
The doctor said that although the baby girl was in a relatively normal condition , she could have died if she had spent more time riding buses .
Now the baby is treated in the ER and is fed through an IV system .
There is no news from the mother .
Police are not going to look for her as they are convinced that there is no crime in what she had done .
Konstantin , however , comes to visit the baby girl on a regular basis .
The man bought her all necessities and takes care of her as much as he can .
According to statistics , within the last five to six years in Moscow alone the number of social orphans ( i.e. , orphans with living parents ) has increased from 23 to 48 percent .
Most often , it is mothers at the age of 15 to 19 years who abandon their children .
It is obvious that abandoned children are a global issue .
There are different ways to fight it .
In Latvia , for example , a special baby - box was opened where mothers can leave their children anonymously .
The box is a specially equipped space in the intensive care department of the University Children ’s Clinical Hospital .
An abandoned baby gets into a special crib .
After that , the doors are automatically blocked and the baby is isolated from the hazards of the exterior world .
Two minutes later , nurses receive a signal and take the baby for an exam .
Later , they contact the officials to place a baby into an orphanage .
The baby - box has a phone number on it where a woman can call and receive physiological or practical support 24 / 7 .
This might make her change her mind and not abandon the baby .
Of course , it does not solve the issue of social orphans .
But in any case , it is better if a baby is left in a hospital than thrown away to a garbage can , as it often happens .

Fandom is awash with speculation about who will be returning for the finale of Russell T Davies ' stint at the helm of Doctor Who .
But who would we like to see resurrected from the show 's original 26 - year run ?
Here 's our somewhat dubious list of ten supporting characters we'd love , via the miracle of time travel or divine resurrection , to make a return appearance .
Fear not though , despite the recent Jedward mania we wo n't stick the siblings from ' The Twin Dilemma ' down on the list !
Sabalom Glitz
This intergalactic rogue , whose wardrobe seemed to come from the Duran Duran ' Wild Boys ' video set , provided plenty of comedy moments alongside the Sixth and Seventh Doctors .
He was last seen heading off in a spaceship with Bonnie Langford .
Assuming the poor guy has n't ejected himself into outer space to escape her , a return for the character would be most welcome .
He 'd show Captain Jack what moral ambiguity is all about .
Alpha Centauri
Television is far less innocent now than it was in the 1970s .
When this curiously designed ' hermaphroditic hexapod ' made its debut appearance in ' The Curse Of Peladon ' , there was n't much of an outcry about it resembling a huge , veiny nad on its legs .
Add in six arms , a cape , a bulging eye and a high - pitched laugh , and you have a very bizarre creation indeed .
We 'd love to know how this alien delegate would fare on our TV screens in the 21st century !
The Meddling Monk
Rumours have surfaced that this playful character , originally portrayed by Carry On legend Peter Butterworth , is slated for a return in the near future .
We hope so - his antics alongside the First Doctor were a treat to watch , as he tinkered with history for his own amusement and not any grand pretensions of world domination .
It 's a habit that the time - travelling monk found impossible to kick .
Sil
Despite his repulsive laugh , slithery features and tendency to exploit the impoverished , Sil was a loveable addition to the programme .
Anyone who tries to turn
The Doctor 's companion into a bird creature - purely for his own entertainment - deserves some credit !
Whether the immoral creature was dealing arms or working for a mining company , he was eyeing up the profits and guzzling his beloved marsh minnows .
It 's time to bring him back - as an exec for a British bank !
Sergeant Benton
A semi-regular on the show between 1968 and 1975 , Benton was a dependable figure for UNIT and ably assisted three consecutive Doctors to fend off a variety of alien threats .
Armed with good humour and a flashy smile , he was a bit of a ladies ' man too .
Brigadier Lethbridge - Stewart said in 1983 that Benton was now a used car salesman , so perhaps he 's still out there waiting to flog The Doctor a pimped - up version of his beloved Bessie ?
Richard Mace
With his theatrical pretensions , this pusillanimous highwayman assisted The Doctor during his battle with the Terileptils in ' The Visitation ' .
" I have appeared before some of the most hostile audiences in the world , " he proclaimed , although this was nothing compared to the threat he soon encountered .
Played by the flamboyant ( and sadly late ) Michael Robbins , he was last seen trying to fend off the flames of The Great Fire Of London .
Lytton
Played with a cold swagger by the late and great Maurice Colbourne , intergalactic mercenary Lytton would have shot his own grandmother just to keep his trigger finger supple , according to the Sixth Doctor .
Working both with and against the Daleks and Cybermen in two ' 80s adventures , he ultimately faced a grizzly demise .
After a shocking revelation was unearthed , causing The Doctor to eat humble pie , he was partially cyber - converted and died a heroic death .
Legend .
Bellal
Despite his ghoulish looks , Bellal was a benevolent Exxilon who helped the Third Doctor in his battle with his mortal enemies in ' Death To The Daleks ' .
It was refreshing to see a race of aliens having some individuality and not just being an evil entity en masse .
Unlike many of his Exxilon counterparts , he rejected their religious teachings and was more intent on helping Sarah Jane Smith fend off death rather than use her as a sacrificial lamb .
He also had quite a cute and vulnerable voice that tugged at the heartstrings !
King Yrcanos
Anyone who witnessed Brian Blessed 's appearances as a host on Have I Got News For
You a couple of years ago will know that the great man has still got it .
Sadly , he never bellowed " The Doctor 's aliiiiive " as King Yrcanos in 1986's ' Mindwarp ' , but made up for it with an array of judo chops , hissing , shouting and some fairly metrosexual make - up .
It 's time for Yrcanos to make a return and test out the speakers on all these modern flatscreen televisions !
Pex
The world 's most cowardly cutlet made Bonnie Langford 's squeamish companion Mel look harder than Arnold Schwarzenegger when he surfaced in ' Paradise Towers ' .
But he had a memorable moment of redemption , hurling the evil Kroagnon - and himself - into an explosive trap at the end of the story .
The Kangs , who almost mocked him to death , graffitied " Pex Lives " on the wall to commemorate his new heroic status .
Would n't it be great if he did ?
No ?
OK , time to get our coat …

It is n't fair that people who do not know about Jesus go to hell .
" God gives everyone a chance to believe in Jesus .
If they do n't see the opportunity , then they are blind and would have rejected Jesus anyway . "
It 's worthless to say God is " good " in a moral sense when you mean that whatever God does is , by definition , good .
" No it 's not . "
How can God be omnipotent and all good if he allows suffering ?
" God gave humanity the gift of free will .
If he did n't allow bad things to happen , then we would n't be free . "

A Pants Aflame production
Heavy data users may soon find themselves paying more for service if they 're AT&T customers .
AT&T CEO Ralph de la Vega reiterated the company 's idea to charge heavy network users more for their activities at the UBS conference on Wednesday , noting that a mere three percent of smartphone users suck up some 40 percent of the company 's traffic .
For those of us who are constantly tortured subjected to AT&T 's slow service , this may seem like a great idea , but de la Vega 's threat falls into the same trap that other ISPs have used in order to merely profit more from heavy users .
That tiny percentage of customers , which de la Vega pointed out were mostly iPhone users , are using a disproportionate amount of the company 's bandwidth thanks to their heavy use of video , audio , and images .
The company claims that perhaps these users are n't aware of what kind of effect they 're having on the network and could use some " education " on the matter .
" The first thing we need to do is educate customers about what represents a megabyte of data , " de la Vega said , noting that AT&T was planning to offer realtime data usage to customers sometime in the future .
" Longer term , there 's got to be some sort of pricing scheme that addresses the users . "
This is n't the first time de la Vega has talked about cracking down on heavy users .
At the CTIA Wireless IT & Entertainment 2009 conference in October , he hinted at the same thing , repeatedly suggesting that net neutrality regulation would let a few heavy data users " crowd out the many " on its 3G data networks .
At that time , he did n't specifically address pricing , but it was certainly no secret that the company was trying to find some way to help balance the load .
The problem with this approach is that some believe it 's just a money grab instead of an attempt to really unclog the network .
Yankee Group analyst Benoit Felten recently asserted that the concept of the " bandwidth hog " does n't really exist and that ISPs really have no idea if heavy users are causing any sort of congestion .
Instead , they just measure total data per user and wave around the heavy users on a flag as an excuse to muddle with pricing .
Whether or not that 's true of AT&T is hard to say ( Felten was specifically talking about wireline services in his comments , not wireless ) .
Either way , though , AT&T is a victim of its own success thanks to the iPhone .
The company willfully signed a multiyear agreement to be the sole provider of the popular device , which is credited with attracting a large number of new subscribers to AT&T .
With it came an explosion in data usage thanks not only to easy access to the " real " Internet , but plenty of fun apps that give iPhone users access to rich media .
Is this a case of AT&T not realizing what it got itself into ?
And if so , should heavy users have to pay an extra price for short - sightedness ?
Do you think it 's fair for the heaviest users to pay more for service ? ( poll )
A chemical commonly found in plastics that has recently fallen under intense scrutiny by public health officials has now been linked to impotence .
During a five year study , scientists followed 634 male Chinese factory workers who were exposed to high levels of the chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) on the job and compared their sexual health with that of similar Chinese factory workers not exposed to BPA .
The men handling BPA were four times as likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction and seven times as likely to have difficulty with ejaculation [ Washington Post ] .
( PDF ) ,
The study
published in the journal Human Reproduction ,
marks the first time sexual dysfunction has been linked to BPA exposure .
To be fair , the workers were exposed to BPA levels that are 50 times greater than the average U.S. man faces , so scientists can't say how smaller amounts of the chemical will affect sexual health .
However ,
the chemical resembles the hormone estrogen and that 's fueled worries that even very small amounts of BPA can cause harm [ NPR News ]
.
The feds are determined to get to the bottom of the issue and have pledged $ 30 million to researchers over the next two years in an effort to finally settle the question of whether BPA is safe .
That would be a welcome development , since BPA is ubiquitous in consumer products —
everything from plastic bottles to canned food linings is laced with the stuff .
BPA is so widespread that
93 percent of the U.S. population has BPA in their urine , according to previous research .
The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that BPA is safe , despite its own scientific advisory board 's criticism that the agency ignored over 100 research publications linking BPA to ill health effects .
A growing body of research over the past decade has linked BPA to a range of health effects in laboratory animals , including infertility , weight gain , behavioral changes , early - onset puberty , cancer and diabetes
[ Washington Post ]
. BPA defenders have argued that the previous research conducted on animals is of limited use in determining the chemical 's toxicity , and have insisted that human data is necessary .
The FDA is currently taking a fresh look at the issue , and is expected to complete its review by the end of the month .

About
Edward ' the bonobo ' is a Catalan macroeconomist and economic demographer of British extraction , now based in Barcelona .
By inclination he is a macro economist , but his obsession with trying to understand the economic impact of demographic changes has often taken him far from home , off and away from the more tranquil and placid pastures of the dismal science , into the bracken and thicket of demography , anthropology , biology , sociology and systems theory .
All of which has lead him to ask himself whether Thomas Wolfe was not in fact right when he asserted that the fact of the matter is " you can never go home again " .
He is currently working on a book with the provisional working title " Population , the Ultimate Non-renewable Resource " .
Apart from his participation in A Fistful of Euros , Edward also writes regularly for the demography blog Demography Matters .
He also contributes to the Indian Economy blog .
Yeah , I know .
It ’s pretty strong , and I can feel the ire of those reading even as I type this .
( Please note , this is n’t our official review , you can find that here , as written by Gary ) .
Believe me though , it was never supposed to be like this .
I ’ve known about Avatar for a long time .
I ’ve been aware of the great time and effort ( and money ) that have been spent on this project .
And those of you that read my article Could Avatar be a Cutting - Edge White Elephant know that I was desperate to get tickets to see it at the Imax .
I wanted to love it , I really did .
And whilst I have a reputation for being cynical about movies , I want to like them all .
If I did n’t , why would I spend so much of my time writing about them ?
It ’s important to point out that when the film ended , 90 % of the audience around me applauded .
So i’m well aware , it ’s my problem and not theirs .
This meant that though i’d decided to post my thoughts on the movie before i’d seen it , once I had , I felt that I should probably keep my opinion quiet , in order to avoid the vitriol that would inevitably be pointed in my direction .
I thought again , however , and decided it might be cathartic to explore why a movie that had united the industry in praise had left me so very cold .
The first issue , which I was already expecting , was the storyline .
What I was n’t expecting , though , was just how simplistic and predictable it would turn out to be .
I had only watched the first proper trailer , and had in my mind the general direction the story would take .
The direction , it turned out , was exactly as expected , with no deviation whatsoever .
The story of the human race trying to move on an indigenous population in order to make use of localised natural resources is nothing new , and has been explored more fully in an episode of Stargate SG1 , amongst numerous other places .
Along with that , it takes a particular talent to turn the serious issue of mass genocide into a poorly executed love story .
Which brings me to my next issue with Avatar .
Give or take a couple of plot devices , it feels very much like a ‘ greatest hits of Star Wars ’ homage , glued together with Starship Troopers .
Much of the environment of Pandora brings to mind the locale of Naboo , replete with the ‘ there ’s always a bigger fish ’ philosophy .
The robots shooting aliens theme echoes the finale of Phantom Menace , with a bit of the moon of Endor also fit in .
The mostly CGI environment , along with the PG13 family friendly action throughout most of the film firmly gave it that undeniable Lucas feel .
The fish out of water story of Sully learning the ways of the natives also had a very Disney - esque feel .
And maybe for me that ’s a large part of the problem .
I can no longer stomach family - friendly movies .
The attempt to appeal to such a diverse demographic tends to give family movies an ‘ everybody gets what no - one wants ’ atmosphere .
Whilst as a kid I lapped that up , nowadays , with much less time available to watch a two and a half hour movie , i just crave something more .
Adult issues explored in a thorough and thought provoking way .
In a climate of adults paying to see Harry Potter and The Twilight Saga , i find myself in the minority .
It ’s not necessarily that the story of an intergalactic war fought on alien turf can’t address real issues .
If instead Cameron had chosen to adapt Joe Haldeman ’s The Forever War , for example , we could have had a classic on our hands .
Instead the filmmaker opts for black and white .
The evil human race attempts to wipe out the unknown enemy it does n’t understand .
With right on their side , the beleaguered , peaceful beings must triumph in the end .
With a great cast committed to bringing the script to life , there could have been a saving grace .
Unfortunately , this is Avatar ’s lowest point .
There honestly is n’t a good performance on display .
Weaver , et al are all terribly wooden , not at all helped by poor dialogue and contrived exposition devices .
Also not helped by a chronic lack of depth to the characters .
Neytiri never says one word that speaks to her personality , and all we ever find out about Sully is that his twin brother died , and he used to be a marine .
Tell me something , anything else we know about him ?
What ’s the point of creating a fully 3D environment and then filling it with woefully two dimensional characters ?
The gruff Colonel Quaritch ( HeyUGuys interview with Stephen Lang here ) , obsessed with the annihilation of a species , would have been the most shallow character in any other movie , but here at least he has the courage of his convictions .
What about the abrupt mid-mission turn by Michelle Rodriguez ’ Trudy ?
Where did that come from ?
Even Sully himself turns on a dime .
We all knew it was coming except him .
In his Avatar he was having the time of his life , yet in the lab showed no conflict over the mission he was carrying out , the double life he was leading , until he made the sudden u-turn in just one short scene .
This flaw may not have been purely a fault of the script .
After praise for his turn in Terminator : Salvation Worthington has been hailed as the latest in a long line of ‘ next big things ’ .
On this evidence , that ’s an extremely premature assertion .
He managed to display no on - screen presence whatsoever .
Until , in fact , being transplanted into his Avatar .
When a computer generated version of you shows more charisma and likeability than the real deal , you have a bit of a problem .
Which nicely leads me onto the positive , the reason we are all here .
Avatar is visually stunning .
There can be no argument .
The vista of Pandora is a sight to behold , the aliens beautifully realised .
And yes , much of the 3D is awe - inspiring , particularly in the beginning .
It ’s not the stuff that pops out of the screen that ’s the most impressive , but the more subtle yet astonishing sense of depth that is created .
This is displayed at it ’s best in the opening scenes of stasis pods being opened , and their inhabitants floating not just across the screen , but towards and away from it .
The water and fire effects are also phenomenal .
And i’ll also concede that the finale is action packed and surprisingly brutal at times .
For me , though , however great the visuals were , it did n’t stop me becoming bored throughout the overlong middle part of the movie .
Avatar is being nominated for awards , and is a likely contender for the expanded best picture category at the Oscars .
It clearly deserves it , as the myriad of great review scores attests .
But it baffles me .
If great CGI and a weak and plodding storyline is enough for an academy award , presumably we can also expect Transformers 2 and GI - JOE to appear on the list of ten ?
The test for Avatar comes when it finds release on DVD and Blu - Ray , when the limits of those technologies hamper the 3D experience .
Will Avatar then be shown to be the emperors new clothes ?
I do n’t believe so .
I believe i’ll be shown to be the one that ’s wrong .
And I believe James Cameron ’s opus will be the movie that makes Blu - Ray in the home no longer the exception , but the rule .
A fitting legacy for the product of over a decade of commitment , and the hundreds of millions of dollars spent bringing it to fruition .

Simulators are a great , safe way to teach people how to do things properly before they actually have to do them .
The first simulators were for airplanes and they cost a lot of money when they appeared 80 years ago .
Although simulating an aircraft cockpit and behavior was a difficult and costly business , it had a very effective ROI in terms of planes and pilots .
Nowadays , you can simulate almost any environment thanks to the computer - there are low cost safety simulators available for planes , boats , cars , motorcycles , and even the inside of a person ’s mouth - but until now , not bicycles .
Honda is rectifying that with a bicycle simulator that has been developed for the purpose of traffic safety education .
The Honda Bicycle Simulator allows riders to experience the possible risks they may face on the roads to improve their ability to predict dangers and increase their safety awareness .
The system is equipped with monitors in front and behind the rider to allow them to check in front , right , left and behind , while a “ walking sensor ” can even recognize the user ’s action of walking the bicycle .
Designed to offer realistic scenarios for riders of different ages , the simulator features different courses such as “ going to school ” , “ going to a local shopping street ” and everyone ’s favorite , “ going to cram school . ”
After the simulation , the rider ’s path can be reviewed from multiple vantage points for evaluation of the performance .
Honda says that approximately 70 percent of bicycle accidents are caused by violation of traffic rules and it hopes its bicycle simulator will be adopted by law - enforcement organizations , driving schools , public offices and schools which conduct bicycle safety education programs primarily for school children and senior citizens .
Honda is targeting these age groups because , although the total numbers of fatalities from traffic accidents has declined in Japan in recent years , the ratio of fatalities involving bicycles has increased , with riders aged between 10 and 19 and over 50 having the highest chance of being involved in an accident .
Honda has been selling automobile simulators since 2001 , motorcycle simulators since 1996 and will begin accepting pre-orders for its bicycle simulator in November .
It measures 2.27 m ( 7.4 - feet ) long , 1.4 m ( 4.6 - feet ) high , 0.99 m ( 3.2 - feet ) wide , and weighs 88kg ( 194lbs ) .
And although it probably wo n’t be as much fun as the CyberBike , its an important development which could help save lives .

Married soldiers in combat zones are expected to put love lives on hold A US Army general in northern Iraq has defended his decision to add pregnancy to the list of reasons a soldier under his command could face court martial .
It is current army policy to send pregnant soldiers home , but Maj Gen Anthony Cucolo told the BBC he was losing people with critical skills .
That was why the added deterrent of a possible court martial was needed , he said .
The new policy applies both to female and male soldiers , even if married .
The male sexual partners of female soldiers who get pregnant would also " face the consequences " , he said .
It is the first time the US Army has made pregnancy a punishable offence .
I 'm going to take every measure I can to keep them all strong , fit and with me
Gen Anthony Cucolo Gen Cucolo told the BBC it was a " black and white " issue for him .
He said married soldiers in combat zones should either put their love lives on hold - or take precautions .
" I 've got a mission to do , I 'm given a finite number of soldiers with which to do it and I need every one of them . "
" So I 'm going to take every measure I can to keep them all strong , fit and with me for the twelve months we are in the combat zone , " he said .

Not everyone welcomes the proposals as political tensions between the two nations never fully dispelled following Japan 's occupation of Korea between 1910 and 1945 .
Fears have been voiced among South Koreans about the creation of a direct connection .
In the complaint , prosecutors said Mr. Headley received training from Lashkar - e - Taiba , which is dedicated to ending Indian rule of Kashmir , on several occasions from February 2002 to December 2003 .
After he was instructed by the group to conduct surveillance in Mumbai , the complaint says , he made five trips there from 2006 to 2008 .
Each time , he took photos and videos of various targets , including the Taj Mahal Hotel , the Oberoi Hotel , the Leopold Café , the Nariman House and a Mumbai train station .
In April 2008 , Mr. Headley also scouted locations in and around the Mumbai harbor , looking for a safe landing for a boat that would carry the Lashkar operatives , officials say .
After the visits , he traveled to Pakistan to hand over his photos and other material to his contacts .
Seven months later , at least 10 men landed at the port in two inflatable boats and attacked the city with grenades and assault rifles .
Among the many killed were six Americans .
Hundreds more were injured .
Federal officials said the case against Mr. Headley underscored the potential threat posed by American citizens who could use their ability to travel easily across borders in support of such plots .
The assistant attorney general for national security , David Kris , said , “ This case serves as a reminder that the terrorist threat is global in nature and requires constant vigilance at home and abroad . ”
William Headley , the suspect ’s uncle , reacted with shock to the accusations on Monday .
“ You might as well be telling me my nephew is being charged with 9/11 , ” William Headley said in an interview .
“ That ’s like pouring cold water inside me .
He ’s been in trouble before , but we thought something like this was beyond his character . ”
David Headley , the son of a former Pakistani diplomat and an American socialite from Philadelphia , was born in Washington and raised in elite circles in Pakistan , where he attended a strict military high school .
His parents divorced when he was young .

An analysis and tournament review
Article Discussion Report error Sunday , December 6 , 2009 Originally reported on Legendary Pokémon by Arty2
This editorial has been written by Legendary Pokémon by Arty2 .
It expresses the views of the writer , not necessarily those of Bulbagarden networks .
Link to this article
This retrospection aims to draw some conclusions from the first Greek Pokémon Championship , which ran via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection from April 21st to July 16th 2009 .
It was organized by Nintendo of Greece , with the support and cooperation of the site Legendary Pokémon .
The tournament had 62 participants , of which ten failed to show up in either the first or the second round .
Estimated age range was 10 to 24 years old - the author is familiar with most of the participants through the Nintendo of Greece forums .
Only two girls were among the total .
The tournament format was single elimination , which resulted in six rounds of battles .
The sample
Our sample consists of 58 teams , made up of six Pokémon each , 41 of them complete with movesets , of which seven had no items attached , apparently consciously ; a few only had a couple of items .
There were at least nine shiny Pokémon participating in the tournaments , as participants voluntarily declared .
The above sample is not sizable enough to draw any conclusions about a possible distinct metagame in Greece .
It is , however , indicative as to what proportion of the participants can be described as knowledgeable about competitive battling or casual .
The statistic data gathered also allows people to spot some trends among usage of Pokémon , attacks and items .
Tournament Rules
Before moving further , a quick review of the tournament rules as designated by the Legendary Pokémon crew :
The following Pokémon were banned : Arceus , Darkrai , Deoxys ( all Formes ) , Dialga , Giratina , Groudon , Ho - Oh , Kyogre , Lugia , Manaphy , Mew , Mewtwo , Palkia , Rayquaza , Wobbuffet , Celebi and Shaymin .
All participating Pokémon had to be legitimate and not hacked .
Latias and Latios were allowed only without holding the item Soul Dew , yet a team could not include both of them .
Garchomp could only be used without a held item and not in the same team with either Tyranitar or Hippowdon .
All moves were allowed .
The only exceptions were Explosion or Destiny Bond at the end of battle .
The player using such moves at the end of battle resulting in a draw , would be eliminated .
No single item can be held by more than one Pokémon ( Item Clause ) .
Battles were run at Level 100 forced single .
All participants had to declare six different Pokémon ( Species Clause ) .
In addition they were not allowed to change their team in - between the battles , with the exception of rematch battles due to technical difficulties .
Players had to agree on a date for their match during a flexible time period and publicly disclose their arrangement on the Nintendo . gr forums .
If either player happened to disconnect during a match ( up to two times ) , then a rematch was in order .
Cases of multiple disconnections were to be examined individually .
After a particular match was over , the participants had to send a report describing the opponent 's team and could also request a hack check if they doubted the legitimacy of their opponent 's Pokémon .
Participants that revealed an opponent 's Pokémon publicly were to be eliminated .
A hack check included inspection of Pokémon 's statistics and related available information via Wi-Fi or photographs .
As expected , the rules caused some stir among the participants .
Some complained about most legendaries ( ubers ) being prohibited .
Mostly casual players , apparently , yet even more had complains about forcing set solid teams .
The latter dispute was quite easy to settle since that 's the norm in all official tournaments .
Perhaps in the next tournament seventh or eighth slot could be opened up to prohibit use of additional Pokémon during rematches .
What proved to be problematic was not having strict time limits on each round 's duration , thus the tournament was slow paced and lasted 3 months .
That will be a thing to remember when organizing similar events in the future .
Multiple disconnections was another issue that caused frustration to the judges .
Due to the nature of a Wi -Fi tournament , a lot of connectivity problems are bound to appear .
What is more , it 's tough to accurately determine whose fault it is .
Through endless email back - and - forths , requests were made to the players to capture a video of their battle to see who was the first to disconnect .
Preferably , the participants in dispute were asked to peacefully decide , if possible , on which had the advantage and should therefore move forward .
A fair and objective solution to this problem is yet to be found .
Wi-Fi tournaments require less to no resources since there 's no need for conference halls or people to set things up and moderate the event .
It is also more convenient for players in remote locations to participate .
There are , however , serious shortcomings : dealing with disconnects is problematic , legality checks are harder , plus it 's also a fact that such tournaments , no matter how flexible they are , should eventually finish in a timely manner , hence why double - battles or all - play - all formats are not suitable .
Last but not least , a mistake that should never repeat was not having a strictly formatted team submission template .
This not only brought a chain of emails that could be avoided , but also made the data procession that precedes this very article slow and tedious .
The trends
Since the sample was relatively small , the author believes that bar charts and percentages are unsuitable for the purpose of this article , thus word frequency clouds are used instead .
In the following cloud , one can clearly see which species were the most popular among the participants .
The results are rather predictable considering the Soul Dew clause and the fact that Tyranitar and an itemless Garchomp could not co-exist .
The usual suspects are also among the top ten , along with mostly Fire - type starters , which are traditionally popular .
If one is willing to participate in the next championship , which is going to be sometime around Christmas , these findings could be put to good use .
Moving over to the attacks , where Earthquake seems to be overly preferred , followed by Thunderbolt , Ice Beam , Psychic , Shadow Ball , Flamethrower , Hyper Beam and Surf .
Obviously predominant species affect which moves are more popular than others .
There is however a distinct lack of Grass - type moves .
In the following graph are the attacks of preference for Metagross and Tyranitar , the top duo .
Movesets vary , yet one can spot the trends clearly .
A particular statistic that sets expert players apart from the casual ones is apparently usage of held items .
A lot of inexperienced players seem to unknowingly underestimate this feature .
Perhaps Pokémon game designers should better underline its potential in the future .
Everybody else seems to understand the value of Leftovers , however , with Life Orb and Focus Sash following far behind .
And this is pretty much all that could be analyzed and visualized from the limited data that was available .
Given the opportunity while running the forthcoming tournament , more detailed information from the participants will be required , including Level 100 stats and natures .
A proper team registration template will be implemented this time around .
It will be interesting to see what 's the impact ( if any ) of this article on team strategies and movesets used during the next championship .

In Québec there is this long tradition of artists who ’s real names might or might not be Bob Walsh and Steve Hill who earn a living performing american blues standards in the provinces innumerable blues festivals with the technical precision and soul of a catholic priest performing mass .
Then , once in a while , someone comes along to remind us that blues can actually be good music and that Québec French , especially street Joual , could be Delta English ’s closest relative .
Offenbach proved it in the 1980’s .
Bernard Adamus does it again this year .
“ Singing in English would have made no sense .
I live in French , I love in French , I read in French ” , says Adamus , who was born in Poland and sings about Coors light , winter in Longueuil and all things brown ( the colour of love … )
Bernard Adamus is in France this week to show the cousins how it ’s done .

There is no doubt that Muzion ’s La Vi Ti Neg is the only song ( partly ) in Haitian Kreyol to be on regular rotation anywhere on the National Hockey Leagues circuit ( and for that you can thank my brother Vince ) .
J. Kyll , the lyricist responsible for that Kreyol verse , just broke a long silence with Spit White , an homage to Québec Joual .
“ Damn it ’s beautiful to hear you speak Joual ” , she raps , “ It sounds so real ” .
Bobbing his head next to J. Kyll is Imposs , who , as far as we can tell by Youtube clips floating around the Internet has been adopted by Wyclef Jean and just might be getting ready to try to become the first Hip Hop artist to make it big in both the American and French scenes .
A Hip Hop Céline Dion ?
Now here ’s one for the people who like to say that Québec French and Joual are not “ real French ” .
Well , I dare any of the amateur linguists who have shared such wisdom on the blogs and internet forums of the world to tell me what Pure Laine Parigot Renaud is singing about in his classic Laisse Béton , shown above .
Yeah , thats what I thought …
France ’s street French is as far from the standards of l’Académie française as the French spoken on the corner of Papineau and Beaubien .
Check out Québec City ’s Keith Kouna Joual version of the song , called Oublie Ça ( get it ?
Of course you do n’t . )
Suddenly Joual sounds a lot more like “ real French ” , does n’t it ?

What does it say about the capitalist system that some of its most profitable companies are happiest when newly evolved and potentially catastrophic viruses emerge to threaten humanity , asks Keith Rosenthal ?
" WITH A pandemic like this , the upside for us is clearly significant . "
So confessed the chief executive of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in an interview in the Boston Globe , regarding the rise of the H1N1 ( or " swine flu " ) global pandemic .
Novartis , one of the main manufacturers and distributors of flu vaccines , is hoping to make a $ 7 billion windfall profit this year , due largely to the demand around an H1N1 vaccine .
The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable industries in the U.S. , and this year , all the companies are licking their lips .
Doubtless , most people reading this story are worried about the rise of the H1N1 flu strain .
Recently , the World Health Organization officially designated the spread of H1N1 a " pandemic , " and media outlets everywhere have given much play to the potentially fatal dangers of the virus .
Already , more than 4,000 people have died worldwide of H1N1 , a cousin of the seasonal flu virus , which itself claims up to half a million lives annually .
With much of the world nearing the height of flu season , the dangers will only grow .
Families waiting between 1 and 2.5 hours for H1N1 vaccinations at a hospital ( Vera Yu and David Li )
Theoretically , this need n't be a fatal situation .
Current medical science has the capacity to produce vaccines for most strains of the flu that , when distributed widely , radically decrease the likelihood of a high death toll from the flu .
However , shortages of the seasonal flu vaccine have meant that clinics across the country have been forced to stop distribution early .
The clinic where I work , Harvard University Health Services , usually runs its flu clinic until January , but we have been forced to stop administering all flu shots at the end of October due to vaccine scarcity .
Nor have we been ensured a necessary supply of the forthcoming H1N1 vaccines now entering the market .
Given that the wealthiest university in the world has been unable to secure vaccines for its privileged students , what chance do the myriad of community hospitals and health centers across the country have to meet the pending need ?
ONE OF the main causes of this wholly unnecessary situation is that vaccine production and distribution in America -- as for much of the world -- is largely monopolized by several huge and highly profitable drug companies .
When the H1N1 pandemic was declared , four of the biggest of these companies -- Sanofi - Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , CSL Limited , and MedImmune - - decided to immediately cease production of the seasonal flu vaccine and switch over to the H1N1 vaccine instead .
Gone was the urgency of ensuring an adequate supply of seasonal flu vaccine to match the coming need .
These companies saw nothing but dollar signs in the new virus threat and dropped everything in order to meet the need -- circling this market like sharks in bloodied waters .
Ironically , the artificial short supply of seasonal flu vaccines , coupled with immense demand by world governments for H1N1 vaccines , has further boosted the profits of these companies .
As you learn in any basic economics class , the tighter the supply and the greater the demand , the higher will be the price of the commodity , thus ensuring even higher profits .
The global vaccine market is expected to double to $ 35 billion by 2014 , but these pharmaceutical companies have much to be happy about right now , in this flu season .
What else but barbaric can you call a setup in which the manufacturers of life - saving vaccines stand to gain by not producing enough to meet the need ?
When the very institutions ostensibly in the business of healing people are at their happiest when newly evolved and potentially catastrophic viruses emerge to threaten huge parts of humanity ?
Only in a system of production and distribution based around the sole guiding principle of profit could such an arrangement be seen as normal .
Accountable to nobody and nothing but their small clique of investors and board members , these companies can't be trusted with our futures .
They -- and the whole for - profit , private health industry in which they are ensconced -- need to be thrown on the dustbin of history and replaced by a system in which human need is made the sole guiding factor when it comes to using our vast human and natural resources .

The air strike killed at least 70 civilians , the rebels say
The Saudi Arabia air force has bombed a market in Yemen killing 70 civilians , rebels in the north of the country say .
The rebels , known as Houthis , have been fighting Saudi and Yemeni forces since August this year and accuse the Saudis of frequent attacks across the border .
Bani Maan , the village hit by the air raid is in the border region between Saudi Arabia and Yemen .
The Yemeni army has reportedly claimed it carried out the attack , not Saudi Arabian forces .
A spokesman for the Yemen 's army , Askar Zuail , told Agence France Presse that the Saudis were not involved .
" Bani Maan is one of the most fortified rebel strongholds .
Today Yemeni aircraft launched a number of air raids , killing many Houthis , " he said .
" Saudi aircraft committed a massacre against the innocent residents of Bani Maan , " a statement on a Houthi website said .
Skirmishes
The Houthis accuse Saudi Arabia of supporting the Yemeni government in its campaign against them .
In November the rebels launched a cross - border raid on a Saudi mountain region , which they held for several days before being pushed back by Saudi troops .
There have been several skirmishes around the border , but the Saudi military denies it has carried out attacks inside Yemen .
The Houthis , named after the family of their leader , say they are trying to reverse the political , economic and religious marginalisation of the Zaydi Shia community in Yemen .
The Zaydi community are a minority in Yemen , but make up the majority in the north of the country .
The insurgents have been fighting the government since 2004 .
The government launched a fresh offensive in August 2009 , which precipitated a new wave of intense fighting .
It accuses the Houthis of wanting to re-establish Zaydi clerical rule , which ended in 1962 .
Aid agencies say tens of thousands of people have been displaced .
How our governments use terrorism to control us
By Tim Howells
Online Journal Contributing Writer
Nov 28 , 2005 , 13:55
The sponsorship of terrorism by western governments , targeting their own populations , has been a taboo subject .
Although major scandals have received cursory coverage in the media , the subject has been allowed to immediately disappear without discussion or investigation .
Therefore the appearance this year of two major studies of this subject is a welcome breakthrough , and provides essential reading for anyone struggling to understand the events of September 11 , 2001 and the post September 11 world .
The studies are complementary .
NATO 's Secret Armies , Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe by Daniele Ganser concerns terrorism sponsored by American and British intelligence in Western Europe and Turkey between the end of World War II and 1985 .
The War on Truth , 9/11 , Disinformation , and the Anatomy of Terrorism by Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed chronicles the cultivation and sponsorship of militant Islamic terrorism by the intelligence services of the United States , Britain and Russia from 1979 to the present .
Both studies are models of scholarship -- meticulously documented and carefully reasoned -- but the world they reveal will boggle the mind of the most wild - eyed conspiracy theorist .
Creating " Communist " Terrorism to Fuel the Cold War
NATO 's Secret Armies describes how following World War II the US and Britain , fearing a Soviet invasion of Europe , established " stay - behind " paramilitary units throughout Western Europe and in Turkey .
Had the anticipated Soviet invasion occurred these units would have constituted ready made resistance groups , trained and armed , with secure communications with each other and with their allies in Britain and the US .
In some counties , for example Norway and Sweden , these stay - behind units were true to their original charters , remaining inactive until they disbanded at the end of the Cold War .
In other countries , however , the paramilitary units were activated by their handlers in the United States as part of a hellish " Strategy of Tension " designed to convince left - leaning populations in Italy , Germany , Belgium , Greece , Turkey and other countries that their very lives were at risk from communist terrorists .
The arms and bombs originally intended for the Soviets were turned instead on their own compatriots with the aim of placing the blame for the waves of terrorist attacks on communists .
In Italy the stay - behind operation was referred to as Gladio ( Latin for " Sword " ) .
The Piazza Fontana bombings that killed 16 and wounded 80 shortly before Christmas in 1969 initiated a wave of terrorist bombings in Italy by Gladio operatives that continued throughout the 1970s .
The worst single bombing occurred in the Bologna train station in 1980 , killing 85 and wounding 200 .
Another Gladio bombing in Brescia in 1974 killed eight and wounded 102 , and the same year a train was bombed in Rome , killing 12 and wounding 48 .
The case that led to the discovery of the Gladio plots by the Italian courts was a 1972 bombing that killed three policemen .
The Gladio operations in Italy are relatively well known and well understood because of several high level judicial investigations that received coverage in the European press and have been the subject of a few books .
One contribution of Ganser 's book is to bring this material together in a concise and well organised format .
Further , Ganser extends his study beyond Italy to examine the effects of stay - behind operations throughout Western Europe and in Turkey .
I was quite surprised to learn that by far the most extensive and destructive stay - behind operations were those carried out in Turkey under the code name Counter - Guerrilla .
Among other crimes , a long series of bombings , random killings and assassinations , covertly perpetrated by CIA - controlled Counter - Guerrilla operatives in the late 1970s , were used as a pretext for the military coup in 1980 that led to the installation of a pro-American and pro-Israeli government there .
I was also shocked to learn that stay - behind operatives were responsible for a series of horrific terrorist attacks in Belgium as late in the Cold War as 1985 , although this is still the subject of unconvincing official denials .
One limitation of Ganser 's study , which he frequently laments , is the unavailability of official documentation because all materials relating to the stay - behind operations remain highly classified .
All Freedom of Information
Act requests to date have been denied by American authorities .
One might have hoped that at least with the end of the Cold War such atrocious strategies would be renounced , and that the implicated governments would make every effort to come clean and ensure that this history would not be repeated .
Unfortunately , as The War on Truth by Nafeez Ahmed makes clear , the Strategy of Tension has proved to be so useful a tool both in terms of global and domestic politics that , far from being abandoned , these despicable operations have become increasingly accepted and commonplace .
Creating " Islamic " Terrorism for the Post - Cold War Era
Ahmed 's study centres on the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , but the story begins in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion in 1979 .
Zbigniew Brzezinski , national security advisor to President Jimmy Carter at the time , has described in an interview how , even prior to the invasion , the US had taken steps to fund the Mujahedeen warlords and to inflame militant Islam in the region .
The aim was to destabilise the region and to force the Soviets to invade -- to draw them into their own Vietnam - style quagmire .
According to Brzezinski , " We did not push the Russians into invading , but we knowingly increased the probability that they would .
That secret operation was an excellent idea .
The effect was to draw the Russians into the Afghan trap . "
After the Soviets ' inglorious retreat from Afghanistan , and even more so after the collapse of the Soviet Union several years later , the policy of inflaming and exploiting militant Islam was credited by many in the US national security establishment for these historic developments .
Ahmed has compiled irrefutable evidence that the United States did not abandon the militant Islamists after the end of the Cold War .
In fact , American leadership at the very highest levels has continued to covertly protect , assist and guide militant Islam in general and al - Qaeda in particular in geopolitically important areas around the world , including Central Asia , North Africa , the Balkans , and the Philippines .
It is impossible to do justice to Ahmed 's densely packed 390 - page presentation here , but I will give some representative examples .
Sergeant Ali Mohamed Joins al - Qaeda
Ali Mohamed , an Egyptian intelligence officer , was fired in 1984 because of his religious extremism .
In spite of this and in spite of the fact that his name was on the State Department 's terrorist watch list , he was granted a visa to enter the US and became a US citizen .
By 1986 he was a sergeant in the US Army and an instructor at the elite Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg .
While in this position Mohamed travelled to Afghanistan to meet with bin Laden , and he assisted with the training of al - Qaeda operatives both in Afghanistan and in the US .
His immediate supervisors at Fort Bragg were duly alarmed by these illegal activities , and reported them up the chain of command .
When their reports failed to produce any action , not even an official debriefing of Mohamed upon his return from Afghanistan , at least one of his supervisors , Lt. Col .
Robert Anderson , concluded that Mohamed had been acting as part of an operation sanctioned by an American intelligence agency , " probably the CIA . "
Mohamed 's activities in support of al - Qaeda throughout the 1990s were of the highest significance to that organisation .
In 1991 , he handled security for bin Laden 's move from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan .
In 1993 , Mohamed accompanied bin Laden 's second in command , Ayman al - Zawahiri , on a fund raising tour of the United States , again handling security arrangements .
The funds raised helped support Zawahiri in a Pentagon supported mission in the Balkans , which will be discussed in the next section .
The al - Qaeda members trained by Mohamed in the United States included several who were later convicted in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
Top secret US
Army training manuals supplied by Mohamed to the defendants were produced as evidence at their trial .
Mohamed himself did the initial surveillance for the al - Qaeda bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
At the time Mohamed was on active reserve with the Special Forces and was a paid FBI informant .
Mohamed was at long last charged with crimes in connection with the 1998 embassy bombings .
In October 2000 , he was convicted of five counts of conspiracy to murder nationals of the United States .
However , the nature of Mohamed 's plea agreement , the sentence handed down , if any , and Mohamed 's present whereabouts remain secret .
The Pentagon Brings al - Qaeda to the Balkans
The US national security establishment did not miss a beat in seeking to replicate the triumph in Afghanistan in other geopolitically critical areas .
The Soviet puppet regime fell in Afghanistan in February 1992 .
That same year , the Pentagon started importing Afghan jihadists organised by bin Laden into Bosnia to wreak chaos and fuel the civil wars between Muslims and Serbs that devastated the former Yugoslavia in the following years .
Bin Laden 's second in command , Ayman al - Zawahiri , served as commander of the Mujahedeen forces in the Balkans .
The role of the Pentagon in airlifting the Mujahedeen terrorists into Bosnia and Kosovo between 1992 to 1995 has been well documented and widely reported in the European and Canadian media , but almost completely ignored in the United States .
However , the geopolitical advantages of breaking the former sovereign nation of Yugoslavia into a patchwork of NATO protectorates , under the firm control of the United States , did not go unnoted .
New Republic editors Jacob Heilbrunn and Michael Lind celebrated the event in a New York Times article titled " The Third American Empire " published on January 2 , 1996 :
" Instead of seeing Bosnia as the eastern frontier of NATO , we should view the Balkans as the western frontier of America 's rapidly expanding sphere of influence in the Middle East . . .
The regions once ruled by the Ottoman Turks show signs of becoming the heart of a third American empire . . .
The main purpose of NATO countries , for the foreseeable future , will be to serve as staging areas for American wars in the Balkans , the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf . "
The CIA Brings al - Qaeda to the Philippines
In 1991 , with the Afghan War winding down , the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group was formed in the Philippines around a core of radical Afghan veterans .
They conducted their first kidnapping operation in 1992 , and were responsible for a series of bombings and kidnappings throughout the 1990s that were highly destabilising for the Philippine government .
Several high level al - Qaeda operatives , including Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed were involved .
Funding was provided by one of bin Laden 's brothers in law , Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , an important figure in the funding of al - Qaeda operations worldwide .
Ahmed cites many authoritative sources , including Philippine intelligence officer Rene Jarque , Lt. Col. Ricardo Morales , and Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel , to show that the Abu - Sayyaf group has received special assistance and protection both from the Philippine military and from the United States .
Pimentel in a speech before the Philippine Senate in July of 2000 accused the CIA of creating the terrorist organisation with the help of their contacts in the Philippine military and intelligence communities .
Two incidents in particular have exposed the connivance of the United States in the Abu Sayyaf reign of terror beyond a reasonable doubt .
In December of 1994 , Khalifa was arrested during a visit to San Francisco on immigration violations .
The FBI was aware of his ties to the Abu Sayyaf group and to al - Qaeda , and began a criminal investigation .
Khalifa 's lawyers tried to stall the investigation and manoeuvre for extradition to Jordan .
Incredibly , help came to Khalifa from on high .
Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally wrote a three - page letter to Attorney General Janet Reno asking that the request for extradition be granted .
Accordingly , the FBI investigation was cancelled and Khalifa was sent to Jordan per his own request , where he was soon a free man .
The second incident is even more extraordinary and revealing .
Michael Meiring , an American citizen , arrived in the Philippines in 1992 and promptly formed close working relationships both with high government officials and with rebel leaders in the Abu Sayyaf group .
In 2002 , in the midst of a wave of Abu Sayyaf bombings , Meiring accidentally detonated a bomb in his own hotel room in Mindao causing grave injury to himself , requiring emergency hospitalisation .
US authorities immediately intervened .
FBI agents and " agents of the National Security Council " swept him away from his hospital room , first to a hospital in Manila where Meiring was kept incommunicado and was treated by a doctor hand - picked by the US embassy .
Then Meiring was rushed back to the United States .
Like Ali Mohamed , his fate and current whereabouts are unknown .
Numerous attempts to have him extradited back to the Philippines for prosecution have been stonewalled by US authorities .
The motivations for American support of terrorism in the Philippines are not hard to guess .
In 1991 , the same year that Abu Sayyaf was formed , the Philippines Senate had voted to close all US military bases in their country , an action with profound implications for the military posture of the United States in South Asia .
In 2002 , due to the destabilising effects of the Abu Sayyaf operations , the US military were invited back into the country to participate in operation Balikatan ( " shoulder to shoulder " ) , a joint US / Philippine military exercise purportedly aimed at eliminating terrorism .
These operations required special exemptions from the Philippine Constitution , which forbids foreign armies from operating on Philippine soil .
Once again , al - Qaeda , with the help of their American friends , had acted to advance the geostrategic interests of the United States .
The Grand Design
The above examples are by no means isolated anomalies .
The bulk of Ahmed 's fine book is devoted to recording a pattern of evidence that is finally overwhelming .
As he says in conclusion , " not only does the strategy employed in the new ' War on Terror ' seem to provoke terrorism , but an integral dimension of the strategy is the protection of key actors culpable in the financial , logistical , and military - intelligence support of international terrorism . "
And Then There Is September 11 Itself . . .
But what about the September 11 attacks themselves ?
Were they " blowback , " i.e. , unintended domestic consequences of foreign covert operations , or were they an integral part of the Strategy of Tension ?
Based in part on an analysis of intelligence warnings of the attacks , and on the absence of any air defence response , Ahmed strongly endorses the latter view .
He reviews the dozens of very specific foreign and domestic intelligence warnings of terrorist attacks in the United States using airliners that came in the months leading up to the attacks .
These in turn led to warnings issued by American intelligence to Pentagon officials , and to others , including author Salman Rushdie and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown , to cancel all flight plans on the day of September 11 , 2001 .
Meanwhile , no action whatsoever was taken to warn or to protect the American public .
Ahmed points out that the responsible authorities at the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration have produced several profoundly contradictory accounts of their own actions on that day -- each subsequent story seemingly an attempt to remedy the shortcomings of a previous one .
And still no remotely satisfactory account of the failure to intercept even one of the four hijacked airliners has been produced .
Under ordinary circumstances , interception of wayward aircraft by military fighters would have been absolutely routine ; such interceptions occurred at least 56 times in the calendar year prior to September 11 , 2001 .
Ahmed points out that the attacks were allowed to proceed " entirely unhindered for over one and one half hours in the most restricted airspace in the world . "
He finds the idea that this was due to negligence beyond belief .
Instead he argues that there must have been a deliberate stand - down of the air defence system managed by senior national security officials including the vice president and the secretary of defense .
The Future of the Strategy of Tension
The books reviewed herein document a continuous history over the last 40 years of the United States and other governments fostering and manipulating terrorism for their own ends .
Terrorist organisations have been used to destabilise inconvenient regimes around the world , and to sow chaos , which can then serve as a pretext for military intervention .
Even more importantly , terrorism is used to create a crisis atmosphere at home under cover of which the crimes and corruption of government officials go unpunished , civil liberties are easily abandoned , and major wars can be launched under false pretences .
Although at present there appears to be no reason for the terror - masters in Washington to consider changing their tactics , the publication this year of these two illuminating books raises the hope that the Strategy of Tension , which can only thrive in darkness and confusion , will ultimately have to be abandoned .

Sonika has become very popular after participating in a reality show Sonika Kaliraman is a rarity - she is one of 200 Indian women who wrestle professionally , and one of only about 50 women who can represent India in international championships .
She is tall and graceful - and it's hard to imagine her tossing opponents onto a wrestling mat .
But Sonika , 26 , is the daughter of India 's wrestling champion , Chandgi Ram .
She has been living her father 's dream for 10 years now , and hopes for success in next year 's Commonwealth Games in Delhi .
She won gold at the Asian Women Wrestling Championship in 2000 .
Her real shot at national fame came this August , when she took part in Khatron Ke Khiladi - the Indian version of popular American reality show , Celebrity Fear Factor .
'' [ Bollywood star ] Akshay Kumar [ who hosts the show ] once exclaimed on the set - " Wrestler ?
She looks more like a model ! " says Sonika .
Her appearance on the show , and the subsequent attention she received from the media have had an effect on her .
Fashionable Before participating in the reality show , she weighed over 80kg , and knew nothing about " presentation " .
But now , after shedding 15kg , she looks fashionable .
And long after her exit from the show , the public is still interested in her .
" I was 15 , and my sisters and I were watching keenly as TV channels celebrated [ Bollywood actor ] Priyanka Chopra 's Miss World title .
Our father asked us - ' Do you want to be famous like her ? ' "
Sonika says .
" He then pulled out a picture of boxer Laila Ali and said something I 'll never forget - ' Both women are famous because they 've worked for it , they did n't sit in front of the TV and gape ' . "
Chandgi Ram then made a proposal - he wanted to train women as professional wrestlers , something he had fought for with the Indian Wrestling Federation for many years .
I 'm never going to allow anybody to humiliate me again
Sonika Kaliraman
And he wanted his four daughters to take the lead .
In the northern state of Haryana - where according to the 2001 census the gender ratio was at an all - time low of 861 girls to every 1,000 boys born - it was unthinkable for a woman to compete in what is generally considered a man 's game .
" When my father said he had a proposal for us , we actually thought he 'd suggest we become models ! "
Sonika was the only woman from her family who took up the challenge her father set down in 2000 .
And she learned the consequences of her choice the hard way - audiences at a rare women 's tournament threw stones at her and 15 other contestants .
" As we were rushed out by the police , I heard somebody yell - ' Why are women competing here ?
They are meant to be at home and cooking .
This is a man 's game ' . "
" I 'm never going to allow anybody to humiliate me like that again , " she says .
Contribution Former coach Rohtas Singh Dahiya feels Sonika had great potential , but her time was divided between studies , TV appearances and wrestling .
" But there 's no denying the contribution she and her family have made to women 's wrestling in India , " he says .
" I first coached a woman in 1999 .
Since then there have been many more that have come to me to learn .
Sonika had to perform stunts on the TV show " Initially , women were wary of the costumes , and I had to convince them to overlook it .
But wrestling has worked as an incentive - women have done well , won medals and widespread fame .
" And some of my former students now have well paying jobs , and are settled for life . "
Sonika 's life has been a mixed bag so far .
She took up wrestling at the behest of her father , but then faced opposition from many of her father 's students and her own brother , wrestler Jagdish Kaliraman .
Sonika recently married US - based businessman , Siddharth Malik .
It was an arranged match in true Indian style , but Sonika has found support from her husband .

Intel is accused of forcing computer makers to use its chips
Intel , the world 's biggest maker of computer chips , is being sued by a US competition authority .
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has accused the company of using its market dominance to squash competitors and prevent innovation .
It said Intel had deliberately tried to " hamstring " its smaller competitors .
Intel said the FTC 's case was " misguided " .
The FTC 's move comes a month after the New York attorney general launched a similar lawsuit .
In that case , New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo accuses Intel of using " illegal threats " to dominate microchip sales .
This is clearly a good day for [ Intel 's rival ] Advanced Micro Devices , there 's no question about it
Peter Kenny , Knight Equity Markets
Last month Intel also reached a $ 1.25 bn ( £ 770 m ) settlement with rival Advanced Micro Devices to end an anti-competition legal dispute between the two firms .
' Hamper competition '
Shares in AMD rose 5.2 % on news of this latest action , while Intel dropped 0.7 % .
" This is clearly a good day for Advanced Micro Devices , there 's no question about it , " said analyst Peter Kenny of Knight Equity Markets .
Intel is also appealing against a record $ 1.45 bn anti-competition fine from European regulators .
The FTC said it is asking for an order that would bar Intel from using " threats , bundled prices , or other offers to encourage exclusive deals , hamper competition , or unfairly manipulate the prices of its " chips .
It accuses Intel of using both threats and rewards to keep some of the biggest computer makers from buying other companies ' chips or marketing computers that carried them .
The complaint names Dell , Hewlett - Packard and IBM as Intel 's targets .
SHANGHAI -- A Zimbabwe - registered cargo plane bound for Kyrgyzstan crashed on takeoff from Shanghai 's main airport Saturday morning , killing crew members , according to reports .
Three American crew members were killed , the Associated Press reported , citing a U.S. Embassy spokesman .
Another four crew were injured in the incident , which Chinese officials said is being investigated .
Shanghai television showed billows of black smoke rising high in the sky .
Footage also showed the wrecked MD - 11 fuselage laying in a wet field adjacent the to the Chinese city 's main international airport .
London - based Avient Ltd. said on its
Web site that its Zimbabwe - based aviation division operated the MD - 11 freighter aircraft with a seven person crew and that " preliminary information indicates that the accident occurred on takeoff . "
It described the flight as a charter freight flight but offered no additional details .
The MD - 11 cargo plane was registered in Zimbabwe and heading to Bishkek , the capital of Kyrgyzstan , according to China 's news agency Xinhua .
CARACAS , Venezuela , Nov. 24 ( UPI ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is deploying 300 newly bought Russian tanks and armored vehicles and has called on Venezuelans to join Bolivarian militia in a marked military buildup seen as a continuation of his rhetoric the country is on a war footing and faces a threat from Colombian - U.S. military bases .
The Venezuelan leader has been buying weapons and forging new military alliances , including a wide - ranging agreement with Iran , in response to the perceived threat from Colombia .
Both Colombia and the Obama administration have rejected Chavez 's claims , stressing the bases are focused on anti-narcotics operations against drug cartels flooding North America with cocaine and heroin .

Chavez announced the arrival of a shipment of 300 Russian tanks and armored vehicles on television .
" We are about to receive , and it's no secret , more than 300 tanks and armored vehicles from Russia .
We are going to have T - 72 tanks , " Chavez said .
Analysts said the shipment is believed to include light tanks , armored cars as well as T - 72 tanks .
Russia confirmed the deal earlier , but the exact terms of the purchase were not revealed .
Analysts said Russia offered the military hardware on soft terms as part of its effort to build up military sales in Latin America .
A Russian team that visited Argentina offered similar deals to Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner .
Chavez has hailed Russia as a " strategic ally , " but analysts see the Russian sale as part of the wider effort by Moscow to boost arms sales in a region that was until recently the preserve of the U.S. arms manufacturers and exporters .
The military buildup coincides with mounting problems on Venezuela 's energy front .
Water and electricity shortages have become endemic and the state - managed oil industry has suffered in the wake of large - scale purges of personnel considered to be unsympathetic to the president 's Bolivarian revolution .
The call for a national militia that is to include members of the ruling United Socialist Party followed arrests of critics of the government and closure or confiscation of privately owned media .
Analysts said the expansion of the militia could signal an effort by Chavez to ensure loyalty and quell discontent over electricity and water shortages .
New legislation introduced by Chavez requires all citizens to volunteer for a combatant corps that will be trained to face all eventualities .
Details of the militia have not been revealed , but government media said at least 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles were part of the Russian arms shipments , along with 50 combat helicopters and other equipment .
Venezuela 's ongoing quarrel with Colombia is likely to figure in the next meeting of the Union of South American nations .
Unasur is expected to meet in Quito , Ecuador , later this month .
" There is growing concern over the delicate situation involving some country members of Unasur , " Ecuadorian Foreign Affairs Minister Fander Falconi said in a statement .
He said the dispute between Venezuela and Colombia and recent differences between Peru and Chile would top the agenda .
The other day I was browsing through the C++ API code of a third - party library .
I was not much surprised to see stuff like
# define MAX ( a , b ) ( ( a ) >= ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) # define MIN ( a , b ) ( ( a ) <= ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) )
because despite the fact that std :: min , std:: max together with the rest of the C++ standard library is around for quite a while now , you still come across old fashioned code like above frequently .
But things got worse :
# define FALSE 0 #define TRUE 1
and later :
... bool someVariable = TRUE ;
As if they learned only half the story about the bool type in C ++.
But there was more to come :
class ListItem { ListItem * next ; ListItem * previous ; ... } ; class List : private ListItem { ... } ;
Yes , that ’s right , the API guys created their own linked - list implementation .
And a pretty weird one , too , mixing templates with void* pointers to hold the contents .
Now , why on earth would you do that when you could just use std :: list or std::vector ?
Makes you wonder about the quality of the rest of the code .
Especially with C++ where there are so many little pitfalls and details which can burn you .
Hey , if you have no clue about the very basics of a language , leave it alone !
Unfortunately , the above example is not exceptional in industry software .
It seems that the C++ world these days is actually split into two worlds .
In one , people like Andrei Alexandrescu write great books about Modern C++ design , Scott Meyers gives talks about Effective C++ and the boost guys introduce the next library using even more creative operator overloading that in the spirit library ( which is pretty cool stuff , btw ) .
In the other world , you could easily call it industry reality , people barely know the STL , do n’t use templates at all , or fall for misleading and dangerous c++ features like the throw ( ) clause in method signatures .
Or they ban certain c++ features because they are supposedly not easy to understand for the new guy on the project or are less readable in general .
Take for example the Google C++ Style Guide .
They do n’t even allow exceptions , or the use of std::auto_ptr .
Their take on the boost library is that “ some of the libraries encourage … an excessively “ functional ” style of programming ” .
What exactly is bad about piece of functional programming used as the right tool in the right place ?
And what communicates ownership issues better than e.g. returning a heap allocated object using a std::auto_ptr ?
The no-exceptions rule is also only partly understandable .
Sure enough , exceptions increase code complexity in C++ more than in other languages ( read Items 18 and 19 of Herb Sutter ’s Exceptional C++ as an eye - opener .
Or look here ) .
But IMHO their advantages still outweigh their downsides .
With the upcoming new C++0X standard my guess is that the situation will not get any better , to put it mildly .
Most likely , things like type inference with the new auto keyword will sell big because they save typing effort .
Same thing with the long overdue feature of constructor delegation .
But why would people who find functional programming less readable start to use lambda functions ?
As little known as the explicit keyword is now , how many people will know about or actually use the new “ = delete ” keyword , let alone “ = default “ ?
Maybe I ’m a little too pessimistic here but I will certainly put a mark in my calender on the day I encounter the first concept definition in some piece of industry C++ software .
Update : Concepts have been removed from C++0X so that mark in my calender will not come any time soon …
Adding to the positive signs , a broad measure of unemployment  one that includes those forced to work only part time and those too discouraged to look for work  fell to 17.2 percent , from 17.5 percent in October , the first decline in several months .
In addition , job losses in September and October turned out to be far less than previously reported : 250,000 instead of 409,000 .

“ All this good news is miles above the underlying trend rate of improvement , so we expect a correction in the next month or two , ” Ian Shepherdson , chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics , said in a message to the firm ’s clients .
Even without a correction , once the economy turns and hiring resumes , nearly 18 million people are likely to be vying for jobs , as if they were all trying at once to jam themselves through a door too narrow to accommodate more than a few .
In a strong economy , the work force seldom grows by more than 300,000 workers a month .
Nearly one - third have an even greater burden .
They are the long - term unemployed , out of work for six months or more , and in many cases longer than a year .
Not since records were first kept in 1948 has the percentage of long - term unemployed been as high as it is today : 38.3 percent of all those seeking work , or more than 10 percentage points above the previous high , in the aftermath of the early 1980s recession .
“ Assuming we have a strong recovery , it will take at least five years or more to get the unemployment rate down to a more normal 5 percent , ” said Jan Hatzius , chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs , adding that the long - term unemployed have lost skills and some of the habits of work because of their extended idleness .
Because of this , the nation may have to get used to an unemployment rate that seldom falls below 6 percent .
Annette Mercado , 39 , a single mother in Chicago , said that she had retained her skills , even though she has been hunting for work since July of last year , when she was laid off from a $ 12 - an - hour clerical job in a motorcycle accessory shop .
She attributes that layoff to her refusal to work extra hours .
“ I told them I was n’t willing to spend more time away from my 14 - year - old daughter , ” Ms. Mercado said .
She spent months scouring Craigslist , CareerBuilder and other job sites , but the best she could do , she said during an interview at the state unemployment office , was temporary holiday season work last December at a liquor store .
Pod :: Coverage :: TrustPod - 2009-12-04
Testing Pod Coverage
Andy Lester 's fantastic Test :: Pod :: Coverage makes it easy to check whether you 've covered all your code .
The standard usage is to make a file named something like t/ pod-coverage.t , with these contents :
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
use Test :: More ;
plan skip_all =>
" Test : : Pod : : Coverage 1.08 required for this test "
unless eval " use Test : : Pod:: Coverage 1.08 ; 1 " ;
all_pod_coverage_ok ( ) ;
The test will find all the Perl libraries in your distribution , find all the public subroutines or methods , and then try to ensure that they 're documented .
It does this by finding all defined subroutines , ignoring ones that it thinks are private ( anything starting with an underscore and Perl - wide things like import or DESTROY ) .
Then it looks for =headn or =item entries .
There 's even a mechanism to supply your own coverage_class to , for example , allow documentation in parent classes to suffice -- that way you do n't have to document new in every subclass you write .
Sometimes , though , you want to note that a symbol does n't need to be checked .
Maybe it 's documented without having its own header , or maybe it's from a documented source more complex than an is - a relationship , like a role or trait .
With Test :: Pod :: Coverage 's default behavior , this is sort of a mess .
You can either specify global options :
1 :
all_pod_coverage_ok ( { trustme => [ qw ( weird_doc_sub ) ] } ) ;
... but this will trust that symbol to be documented in all your modules .
So instead , you could test libraries one by one , expanding that all_pod_coverage call into a bunch of single - module calls with the right arguments :
1 :
2 :
3 :
pod_coverage_ok ( ' Library : : Alpha ' , { trustme => [ qw ( weird_doc_sub ) ] } ) ;
pod_coverage_ok ( ' Library : : Beta ' , { trustme => [ qw ( weird_doc_method ) ] } ) ;
pod_coverage_ok ( $ _ ) for qw( Library : : Gamma Library : : Epsilon ) ;
... but this is a bunch more work , and you wo n't realize until it 's too late that you forgot to add Library : : Delta to the list of " no special treatment " routines .
Putting Trust Where it Belongs
Pod :: Coverage :: TrustPod is built on the idea that the best place to make a note about things already documented is in the documentation itself .
You do n't need to write a bunch of documentation for weird_doc_method , but you can make a note about it in the Pod .
That way , every file has its own list of routines to consider already documented , but you can still call all_pod_coverage_ok .
When you write your library , you 'd write something like this :
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :
6 :
7 :
8 :
9 :
10 :
11 :
12 :
13 :
14 :
15 :
16 :
17 :
18 :
19 :
20 :
package Library :: Alpha ;
use parent ' Library : : Common ' ;
=for Pod:: Coverage
new
weird_doc_method
=cut
sub new { ... }
sub weird_doc_method { ... }
=head2 documented_method
This method is really documented !
=cut
sub documented_method { ... }
And you 'd write your t/pod- coverage .t file like this :
1 :
all_pod_coverage_ok ( { coverage_class => ' Pod :: Coverage :: TrustPod ' } ) ;
That 's it !
Now all your documentation 's coverage is easy to test , and exceptions are easy to maintain by putting the exceptions right where they belong : in the Pod document itself .
A final request ...
Having
Pod coverage tests is great .
It helps you make sure that you documented things .
What is n't great is when you let those tests run on the computer of anybody who 's installing your code and they fail for some stupid reason .
It prevents the user from installing your code just because it thinks you forgot to write enough documentation .
So , always write this t/ pod-coverage .t
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :
6 :
use Test :: More ;
plan skip_all => " author test only " unless $ ENV { RELEASE_TESTING } ;
plan skip_all =>
" Test : : Pod : : Coverage 1.08 required for this test "
unless eval " use Test : : Pod:: Coverage 1.08 ; 1 " ;
all_pod_coverage_ok ( { coverage_class => ' Pod :: Coverage :: TrustPod ' } ) ;
That way , the tests will only be run when you 're testing your distribution before release .

Justice Sotomayor said that result was dictated by sound policy and was consistent with a law governing appeals .

In a minor case , part of an opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor was rejected by Justice Clarence Thomas .
The decision was unanimous , but Justice Clarence Thomas declined to join the part of Justice Sotomayor ’s opinion discussing why the cost of allowing immediate appeals outweighs the possibility that candid communications between lawyers and their clients might be chilled .
In a concurrence , Justice Thomas took a swipe at his new colleague , saying she had “ with a sweep of the court ’s pen ” substituted “ value judgments ” and “ what the court thinks is a good idea ” for the text of a federal law .
The federal government had urged the court to rule as it did but asked the court to exclude appeals of claims of the state secrets privilege and other governmental privileges from the sweep of its ruling .
Justice Sotomayor obliged with a footnote saying “ we express no view on that issue . ”
In an otherwise dry opinion , Justice Sotomayor did introduce one new and politically charged term into the Supreme Court lexicon .

DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal urged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday to stop seeking compromise with Israel but offered him an olive branch , saying Palestinians must end their divisions .

Sounding conciliatory after raising the political ante against Abbas following his call for national elections last month , Meshaal said the Islamist group Hamas “ stretches its hand ” to Abbas ’s Fatah faction to end divisions between the two sides undermining the Palestinian cause .
“ Courage dictates that we , as leaders of the Palestinians , be frank with our people and evaluate what compromise has brought us , decide together to suspend or freeze the political settlement process and pursue our real national options , ” Meshaal told a rally in the Syrian capital .
He said compromise with Israel , starting with the 1993 Oslo Accords , had failed to stop Israeli settlement expansion and brought Palestinians no closer to establishing an independent state in the land Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War .
Abbas suspended talks with Israel during the Israeli invasion of Gaza in December and U.S. efforts to re-start them have since failed .
Hamas has opposed the talks and rejected Western demands to recognize Israel , renounce armed struggle and accept existing interim peace deals .
“ Any leader who insists on the right of return for the Palestinian refugees and on restoring the land , even to the 1967 borders ... must know that the way to do this is not through negotiations or betting on the Americans but through holy struggle , resistance and national unity , ” Meshaal said .
NATIONAL PROJECT
“ Our hand is stretched out to reconcile with our brothers in Fatah and the Palestinian presidency to achieve our national project , ” he said , but did not make any new proposals for reconciliation after Hamas rejected an Egypt - mediated deal .
Hamas won a Palestinian parliamentary election in 2006 , defeating the once - dominant , more secular Fatah , and won a brief civil war the following year in the Gaza Strip against Fatah .
Abbas then sacked the Hamas government and appointed his own administration in the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
The factional violence has been deadly and hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested in crackdowns by the two groups against their rivals ’ supporters , intensifying mutual acrimony .
The United States refuses to talk to Hamas , considering the group a terrorist organization .
Abbas last month called for new Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections in January , opposed by Hamas , and announced on Thursday that he did not want to seek re-election .
Meshaal , who lives in exile in Syria , said Abbas ’s decision not to run , caused “ some embarrassment ” to the United States , the main Western backer of Abbas and Israel ’s chief ally .
Hamas said Meshaal this week met delegates from the Council for the National Interest , an independent U.S. group advocating what it calls a more even handed U.S. policy in the Middle East .
The delegation included Jack Matlock , a former American ambassador to Moscow .
It was the first time Hamas announced meeting the group , which had visited Syria in the past .
The mummified caterpillars are said to be much more potent than ginseng
Police in Indian - administered Kashmir have arrested four people trying to smuggle the rare medicinal herb , caterpillar fungus , to China .
The fungus - known as caterpillar mushroom - is used in Chinese medicine and is believed to be an aphrodisiac .
Police say about 90kg ( 200 lb ) of the fungus was seized in the Ladakh region near China .
It is worth about $ 300,000 ( £ 180,000 ) on the black market .
Caterpillar fungus is found about 5,000 m ( 16,500 ft ) above sea level .
It must be harvested in freezing monsoon rains in the alpine pastures of the Himalayan mountains around Tibet .
Infertility cure
The fungal parasite - Cordyceps sinensis - infects the larvae of a butterfly and grows inside the body of the insect .
The parasite eventually kills the insect when it becomes a caterpillar and then the fungus grows out of the head of the dead caterpillar .
The power of the fungus was discovered some 1,500 years ago and was used by Ming Dynasty rulers as an aphrodisiac and a cure for infertility .
Recent Chinese studies suggest it also has cancer - fighting and cholesterol - lowering properties .
That the US Episcopal Church has elected a lesbian as a bishop should come as no more of a surprise than learning that the future of the Anglican Communion is once again in jeopardy .
The trajectory of each has been clear to church watchers for almost a decade , so talk of schism and turmoil is not so much premature as it is tardy and , quite frankly , a statement of the bleeding obvious .
As recently as July the US Episcopal Church announced its decision to open " any ordained ministry " to gay and lesbian people .
Last weekend they did just that – congratulations Mary Glasspool .
You never wanted to be a " single issue person " but you are anyway .
Not to be outdone on the flouting of the moratoria – three laughable " bans " aimed at keeping the Communion together – malcontents on the conservative evangelical side last year announced their decision to launch a parallel network for like - minded Anglicans , and there were accusations of heresy and apostasy thrown about in Jerusalem with gay abandon .
Although the existence of the Global Anglican Futures Conference ( Gafcon ) in itself is not breaking a ban , conservatives , whether in Pittsburgh , Abuja or Oxford , like rattling their sabres , threatening to break away because of the progressives ruining " their " church .
Before the launch of Gafcon and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans ( Foca ) , Anglican churches in Africa intervened in US parishes where there was a difference in opinion over homosexuality by providing religious leadership that is more conservative , a practice that continues to this day .
How else to describe then , other than broken , a Christian denomination that offers alternative oversight for those who cannot stand their fellow Anglicans ?
The conservatives have their own church - within - a - church – even if they themselves will not admit it – and the liberals are forging ahead in an inclusive direction as befits the 21st century .
Amid all this empire building and thumbing of noses the sky has not fallen in and the average Anglican continues to be bemused and more than a little frustrated at the Communion 's obsession with sex , how people have it and with whom .
The most intriguing aspect of this latest episode is , as always in ecumenical matters , what Rowan Williams will do next .
Sidelined by the Vatican and tested once again by the Americans , Anglican eyes are trained on Lambeth Palace .
The archbishop of Canterbury , so quick to lecture bankers and politicians and industrialised nations , took an age to even acknowledge an anti-homosexuality law in Uganda .
But he took less than 12 hours to wag his finger sternly in the direction of Mary Glasspool – obviously he thinks one is a greater threat than the other .
He does not have authority over other Anglican provinces and , even if he did , it is too late for him to get tough with them .
Everyone respects him , but nobody listens to him .
While Glasspool 's election needs approval from a majority of dioceses before the consecration can proceed , her victory shows how committed the Episcopalians are to same - sex relationships , in spite of vociferous opposition .
The conservatives are also pressing ahead with their vision of what an Anglican church should look like .
However one feels about the direction or values of either , neither can be faulted for their consistency , integrity and principles .
If only the same could be said for the archbishop .
Asteroid passes just 8,700 miles from Earth - with only 15 hours warning
Although no one noticed at the time , the Earth was almost hit by an asteroid last Friday .
The previously undiscovered asteroid came within 8,700 miles of Earth but astronomers noticed it only 15 hours before it made its closest approach .
Its orbit brought it 30 times nearer than the Moon , which is 250,000 miles away .
Do n't panic !
Although the asteroid passed within 9,000 miles of Earth it measured just 23ft across and would n't have dented the surface ( artist 's illustration )
Part of the devastation in Tunguska , Siberia , in 1908 after a meteorite struck .
The impact created a blast so powerful it levelled 1,200 square miles of forest
But before you head for the nuclear bunkers you will be relieved to learn the tumbling rock was only 23ft across .
Similar sized objects pass by this close to Earth about twice a year and impact on the planet about once every five years .
Astronomers believe the object , called 2009 VA , would have almost completely burned up while entering Earth 's atmosphere , causing a brilliant fireball in the sky but no major damage to the surface .
The asteroid was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on November 6 , 2009 .
It was then identified by the Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge , Massachusetts as a near Earth object .
The path of the asteroid 2009 VA , which passed well within the Moon 's orbit last Friday
Nasa 's Near Earth Object Programme plotted the orbit of the object and determined that although it would fly extremely close to our planet it would n't hit us .
It was the third - closest known ( non-impacting ) Earth approach on record for a cataloged asteroid .
The Nasa NEO programme aims to detect and track at least 90 per cent of the 1,000 asteroids and comets that approach Earth and are larger than 0.6 miles in diameter , by 2020 .
They monitored a 100ft asteroid that whizzed 45,000 miles above the Earth 's surface on March 2 this year .
A similar sized object slammed into Tunguska , Siberia in 1908 .
The impact created a blast so powerful it levelled 1,200 square miles of forest .
Here 's a personal description from the artist :
" I'm KJ Sawka and I 'm excited to introduce the ' Mad Beatz ' drum n' bass , dub step and breakbeat collection exclusively for Ableton Live , as a special holiday gift .
I 'm proud to be part of the world changing Ableton team !
' Mad Beatz ' is mainly drum and beat - oriented stemming from a live acoustic drumming session recorded at the Art Institute in Seattle , Wa USA .
There are also plenty of electronic drum loops , percussion , basslines and keyboard riffs . "

Food digestion varies depending upon the type of food .
I will break down the process into its steps and provide a timeline for each step .
First we see the food .
This stimulates our brain to ready our stomach to receive food , by increasing gastric secretions .
Then , we eat the food .
Amylase is a digestive enzyme in our saliva that helps to break down carbohydrates .
Mechanical manipulation by chewing breaks the food into smaller pieces which provide more surface area .
This increased surface area helps the enzymes in the small intestine absorb the nutrients in our food better .
This is why it is important to chew your food well .
Next , we swallow and food arrives at the stomach .
The stomach is responsible for further mechanical breakdown of food and some chemical breakdown .
Proteins are broken down by pepsinogen into peptide chains and fat is broken by gastric lipase ( to help you navigate through these terms , any word with “ ase ” at the end generally denotes an enzyme responsible for some kind of digestion ) .
When food has been through the stomach , it becomes chyme ; an acidic mixture of hydrochloric acid from our stomach , pepsinogen , lipase and amylase .
The entrance to the small intestine from the stomach is controlled by the pyloric sphincter ; a controlled doorway that prevents too much chyme from entering the small intestine at once .
The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine .
The duodenum ’s job is to neutralize the acidic chyme before allowing it to continue through the rest of the small intestine by way of bicarbonate from pancreatic juice .
The food then enters the jejunum , the part of the small intestine that is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption .
Fat , peptides and carbohydrates are further broken down by enzymes into units that are small enough to be transferred in the bloodstream to the target organs .
The primary fuel the body needs to run properly is glucose ; so much of the food is broken down and recombined into glucose .
At this point , the food has spent between 30 minutes and 2 hours in the stomach and between 2 and 6 hours in the small intestine and 90 % of the nutrients have been extracted .
The left over material has lots of water and sodium left in it .
The body wants to reclaim these substances before defecation ; food takes 72 hours to be processed in the large intestine .
The jobs of the large intestine are to reclaim the water from the food , reclaim the sodium from the food , and provide healthy bacteria to ferment fiber that has not been digested .
This fermentation provides nutrients to keep the cells in the large intestines healthy .
Fiber that has not been digested adds bulk to the waste products to facilitate elimination .
In summary , at the short end , digestion takes about 75 hours , but it can take up to 80 hours from the time it enters the mouth to the time it leaves the body in the form of stool .

United States : The World ’s Leading Jailer
The United States has a longstanding policy of mass incarceration .
Recent statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistic ( BJS ) , a branch of the US Department of Justice , showed that the US has more than 2.4 million people behind bars on any given day , and an incarceration rate of 754 per 100,000 residents .
This is the highest incarceration rate in the world , and it is much higher than rates in other democracies .
In comparison , the rate in England is 154 per 100,000 , in Canada it is 116 per 100,000 and in Japan only 63 per 100,000 .
According to the BJS , in 2008 over 7.3 million people were either on probation , in jail , in prison or on parole .
This amounts to an astonishing 3.2 percent of all US adult residents or 1 in every 31 adults .
States and federal prison authorities had jurisdiction over 1,610,446 prisoners at year - end 2008 ; 1,409,116 in state jurisdiction and 201,280 in federal jurisdiction .
Local jails held 785,556 persons awaiting trial or serving a sentence at mid-year 2008 .
However , the new government figures show a slower growth in the prison population .
The US prison ’s population still grew by 0.8 percent from 2007 to 2008 , which is the lowest annual growth in 8 years .
Twenty states reported a decline in their prison population , with New - York , Georgia and Michigan reporting the largest reductions .
In comparison , the growth of the prison population from 2000 to 2008 was 1.8 percent per year on average .
During the 1990s , it was even higher with an incredible 6.5 percent incarceration rate increase per year on average .
The report confirms significant racial disparities in US criminal justice policy , with black men incarcerated at a rate of six and half times as high as that of white men .
As the financial crisis has created record budget deficits at federal , state and local level , many states are amending their sentencing laws to reduce the use of incarceration .
Other states have granted early release to prisoners convicted of minor non-violent offenses .
This could be one of the only positive outcome of the recession , if the United States could re-think its massive penal system , and reform it .
America is obsessed with crime & punishment , and because of it has an addiction to imprisonment .
Imprisonment on this scale is not only immoral , unpractical but most of all counter - productive .
Crime and punishment are connected symbolically but are disconnected in the reality of lowering crime and improving our social fabric .
The crime rate , in the US , seems to have fluctuated of its own free will , unaffected by the billions thrown at the problem every year .
Although crime declined throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium , incarceration rates climbed dramatically .
The cost of maintaining an inmate in the US penal system is around 40,000 dollars a year .
The expenditure is creating a situation where state budgets are getting drained by the rising cost of the ever expending penal system , representing a cumulative amount of 50 billion this year .
Politicians are coming up with the solution of deep cuts on education , health care and other social services and programs to make up the difference .
Of course , politicians should be doing the exact opposite , it is precisely the lack of funding for quality public education and drug rehabilitation programs that have produced the gargantuan monster that is the United States penal system .
The logic of mass incarceration to prove you are “ tough on crime ” has worked as an electoral slogan for both Republicans and Democrats , but putting people away and “ throwing away the key ” has not reduce crime or made our society any better .

Among the news from today 's New New Chrysler briefing was this slide of the 2012 Dodge Charger .
The design is so good it apparently made Ralph Giles weep with joy .
Look familiar ?
There 's a reason ...

This image reveals a sloping belt line and strong curve building from the front to the shoulders , reminiscent of the 1999 Dodge RT Charger Concept ( below ) it seems to borrow heavily from .
We 're also told the new Charger initially had rear door handles in the roof line rather than the door panel — giving it a two - door look — but this was eventually dropped .

In an interview with ABC News ' Barbara Walters , Sarah Palin , the former GOP vice presidential candidate , gave her policy recommendations , weighing in on issues in the Middle East , U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and more .
Palin , whose book , " Going Rogue : An American Life , " hit bookshelves today , took aim at the Obama administration 's stance on Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories .
" I disagree with the Obama administration on that , " Palin told Walters .
" I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon , because that population of Israel is , is going to grow .
More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead .
And I do n't think that the Obama administration has any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand . "
Watch Barbara Walters ' interview with Sarah Palin tonight on " Nightline , " Wednesday on " Good Morning America " and Friday on " 20/20 . "
As for another hot - button issue -- Afghanistan -- where 68,000 U.S. troops are currently deployed , Palin said the president should follow the advice of Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
" To listen to McChrystal , to listen to the appointee that President Obama asked for , the advice from , " she said .
" McChrystal gave the president the advice and said , ' We need essentially a surge strategy in Afghanistan , so that we can win in Afghanistan .
And that means more resources , more troops there . '
It frustrates me and frightens me -- and many Americans -- that President Obama is dithering around with the decision in Afghanistan . "
Obama is deciding on a strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Four options have been submitted to the president , who , along with his war council , is assessing troop levels and the cost .
The most ambitious strategy , from McChrystal , would send 40,000 more troops .
According to ABC News ' Jake Tapper , Obama pushed the generals to elaborate on how and when the exchange of responsibility could take place from U.S. troops to the Afghans .
Though the two do n't have much in common in terms of policy , Palin said the ultimate goal for the United States in Afghanistan should be to turn responsibility over to the Afghan government and people .
" The people there , the government there , should be able to take over and to have a more peaceful existence there for the people who live there -- without American interference , if you will , " she said .
Sarah Palin : How to Fix Unemployment
To address the highest unemployment levels since 1983 , Palin said she would cut taxes .
" I would start cutting taxes and allowing our small businesses to keep more of what they are earning , more of what they are producing , more of what they own and earn so that they could start reinvesting in their businesses and expand and hire more people , " she told Walters .
" Not punishing them by forcing health care reform down their throats ; by forcing an energy policy down their throats that ultimately will tax them more and cost them more to stay in business .
Those are backassward ways of trying to fix the economy . "
" You do have a way with words , " Walters replied .
" I call it like I see it , " she said .
Russia : Foreign Policy Experience ?
In September 2008 , Palin told ABC News ' Charles Gibson in an exclusive interview , that there is an island in Alaska where one can see Russia and that this strategic proximity was part of her foreign policy experience .
" They 're our next - door neighbors , and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska , from an island in Alaska , " Palin told Gibson .
Her response to that question came back to haunt her in interviews and with Tina Fey 's iconic portrayal of her on " Saturday Night Live . "
But Palin told Walters that she never said " I can see Russia from my house " and explained why she still feels Alaska 's proximity to Russia is important .
" It 's very significant .
And we are a gatekeeper for the continent .
So for national security reasons , and for energy independence and resource development reasons , Alaska should be recognized for its strategic location on the globe , " she told Walters .
Palin on President Obama
The former governor would n't directly address the burning question of whether she wants to be president or if she would make a run in 2012 , but she did not completely close that door , either .
" That certainly is n't on my radar screen right now , " said Palin . " [ But ] when you consider some of the ordinary turning into extraordinary events that have happened in my life , I am not one to predict what will happen in a few years . "
Sarah Palin discusses her political future and Obama 's presidency with Barbara Walters .

Palin said that on a scale of one to 10 , she would give the president a mere four for his job performance .
" There are a lot of decisions being made that I -- and probably the majority of Americans -- are not impressed with right now , " Palin said .
" I think our economy is not being put on the right track , because we 're strayed too far from , fundamentally , from free enterprise principles that built our country .
And I question , too , some of the dithering , and hesitation with some of our national security questions that have got to be answered for our country .
... So , a four . "

Prison Break , the drama packed television series that revolves around two prison bound brothers , has been known to have an upcoming game for quite a while .
However , recent economic turbulence caused the original developer , Brash Entertainment , to shut down .
Fortunately the game found a new home with publisher Kosh Media who will now bring out the game .
The protagonist of “ Prison Break : The Conspiracy ” is Company Agent Tom Paxton .
He is sent to the Fox River State Penitentiary to investigate why Michael Scofield ( the hero of the TV series ) , a man without a previous criminal record or sufficient motive , became a bank robber .
The storyline runs parallel to the first season of “ Prison Break ” : Paxton encounters several characters from the series and experiences key events from his own viewpoint .
Koch Media has announced that Prison Break : The Conspiracy will be released for PS3 , PC and Xbox 360 on March 26th 2010 in Europe , with no date currently given for the US .

When infant eyes absorb a world of virgin visions , colors are processed purely , in a pre-linguistic parts of the brain .
As adults , colors are processed in the brain 's language centers , refracted by the concepts we have for them .
How does that switch take place ?
And does it affect our subjective experience of color ?
Such tantalizing questions , their answers still unknown , are raised by this developmental shift in color categorization , described today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To test the phenomenon , a team of British and English researchers asked adults and infants to focus on a briefly flashing target circle .
Sometimes the target appeared in the subjects ' right visual fields
– roughly speaking , the right half of a person 's field of vision , which is transmitted from the eyes to the brain 's left hemisphere , where language processing also takes place .
Sometimes the targets appeared in the left visual field , which connects to the pre-linguistic right hemisphere .
When asked to pick out a target against a similarly - colored background
– a more mentally demanding task than distinguishing between different colors – infants performed better when the target appeared in their left visual fields .
Adults , by contrast , had an easier time with targets in their right visual fields .
Over the course of our lives , it appears that an unfiltered perception of color gives way to one mediated by the constructs of language .
Does this mean that adults and infants see the same colors differently ?
" We do n't know , " said study co-author Paul Kay .
But might adults see colors differently ?
That seems plausible .
" As an adult , color categorization is influenced by linguistic categories .
It differs as the language differs , " said Kay , who is renowned for his studies on the ways that different cultures classify colors .
He cited recent research on the ability of Russian speakers to
detect shades of blue [ pdf ] that English speakers classify as a single color .
How does the switch to a language - bound perception of color take place ?
" That 's the $ 64,000 question , " said Kay .
" We have every reason to believe that learning a language has a lot to do with it – but [ as for ] how that works , it 's early . "
Categorical perception of color is lateralized to the right hemisphere in infants , but to the left hemisphere in adults [ PNAS ]

ADADO , Somalia
ABOVE the shimmering horizon , in the middle of a deserted highway , stands an oversize figure wearing a golf cap , huge sunglasses , baggy jeans , and an iPhone on his hip , not your typical outfit in war - torn Somalia .
But then again , Mohamed Aden , the man waiting in the road , is not your typical Somali .
The instant his guests arrive , he spreads his arms wide , ready for a bear hug .
“ Welcome to Adado , ” he says , beaming .
“ Now , let ’s bounce . ”
Mr. Aden , 37 , is part militia commander , part schoolteacher , part lawmaker , part engineer , part environmentalist , part king  a mind - boggling combination of roles for anyone to play , let alone for a guy who dresses ( and talks ) like a rapper and recently moved from Minnesota to Somalia in an effort to build a local government .
Think of him as the accidental warlord .
And a shard of hope .
In less than a year , Mr. Aden , who was born in Somalia and emigrated to the United States at age 22 , has essentially built a state within a state .
With money channeled from fellow clansmen living in the United States and Europe , he has transformed Adado and its surroundings in central Somalia , which used to be haunted by bandits and warring Islamic factions , into an enclave of peace , with a functioning police force , scores of new businesses , new schools and new rules .
Crisis in California : Everything Touched by Capital Turns Toxic
The United States ’ most populous state , California is the world ’s eighth largest economy .
The state has some of the planet ’s most productive farmland and in the 1990s enjoyed an extensive real - estate boom .
But intensive , industrialised agriculture has polluted much of the environment and now , with more foreclosed homes than anywhere else in the world , it is also home to a growing number of tent cities .
Gifford Hartman takes us on a road trip through California ’s Central Valley to witness the toxicity : of mortgages and ecosystems , houses , drugs and human relations .
I should be very much pleased if you could find me something good ( meaty ) on economic conditions in California … .
California is very important for me because nowhere else has the upheaval most shamelessly caused by capitalist centralisation taken place with such speed .
– Letter from Karl Marx to Friedrich Sorge , 1880
Shantytown USA
In California toxic capitalist social relations demonstrated their full irrationality in May 2009 when banks bulldozed brand - new , but unsold , McMansions in the exurbs of Southern California .
Across the United States an eviction occurs every 13 seconds and there are at the moment at least five empty homes for every homeless person .
The newly homeless are finding beds unavailable as shelters are stretched well beyond capacity .
St. John ’s Shelter for Women and Children in Sacramento regularly turns away 350 people a night .
Many of these people end up in the burgeoning tent cities that are often located in the same places as the ‘ Hoovervilles ’ – similar structures , named after then President Herbert Hoover – of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The tent city in Sacramento , California ’s state capital , was set up on land that had previously been a garbage dump .
It became internationally known when news media from Germany , the UK , Switzerland and elsewhere covered it .
It featured in the French magazine Paris Match and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the US .
Of course this publicity necessitated that Arnold Schwarzenegger , California ’s governor , and Kevin Johnson , mayor of Sacramento , shut it down .
When we visited in March 2009 to investigate , we met Governor Schwarzenegger and Mayor Johnson there by chance .
Johnson told us the tent city would be evacuated , saying , ‘ They ca n’t stay here , this land is toxic . ’
Almost half the people we spoke with had until recently been working in the building trades .
When the housing boom collapsed they simply could not find work .
Some homeless people choose to live outside for a variety of reasons , including not being allowed to take pets into homeless shelters or to freely drink and use substances .
But most of the tent city dwellers desperately wanted to be working and wanted to be housed .
In many places people creating tent encampments are met with hostility , and are blamed for their own condition .
New York City , with a reputation for intolerance towards the homeless , recently shut down a tent city in East Harlem .
Homeowners near a tent city of 200 in Tampa , Florida organised to close it down , saying it would ‘ devalue ’ their homes .
In Seattle , police have removed several tent cities , each named ‘ Nickelsville ’ after the Mayor who ordered the evictions .
Yet in some places , like Nashville , Tennessee , tent cities are tolerated by local police and politicians .
Church groups are even allowed to build showers and provide services .
Other cities that have allowed these encampments are : Champaign , Illinois ; St. Petersburg , Florida ; Lacey , Washington ; Chattanooga , Tennessee ; Reno , Nevada ; Columbus , Ohio ; Portland , Oregon .
Ventura , California recently changed its laws to allow the homeless to sleep in cars and nearby Santa Barbara has made similar allowances .
In San Diego , California a tent city appears every night in front of the main public library downtown .
California seems to be where most new tent cities are appearing , although many are covert and try to avoid detection .
One that attracted overflowing crowds is in the Los Angeles exurb of Ontario .
The region is called the ‘ Inland Empire ’ and had been booming until recently ; it ’s been hit extremely hard by the wave of foreclosures and mass layoffs .
Ontario is a city of 175,000 residents , so when the homeless population in the tent city exploded past 400 , a residency requirement was created .
Only those born or recently residing in Ontario could stay .
The city provides guards and basic services for those who can legally live there .
Toxic Tour along Highway 99
And so , for all the bravado about the state ’s leading industry [ agriculture ] – about the billions of dollars that it adds to the economy and the miracles of production and technical ingenuity that it has accomplished – California ’s farming is on the way out , as the rising value of its soil produces more in [ real estate ] lot sales than in cotton , cattle , or almonds .
A linear city of shopping malls , housing developments , and office parks spreads from the Bay Area to Sacramento and beyond , and another along Highway 99 from Sacramento to Bakersfield on the east side of the San Joaquin [ Valley ] .
– Gray Brechin , Farewell , Promised Land : Waking from the California Dream
California ’s Central Valley is 720 km long and 80 km wide , sitting between the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range mountains .
Its two main rivers are the Sacramento and the San Joaquin , which run through the northern and southern parts , giving their names to the valley ’s two sections .
The two rivers join in a massive delta that flows into the San Francisco Bay .
It is the most productive agricultural region in the world where , since the 1970s , developers have been paving over fertile soil to build massive tract - style suburban and exurban housing .
For years , the monocultural practices of highly centralised agribusiness have been polluting ecosystems with a toxicity that spreads environmental damage beyond the region .
More recently , the mortgages financing the new homes have become the toxic assets polluting social relations .
In the midst of the world ’s richest farmlands , the Central Valley probably has more foreclosed homes than anywhere else in the world .
Historically , some parts of the Valley have had the lowest wages in the US and some of the highest rates of unemployment outside the Midwestern ‘ Rust Belt ’ .
The Valley competes with the Los Angeles basin for the worst air quality in the US .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , the town of Arvin – immortalised in John Steinbeck ’s Grapes of Wrath for the government - funded migrant workers camp called ‘ Weedpatch ’ – has the dirtiest air in the country .
Interstate 80 is the second - longest highway in the United States , traversing the country from San Francisco in California ’s Bay Area to the suburbs of New York City .
Driving east along Interstate 80 from the Bay Area , chaotic , unplanned suburban sprawl has replaced farmland for nearly all of the 140 km to Sacramento .
There are a few breaks when the terrain is hilly and a few crop fields have survived , but otherwise all you see are longs strips of suburbanity : shopping malls , endless rows of tract homes , automobile and recreational boat dealerships ( many now just empty lots ) , office parks and billboards .
Running south of Sacramento , through the heart of the Central Valley , is Highway 99 .
For decades the towns and cities of the Central Valley have been amongst the fastest growing in the US , and as you drive along the highway you pass through all these places that until recently had all the garish optimism of boom towns .
The first big city you reach after Sacramento is Stockton , home to a deep - water sea port that connects major rivers with the San Joaquin Delta , the Bay and trans -Pacific trade .
In the earlier years of the decade , Stockton was at the centre of the speculative housing bubble .
In 2008 it had the highest rate of foreclosures in the country .
It also has one of the highest unemployment rates and Forbes magazine recently rated it the ‘ most miserable city in the US ’ .
Further south there is more of the same American consumer culture : shopping malls surrounded by massive parking lots and a huge Christian high school in the town of Ripon .
In places railroad tracks and changing yards run alongside 99 , but many of the tall grain silos and food processing facilities have been abandoned .
The next big city is Modesto – the number one city in the US for car thefts and number five on Forbes ’ ‘ most miserable ’ list .
Here the fertile farmland has been concreted over to build ‘ affordable ’ housing for commuters , some of whom endure a two - hour each - way drive to the Bay Area .
Continuing south through Merced – with the second highest ‘ official ’ unemployment rate of any US city – there ’s yet more malls and chain stores , but also reminders of the agricultural industry : a few orchards and livestock pens along the highway , as well as dealers in tractors and other farm machinery .
You can also see the plentiful irrigation canals that move water from the wet north to the Valley ’s dry southern end .
What is striking is how much of the industrial and agricultural infrastructure appears to be rusting away .
Many plants display huge ‘ For Sale ’ signs .
Two hundred and seventy kilometres south of Sacramento , you reach Fresno , California ’s fifth largest city , with a population of half a million .
Fresno is the hub of the San Joaquin portion of the valley and it always seems to be in a haze of brown smog , especially during the stiflingly hot summer months .
It is the ‘ asthma capital of California ’ , a result not only of vehicle and industrial pollution , but also the airborne pesticides and other toxic chemicals used in agriculture .
Fresno County is the most productive and profitable agricultural county in the US .
Until recently it was also home to three large downtown tent cities , as well as other smaller encampments scattered throughout the city and along the highways .
The first tent city , on Union Pacific railroad property , was evicted in July 2009 .
It was literally toxic : sludge was discovered oozing out of holes in the ground in the summer of 2008 , possibly due to the site ’s previous use for vehicle repair .
‘ New Jack City ’ – after the 1991 film about violent crack - dealing urban gangs – earned its name because two murders have already occurred there .
The third tent city is more like a shantytown because many of the living spaces are built with scavenged wood .
It is called ‘ Taco Flats ’ or ‘ Little Tijuana ’ because of its many Latino residents .
These are mostly migrant agricultural labourers , unemployed because of the economic crisis and because a three - year drought has severely reduced the number of crops being planted .
Farm work has always been seasonal and unstable , and it has relied on migrant labour since the Gold Rush of 1849 .
Right now 92 % of agricultural workers are immigrants .
Chinese workers – often derogatorily referred to as ‘ Coolies ’ – were brought in to build the railroads .
Once the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 , they worked in mining until racism and declining yields drove them off .
Many ended up labouring in the fields until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 , which prevented further immigration , and also resulted in many Chinese being driven out of rural areas and into urban ghettos .
Growers then turned to Japanese , Filipino , Armenian , Italian and Portuguese immigrants , as well as Sikhs from the Punjab region and beyond .
During the Great Depression of the 1930s they employed ‘ Okie ’ and ‘ Arkie ’ refugees from the Dust Bowl – native - born white migrants , mostly former sharecropper or tenant farmers from Oklahoma and Arkansas .
Mexican immigrants have also been used for this work and they , along with Central Americans , have become the overwhelming majority of agricultural workers today .
One Big Union
Fresno also has a history of struggle .
It ’s where the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW or ‘ Wobblies ’ ) waged a successful six - month Free Speech Fight in 1910 – 11 .
The battle attracted several hundred Wobblies and other migratory workers from up and down the West Coast to support the right to organise on public streets and to ‘ soapbox ’ .
The guiding force was IWW organiser Frank Little , who arrived from a free speech fight in the agricultural area around Spokane , Washington .
( Little , who was half - Indian , was lynched in Butte , Montana in 1917 , whilst helping organise a copper workers ’ strike and arguing that working men should refuse to fight a World War on behalf of their oppressors . )
At the time , Fresno called itself the ‘ Raisin Capital of the World ’ and at the end of each summer , 5,000 Japanese workers and another 3,000 hobos would arrive in Fresno for the grape harvest .
Much like the tent cities today , workers camped out downtown and looked for work in what was known as the ‘ slave market ’ .
The Japanese were often very united and willing to strike for higher wages and better conditions .
Knowing that the IWW tried to organise all workers , regardless of race , nationality , ethnicity , gender or sector , the local elites were terrified that the Japanese might align themselves with the IWW .
They resorted to violent harassment and mass arrests of IWW soapbox orators , frequently using vigilantes .
The struggle continued in the courtroom where the Wobblies took up as much time as possible , seeking to make their trials political and agitating for class struggle .
This fight for free speech was victorious , although its main effect was Fresno ’s political leaders and local farm owners becoming more tolerant of the conservative American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) and its attempts to organise farm workers .
The next major IWW confrontation took place in 1913 , in the Sacramento Valley ’s hop - growing region .
The Durst Hop Ranch in Wheatland advertised in newspapers throughout California the need for 2,700 workers .
In fact they needed only 1,500 .
The intention was to create a surplus of workers to push down wages .
The advertisements eventually drew 2,800 workers of 24 ethnicities , speaking two - dozen languages .
It was extremely hot , there was no clean water and there were only nine outdoor toilets .
People had to sleep in the fields if they did not want to pay Durst for a tent and , without clean drinking water , the only alternative was paying Durst ’s cousin five cents for lemonade .
Stores in town were forbidden to come to the ranch to sell to the workers , forcing them to buy supplies at Durst ’s own store .
With no garbage removal or sanitation , many workers became sick .
Durst withheld 10 % of wages until the end of the harvest , hoping that the filthy conditions would drive many to leave without collecting them .
A hundred or so of the men had some connection to the IWW and they quickly called a meeting , more to discuss the deplorable living conditions than the pitiful wages .
About 2,000 people gathered to hear the Wobbly organisers speak , but the meeting was broken up by the sheriff and his men .
Four people were killed in the resulting riot , two workers and two from the sheriff ’s posse .
Most of workers fled the Durst Ranch and scattered .
A reign of terror then began .
All over California radicals were targeted in the hunt for the Wobblies judged responsible for inciting the riot .
But the state ’s investigation of the unhealthy conditions at the ranch that followed led to new laws to improve the living conditions of agricultural workers .
Even so , fifty years later almost nothing had changed concerning the creation of a ‘ reserve army of labour ’ , or the use of racism to keep workers divided and weak .
The appalling conditions under which workers continued to labour , as many still do today , encouraged Cesar Chavez to lead a farm worker organising drive in Delano in the San Joaquin Valley in the 1960s .
It resulted in the formation of the United Farm Workers union .
Gold , green gold , black gold : California ’s capitalist development
Gold was discovered in California in 1848 .
The Central Valley grew with the rest of the state as capitalism appeared seemingly out of nowhere , practically overnight .
California gold enabled the world economy to recover during the age of revolution in Europe and it fired the rapid urban industrial expansion across the United States .
The San Francisco Bay Area became one of the most dynamic regions of capitalist accumulation in the late 19th Century , a role that the area of Southern California around Los Angeles continued to play throughout the 20th .
California ’s later expansion was based on ‘ green and black gold ’ : agricultural commodities and oil .
From the early 20th Century , several counties in California began to lead the US in the production of both .
Agriculture is much like any other form of capitalist production .
With increasing mechanisation , the concentration of capital and centralisation of production ( and now with the use of genetically modified crops ) , higher yields can be achieved with fewer workers , who labour on a smaller number of larger farms .
California ’s Central Valley was the first region in the US to develop this system of industrial agriculture on a mass scale : agribusiness .
As capital tightened its control of farm work – in a move from its ‘ formal ’ to ‘ real ’ domination over labour – the resulting highly productive agricultural sector was able to take advantage of advances in transportation to sell its products on the world market .
This in turn threw weaker producers into crisis .
In Europe , millions of peasants were driven off the land , and many were forced to emigrate to places like the US .
Globally , cheaper food meant workers could feed themselves and their families more cheaply , allowing wages to fall , even as working class living standards – in some countries – rose .
The novel The Octopus : A California Story , by Frank Norris , paints a vivid picture of this process of the proletarianisation of the Central Valley ’s agricultural labour force in the 1880s .
A generation later , John Steinbeck described the completion of the process in The Grapes of Wrath , as internal migrants – the dust bowl refugees – trekked from Oklahoma to the Central Valley during the Great Depression seeking work .
This agribusiness system of market - driven , centralised production resulted in the violent and brutal industrial exploitation of agricultural workers .
These conditions are still apparent today , as an army of mostly Mexican and Central American farm and ranch workers roam throughout California toiling for low wages and under equally precarious conditions .
The main difference is that the increasing reliance on petrochemicals in agriculture exposes farm workers to a wider variety of deadly toxins .
Water has become a commodity critical for California ’s development .
Most rain falls in the state ’s northern part , but 80 % of the agricultural and urban demand is in the south .
An enormous , now creaking infrastructure of interconnected canals , dams , reservoirs and pumps moves water from sea level in the north to an elevation of 150 m in the south , allowing vegetables , fruit and nuts to be grown in the San Joaquin Valley .
But California ’s development has always been rooted in an ideology of endless growth and the idea that soil is real estate .
From the 1980s onwards , water distribution across the state has become more deregulated , whilst influence over the bureaucracies managing water has shifted from agribusiness to property developers .
As farmland has been paved over , water once used to irrigate crops has become available to property developments as far afield as Orange County in southern California , Las Vegas in Nevada and Phoenix , more than 1,000 km away , in Arizona ’s rapidly developing sunbelt .
Water , freed from its obligations to Central Valley agribusiness , was part of the fuel that fired the massive housing boom throughout California and the south - western US .
But as demand for water outstripped supply , the conditions for future droughts were created .
At the same time as much farmland has made way for development , other farms and ranches have centralised and concentrated even more as they have shifted to a narrower range of more lucrative cash crops and livestock production .
Between 1996 and 2006 , dairy production increased by 72 % and almond acreage by 127 % .
An amazing 80 % of the world ’s almond crop comes from 250,000 hectares of orchards in the Central Valley .
This form of monoculture has its toxic effects .
There are simply not enough bees in the Valley to pollinate all the almond trees , so over 40 billion of them are brought in for the three weeks the trees are in bloom in February : some are trucked all the way along Interstate 80 from New England and others are flown from as far away as Australia .
En route the bees are fed what amounts to insect junk food : high - fructose corn syrup and flower pollen imported from China , causing Colony Collapse Disorder .
As many as 80 % of bees have left their hives , never to return .
Since bees pollinate nearly two - thirds of plants that end up as food , this could have disastrous consequences for humans .
The ‘ rationalisation ’ of agriculture , coupled with property development , has already had disastrous consequences for humans in Mendota , a town 50 km due west of Fresno .
Mendota ’s population is just under 10,000 ; 95 % of its residents are Latino and most work in agriculture .
Mendota claims to be the ‘ cantaloupe capital of the world ’ , but the crop requires irrigation and the drought has prevented planting , putting many people out of work .
The town now has a second title as the ‘ unemployment capital of California ’ , with a 41 % jobless rate .
As alcoholism runs rampant and the social fabric breaks down , the nearby Mendota Federal Prison offers one of only a few future employment possibilities .
Budget problems mean the prison is currently only 40 % finished , but President Obama has pledged $ 49 million of stimulus money towards its completion .
Once built , it should provide 350 jobs .
Prisons are a growth industry in California , where one in six prisoners is serving a life sentence .
At the end of the 19th Century , oil was discovered in Kern County , in the southern , San Joaquin part of the Central Valley .
Kern County contains three of the US ’ five largest oil fields .
With all the refineries in the area adding to the toxic mix , the air is heavy with ozone and other forms of particle pollution .
Exposure to industrial chemicals , especially in the workplace , is listed in various reports as a major cause of toxicity in the region .
Women ’s Health magazine listed Bakersfield , the County seat , as the country ’s most unhealthy city for women .
This southern end of the Valley was merely a desert until the irrigation projects brought water .
But the soil also contained salt and alkalis from an ancient seabed .
A plan was devised for a master drain through the centre of the Valley that would dump these wastes in the San Francisco Bay from which they could be flushed out into the Pacific Ocean .
Environmental protests prevented the completion of the project and the drain instead ended up dumping into the Kesterson Reservoir , site of a refuge for migratory birds .
In the early 1980s , birds began to die in large numbers , chicks were born with deformities and cattle grazing nearby became sick .
The cause was discovered to be selenium , a naturally occurring trace element common to desert soil , toxic in high concentrations .
The area became another human - made toxic hotspot , the reservoir was drained and capped with soil , and the wildlife sanctuary closed .
But the poisoning of land , people and animals is not limited to mistakes like Kesterson .
Concentrated , high - yield farming is chemical - intensive .
A result of this is rapid soil - depletion , salinisation , desertification and outright toxic contamination – by metals such as lead , and salts like selenium .
These chemicals include carcinogens that cause cancer , teratogens that cause birth defects and mutagens that cause genetic changes .
In 1988 , the United Farm Workers union demanded that five toxic pesticides used by grape growers – dinoseb , methyl bromide , parathion , phosdrin and captan – be banned .
Toxic housing , toxic self - medication
California ’s housing boom , like that of the US more generally , was fuelled by the creation of collateralised debt obligations ( CDOs ) that were based on readily available subprime and other risky mortgages .
CDOs rapidly became ‘ toxic assets ’ when the bubble burst .
The notion of ‘ toxic assets ’ is of course something of a metaphor , but the housing boom created hundreds of thousand of homes that are literally toxic .
It began with the confluence of the national housing boom and the rebuilding of New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana , Florida and Texas in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
Massive quantities of drywall – also known as plasterboard or gypsum board – were needed .
Builders , especially developers of large - scale housing tracts like Lennar Corporation , the second biggest home - builder in the US , imported 250,000 tons from China .
Although this Chinese drywall mostly ended up in Florida and Louisiana , much of it also found its way into Central Valley developments .
The material gives off carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide , which corrode copper pipes , electrical wiring and appliances like air conditioners .
Worse still , people have suffered nosebleeds and rashes , whilst children have been afflicted by ear and respiratory infections .
Owners wishing to sell these toxic new homes are legally required to reveal that they have Chinese drywall , resulting in house prices falling as low as $ 19,000 .
Some of the bigger builders , like Lennar , are ripping out the drywall and repairing some of the homes they built .
But others have gone bankrupt , or are on the verge of collapse , and have done nothing .
Most banks have refused to renegotiate or adjust loans on these toxic homes , leaving their buyers trapped .
Beyond these doubly toxic walls lie the Fresno tent cities , which are plagued by a high level of drug use , particularly methamphetamine , commonly called ‘ meth ’ or ‘ crystal meth ’ .
Across the working class areas of Fresno , the use of this addictive psychostimulant drug has been defined by local health workers as having reached ‘ epidemic ’ proportions .
The Central Valley was the birthplace of the modern illicit form of this drug , originally produced and distributed by biker - gangs like the Hell ’s Angels .
The biker drug networks were mostly broken by the police in the early 1990s , only to be replaced by Mexican drug cartels using even more rationalised international systems of production and distribution .
The Central Valley around Fresno is key to meth production not only because of the large - scale operators , but also the tens of thousand of smaller producers , all of whom use the rural setting to operate clandestine labs and super - labs on farms and ranches .
The plague of this commodity of immiseration is growing across the US .
As social order breaks down due to the crisis , many turn to self - medicating themselves with this toxic substance .
Social problems in the Central Valley once again attracted international media attention in August 2009 , when the BBC aired the documentary , The City Addicted to Crystal Meth .
Filmed in Fresno , it details how social breakdown has been accelerated both by the urban sprawl during the housing bubble and by the unemployment and mass foreclosures that have accompanied its inevitable collapse .
The resulting desperation spread meth to the working class beyond the Central Valley , making it one of the most popularly abused drugs in the world today .
The documentary features meth - users decrying ‘ cookers ’ , those who actually mix the toxic chemicals to produce the drug , as being ‘ brain damaged ’ .
Meanwhile , many admit their own brains have been damaged by use of the drug which is sometimes consumed by those as young as 11 .
Some families contain multigenerational users , and many have been destroyed with increased incidences of domestic violence , incarceration and premature death .
The chemicals used to produce meth are not only highly toxic , but highly flammable too .
Many meth labs have exploded as a result , killing the cookers and burning down nearby buildings .
Some cookers produce meth on the run and have ended up burning down whole motels when their rooms have exploded due to inadequate ventilation .
Beyond its immediate costs , one of the worst aspects of the manufacture of methamphetamines is the waste .
Each kilogram of meth produced results in five to seven kilos of waste .
Inevitably , this frequently gets dumped in remote rural areas , such as the parks and forests in the foothills enclosing the Central Valley .
An image from our future ?
Commonplace though it may be : the economic crisis is global .
So why focus on California ’s Central Valley ?
Because , to return to Marx , ‘ [t ] he country that is more developed industrially only shows , to the less developed , the image of its own future . ’
Because the upheaval most shamelessly caused by capitalist development in California has continued unabated , perhaps even gaining speed .
Because the wasteland of devastated eco-systems and toxic lives that we encounter there , where capitalism has contaminated every aspect of human social relations it has touched , may be what lies in store for all of us .
In the Preface to the first German edition of Capital in 1867 , Marx suggests we observe ‘ phenomena where they occur in their most typical form ’ .
In his day that meant ‘ production and exchange ’ and the conditions of ‘ industrial and agricultural labourers ’ in England .
If we do this , he said we can confront those who say that in their own country ‘ things are not nearly so bad ’ .
In our day , the United States – particularly California – has replaced England as the world ’s most advanced capitalist economy .
Here we see that violent exploitation of humans is linked to the abusive treatment of the land .
That toxic housing , toxic mortgages and the abuse of toxic drugs complement each other .
And , in almost impossibly rarified form : the full irrationality of toxic capitalist social relations .

Recently I lost someone very close to me and it becomes very real that you need to make a plan for your family in order to de-vest yourself of your assets and the other things important to you .
Funeral ?
How to we access the bank accounts not held with your spouse ?
Who gets the jewelry , beach house , etc . ?
These are all questions that need to be answered before you pass .
Unfortunately the result of not having an estate plan , all of those items go to the court .
The court then can charge you a statutory fee , which is a percentage of the total estate , and make decision for your family !
No one wants that .
While setting up your estate plan , it is important to have a living trust , that you can make changes to while you are alive .
It is important to have a will .
That way the state or county wo n’t know what your estate looks like .
The will puts items into the trust .
The trust are all the secret or important items that you want your family or trustees know .
Another important part of an estate plan is the durable powers of attorney .
You have heard of health care power of attorneys and how the doctor needs a copy .
Keep in mind , if you are not married to your significant other or do n’t have the best family relationship , it might not be in your best interest for that person to make decisions on your behalf while you are incapacitated .
family member .
If you do n’t have a durable power people can make decisions for you .
That can also apply to financial matters .
Also , do n’t be afraid that once you sign one , everyone can take over your life .

CONGRESS MOVES TO CONTROL ALL U.S. WATER

Conservatives are warning Americans about the ambitions of federal lawmakers to control all waters within the United States including those on private property , in the latest power grab by progressive politicians .
According to the American Land Rights Association , the Obama Administration and Congress are attempting to pass the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2009 ( S787 ) that would amend the 1972 Clean Water Act and replace the words " navigable waters " with " waters of the United States . "
" The US Constitution 's Tenth Amendment automatically reserves power for controlling waters to the states , not to the Oval Office and US Congress , " said political strategist Mike Baker .
" This is just one more power grab by out - of - control politicians who only adhere to constitutional law when it suits them , " he added .
Section 3 , Paragraph 8 stipulates that " this Act will treat , as ‘ waters of the United States ’ , those features that were treated as such pursuant to the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps of Engineers in existence before the dates of the decisions referred to in paragraph ( 10 ) , including --
( A ) all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide ;
( B ) all interstate waters , including interstate wetlands ;
( C ) all other waters , such as intrastate lakes , rivers , streams ( including intermittent streams ) , mudflats , sandflats , wetlands , sloughs , prairie potholes , wet meadows , playa lakes , or natural ponds ;
( D ) all impoundments of waters of the United States ;
( E ) tributaries of the aforementioned waters ;
( F ) the territorial seas ;
( G ) wetlands adjacent to the aforementioned waters . "

After being overuled by the U. S. Supreme Court in two recent decisions that the words " navigable waters " in the Clean Water Act limited federal agencies to regulation of navigable waters only , Democrats and liberal Republicans in Congress are striking back .
They are attempting to pass the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2009 ( S 787 ) that would amend the 1972 Clean Water Act and replace the words " navigable waters " with " waters of the United States . "
" The bill also defines " waters of the United States " with such breathtaking scope that federal agencies would be required to regulate use of every square inch of the U.S. , both public and private , " according to the American Land Rights Association .
" Obviously , those behind this legislation have only contempt for the Constitution , limited government and private property rights .
To understand what the framers of the Constitution intended , one need only look to their writings and the writings of those from whom they took wisdom and direction , " said officials at ALRA .
" This is a terrible bill that would give the Federal government jurisdiction over anything that is wet including seasonal mud flats .
This means that the Feds could enter your property and dictate what you can do with bodies of water on your land , " said political strategist Mike Baker .
" It also means that the Great Lake States and Provinces could not protect the Great Lakes from being pumped dry to feed the growth of California and the Southwest .
In that area , Democrat Senator Russ Feingold has sold out his own state : Wisconsin . "
" Senate Bill 787 will change federal jurisdiction over “ navigable ” water , to give the federal government control over all water everwhere , in municiple reservoirs , and on private lands , and in private wells .
This bill ignores state water law authority and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , " stated Barbara H. Peterson , a farm lands protection activist .

Earlier Stories :
SAN FRANCISCO – the business building at San Francisco State University has been occupied at approximately 5 to 6 am , Wednesday , December 9th .
( see their site : occupySFSU )
By redefining and reclaiming these spaces , we expose the true violent nature of our society .
After escalated police violence on the UC campuses in Los Angeles and Berkeley , student occupiers rightly proclaimed that “ behind every fee increase , a line of riot police . ”
In this structure , the Business Building of San Francisco State University , usually occupied by financial advisors for war - profiteering companies , there is no business as usual .
Outside , the invisible hand of the market is holding a gun , revealing itself to us with a badge emblazoned “ UPD ” .
The act of occupation is violent because it is a threat ; we are not those who wield weapons , we are not those who possess the means to subordinate people to not just physical violence , but the psychological violence that disempowers us to believe that we do not have the power to resist and fight back .

Posted by John , December 28th , 2009 - under Tony Blair , War crimes .
Tony Blair finally admitted recently what millions of people in the anti-war movement have known for years – that he was intent on going to war in Iraq whether the country posed a threat or not .
Fern Britton asked Blair in a BBC TV interview , “ If you had known then that there were no WMDs [ weapons of mass destruction ] , would you still have gone on ? ”
Blair replied , “ I would still have thought it right to remove him [ Saddam Hussein ] ” .
He added , “ I mean obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments about the nature of the threat . ”
Blair ’s confession that he wanted “ regime change ” has provoked outrage .
Even Sir Ken MacDonald , the former director of public prosecutions , wrote after seeing the interview , “ The degree of deceit involved in our decision to go to war on Iraq becomes steadily clearer .
“ This was a foreign policy disgrace of epic proportions , and playing footsie on Sunday morning television does nothing to repair the damage .
“ It is now very difficult to avoid the conclusion that Tony Blair engaged in an alarming subterfuge with his partner , George Bush .
“ He went on to mislead and cajole the British people into a deadly war they had made perfectly clear they did n’t want , and on a basis that it ’s increasingly hard to believe even he found truly credible . ”
The interview came before Blair was due to appear at the official inquiry into the Iraq war .
Sir John Chilcot , the inquiry ’s chair , has said that Blair will give evidence in public , except when national security matters are being discussed or if appearing would present a danger to his health or security .
But this offers Blair an opportunity to ensure the bulk of his evidence will be heard in private .
We will not be told what questions the inquiry asks and whether it challenges Blair on the question of war crimes .
It is against international law to attack a country on the basis of regime change .
Millions of people took to the streets of London and other cities across the world in 2003 against Bush and Blair ’s plans .
Protesters argued that there was no truth to the claims about Iraq ’s WMD , and that it was a war for US power and control of oil .
But Bush and Blair did not care about the truth .
Now Blair has admitted that different arguments should have been used but the outcome would have been the same – regime change and the deaths of over one million Iraqis .
For the millions who opposed the war , Blair ’s words offer no satisfaction – only more anger at the lies we were told .
The car and suicide bomb attacks that rocked Baghdad last week , killing 123 people and injuring 500 , are the bloody legacy of the war and occupation .
The Stop the War Coalition is calling for the Iraq inquiry to declare Tony Blair guilty of war crimes and send him to The Hague for trial .
Lindsey German , the convenor of Stop the War , said , “ If Tony Blair repeats his confession of war crimes to the Iraq inquiry , it will have no alternative but to recommend that legal proceedings be taken against him .
“ Not to do so will confirm what many people suspect – that Sir John Chilcot ’s committee was handpicked by Gordon Brown with the clear intention of whitewashing war crimes . ”

“ Leaders do n’t create followers , they create more leaders . ”
~ Tom Peters
Sometimes , the greatest lessons taught by our fathers are those that they never so much as mention .
Growing up , I understood my father only as a man known for his business accomplishments : a leader of convention , an attorney and small business owner whose law firm had earned a respected reputation ; and who had worked alongside important state officials , unions , and municipalities for decades .
Traits We Inherit
In my youth , I understood my father , the attorney , to be an indistinguishable part of who my father was as a dad at home .
I connected his distinguished , structured style of teaching my siblings and me as no different from the way in which he would formulate an argument in court .
He would often teach us lessons like , “ You can not judge your actions on the basis of what others do or do n’t do , ” and “ The ways the world works can not be separated into black and white . ”
I concluded that these parenting lessons were nothing more than results of his years of experience with the complexities of practicing law .
In many ways , they were .
But , all the while , my father was teaching me a great lesson that I would not come to realize for decades .
Remarkably , this lesson was never so much as spoken .
I ’ve only come to understand it now , after having realized that I inherited this quality from him as much as I have any physical characteristic or personality trait .
The unspoken lesson that my father taught me was by his quiet example as a constant , selfless giver .
A product of my dad ’s immigrant family ’s impoverished history and the family ’s general “ lack ” of everything throughout most of his young life , my father became a quiet giver , one who sought to provide beyond his means and at his inconvenience to both family , friends , and strangers alike .
In his career , giving took the form of upstanding moral integrity and public service as an attorney .
Much of his giving , I ’ve realized , has been often without reason and without purpose .
But thankfully , it has also been without limitation .
Giving Beyond One ’s Means , and at One ’s Inconvenience
As if to counterbalance the utter deficit of material and emotional comfort that he had growing up , my father has strived to provide a surplus of both forms of comforts to his family and friends : to always open his home to others without question ; to grant the foremost opportunities for his children through the best schooling and college education that he could afford ; to provide an unquestionable amount of moral support and encouragement ; to provide the means to alleviate any possible financial burden that might fall upon us ; and truly , to allow us the means to follow our hearts and pursue our most sincere passions in life .
After years of witnessing his quiet but persistent giving , something dawned upon me : my own will to give beyond my means and at my inconvenience was a trait I inherited from my father , like any other .
My father ’s quiet example was a subtle side to him that I had felt and witnessed all of my life .
But because this side to him was never advertised , discussed , or iterated , I emulated his example without so much as ever realizing it .
And so it became as much a part of me as any other inherited quality .
My father , I now realize , has not been just a leader of convention as an attorney .
He is also — and , perhaps , more importantly — a quiet leader who teaches by loving example .
Whether he knew it or not , his quiet leadership was an integral component of his fatherhood and influenced his children perhaps more notably than any spoken lesson that I can recall .
Teaching by Quiet Example
The dualistic nature of his fatherhood is an integral component of teaching by example : on the one hand , to lead by traditional fatherly example , and on the other , by being a living example of an individual who his children naturally want to emulate .
Sons inherit much from their fathers .
Physical characteristics , like body type and eye color , are easy to recognize .
Personality traits , like one ’s sense of humor , can be measured in laughter .
But a quiet life lesson like the one taught by my father to be a constant giver and to give beyond one ’s means and at one ’s inconvenience — a lesson that was never spoken , and taught only by quiet example — can only be measured by the extent that others feel it , and oftentimes , never realize it .

The woman was attacked as she ate with her family at Frankie and Benny 's A teenager who poured bleach over a woman in a Leeds restaurant has been found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm .
The city 's crown court heard Annette Warden had earlier asked the boy to be quiet as she watched a Harry Potter film with her family at the cinema .
The 16 - year - old had admitted causing actual bodily harm but a jury found him guilty of the more serious charge .
The case was adjourned for sentencing on 11 January .
Mrs Warden , 46 , had to be treated in hospital after the attack , although she was not seriously injured .
This was a cruel and cowardly attack on a mother enjoying a Sunday evening out with her family
Insp Richard Baildon
The court had been told she was having a meal with her husband and two children on 26 July this year when she was attacked at the Frankie and Benny 's restaurant , near the cinema .
The family , from Leeds , had earlier been watching Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince at the Vue cinema , in the city 's Kirkstall Road , when they had been disturbed by a group of youths .
The jury heard the teenagers ' phones kept going off and they were being noisy , so Mrs Warden asked them to be quiet before calling for a member of staff .
Later , as the family went into the nearby restaurant , the defendant leaned out of a car and swore at the woman .
' Mentally scarred '
The court heard he then went to a service station and bought a bottle of bleach .
The family had been watching a Harry Potter film at the cinema
He was driven back to the leisure complex , went into the restaurant and squirted the liquid on to the top of Mrs Warden 's head .
The liquid ran on to her face and she had to be treated with saline solution at hospital .
The defendant , who can not be named for legal reasons , denied trying to cause her serious injury and told the court he only wanted to " show up " the woman .
In a statement read to the court , Mrs Warden said : " I was terrified and at the same time scared for my children . "
She said : " [ The bleach ] kept coming and fell all down the right side of my face and into my eyes . "
Insp Richard Baildon said Mrs Warden and her family had been left " mentally scarred " by the incident .
He said : " This was a cruel and cowardly attack on a mother enjoying a Sunday evening out with her family who simply asked a rowdy group of youths to be quiet during a film .
" That is something most of us would have done without expecting it to result in the truly appalling actions that followed . "

First , I want to express my gratitude to Demitry .
I remember aksing him for such a post a long time ago .
I understand that we all have lot of things to do besides our online life , so I understood when the reply did n’t come .
I often find myself lost in the amount of comments , emails and various posts .
Very hard to keep up with everything .
But it sure was a wonderful surprise to receive your email Dimitry , so thank you very much for writing it .
It ’s an extra effort for us non English speakers , so the merit is even greater .
The article is long and worth reading in detail , but I also wanted to write down the main points I found , most of which I share and agree with 100 % :
In spite of different cultures and lifestyles , during hard times .
I ca n’t avoid but notice more similarities than differences , no matter if its USA , South Africa , Spain during the 1930 ’s or Russia .
Guess that after all , we are all people .
That should n’t be a big surprise .
:-) great political struggles ( for whatever reason , and any excuse is good ) and meanwhile the average citizen , the average Joe that just wants to be left a lone and live a good life , care for his family is caught in between fighting to carry on .of course , are of the greatest importance .
Along with breathable air constitutes the 4 pilars needed to sustain life no matter what .
Most often it seems , food is the one that is hardest to obtain during most events .
but having a weapon as a last resort mean of self defense .
As Dimitry said , something you can actually conceal to keep a low profile is of great importance .
If nothing else ( and respect the laws that apply to you ! ) sawing off the barrel and stock of a shotgun at least gives you short range , two shot handgun .
Again , not legal to do in most places so do n’t do it .
Just noticing the importance in concealabilty , be thankful of your Glock !
Besides good security habits and measures , the importance of a solid building that can actually stop bullets and also the importance of a GOOD DOOR , make mine armored and reinforced , locking on all 4 sides on a concrete and metal frame .
The different routes , what kind of trouble ou can expect in the various areas and neighborhoods , what kind of supplies are available in which area .
At least know where the black markets operate , in case you do n’t have any other choice but to do business there .
How to get in and out of it , alternative routes , where to hide , where you have friends you can stay at .
If you have one , do n’t count on a GPS alone .
I always have a small “ Guia T ” with me , it ’s a very popular miniguide with maps , buss stations and other relevant information , also the streets where each bus goes through , their route .
It seems Dimitry considers this important as well .
No cammo or military uniforms .
Comfortable , dark colored civilian clothes .
Expect lots of roadblocks .
Expect not to be able to use your can in some cases .
Folks , that means you should ask yourself :
Am I in proper physical condition to grab a back pack , may a baby as well , and walk for several miles ?
Do I have the gear and supplies to do so in my vehicle in case that happens ?
Talking about a “ bug out ” bag , or other emergency kit being in your vehicle at all times .
( there ’s a post on that , check on the left column ) Have them ready at all times !
Ready if you have to leave your home in just a second .
Know exactly where they are .
( I ’m suffering the passport problem myself here , corrupt gov . that wont issue it unless you pay a hefty bribe ) I would n’t keep them in my pocket because of the crime problem .
I keep my ID safe at home and only keep a ID car in my wallet at all times .
A passport is too important to risk it getting robbed .
I got by without one myself but the advice is valid .
Notice : A SMALL , PORTABLE generator , not something you bought at a power plant auction and uses more fuel than 10 Mac trucks put together .
Also remember , LED lights , batteries , chargers , a spare solar charger or crank operated one is worth having .
If you buy one , buy the good stuff since the cheapo ones are mostly junk .
During a civil war or dictatorship , expect TV and radio to be either canceled or censored .
Cell phones and internet service cancelled too .
Better to have satellite phone or internet , battery operated short wave radio or transiver to gather news for further away .
Get a good multifuel stove that runs on any liquid fuel .
Get one that is n’t too sensitive since the fuel you get may be dirty or of bad quality .
( same applies to your car , I change my gas filter often because the fuel quality here in Argentina is n’t very good ) Dimitry worte “ Each day begins with the new prices . ”
Man , I feel you .
I understand your words 100 % .
Seeing prices change within minutes , clerks running around sticking new prices into everything is n’t something you forget easily .
Gold and silver , Dimitry recommends 25 % of your savings in gold , 25 % in Euro or dollars .
Euro and dollars are much tougher as of today , compared to lesser currencies like the one Dimitry had or our Argentine peso so we do that too here .
Dimitry gives some good links to check .
Also check the post here in my blog about Architecture ( look in the Topics of the left column ) the one where the ex Yugoslavia survivors talk about their ideal home .
Dimitry , the Lada Niva is also very popular here in Argentina too !
Lots of Lada Niva fan clubs doing 4x4 .
The LADA is liked here because of those same reasons you mention .
My car looks also pretty bad on the outside ( lots of bumbs , tape holding the front plastic fender ) looks poor but works ok ! :-)

Sen .
Max Baucus recently acknowledged his relationship with Melodee Hanes , whom he nominated for the job of U.S. attorney in Montana , after it was first reported on the website MainJustice.com Baucus gave girlfriend $ 14 K raise
Sen . Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee , gave a nearly $ 14,000 pay raise to a female staffer in 2008 , at the time he was becoming romantically involved with her , and later that year took her on a taxpayer - funded trip to Southeast Asia and the Middle East , though foreign policy was not her specialty .
Late last Friday , Baucus acknowledged his relationship with Melodee Hanes , whom he nominated for the job of U.S. attorney in Montana , after it was first reported on the website MainJustice.com .
But he said that Hanes withdrew from consideration for the job when the relationship became more serious .
The following day , Baucus dismissed calls for an ethics investigation , saying , “ I went out of my way to be up and up . ”

Since his announcement , more details of the relationship have emerged , raising questions about a workplace romance between a boss and employee that Baucus tried to keep quiet , and apparently contradicting his explanation for why Hanes ’s nomination was withdrawn .
Jodi Rave , a former reporter for the Missoulian revealed over the weekend that the paper informed Baucus in March that it was poised to publish a story about Hanes ’s relationship with the senator and the fact that he had nominated her for the U.S. attorney job .
The next day , Hanes withdrew from consideration .
According to the Missoulian , Baucus ’s office never acknowledged a relationship between the two , and the paper did not run a story .
Baucus ’s office said yesterday that while Baucus was aware of Rave ’s questions , “ there were a number of factors that went into Ms. Hanes ’s decision to withdraw ” from consideration for the U.S. attorney post , including that the couple ’s relationship was “ changing . ”
“ These discussions took place before , though around the same time as , the reporter ’s inquiry , ” Baucus ’ office said in a statement .
“ This , coupled with the fact that they wanted to live together in Washington , led to her withdrawal . ”
Baucus ’ office also defended the salary boost for Hanes , saying it was in line with what his other staffers were receiving at the time , and argued that she played an important role on the international trip she took with Baucus .
Baucus separated from his now - ex - wife , Wanda , in March 2008 and moved out of their home .
Hanes separated from her husband in April 2008 and moved out in early June .
Hanes was divorced from her husband last December , and Baucus was divorced in April 2009 .
They are now living together on Capitol Hill and began dating in the summer of 2008 .
Hanes and other staff received their raises in this time period , according to public documents that show payroll breakdowns in six - month increments .
Baucus insists that Hanes was well - qualified for the prosecutor position , and his office released a lengthy résumé detailing her expertise as a prosecutor and in private practice .
Unlike many private corporations , there are no congressional rules barring a lawmaker from having a romantic liaison with an employee .
In several cases , members have married staffers .
For instance , Rep. Steve LaTourette ( R - Ohio ) became involved with his wife when she was still his chief of staff .
Former Rep. David Bonior ( D - Mich . ) first hired his wife , Judy , as a staffer and later married her .
Former Rep. Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) became involved with a House staffer when he was speaker of the House .
He later divorced his second wife and married the staffer .
Baucus himself was sued by his former chief of staff , Christine Niedermeier , after he fired her , but the case was thrown out on a technicality .
She claimed the senator made unwanted sexual advances , but Baucus vehemently denied the allegation .
Hanes , who worked on Baucus ’s staff as his state director and senior counsel , accompanied him on a taxpayer - funded congressional delegation in late 2008 with other members of the senator ’s staff , a trip first reported by The Hill .
The Baucus group traveled to Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates , at a cost to taxpayers of more than $ 14,000 per person
On Friday , Baucus ’ office said that Hanes traveled in 2007 to Cuba on official travel , months before she and Baucus became romantically involved .
The senator ’s office said the Cuba trip was meant to promote trade issues between Montana and Cuba .
The $ 1,105 cost of Hanes ’ trip was paid for by the Finance Committee .
Baucus was not part of the delegation , which also included representatives from Montana agricultural associations .
The two trips constituted Haynes ’s only official foreign travel during her nearly six years on Baucus ’s payroll .
Baucus ’s office said it was appropriate for Hanes to accompany the senator and other aides to the Montana Democrat on the trip to Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates , even though the couple had begun a romantic relationship .
The office said previous state directors had also gone on official overseas trips , and that the trip resulted in increased collaboration between universities in Montana and Vietnam .
And it released a Jan. 2009 e-mail from an official at the University of Montana praising the senator for the trip , saying it yielded tangible results for the school in boosting educational and cultural exchanges with Asian colleges .
Baucus ’s office also denies giving Hanes any preferential treatment while she was a paid member of his Senate staff .
A Baucus spokesman downplayed the salary hike Hanes received , saying it was in line with what other aides to the senator received during the same period .
Around the time when her relationship with Baucus reportedly “ intensified ” in the summer of 2008 , Hanes ’s salary jumped $ 13,687 , according to public documents covering the April 1 - Sept. 30 , 2008 , period , to among the highest on the senator ’s payroll .
In a statement to POLITICO , Baucus ’s office argued that “ virtually our entire staff ” saw their salaries rise during the period , saying the raise was on a par with the legislative director ’s and less than the chief of staff’s .
“ In fact , during that period , Ms. Hanes ’s salary increased by the exact same amount as our legislative director and less than our chief of staff , ” said a statement from a Baucus spokesman .
Hanes ’s salary did return to a lower level in the following six - month period , Senate records show .
According to Baucus ’s office , she left the staff in May and joined the Justice Department ’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , where she currently works as acting deputy administrator for policy .
The official Street Fighter IV developer 's blog was updated today with some truly beautiful screen captures featuring some new backgrounds .
One of my biggest fears following the initial batch of SSIV screen shots was that Capcom was neglecting to update some of the purely aesthetic aspects of Street Fighter IV .
This new batch of shots has finally put my fears to rest .
These shots , along with the previously revealed construction site and India stages look fantastic .
The two stages shown above appear to be Africa and a new Asian locale .
Here is a good screenshot ( finally ) of the new India stage that was revealed a few weeks ago in a video .
There also appears to be a handful of pics highlighting the updated revenge meter .
Look , it 's clearly a kunai !

Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ( CNN ) -- Cement - block walls are being built around the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro .
Authorities say it's to save rainforests .
The city 's poorest residents say it 's an attempt to shut them out .
When Francisco de Moraes looks at the wall , it angers him .
He has one of the best views of Rio , overlooking the city , its shimmering beaches and Sugarloaf Mountain jutting from the sea .
" We do n't have the right to have our opinion heard , " he said .
He speaks during a break from a soccer game on a makeshift cement field that 's wedged in by the wall .
The " eco-wall , " as officials call it , runs up next to his house and around most of the Santa Marta shantytown where he and about 7,000 others live .
" The state government walled us in , so more houses would n't be built in the forest , " de Moraes said .
" But people felt imprisoned , like they were setting borders and limiting when we could come and go . "
The state of Rio de Janeiro began building the wall around Santa Marta in March , and it plans to spend $ 17 million on similar walls around the shantytowns .
There are nearly 1,000 such favelas -- cramped poor communities built around the city .
The squalid homes tilt from their shaky foundations , some built on top of others .
Many are carved into the humid rainforest that cling to the hillsides .
It 's estimated about 20 percent of Rio's 6 million people live in the shantytowns .
Icaro Moreno , director of Rio state 's public works , says the walls are necessary because the favelas have continued to expand by 7 percent over the last decade , making them one of the biggest causes of deforestation in the state .
" The limits used to be virtual and now they 're physical , " he told reporters at a news conference .
" The government is saying , ' If you cross them or break them , you will be violating public property . ' "
Some residents feel officials are keen to rein in the expansion of Rio's chaotic slums ahead of the 2016 Olympics .
The naked cement and brick homes of the shantytowns can be spotted from beaches .
Locals feel the city 's elite are trying to wall off an eyesore .
Blog : Postcard from Rio's ' pacified ' slum
" They treat the people here like children who need to be corralled in , " said Eliane Lopes , who runs her own party - organizing business in Santa Marta .
" We can respect limits as well as the rich people .
We do n't need a wall . "
Founded by squatters looking for work in the big city , shantytowns like Santa Marta are not even on most maps .
Critics see the wall as a barrier between crime - ridden slums and beachside condos rather than an effort to protect the forest .
But not everyone in Santa Marta opposes the wall .
Jiuzel has lived here for 34 years and he 's seen the population explode in size , more than double what it was in the 1970s .
He says an increased police presence and investments in projects like the wall and a funicular ( cable car on rails ) linking the steep slum to the rest of the city shows that officials are trying to improve their standard of living .
" People are pleased because it 's going to protect the Atlantic Forest .
Protecting the environment is important , " he said from his balcony overlooking the forest .
The Atlantic Forest blanketed much of Brazil 's coast when Portuguese adventurers landed here 500 years ago .
According to experts , the humid rainforest was home to more plant and animal species than the Amazon .
Only 7 percent of the original forest is left .
In Rio , the plan is to build about 9 miles ( 14 km ) of walls around 13 favelas in danger of eroding the jungle further .
Critics have drawn parallels to the Berlin Wall or the barriers that separate Israel from Palestinian territory .
Fernando Gabeira , a senator from Brazil 's Green Party , disagrees .
" This wall is not a wall like the Berlin wall , " he says .
" Everyone may pass .
There is no control trying to avoid people visiting the community or leaving the community . "
But , he says , he recommended introducing a satellite tracking system to prevent the expansion of favelas , instead of building a physical barrier .
" It 's the difference between soft power and hard power . "
NASHVILLE 
Some of the debtors sitting forlornly in this city ’s old stone bankruptcy court have lost a job or gotten divorced .
Others have been summoned to face their creditors because they spent mindlessly beyond their means .
But all too often these days , they are there merely because they , or their children , got sick .
Wes and Katie Covington , from Smyrna , Tenn. , were already in debt from a round of fertility treatments when complications with her pregnancy and surgery on his knee left them with unmanageable bills .
For Christine L. Phillips of Nashville , it was a $ 10,000 trip to the emergency room after a car wreck , on the heels of costly operations to remove a cyst and repair a damaged nerve .
Jodie and Charlie Mullins of Dickson , Tenn. , were making ends meet on his patrolman ’s salary until she developed debilitating back pain that required spinal surgery and forced her to quit nursing school .
As with many medical bankruptcies , they had health insurance but their policy had a $ 3,000 deductible and , to their surprise , covered only 80 percent of their costs .
“ I always promised myself that if I ever got in trouble , I ’d work two jobs to get out of it , ” said Mr. Mullins , a 16 - year veteran of the Dickson police force .
“ But it gets to the point where two or three or four jobs would n’t take care of it .
The bills just were out of sight . ”
The independent voters who powered President Obama and Democrats to victory in 2008 fled to Republicans in Tuesday ’s elections , helping the GOP romp to a ticketwide sweep in Virginia and a stunning victory over an incumbent Democratic governor in New Jersey .
But the night was n’t a total loss for Democrats , as their candidate won a special election to fill an open congressional seat in upstate New York after a bitter civil war left Republicans divided between their party ’s nominee and a Conservative Party candidate .
The seat had been in Republican hands for more than a century .
Nevertheless , in a sign that there ’s more trouble ahead for Democrats , voters in New Jersey and Virginia said they were driven by the economy and spending , and Republicans said their showing on Tuesday gives them momentum heading into the 2010 congressional elections .
Campaigning in Virginia , Republican Robert F. McDonnell said Democrats ’ “ overreach ” in Washington helped boost him to what was a trouncing of Democratic nominee R. Creigh Deeds .
And in New Jersey , Republican Chris Christie unseated the broadly unpopular Gov. Jon Corzine despite being outspent in a solidly blue state .
Mr. Christie said his election was a victory for voters “ who do not want the government to fix every problem . ”
“ Yes , we can , ” the crowd chanted , appropriating Mr. Obama ’s slogan from his campaign as Mr. Christie took the stage .
Mr. Obama won New Jersey , Virginia and New York ’s 23rd Congressional District in 2008 , so Republicans ’ showing Tuesday suggested that the red - to - blue wave that Democrats rode the past two national elections has crested .
Most important , Republicans showed gains among independent and suburban voters who had defected in 2006 and 2008 .
Exit polls showed independents , who made up nearly one - third of voters in both Virginia and New Jersey , went for the Republicans by a margin of nearly 2 - to - 1 .
AP INTERACTIVE : Election 2009 results
It was n’t just independent voters .
Republicans and Democrats alike were eyeing independent and third - party candidates such as Doug Hoffman , the Conservative Party candidate in New York ’s congressional race whom most Republican voters ended up backing .
Meanwhile , in New Jersey independent Chris Daggett siphoned votes from the two major - party candidates .
In New York City , another independent , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , won his third term , though the race was unexpectedly tight .
In Detroit , former basketball star and Washington native David Bing was re-elected to the mayoral post and in Boston , Thomas Menino won his fifth full term .
Other big -city mayor ’s slots up for grabs included Atlanta , Miami and Houston .
Voters in Maine were deciding whether to repeal a law that allows same - sex marriages , and the vote was still close Tuesday night .
Meanwhile , another special congressional election in California was expected to be won by Democrats .
In Virginia ’s governor ’s race , Mr. McDonnell easily topped Mr. Deeds , despite the Democrat bringing moderate stances to the race and repeatedly attacking Mr. McDonnell for being too conservative in a state Democrats had touted as the ultimate “ purple ” state .
The entire Republican ticket ran double digits ahead of Democrats .
“ For those out there who say conservatives can’t win , this rejects that notion .
This is a very conservative ticket , ” said Chris LaCivita , a Republican strategist who helped Virginia candidates this year and will be aiding congressional candidates in the state next year .
“ It ’s proof - positive that solid , committed conservatives can win , and can discuss and talk about issues in a campaign that people care about .
The labeling aspect just is n’t going to work . ”
Mr. Obama won the New York congressional district by five percentage points in 2008 , won Virginia by six percentage points and won New Jersey by 17 points .
But Democrats insisted that Tuesday ’s results were neither a dress rehearsal for 2010 ’s congressional elections nor a referendum on Mr. Obama .
They pointed to exit polls that showed 55 percent of Virginia voters and 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Mr. Obama was n’t a factor .
Democrats pointed to history .
This is the sixth time in a row that Virginia and New Jersey have elected governors of the opposite party of the president .
“ The question on everyone ’s mind will be : ‘ What does this mean ? ’
The answer is simple , ” said Nathan Daschle , executive director of the Democratic Governors Association .
“ Nothing .
The party in the White House has lost these races for 24 straight years , and this election merely continued that streak .
New Jersey and Virginia are independent - minded states , and tonight they reminded us of that . ”
Still , Mr. McDonnell said as he campaigned Tuesday that Democrats ’ “ overreach ” in Washington played a role in boosting him to victory .
In both states , the economy topped the list of top concerns .
In Virginia health care was second , while property taxes was the runner - up in New Jersey .
In the Garden State race , Mr. Christie tried to co-opt Mr. Obama ’s 2008 campaign theme of “ change , ” arriving at a campaign stop Monday in a black tour bus emblazoned with the message “ vote for change . ”
Campaigning across the state , Mr. Christie said that the race was about New Jersey and that it would be up to the White House to figure out what his victory means .
“ Those people in Washington will have to figure that out , ” he said .
Despite Mr. Obama ’s campaigning in New Jersey , Virginia and New York and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s making a last - minute stop in New York , the White House insisted that neither the president ’s agenda nor his political prospects were on the line in those three races .
But press secretary Robert Gibbs did single out the New York congressional election as a worrying sign for Republicans .
Powered by discontent with Republican nominee Dede Scozzafava , Mr. Hoffman , the Conservative Party candidate , surged in the polls , deeply splitting Republican voters in the district and forcing Mrs. Scozzafava to withdraw .
She later endorsed Democrat Bill Owens .
“ I think many in the Republican Party hung out a sign , as you heard people at the White House say this weekend , that moderates need not apply , ” Mr. Gibbs told reporters Tuesday afternoon .
Early Wednesday morning , Mr. Hoffman conceded to Mr. Owens .
Voters in the New York district were irked they had become a national battleground , saying the issues they cared about were jobs and the local military base , not party labels .
But for Republicans in particular , the race became a referendum on the direction of the party .
The Republican Party backed Mrs. Scozzafava as its nominee , but many of the party ’s most recognizable leaders endorsed Mr. Hoffman , and interest groups poured money in to help him .
The Club for Growth , a free - market group in Washington , said it spent more than $ 645,000 in radio and television advertising and its political action committee bundled another $ 376,000 in contributions to Mr. Hoffman ’s campaign treasury .
“ Hopefully , this is an unusual situation , but I think that the Republican Party hopefully will be more careful to pick somebody that has the ideas and values of a real Republican going forward , ” Mr. Hoffman said Tuesday afternoon .
The seat opened up when Mr. Obama tapped Rep. John M. McHugh , a Republican , to become secretary of the Army .
The race was the latest special - election test for Republicans , who have a four - election losing streak in contested special congressional elections dating back to 2008 , when they lost Illinois , Mississippi and Louisiana races .
Earlier this year , they lost a close election in New York ’s 20th District .
The 23rd District race also important because it was one of the last Republican - held districts in New York .
Just two of the state ’s other 28 seats are held by the Republican Party .

news Hangin’ Out at St. Peter’s
Today ’s Metro contains something of a cock - up .
On page 10 of the Toronto edition — distributed in print city - wide and available online , too — there ’s a large Canadian Press photo of several ecstatic young people , credited to one Clifford Skarstedt .
( That ’s the upper half of it , above . )
What ’s remarkable about this photo ?
The caption takes us halfway there : “ St. Peter ’s students … make a splash from their hot tub during the annual Kinsmen Santa Claus Parade in Peterborough , Ont. , on Saturday .
The parade attracted 87 floats and a variety of marching bands . ”
Oh , and the male student is…uh , he appears to have his penis out .
Full photo in context after the fold , with apologies to the respective parties ’ parents .
Names blurred , obviously .
Hat tip to readers Ben Hendry & Sean Avery for the tip .
According to the Catholic school board which represents St. Peter ’s , the photo depicts a current seventeen - year - old student of the school .
While the image as it appeared in Metro does not constitute “ child pornography “ — those depicted are not “ engaged in explicit sexual activity ” nor was the image ’s “ dominant characteristic … the depiction , for a sexual purpose , of a sexual organ ” — we ’ve nonetheless pixellated the point of contention in the photo above .
How can a woman love the man who killed her daughter ?
A mother has married the man who was convicted of torturing her daughter to death .
Andreas B. ( 41 ) , a policeman , was found guilty of beating little Leonie ( † 4 ) to death two years ago .
But the youngster ’s mum Miriam B. ( 32 ) married the killer on Monday while he was on remand in prison in the German state of Lower Saxony .
It was a relatively normal scene - the couple were reportedly caressing and holding each other during the ceremony .
After the horror of her daughter ’s death , it is unimaginable how the mother could decide to marry the man convicted of killing her – but now the couple can saunter off to the trial hand in hand .
How can a woman love a man who killed her daughter ?
Andreas B. was charged with inflicting serious injury resulting in death .
On November 26 2007 , Leonie suffered haemorrhaging in the brain and bruises were found covering her body .
Police reports stated : “ The force of the blow to the child ’s head ripped her jaw muscle .
Five days later the child was badly shaken , which caused the fatal injuries . ”
The first trial sent the would - be stepfather to prison for seven - and - a - half - years , with the judge describing the crime as “ absolutely callous ” .
But Miriam B. stayed by his side .
Together , the couple are seeking to a lighter sentence with a new trial .
The accused denied the charges during the appeal .
And his new wife did not speak , sitting in the back of the courtroom just like a mere onlooker .
In the meantime , the public prosecutor ’s office has charged her with unsworn false testimony and a failure to render assistance .

Freed Hamas MP Hatem Qafisheh ( L ) with parliament speaker Aziz Dweik
Israel has released six members of the Palestinian parliament from jail after holding them for up to three years .
Some of those who were freed , who were members of Hamas , were never charged with an offence .
Israel arrested 45 Hamas MPs in the occupied West Bank after the group 's military wing in Gaza captured Israeli soldier , Gilad Schalit in 2006 .
Israeli officials say the Hamas MPs had completed their prison terms and were not part of a prisoner - swap .
About 20 Palestinian parliamentarians remain in Israeli custody , including at least 15 from Hamas .
Many of them are held under Israeli administrative detention rules , which allow detainees to be held indefinitely without charge .
Hamas won overall control of the Palestinian parliament in the 2006 elections , beating the Fatah party of Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas .
They seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 , while the West Bank has remained under the authority of Mr Abbas .
Mr Abbas has called for fresh elections in January 2010 , but Hamas has warned Gaza residents not to participate .
They say Mr Abbas does not have the authority to call the vote because his presidential term has already ended .
Israel released 20 female Palestinian prisoners in October 2009 in return for video evidence that Gilad Schalit was alive .
CB Richard Ellis has a brand new client : the bankrupt state of California , which is now attempting to sell what is the largest office portfolio currently marketed nationwide , at 8.7 million square feet .
The California Department of General Services has announced CBG has been retained to sell 17 office buildings .
The state is hoping the sale will generate more than $ 660 million in proceeds to offset cuts in the state budget .
With a budgetary hole in the billions , California will likely need to throw in quite a bit of beachfront property in order to make it seem like it has the fiscal catastrophe under control .
BusinessWire reports :
" The Governor was clear that we must re-think how we manage the state ’s real estate .
The awarding of this contract is a significant step forward in DGS ’ effort to carry out that mission , ” said Acting DGS Director Ron Diedrich .
“ We look forward to working with the talented and experienced team that CB Richard Ellis has assembled to seek out the investors worldwide that want to purchase these prime office buildings and allow the state to tap the needed equity . ”
CBRE has already begun marketing the properties to investors in the global capital markets .
The 11 properties range from the 97,000 square foot Judge Joseph A. Rattigan Building in Santa Rosa , to the LEED Gold Certified Capital Area East End Complex in Sacramento and the 24 - story , 863,000 square foot Elihu M. Harris Building in downtown Oakland .
“ We are very pleased to be selected as the State of California ’s advisor on this exciting disposition assignment , ” said Kevin Shannon , CBRE Vice Chairman .
“ This will be the largest office portfolio available for sale in the nation currently .
The offering is ideally suited for what the majority of investment capital is seeking right now which is stable leased product .
We will conduct an expansive global marketing campaign appropriate for this generational acquisition opportunity , and we expect to attract tremendous domestic and international interest . ”
In order to prevent any allegations of impropriety in awarding what would be one of the biggest ever CRE contracts , California conducted a test of 6 brokerage companies .
CBRE earned the contract for the brokerage services with the state after competing alongside five other companies .
Each company was scored in multiple categories including : history of sales over $ 20 million over the past seven years ; sales of at least $ 7.5 million over the last 10 years ; experience of the proposed sales team ; an interview with each bidder ’s sales team ; and the bidder ’s proposal for its percentage of sales compensation .
Commissions for commercial real estate sales range from approximately one - half of one percent for high valued properties to as high as 4 % for smaller valued properties .
Through a very competitive process , all of the proposals received by the State were under one percent and the winning proposal was substantially less than one - half of one percent , representing a good value for the State .
The status of this " exciting " portfolio sale will be closely followed by all who believe the bottom in CRE is still to come .
As a reminder the Department of General Services ( www.dgs.ca.gov) serves as the business manager for the State of California , with more than 4,000 employees and a budget in excess of $ 1 billion .
DGS helps state government better serve the public by providing services to state agencies including innovative procurement and acquisition solutions , creative real estate management , leasing and design services , environmentally friendly transportation , and architectural oversight and innovative funding for the construction of safe schools .
Here is a listing of all the office buildings included in the ongoing disposition .

Chinese Modal Verb Venn Diagram
by John Pasden in personal
I ’m a bit of a sucker for Venn diagrams .
When I was recently asked by a student about the Chinese modal verbs 会 , 能 , and 可以 ( all of which can be translated into English as “ can ” ) , I recalled a nice Venn diagram on the topic and dug it up .
What creates the most confusion with these three modal verbs is not that they can all be translated into “ can ” in English .
The problem is that they are usually explained over - simplistically something like this :
> 会 : know how to
> 能 : be able to
> 可以 : have permission to
This is not a bad start , but this sort of definition is eventually revealed as insufficient to the learner because in usage , the three modal verbs actually overlap .
Enter the Venn diagram .
The image below is a reconstruction of the one on page 95 of Tian Shou - he ’s A Guide to Proper Usage of Spoken Chinese :
> A = ability in the sense of “ know how to ” ( “ 会 ” is more common than “ 能 “ )
> B = permission / request ( use “ 能 ” or “ 可以 “ )
> C = possibility ( use “ 能 ” or “ 可以 “ )
> D = permission not granted ( use “ 不可以 “ )
> E = impossibility ( use “ 不能 “ )
Yeah , grammar needs more Venn diagrams .
Update : I ’ve been informed that this diagram is actually a Euler Diagram .
Oops .
I stand corrected .
I should have read up on the requirements for Venn Diagrams first !
( Hey , some of those extensions are pretty cool ! )

In an historic shift , the country 's largest physician group , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , has reversed its long - held position that marijuana has no medical value .
The group instead adopted a new policy position on medical marijuana , calling for a review of marijuana 's status as a Schedule I drug with no accepted medical use under the federal Controlled Substances Act .
The AMA had previously recommended that marijuana be retained in Schedule I .
The AMA adopted a report drafted by the AMA Council on Science and Public Health ( CSAPH ) entitled , " Use of Cannabis for Medicinal Purposes , " which affirmed the therapeutic benefits of marijuana and called for further research .
" Short term controlled trials indicate that smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain , improves appetite and caloric intake especially in patients with reduced muscle mass , and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis , " the CSAPH report found .
" Our AMA urges that marijuana 's status as a federal Schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid - based medicines , and alternate delivery methods , " the new policy says .
But the AMA goes on to say that it is not endorsing existing state medical marijuana programs .
Laying the groundwork for the AMA 's shift in position was the adoption in June 2008 by the group 's Medical Student Section of a resolution supporting reclassification of marijuana .
Leading that effort was University of Washington medical student Sunil Aggarwal , who also played a role as a reviewer of the CSAPH report .
" It 's been 72 years since the AMA has officially recognized that marijuana has both already - demonstrated and future - promising medical utility , " said Aggarwal .
" The AMA has written an extensive , well - documented , evidence - based report that they are seeking to publish in a peer - reviewed journal that will help to educate the medical community about the scientific basis of botanical cannabis - based medicines . "
" This shift , coming from what has historically been America 's most cautious and conservative major medical organization , is historic , " said Aaron Houston , director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project , who attended the AMA meeting .
" Marijuana 's Schedule I status is not just scientifically untenable , given the wealth of recent data showing it to be both safe and effective for chronic pain and other conditions , but it 's been a major obstacle to needed research . "
The AMA lagged behind one of its competitors .
In February 2008 , a the American College of Physicians ( ACP ) , the country 's second largest physician group and the largest organization of doctors of internal medicine , adopted a resolution calling for an " evidence - based review of marijuana 's status as a Schedule I controlled substance to determine whether it should be reclassified to a different schedule . "
" The two largest physician groups in the US have established medical marijuana as a health care issue that must be addressed , " said ASA Government Affairs Director Caren Woodson .
" Both organizations have underscored the need for change by placing patients above politics . "
And so the pressure mounts .
Moody 's Warns Debtor Nations to Beware " Social Unrest and Public Tension "
It sounds a bit out of the ordinary , but a credit rating agency , Moody ’s , has stepped forward to warn leading industrialized nations like the US and Britain to be careful about where exorbitant debt can lead them .
Yet it did n’t focus its caution on the financial perils of loose fiscal policy .
Instead it explained that the biggest hurdle to restoring fiscal health could be social and political tension .
From the Telegraph :
“ In a sombre report on the outlook for next year , the credit rating agency raised the prospect that future tax rises and spending cuts could trigger social unrest in a range of countries from the developing to the developed world .
“ It said that in the coming years , evidence of social unrest and public tension may become just as important signs of whether a country will be able to adapt as traditional economic metrics .
Signalling that a fiscal crisis remains a possibility for a leading economy , it said that 2010 would be a ‘ tumultuous year for sovereign debt issuers ’ .
“ … the main obstacle for fiscal consolidation plans would be signs not necessarily of economic strength but of ‘ political and social tension ’ . ”
Developed countries like Greece and Iceland have already seen riots in the streets due to economic challenges … and it would be best to see the US avoid that fate .

BEIJING  Liu Xiaobo , one of China ’s best - known dissidents and a principal author of a pro-democracy manifesto that has attracted more than 10,000 signatures from Chinese supporters , was indicted Thursday on charges of trying to subvert the state , his lawyer said .
Mr. Liu was expected to be tried in four to six weeks , the lawyer , Shang Baojun , said Friday .
The authorities disclosed the decision to prosecute Mr. Liu  a step that almost invariably ends in imprisonment  exactly one year and a day after the manifesto , Charter 08 , was published .
Other Charter 08 signers said in interviews that the government was using Mr. Liu ’s case to send a strong message to Chinese intellectuals that it would not tolerate organized , independent efforts to foster democracy .
“ The government is trying to tell us to stop trying to push for human rights and democracy in China , ” said Xu Youyu , a Charter 08 signer and a philosophy professor who recently retired from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
“ Secondly , he has been the biggest threat inside of China , and they want to get rid of him . ”
Mr. Liu ’s supporters had hoped that Chinese leaders would be persuaded to release Mr. Liu , who has been detained for more than a year , when President Obama visited China last month .
During the visit , United States officials gave Chinese leaders a list of “ cases of concern ” that included Mr. Liu and 11 other political and religious activists who are imprisoned or facing charges , according to Nicholas Bequelin , an Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch , which is based in New York .
In giving himself " a solid B - plus " for his presidency to date , President Obama also showed how high a political premium he places on new health care legislation .
" B - plus because of the things that are undone .
Health care is not yet signed .
If I get health care passed , we tip into A - minus , " Obama told Oprah Winfrey during Sunday 's night 's broadcast of Christmas at the White House : An Oprah Primetime Special .
Obama and aides are keeping a watchful eye on efforts by Senate Democrats to forge a health care compromise .
This morning , the president 's Council of Economic Advisers released a report saying that " reform will reduce premiums , lower public and private health care spending , and increase workers ' wages . "
Don Stewart , a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , promptly responded that " this is the same Council of Economic Advisers that predicted unemployment would stay under 8 % " under the $ 787 billion stimulus bill ; the current jobless rate is 10 % .
So Oval-ites :
What grade would you give the president ?
Does it go higher or lower if he gets new health care legislation ?

On Tuesday , the Treaty of Lisbon went into effect , bringing the nations of the European Union one step closer to the unity the Continent ’s elite has been working toward for over 50 years .
But the treaty ’s implementation fell just days after a milestone of a different sort : a referendum in Switzerland , long famous for religious tolerance , in which 57.5 percent of voters chose to ban the nation ’s Muslims from building minarets .
Switzerland is n’t an E.U. member state , but the minaret moment could have happened almost anywhere in Europe nowadays  in France , where officials have floated the possibility of banning the burka ; in Britain , which elected two representatives of the fascistic , anti-Islamic British National Party to the European Parliament last spring ; in Italy , where a bill introduced this year would ban mosque construction and restrict the Islamic call to prayer .
If the more perfect union promised by the Lisbon Treaty is the European elite ’s greatest triumph , the failure to successfully integrate millions of Muslim immigrants represents its greatest failure .
And the two are intertwined : they ’re both the fruits of the high - handed , often undemocratic approach to politics that Europe ’s leaders have cultivated in their quest for unity .
Sometimes , when you hear a cover version of an iconic song , you have to shout , What on Earth were they thinking ?
It ’s all a matter of taste of course , but few covers improve on the original .
Probably the best approach is to do a very different version and wow people with a leftfield sound .
The following is a mix of the quirky , the charming , the funny , the outrageous , and the plain insane .
After you read this , you may want to lie down in a darkened room .
You have been warned .
1 .
Paul Anka – Smells Like Teen Spirit
Original : Nirvana
Grunge meets Lounge Lizard .
In 2005 , Anka released Rock Swings , an album of swing jazz covers of pop and rock songs that includes The Cure , REM , and Soundgarden .
In finger snapping , cabaret style , the aging and balding veteran turns Kurt Cobain ’s beautiful piece of angst into kitsch .
What has he got to be angsty about ?
Still in his suit , he is perfectly groomed and does n’t go as far as roughing up his hair , ( what ’s left of it ) , or sporting a cardigan .
Who knew there was a disaffected teenager trying to get out ?
He looks tremendously self - conscious , as he should be .
2 .
Sid Vicious – My Way
Original : Frank Sinatra ( English Language Version )
Originally a French song , Paul Anka wrote English lyrics and presented it to Frank Sinatra .
It became Sinatra ’s signature song and a staple at funerals .
It has been covered numerous times and you either love or hate the punk version by the Sex Pistols ’ bassist .
The lyrics have a kind of screw you , I ’ll do what I want , British Punk sensibility .
Worthwhile just to watch Sinatra fans squirm .
3 .
Rolf Harris – Stairway to Heaven
Original : Led Zeppelin
Known for his quick fire drawing and recordings of Waltzing Matilda and Two Little Boys , the Australian performer embraced a new audience with his surprise inclusion at the Glastonbury Festival .
His tongue in cheek rendition of the rock classic has a certain charm and his didgeridoo solo and wobble board accompaniment take Stairway to Heaven to places that Led Zep never dreamed of .
4 .
Pat Boone – Enter Sandman
Original : Metallica
Rock ‘ n ’ Roll blew Boone and others like him out of the charts in the ‘ 60 s but the clean cut singer and actor has maintained a career over the decades .
Known for his Christian activism and right wing politics , nothing could prepare the world for his album of heavy metal covers .
Pat Boone goes over to the dark side .
Be afraid , be very afraid .
The album cover shows the crooner with an earring in his ear , displaying a bare chest , and looking like he ’s just got off his Harley .
The song ’s arrangement has some nice jazzy instrumentation .
If only he ’d shut up .
There ’s a speaking part that is just plain creepy .
Sleep with one eye open , indeed .
This song could actually give you nightmares .
His album of Marilyn Manson songs is scheduled for release in 2010 .
Sorry , I made that bit up .
5 .
Scissor Sisters – Comfortably Numb
Original : Pink Floyd
There is no sense of the alienation present in Pink Floyd ’s masterpiece from The Wall .
The falsetto vocal and disco backing render it harmless .
It ’s all rather dreamy and pleasant and is almost unrecognizable , but for the lyrics .
Inexplicably , the song ’s video shows a lot of cavorting in the water with jellyfish and a shark .
6 .
Peter Sellers – A Hard Day ’s Night
Original : The Beatles
Peter Sellers became an international star as a comic actor and he also released several comedy records .
The Beatles were fans of Sellers and their record producer , George Martin had worked with him in the 1950s .
Martin produced him again on the Beatles ’ covers , closing a neat circle in his career .
Sellers performed versions of She Loves You , Ca n’t Buy Me Love , and Help ! but A Hard Day ’s Night was the most popular release , the lyrics spoken in the style of Lawrence Olivier ’s portrayal of Shakespeare ’s Richard III .
7 .
Children of Bodom Oops !… – I Did It Again
Original : Britney Spears
Britney and a Finnish heavy metal band .
What a combination .
Lead singer , Alexi Laiho , turns in a fine vocal or he sounds like he ’s trying to cough up phlegm , depending on your point of view .
The song goes into a conventional pop chorus for a while , which is quite jarring .
Startling but entertaining .
8 .
Max Raabe & Palast Orchestra – Kiss
Original : Prince
Bandleader Max Raabe hails from Berlin and performs his own brand of 1920s and 1930s style , German dance music .
The orchestra ’s most well known recordings are their covers of famous pop songs .
They also do a version of Oops !
… I Did It Again and they cover the Tom Jones song , Sex Bomb .
Raabe has a cult following and performed at the Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese wedding .
This version of Kiss is sophisticated but strangely sinister .
9 .
Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain – Anarchy in the UK
Original : The Sex Pistols
The UK orchestra has toured the world and appeared at Glastonbury Festival , charming audiences with their ukulele versions of pop classics , such as Bowie ’s Life on Mars and The Who ’s Pinball Wizard .
You ca n’t help smiling at their gentle version of the Sex Pistols ’ punk anthem with its sing along chorus .
I guess anything sounds harmless on a ukulele .
10 .
William Shatner – Mr. Tambourine Man
Original : Bob Dylan
Is he an icon ?
Yes .
Is he a fine Captain of the Enterprise ?
Certainly .
Is he a singer ?
No .
The Shat recorded an entire album of eccentric interpretations that include Dylan ’s dreamy classic and the Beatles ’ Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds .
He ’s obviously ingested too much space dust , causing him to stress all the wrong words and perform like a lunatic .
Why is he shouting at the end ?
The poor Tambourine Man is trying to get away .
He ’s running for the hills !
Run , Tambourine Man , run !

MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow is concerned that President Obama ’s trip abroad has served to bring out “ the unhinged among the president ’s critics . ”
Not only have the Wall Street Journal and the hosts of Fox News been issuing their usual dark mutterings , but a new slogan has began appearing on bumper stickers , tshirts , and even teddy bears : “ Pray for Obama : Psalm 109:8 . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Verses 8 and 9 of that psalm read , “ Let his days be few ; and let another take his office .
Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . ”
Maddow seemed mainly amused by the teddy bears , but when she turned for comment to former right - wing evangelical leader Frank Schaeffer , he emphasized that in a religious context “ it means something more threatening . ”
“ The situation that I find genuinely frightening right now , ” Schaeffer explained , “ is that you have a ramping up of biblical language … and what it ’s coalescing into is branding Obama … as ‘ not us . ’ …
Now he joins the ranks of the unjust kings of ancient Israel … who should be slaughtered , if not by God then by just men . ”
“ Really , this is trawling for assassins , ” continued Schaeffer , “ and this is serious business .
It ’s un-American , it ’s unpatriotic , and it goes to show that the religious right , the Republican far right , have coalesced into a group that truly want American revolution . …
They can not be dismissed as just crazies on the fringe . …
This bumper sticker simply says to them , ‘ It ’s open season . ' ”
Appearing increasingly agitated , Schaeffer went on to say , “ This is the American version of the Taliban .
The Taliban quotes the Koran , and Al Qaeda quotes certain verses in the Koran , in or out of context , calling for jihad and bloody war and the curse of Allah on infidels .
This is the Old Testament biblical equivalent of calling for holy war . …
And what surprises me is that responsible — if you can put it that way — Republican leadership , and the editors at some of these Christian magazines …. do not stand up in holy horror and denounce this . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I would just say to them , ‘ Where the hell are you ? ' ” Schaeffer concluded .
“ ‘ This is not funny any more , and be it on your head if something happens to our president . ’ …
There are not many steps left on this insane path . ”

Asa Dotzler , Mozilla 's director of community development , used his personal blog to urge Firefox users away from Google and to use Microsoft 's search engine Bing , instead .
Dotzler cited privacy concerns , specifically pointing to comments recently made by Google CEO Eric Schmidt .
" I think judgment matters , " said Schmidt .
" If you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place . "
Dotzler then links to the Bing add - on for Firefox , stating that Bing 's privacy policy is better than Google 's ( and notably fails to mention Yahoo at all ) .
Schmidt was talking about laws in the US , but the way he worded his beliefs did not sit well with privacy advocates — and a whole lot of other folks — including Dotzler .
Microsoft has to respect the Patriot Act and other laws just as Google does , but after seeing Schmidt 's comments , Dotzler decided that Firefox users need to be reminded of Bing 's existence .
Google 's philosophy is that the more open information is , the better it is for everyone , especially the search giant , which makes money by organizing said information and then displaying as relevant as possible ads beside it .
Microsoft , on the other hand , while still a business that like , any other , wants to make money , has a long history of dealing with privacy concerns and regulations , so it 's eager to avoid potential issues if possible .
Dotzler , a 10 - year - veteran at Mozilla , is saying that if you care about your privacy , remember that Bing is better than Google , at least in that department .
The troubling Google - Mozilla relationship
Dotzler 's statement further adds to the unstable relationship between Google and Mozilla .
Firefox has had Google as the default search engine for years , and the default Firefox Start Page homepage is really just a rebranded Google search engine webpage .
Mozilla has always made sure that the Google search engine was easily accessible from Firefox .
One of the reasons for this is that the larger majority of Mozilla 's revenue has always come from Google ( about 97 percent ) .
In November 2009 , we noted that most of Mozilla 's revenue was still being generated through search deals with Google and other popular website operators ( one of the reasons why Dotzler can't simply push for Bing becoming the default search engine in Firefox ) .
Google recently committed to extending its contract with Mozilla until 2011 .
Ever since Google launched its Chrome browser in September 2008 , many speculated that the relationship between the two companies would not be the same ; after all , Google had started directly competing with Mozilla , despite the fact that it was funding its operations .
In October 2009 , Mozilla expressed its concerns about Google 's Chrome Frame project , a plugin that brings Chrome 's rendering engine to Internet Explorer , saying it could possibly fragment the Web .
Now we have an executive reminding everyone that there is a better search engine , in terms of privacy at least , out there , and it works in Firefox .

A Preview of Google Chrome OS
Google has released Chromium OS * , the open source precursor to their Chrome OS ( which Google says will be “ ready for users ” in a year ) .
Google in a blog post explains that the Chrome operating system will be all about web apps , not traditional apps , so the “ entire experience ” takes place within the browser .
Additional focus in Chrome OS will be on speed , as well as security ; “ Every time you restart your computer the operating system verifies the integrity of its code , ” Google promises .
They also mention that they “ benefited hugely from projects like GNU , the Linux Kernel , Moblin , Ubuntu , WebKit ” , some of the layers of Chrome OS .
Below video is giving an overview of the Chrome OS user interface :
Expanding the app menu , linking to web apps such as Gmail , Hotmail or Google Calendar .
Some windows remain always on top .

Militants in Pakistan have blown up the house of a local official , killing him and five members of his family .
Sarbraz Saddiqi , a government official in Kurram district , his wife and four children were killed in the attack , a police official said .
Sunday morning 's attack came as the family were asleep .
No -one has admitted planting the bomb .
But the police spokesman said it could be linked to a Pakistan army offensive against the Taliban in the area .
The army has captured territory in South Waziristan , a hotbed of Islamic militancy , but many insurgents are believed to have fled to nearby regions , including Kurram .
Small children killed
The attack occurred in Mosu Zai village , about 200 km ( 125 miles ) from the north - western city of Peshawar .
" Unknown miscreants planted dynamite around the house and exploded it between 0200 ( 2100 GMT ) and 0300 and the house was destroyed , " Abab Ali , a local official told AFP news agency .
" Those killed were aged five to 11 , " he said .
" We do n't know whether the Taliban , terrorists or Shias were responsible , " Mr Ali said .
But police officer Naeemullah Khan said the attack appeared to be linked to the army 's efforts against the Taliban militants in the area .

The roads were empty when Linda Catt and her father drove their white Citroën Berlingo into London on a quiet Sunday morning .
They could not have known they were being followed .
But at 7.23 am on 31 July 2005 , the van had passed beneath an automatic number plate recognition ( ANPR ) camera in east London , triggering an alert : " Of interest to Public Order Unit , Sussex police " .
Within seconds Catt , 50 , and her 84 - year - old father , John , were apprehended by police and searched under the Terrorism Act .
After filing a complaint , the pair , neither of whom have criminal records , discovered that four months earlier , a Sussex police officer had noticed their van " at three protest demonstrations " and decided , apparently on that basis , it should be tracked .
The two anti-war campaigners were not the only law - abiding protesters being monitored on the roads .
Officers have been told they can place " markers " against the vehicles of anyone who attends demonstrations using the national ANPR data centre in Hendon , north London , which stores information on car journeys for up to five years .
Senior officers have been instructed to " fully and strategically exploit " the database , which allows police to mark vehicles with potentially useful inform-ation such as drink - driving convictions .
The use of the ANPR database to flag - up vehicles belonging to protesters has resulted in peaceful campaigners being repeatedly stopped and searched .
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal Kent and Essex police deployed mobile ANPR " interceptor teams " on roads surrounding the protest against the Kingsnorth power station , in Kent , last year .
The files reveal the pressure police placed on the local Medway council to assist with the installation of cameras on lamp - posts .
Sergeant Keith Waymont , Kent police 's ANPR manager , wrote to the council three months before the demonstration to complain its officials were not co-operating .
He wrote : " When I put this to my bosses , they were less than impressed , given the importance of this operation as the new power station build is likely to create a considerable number of jobs for Medway . "
But council officials had reasons to object .
Internal emails reveal they were concerned temporary cameras could " alienate the community " .
One wrote : " I agree – under what powers are they looking to do that ?
Everyone has a right to drive down a road unless we are returning to the miners dispute tactics of the 1980s . "
Police eventually succeeded in mobilising the Kent ANPR system , which appears to have been used to monitor protesters since four years ago .
The marker was placed on Catt 's van on 10 March 2005 by a PC Sayer , of Sussex police , who had noticed it at anti-war protests .
Sussex police told Catt the marker was placed because her van was " associated " with protests which had given rise to " crime , disorder and the deployment of significant resources " .
After she submitted a complaint , senior officers found their officer 's actions had been " proportionate and appropriate " , a finding upheld on appeal to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , which concluded that while her case highlighted the concerns over " the civil liberties or protesters " , police had been acting in accordance with " national policy " .
Catt has since discovered from Greater Manchester police that footage of her protesting at last year 's Labour party conference , which she drove to in her van , is being stored on the National Public Order Intelligence Unit database .
Another protester , an IT manager who only wants to be known as John for fear of police retribution , said he was stopped more than 25 times in two and half years after a " protester " marker was placed against his Mercedes SUV .
He said police were giving him inconsistent explanations for the stops .
" I heard every excuse under the sun : ' We 've heard reports of suspicious vehicles in the area ' or ' We 're keeping an eye on high value vehicles moving through the area , ' " he said .
" One or two officers would be a bit more honest and say : ' Your number plate has flagged up on our system , we do n't know why . '
This was happening all over the country . "
He finally decided to complain after a police armed response unit stopped him onduring an evening out with his wife in March 2008 .
Documents revealed a marker " requiring stop checks " had been placed on his car by Lancashire police in 2006 after he attended a protest , described by the local paper as " peaceful " , against duck and pheasant shoot near Preston .
Lancashire police said the marker had been placed " for a policing purpose " and due to " concerns about the nature of your involvement " in the protest " .
Yesterday , we wrote about a new , free product from Google : Google Maps Navigation .
Another free Google perpetual beta product , one might say ; nothing to get overly excited about .
Well , the first reviews and reactions are in , and it seems that this is one of those Google products that change the landscape of an entire industry .
GPS turn - by - turn navigation has historically always been something you had to pay for .
Creating and maintaining a map of the entire world , together with points of interests and traffic info , plus developing the algorithms that make sure you do n't take a wrong turn , costs millions of dollars .
But Google is now offering it for free .
The result was devastating for shares of GPS navigation companies : Garmin 's shares fell by 16.4 % ; TomTom 's by 20.8 % .
We 're talking billions of dollars of market capitalization , gone in one day , just because Google presented another free product ( they release new products on a monthly , if not weekly basis ) .
This does n't necessarily mean that TomTom and Garmin are going out of business .
But it means that this entire space has fundamentally changed , and the market reacts to developments like that .
Do they do have something to fear ?
Absolutely .
Google Maps Navigation is n't some half - baked , crippled free version of GPS turn - by - turn navigation .
In most areas , it 's comparable with standalone GPS navigation solutions , and it even brings some novelties to the table , for example Google 's fantastic satellite view and Street View .
The folks over at Engadget have tested it out with a Droid , you can check the results in the video below .
Right now , Google Maps Navigation works only on Android 2.0 devices .
But as it spreads to other platforms and devices , it 's obvious that everyone will get it .
After all , it 's free , so why not ?
People who used GPS navigation before will get it to see how well it works .
People who never cared about it will try it out to see how it 's like .
In a matter of months , Google will control a huge , previously untapped portion of the market .
From their competitors ' perspective , it 's a nightmare .
From the user 's perspective , it 's fantastic : a free alternative for a service that you previously had to pay for .
It 'll be interesting to see where Google takes this , but I have a feeling that GPS navigation will get far more exciting in the future .
Of the many shortcomings of the digital economy bill , one of the most egregious is the treatment of music lovers who download songs from the internet .
The music industry and the government need to understand that sharing music is not stealing , and I would happily debate Lord Mandelson , anytime , anywhere , on this question .
Filesharing is a business model issue , not a legal issue .
Done properly , encouraging the downloading of songs would help the industry flourish .
The labels ' current attitude causes them to do one irrational act after another .
For example , when DJ Danger Mouse created the Grey Album – which consists entirely of contorted samples from the Beatles '
White Album mashed together with vocals from Jay - Z's smash hit The Black Album – the labels should have rejoiced , as sales of White and Black albums went up .
Instead he was served with a cease - and - desist notice from EMI .
This is lunacy .
The labels ' fundamental problems predated the internet .
Recorded music has been a bloated industry .
To take a band from obscurity to popularity is hugely expensive , but that 's what companies have had to do to be given coveted shelf space at the record store .
So record companies seek out only potential superstars , since less than 10 % of CDs are profitable .
Revenues from the best sellers cover the losses of all the rest .
In this context , the internet should have been a godsend .
It can distribute a digital copy of a song to hundreds of millions of listeners at virtually no cost .
By sidestepping the industrial age infrastructure , many more musicians can be profitable .
It would be smart business for companies to nurture many small artists , rather than focusing all energies on just potential superstars .
As a society and culture , we would be much better served by such an approach .
There are many alternatives to ensure that everyone gets fairly compensated for their work .
One solution is to stop trying to sell songs at a set price .
The music industry needs to think Wikinomics .
Music should be a service , not a product .
Here 's one scenario : instead of purchasing tunes , you would pay a small monthly fee for access to all the songs in the world – say € 5 per month .
Recordings would be streamed to any appliance when you want them – your laptop , mobile device , car , home stereo , via the internet .
Call it Everywhere Internet Audio .
Every customer has the Me Channel and could slice and dice the massive musical database anyway you like – by artist , by genre , by year , by songwriter , by popularity , and so on .
The Me Channel would know what you like , based on what you 've chosen in the past .
You could even ask your Everywhere Internet Audio service to suggest new artists that resemble your known favourites or to create a new playlist called " Mick Jagger 's current favourites " .
Musicians , songwriters and the record labels would be compensated through systems that track their popularity .
Technologies and companies already exist that can do this .
Everywhere Internet Audio would make the problem of copyright protection vanish .
No one would ever " steal " music .
Why would you take possession of a song when you can listen to any song at any time on any device ?
Other approaches could solve the industry 's problem , but they also require Wikinomics thinking – experimentation and a spirit of collaboration , traits the labels have failed to demonstrate .
Intellectual property scholars William Fisher and Neil Netanel argue that peer - to - peer music sites should be allowed to distribute music for free .
But the providers of such services , including internet service providers and device manufacturers would be charged a fee .
Like Everywhere Internet Audio , artists would be compensated according to the popularity of downloads .
Alternatively , the Electronic Frontier Foundation has proposed a " voluntary collective licence " that would give the purchaser immunity from prosecution for non-commercial filesharing .
Again the fees from the licence would be pooled and divvied out to artists .
Internet activist Cory Doctorow says approaches like these are better than streaming .
I 'm not enthusiastic about music being streamed to me over a corrupt , expensive , unreliable 3G network with no roaming capability , heavy tracking and censorship .
It 's better to simply collect money for the MP3s that are traded .
But rather than explore bold new approaches for digital entertainment , the industry persists in a business model that turns their customers into criminals .
And the industry that brought us the Beatles is now hated by its customers and is collapsing .

So while current anonymity models may not be workable in 5 or 10 years , if people are generating strongly encrypted traffic to arbitrary hosts , _some_ models will be workable .

Talk is cheap ; actions speak volumes .
And it seems Barack Obama is compiling quite a volume for himself at America 's flagship concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay .
As Andrew Wander reports , conditions for prisoners at Gitmo have grown worse since Obama took office : Guantanamo conditions ' deteriorate ' .
Of course , Gitmo is by no means the worst pit in America 's worldwide gulag , which Obama has kept wide open for business , while fighting strenuously in court to retain all of Bush 's authoritarian powers over the lives and liberties of anyone the president arbitrarily deems a suspected terrorist .
And of course , he has n't , uh , closed Gitmo , as he made a solemn promise to do within a year of his inauguration .
But whether he eventually gets around to the PR show of shutting down this one camp , the fact that his administration has imposed an even harsher regime on its denizens of limbo is , literally , atrocious .
One can only assume that this has been done as some sort of compensation mechanism for Obama 's promise to close the joint ; every president now must continually prove that he is " tough enough " to do the dirty work – killing civilians , spying on citizens , kidnapping people and putting them in concentration camps , etc. -- required to keep the imperial war machine going .
Any gesture – however hollow – toward an alternative approach must be balanced with harshness elsewhere .
This works on the domestic front as well , of course .
For example , you can't have even a hollow and perverse gesture at health care reform without condemning poor women to die in back - alley abortions .
Somebody has to pay , in blood and suffering , for every attempt at amelioration in the system ; that 's the modern American way .
Wander writes :
Within days of Obama 's inauguration and subsequent announcement that he would close Guantanamo , prisoners say authorities introduced new regulations and revoked previous privileges at the prison .
" They took away group recreation for prisoners in segregation , which was the only time we saw anyone , " Mohammed el Gharani remembers .
[ Gharani " They took away the books we had from the library .
They even sprayed pepper spray into my cell while I was sleeping , so I 'd wake up unable to breathe . "
Gharani says he was beaten so badly by guards that he is still suffering pain today .
... " I am in the very same cell , wearing the same uniform , eating the same food , yet treated much worse compared to mid-2008 , " [ a current ] prisoner writes .
" We are unable to understand the goals of the policy of more restrictions and inflexibility . "
Gharani was released in June 2009 , after being held in American captivity since he was seized in Pakistan in October 2001 -- at the age of 14 .
He was originally charged with being a top money - man for al Qaeda , after an American - hired translator mistook Gharani 's talk about vegetables as evidence of his wide - ranging financial operation .
As the Boston Globe reported back in 2006 :
He was .. interrogated using a translator from Yemen who spoke a different dialect of Arabic than was spoken in his native Saudi Arabia , according to Gharani 's lawyer .
" The word `zalata ' in Yemen means money , but in his Saudi Arabian dialect , it means tomato , " said Smith .
" They asked him , ' When you went to Pakistan , where did you get your zalata ? ' and he tells them all these different shops where you could buy tomatoes in Karachi .
They write them all down , thinking that this 14 - year - old kid is a big financier who was able to get money from all these different places . "
Later , they accused him of being part of a London " cell " run by an extremist cleric -- in 1998 .
The fact that Gharani was 11 years old at that time , and had never been to London , did not prevent him from being held captive for almost eight years -- a cruel and unusual punishment no matter what the conditions were , much less with the abuse that he endured .
And still it goes on , as Wander reports :
According to the letter [ from a current prisoner ] , prison authorities inflict " humiliating punishments " on inmates and prisoners face " intentional mental and physical harm " .
" The situation is worsening with the advent of the new management , " the prisoner writes , noting , like Gharani , that the new rules were imposed in January this year .
Conditions , he says , " do not fit the lowest standard of human living " .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , which monitors prisoner treatment at Guantanamo , declined to comment on specific allegations at the prison , but says that it recognises the cumulative effect low - level abuse can have on the well - being of prisoners in general .
" In some cases , a single act may amount to torture , " ICRC spokesman Simon Schorno says .
" In others , ill treatment may be the result of a number of methods used over time , which , taken individually and out of context , may seem harmless . "
... Ahmed Ghappour , who represents Guantanamo prisoners , has lodged several requests to initiate investigations since Obama took office .
" I have requested four investigations regarding prisoner abuse just this past year , " he says .
" The military responded to my first request indicating that they would investigate , but have been radio silent since then . "
Iran 's big news yesterday is that the government will formally kill five people who participated in June 's pro-democracy rallies .
Consider , though , the implications for the West 's peace - brokers of the case of Frenchwoman Clotilde Reiss .
It is now 20 weeks since Ms. Reiss was arrested while trying to leave Iran and 12 weeks since she was released to the French Embassy " to await her return to France , " in the words of President Sarkozy .
She 's still waiting .
Ms. Reiss 's ordeal is merely of a piece of this .
But it ought to be an instructive piece , particularly as Iran 's nuclear ambitions come closer to realization .
That 's the real significance of this week 's report by the International Atomic Energy Agency about Iran 's formerly secret uranium enrichment facility near Qom , which the agency concluded had no possible relevance to any purported civilian power program .
Once Iran goes nuclear , the whole world becomes its hostage .
The results of our study corroborate research showing the detrimental effect of alcohol use on injury .
The results for cannabis use were quite surprising , as they were associated with less risk of injury , which seems to contradict the laboratory studies cited above , as well as opposes the observations on alcohol use .
While these findings are thus more in line with other epidemiological studies showing no effect of cannabis use , possibly even a protective one ( e.g. , [ 32 , 35 ] ) , they are limited by the small sample size of cannabis users and do not necessarily contradict findings from laboratory studies .
One possibility is that persons driving under the influence of cannabis become more cautious in real - life driving situations than they would in the laboratory [ 10 , 24 ] , e.g. , by avoiding potentially risky situations [ 10 ] .
Furthermore , the present study did not only look at traffic casualties , but also included other mechanisms for injury with potential links to cannabis use that are different from those for traffic injuries .
The compensation hypothesis is unlikely to be the only explanation of our results .
First , as is the case for alcohol , there should be limits for such compensation [ 27 , 28 ] .
The present study in fact indicated a ' protective effect ' of cannabis use in a dose - response relationship .
Second , the combined intake of alcohol and cannabis failed to show an increased risk for injury when compared with unaccompanied alcohol use , as should be expected [ 21 ] .
Nonetheless , the relative risk was below even 1 when compared with individuals that abstained from both substances in the six - hour period prior to injury .
Third , compared with other studies ( e.g. , [ 16 , 21 ] ) only very few ( i.e. 2.9 % of the present sample ) had consumed cannabis in the six - hour period prior to injury .
This seems to be quite low given the fact that Switzerland has one of the highest cannabis use prevalence rates in the world ( see [ 36 ] for students , and [ 37 ] for adults ) , and therefore may point to the possibility that Swiss cannabis users take precautions to avoid injuries while using cannabis .
Another possible explanation is that when compared to alcohol consumption , cannabis is consumed in relatively safer , low risk environments ( e.g. at home , private locations , not public such as bars or while ' going out ' ) , independent of whether also it is consumed with alcohol .
Future studies should look at the environment of predominant cannabis usage and whether the place of consumption ( e.g. at home , during special occasions ) is differentially associated with risks of injuries .
The number of cannabis usage cases in the present study was simply too small , to permit a stratified analysis by place of consumption .
As the main results of the study are based on self - reported measures of cannabis use , there may have been a deliberate denial of illicit behaviour .
Although this may explain the small prevalence , it is unlikely to explain a protective association with injury .
It also begs the question of why individuals would deny cannabis use before an injury , but admit use in the week prior ( which is needed to result in a relative risk below 1 ) ?
As shown above , there is not a lot of indication for deliberate denial .
However , there may be other memory effects , e.g. , the ability for recall may have been impeded by alcohol and cannabis use , especially for the period of one week before the injury .
Recall errors may have also particularly affected the estimates in case - crossover studies ( e.g. , overestimation of relative risks due to the underestimation of use in the control period that is retrospectively farther away in time [ 38 ] ) , but would not explain why cannabis use had a protective effect .
While the participation rate was relatively high ( 8 % refusals ) , we cannot exclude the possibility , that exclusion may have been associated with exposure .
Another limitation of our research was the small sample size for cannabis use , and as a result , we should be cautious with conclusions .
Clearly , more research is needed , epidemiological studies in particular .
Roadside surveys in the tradition of Borkenstein and colleagues [ 3 ] should be conducted more systematically to allow for a better examination of the causal effects of cannabis use in traffic injury .
In such studies , not only is the blood alcohol concentration in participants of traffic injuries measured , but a random sample of comparable traffic participants is measured as well .
This allows for the establishment of relative risk estimates .
However , even if such studies yield significant relative risks for injury as a consequence of cannabis use , this does not necessarily demonstrate sufficient evidence for the public health importance of the problem .
It may be that although cannabis is causally connected to traffic injury , the importance of this risk factor is small due to a low prevalence of people combining cannabis with other risk factors , such as drinking and driving .
Thus , attributable fractions may be small .
Of course , the public health importance may differ in regions with higher prevalence of cannabis use .
One of the more interesting research continuations in this area would be to replicate this study in regions with higher prevalence of cannabis use and higher incidence of injury ( e.g. , some parts of Africa or the Caribbean ) .
In conclusion , we need a more systematic exploration of the relationships between cannabis use and other forms of injury than traffic injuries .
There are some indications of cannabis use having a negative biological link to aggression [ 39 ] , hence many categories of injuries may be differentially impacted by cannabis as compared to alcohol .
These relationships should be studied in real life settings and not only in the laboratory , as other factors such as deviance or stigmatization may play a role .
Public health researchers tend to disregard subjective reports of cannabis users , seemingly indicating that they are more cautious and avoid risky situations subsequent to use ( e.g. , [ 40 ] ) .
However , given the numerous reports on different mechanisms of injury , we should take these reports more seriously and should start exploring more systematically which situations involving cannabis use are associated with increased or decreased risks of injury .
Such research could not only shed light on important interactions between social and biological determinants of behaviour , but could also contribute to better preventing cannabis - related harm .
Good morning .
I received this letter on Friday , so it ’s possible that the writer ’s situation has already blown up in his face -- but let ’s help him anyway .
For those who doubt him , I Googled his e-mail address and he is who he says he is .
He is , in fact , a local musician .
Enjoy this one .
Alright Meredith , I have a very peculiar predicament that everyone will probably get a good laugh out of ( or I am going to take a ton of flak for this ) .
Let me start with a little background info here .
It gets to the dating question eventually — just bear with it : I am moving out of my current neighborhood in Boston to a little more suburban scene with a couple friends .
I was the point man for communications with our landlord and realtor during our tenure at our current apartment .
The realtor came over to take pictures of our apartment for the rental website and I casually mentioned , after conversation and the realtor spotting my several guitars and keyboards / recording equipment in my room ( I did n’t just bring it up , I 'm not that lame ) , that I have been contacted by a couple local record companies about some of my songs , which is true .
Fast forward to the next day .
The realtor asked me if he could swing by the apartment with two girls to look at the place .
They came to look at the apartment , and one of the girls and myself had a bit of a connection and started flirting while I was showing them mi casa .
The realtor , out of no - where , drops a bomb that I had just signed a record deal and am moving to NYC / going on tour , which is why I am moving out .
Ridiculous , but believable , so I decided to run with it .
I even ended up signing an autograph for the kid !!!
The two girls decided they wanted to take the apartment and asked the realtor if they could show the apt .
to their third roommate later that night .
The realtor could n’t do it , so I said I will be there and swing in whenever , I will pick up beers and burgers and lets make it a party .
Long story short , after several Coronas , a quick set of some of my songs on the roof deck ( which overlooks the Boston skyline ) and a trip to a local watering hole , we locked lips .
I may or may not have dropped one of the best lines in recent man history : " How would you like to spend your first night in your new apartment ? "
I really did n’t think it was going to work , but " just think of the story it will make " was running through my head , classic guy flaw .
Well , needless to say , it actually worked and the next morning I was tossing back and forth on just being upfront with her about this redonkulous lie while she was trying to find her pants .
A lot of stuff going on here and I hope you could follow , but here 's the predicament :
She thinks I am moving to NYC in the next two weeks to become a rock star .
I just figured nothing would seriously happen so I went along with this snowball .
We have hung out several times since then and I may actually like this Chiquita .
I feel real bad about having to keep this whole facade up .
We have another date planned and I am wondering if it is better to know or not to know ...
Quite a quandary for you Goldstein , but let me have it …

So , I 'm at Chicago SES and see someone tweet about how Google has integrated Twitter into regular search .
Sure enough , Search Engine Land has an article about the topic .
Being a former practitioner of the “ dark arts ” , I immediately start running some searches and was pretty shocked at what I found .
Funnily enough , Dave Naylor was giving a presentation and mentioned this new real time search integration ( in regards to the reputation management issues it creates ) .
He pulled up the results for his name at the same time I tweeted him to get to the speaker room so we could fool around with what I was seeing .
For the next thirty minutes or so , Dave , myself , Michael Gray and Frank Watson sat around doing a few searches , and we were all a bit surprised at what we found and how Google could n't have foreseen the problems they 've just unleashed .
Real Time Spam
The most obvious thing was the ability to real - time spam Google 's results .
A quick search for Viagra showed the real - time results at the very top of the SERP , right under the news results … so I do a tweet about Viagra and drop a link to Sugarrae.com .
Sure enough , my tweet and my clickable link show right at the top of the Google SERP .
Google pulled the anchor from my sites title tag .
Additionally , Twitter hashtags are also clickable .
A quick search for Miley Cyrus gives you visibility to her fans if you drop a tweet offering up great Miley Cyrus tickets with a link ( however links do n't always seem to go through ) , hashtag or phone number ( I actually got two calls after the tweet scrolled by ) .
Can you hear the bots churning ?
I know I can .
I can't imagine that Google could n't have not only foreseen these issues but also had tested their filters much more extensively .
Real Time Libel
A more obvious danger is the reputation management angle .
If you do a search for a person 's Twitter handle ( we 'll use Mike Martin as an example ) you 'll see not only his tweets but tweets mentioning him .
If your Twitter handle is the same as your company name , you suddenly have a real time compliment or complaint feed showing up to anyone who searches your name on Google .
( And just think of what this means for keyword - based Twitter accounts . )
Imagine if you have a disgruntled employee who takes to tweeting poorly about your company all day long in a fit of anger .
Imagine if your competitor wants to play dirty .
There is no way to track who owns a Twitter account , and you may find yourself having to spend a lot of time to try and stop and remove bogus complaints or comments from appearing .
By the time you get it situated , the damage may have already been done with no one to hold accountable for defaming your company 's name .
Real Time Danger
I think the aspect of this “ real time search ” that frankly , scared the hell out of me the most , is the ability for predators to reach out to children with no way to stop them .
At this point , I see no way to remove real time search from showing in the results .
Safe search , even on the highest setting , to date , does not remove them .
Suddenly , anyone can talk to my child while they surf Google .
Let me repeat that .
SUDDENLY ANYONE CAN TALK TO MY CHILD VIA GOOGLE , AND I CAN'T STOP IT .
Google has suddenly become an enabler for predators .
Need an example ?
Let 's say your kid is searching for information on Sesame Street .
A wholesome show , right ?
Right .
That is until some freak is suddenly talking to your child and asking him to call them .
So Michael says to me , “ what four - year - old uses the phone ” ?
Ok , let 's target your angst filled , misunderstood teen then who is incredibly mad at you at the moment that you wo n't let her see her boyfriend anymore .
She does a search for Miley Cyrus to find “ The Climb ” lyrics so she can be emo for the night …
Google has just allowed strangers into my home and given me no way to lock the door , aside from removing my child 's access to Google .
The default search engine for almost every computer I see , including those in schools .
Of course , it 's not just Twitter appearing in the real - time results , but to date , Twitter seems to be the most spammable , most potentially libelous and most potentially dangerous .
And this is just the tip of the iceberg folks .
Google may think they 're ready to deal with the ramifications of personalized search .
In 30 minutes time , we were able to find multiple , multiple exploits ( much more than listed here , but if I told you about everything , the guys might shoot me ) .
Outgoing Virginia Gov.
Tim Kaine hosted his last call - in radio show this morning and greeted a guest identifed only as " Barry from DC . "
Turned out to be none other than Pennsylvania Avenue resident Barack Obama .
" Barry " dialed in to " Ask The Governor " to pay tribute to the man he almost picked for vice president and did tap for Democratic Party chair -- after first joking that he wanted to complain about traffic in Northern Virginia .
" Rather than go there , I just wanted to say how proud we are of your service as governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia , " the president told Kaine .
Obama told the governor , " We continue to think your wife is probably a little superior to you , as I think people think about the first lady , but you and me have to stick together since we 're married to better people . "
Just to be sure : Obama does not normally use the name " Barry , " at least not since he was very young .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the informal name was employed to " surprise the governor of Virginia . "

( CNN ) --
A rising Canadian folk singer was killed by coyotes this week in a national park in Nova Scotia , a park spokesman said Thursday .
Taylor Mitchell , 19 , was at the beginning of the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park on Tuesday afternoon when she was attacked , according to Chip Bird , the Parks Canada field unit superintendent for Cape Breton .
Bird said hikers saw the coyotes attacking Mitchell and called 911 .
She was airlifted to a hospital in Halifax , where she died about 12 hours later , he said .
Mitchell was recently nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by Canadian Folk Music Awards .
She was touring the Maritime provinces and had a break between gigs to go hiking Tuesday , her manager , Lisa Weitz , said in an e-mail .
" She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity , " she wrote .
" Words ca n't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet , compassionate , vibrant , and phenomenally talented young woman , " Weitz said .
" Her warmth , loving nature , astounding artistry , and infectious enthusiasm will be so missed and forever remembered . "
Read more about who Taylor Mitchell was
Mitchell , who was originally from the Georgian Bay area in Ontario , lived in Toronto , Weitz said .
Bird said the area where the attack occurred is popular and well traveled .
It remained closed , and park authorities had shot one coyote believed to be involved .
A pathologist will test the animal 's body for diseases that might have triggered the attack , he said .
Searches for other aggressive animals in the park continue , he said .
" Public safety is our primary concern , " he said .
He said no other coyote attacks had ever occurred in the park .
" We 've had coyotes approach people too closely , " he said , and about six years ago one nipped a person .
That animal was killed because of " lack of fear , " he said .
But Tuesday 's attack is " unprecedented and a totally isolated incident , " he said .
In a written statement , Emily Mitchell described her daughter as " a seasoned naturalist and well versed in wilderness camping .
She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity .
Tragically it was her time to be taken from us so soon .
" We take a calculated risk when spending time in nature 's fold -- it's the wildlife 's terrain , " Emily Mitchell 's statement continued .
" When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes , I clearly heard Taylor 's voice say , ' please do n't , this is their space . '
She would n't have wanted their demise , especially as a result of her own .
She was passionate about animals , was an environmentalist , and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months . "

Michael Johnston , Mitchell 's producer for her debut album , " For Your Consideration , " said the singer was a " brilliant and beautiful light that people were naturally drawn to . "
" She was so young and talented .
Her big dreams were a perfect match with her big , kind heart . "
He said he and his family would soon be organizing a celebration of her life .
Coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare , said Michael O'Brien , wildlife manager of furbearers and upland game for Nova Scotia .
It is " not expected or normal behavior , " he said , although he said there had been aggressive incidents in Nova Scotia before , but no deaths .
Illness , injury and familiarity with humans can affect an animal 's behavior , he said .

Seven months ago Andy Steingruebl , PayPal 's Secure Development Manager , contacted me to know whether a future NoScript version could support server - side activation of its HTTPS - enforcing features , preferably with a more robust approach than the cookie - based one seen in the original Barth & Jackson 's " ForceHTTPS " proof - of - concept .
Such a potential development had obvious positive implications for e-commerce businesses and secure websites in general , hardening them against session hijacking attacks .
I proposed a X - Force - HTTPS response header , to be ignored if coming through an insecure connection , otherwise switching on or off the " HTTPS - only " policy for the sending host .
A dedicated persistence mechanism on the client side , immune from any accidental or malicious override , was meant to overcome the obvious intrinsic limits of cookies .
The discussion seemed to die there , though .
Three months later , on May the 1st 2009 , Steingruebl sent me another email , introducing Jeff Hodges , a PayPal security researcher who was preparing a specification draft for a refined " X - Force - HTTPS " header , renamed as X - Force - TLS .
They were hoping to get a reference implementation in NoScript , and I would have really liked to help , but the timing could not be worse : I was already working around the clock for the first ABE public release , due on May the 25th , and as if that was n't enough , just some hours earlier the Adblock Plus " scandal " had exploded all over the Internet , taking away the peace of mind required to sustain NoScript 's traditionally allegro development rhythm .
So , after releasing ABE , I spent my summertime focusing on its user - driven stabilization , and the X - Force - TLS sub - project went in the fridge .
In the meanwhile an experimental implementation had been provided by Sid Stamm as a standalone extension for Firefox .
Sid is a Mozilla guy who 's very active on CSP as well , so this might be seen an encouraging hint to future support in the core browser .
However one week ago the security staff of a ( quite easy to guess ) leader Asian e-commerce player , which has been closely following the development of NoScript 's " WebAppSec- oriented " features such as ABE , ClearClick and Anti-XSS Injection Checker , asked me whether I could estimate a date for implementing a server - side switch mechanism for HTTPS enforcement , just like the one discussed earlier with PayPal .
They were eager to deploy this kind of protection as soon as possible , even in October , as part of a client security campaign involving a " Safest with Firefox + NoScript " recommendation .
Therefore I decided to unfreeze my own X - Force - TLS implementation and , after a quick assessment , I committed to inclusion in NoScript 1.9.8.9 , scheduled for release this week .
As an incredible coincidence , on day later I noticed a message from Jeff Hodges on the WHATWG mailing list , announcing the Strict Transport Security draft , a more formal and public " X - Force - TLS " header proposal , renamed again as Strict - Transport - Security and about to be implemented in the not - too - distant future by Chrome , too .
So I immediately forwarded the exciting news to the interested Asian party and made the necessary HTTP header renaming in my code for NoScript 1.9.8.9 , announcing its impending release .
And here we are , with NoScript providing the first public Strict - Transport - Security user agent implementation .
If you 're in charge of a secure web site , please refer to the aforementioned specification to increase the reliability of your SSL deployment .
If you 're a NoScript user , just keep relying on it as always , knowing that your online transactions are going to become safer during the incoming months , as adoption among secure web properties grows .
And if you 're a power user and you prefer not to wait for them , do n't forget that NoScript can already force any website to use secure connections only , at your whim .
Looking back at the fictional stories that defined the last decade , you might think of things like The Dark Knight , Battlestar Galactica , or failures like Bionic Woman and Speed Racer .
Was this the decade we ran out of original ideas ?

Okay , that 's obviously not completely fair ; after all , this last ten years have also seen things like Lost and Twilight winning over new fans , not to mention the end of the Harry Potter book series .
But there 's no denying that this has been a decade of recycling ideas : James Bond , Batman and Star Trek all got movie reboots ( Trek also got a television one , if you count Enterprise ) , Star Wars gained new life as a TV show , Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica was reborn to much acclaim , unlike fellow television reboots Bionic Woman , Knight Rider and V .
We even have Tron waiting in the wings for next year , along with a new Charlie 's Angels TV show .
The most successful " new " media franchises were Transformers and Spider - Man - based on ideas that are over two decades old ( You could even argue that things like Lost and Twilight are simply mashing up old ideas into relatively new forms ; they 're definitely standing on the shoulders of giants , at least ) .
So what happened ?
It 's easy to just say " Well , the geeks are in charge of media now , " even if it 's not necessarily untrue .
But that does n't explain how they got there , and why they 're not making us fall in love with all manner of new things , instead of retreads of old flames ( Does Fringe count as new , or just an updated X - Files ? ) .
Personally , I think the blame is shared pretty much equally between creators and the audience .
For all that we may cry YARM whenever someone talks about their dream to make the ultimate Logan 's Run project , it 's as much a desire to succeed as creative backwards - looking that 's behind it ; audiences , for the most part , tend not to support the new in numbers necessary to make it a big success .
Look at the most successful movies of the last ten years :
Each one is based on a concept that people grew up on .

So , is it simply nostalgia ?
Perhaps ; it 's tempting to play armchair psychologist and stroke the chin , commenting on a return to childhood things following the trauma of 9/11 , but it does n't quite fit , because how does that explain the domination of 2000's The Grinch or 1999's Phantom Menace ?
You can see definite post - 9/11 tropes throughout the pop culture that followed ( A simpler morality , where good guys always won and could save us from death from above , in many cases ; stories of people dealing with increasingly familiar apocalypses in others ) , but I do n't think that the prevalence of reboots was necessarily one of them .
It 's not laziness , either ; some reboots ( Battlestar Galactica , for example ) put in as much work as any original concept in terms of worldbuilding and creation .
In the end , it may simply be the result of conservatism on everyone 's parts : Audiences do n't want to spend time or money on something they do n't know will entertain them , and studios / creators do n't want to spend time or money on something that they do n't know will have an audience waiting for it .
Movies like District 9 or Moon , web content like Dr. Horrible and the increasing use of comic books as source material for other media back this up , to an extent ; the new ideas , and new voices , now have to find new - and cheaper - outlets through which to make themselves known , and become popular and proven enough for the big time .
Maybe that 'll have happened by the time they 've been around long enough to be nostalgic about .
Another immortal inspiration has found a new design revival and practical usage .
The French product designer Stephanie Choplin has incarnated the Tetris idea into colorful ceramic pots or just Tetris Pots .
Born as a simple experiment during the ceramic course in the Estonian Academy of Arts , Stephanie ’s initial idea was to personally carry out the model , the mould , the molding , coloring and cooking .
Unfortunately the model was too big with complex molding of 2 parts and the final result was not satisfying .
So what ’s left is the brilliant idea , illustrated in 3D models below , waiting for go - getting production .
Anybody to give them another try ?
I ’m definitely buying .
Instead of the Tetris Pots , Stephanie Choplin decided to carry out a single form and create several objects using the same form .
So with a smart tweak and re-shape of the traditional cup , you ’ve got an impressive complementing ceramic cup set , that your kitchen will fell in love with .

As Jim Chanos , who pointed out this Bloomberg piece “ Arming Goldman With Pistols Against Public , ” remarked , “ Well , it appears that Goldman ’s Best and Brightest may be hedging their goodwill built up by doing ‘ God ’s work ’ . ”
I ’ve heard the expression , “ Trust in Allah , but tie up your camel , ” but I ca n’t recall an exhortation that links faith with carrying firearms ( although I suppose that gap in my knowledge may reflect a cloistered upbringing ) .
The only heavily armed observant types I can think of in the US are the Branch Davidians , and we know how that movie turned out .
Goldman has always been a cult , but one has to wonder what models they are now channeling .
In all seriousness , having grown up in a parts of the country where hunting season ( deer and turkey ) were a big deal , I get nervous when people who have little or no history of using firearms start toting them .
There are rules most people who use guns routinely are taught , and my experience is that those individuals are far more careful than newbies who have seen way more movie and TV gunplay than real world use .
If you are worried about self defense , programs like this one ( I ’m not endorsing it , just using it as an example ) are a safer and more effective solution to the real problem ( what good is your pistol if you are jumped from behind ? )
End of sermon and back to fun .
From Alice Schroeder at Bloomberg :
“ I just wrote my first reference for a gun permit , ” said a friend , who told me of swearing to the good character of a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who applied to the local police for a permit to buy a pistol .
The banker had told this friend of mine that senior Goldman people have loaded up on firearms and are now equipped to defend themselves if there is a populist uprising against the bank .
I called Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag to ask whether it ’s true that Goldman partners feel they need handguns to protect themselves from the angry proletariat .
He did n’t call me back .
The New York Police Department has told me that “ as a preliminary matter ” it believes some of the bankers I inquired about do have pistol permits .
The NYPD also said it will be a while before it can name names …..
Has it really come to this ?
Imagine what emotions must be billowing through the halls of Goldman Sachs to provoke the firm into an apology .
Talk that Goldman bankers might have armed themselves in self - defense would sound ludicrous , were it not so apt a metaphor for the way that the most successful people on Wall Street have become a target for public rage .
Yves here .
This is n’t hard to understand at all .
Goldman ran afoul of one of Machiavell ’s big rules : “ Men sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony . ”
Or its 21st century variant : “ You can take from all of the people some of the time , and some of the people all of the time , but you cannot take from all the people all of the time .
” But the banksters , and Goldman in particular , have been determined to push the limits of those formulas , and are learning , much to their surprise , that they neglected to consider the intensity of the backlash that might result from their considerable success in extracting rents from the populace .
Or did they ?
Back to Schroeder :
Common sense tells you a handgun is probably not even all that useful …
As for carrying a loaded pistol when you venture outside , dream on .
Concealed gun permits are almost impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain in New York or nearby states .
In other words , a little humility and contrition are probably the better route .
Until a couple of weeks ago , that was obvious to everyone but Goldman , a firm famous for both prescience and arrogance .
In a display of both , Blankfein began to raise his personal - security threat level …
He keeps a summer home near the Hamptons , where unrestricted public access would put him at risk if the angry mobs rose up and marched to the East End of Long Island .
He tried to buy a house elsewhere without attracting attention …
Then , Blankfein got permission from the local authorities to install a security gate at his house two months before Bear Stearns Cos. collapsed … .
Blankfein somehow anticipated the persecution complex his fellow bankers would soon suffer .
Surely , though , this man who can afford to surround himself with a private army of security guards is n’t sleeping with the key to a gun safe under his pillow .
The thought is just too bizarre to be true .
So maybe other senior people at Goldman Sachs have gone out and bought guns , and they know something .
But what ?..
There you have it .
The bailout was meant to keep the curtain drawn on the way the rich make money , not from the free market , but from the lack of one .
Goldman
Sachs blew its cover when the firm ’s revenue from trading reached a record $ 27 billion in the first nine months of this year , and a public that was writhing in financial agony caught on that the profits earned on taxpayer capital were going to pay employee bonuses …
No , talk of Goldman and guns plays right into the way Wall - Streeters like to think of themselves .
Even those who were bailed out believe they are tough , macho Clint Eastwoods of the financial frontier , protecting the fistful of dollars in one hand with the Glock in the other .
The last thing they want is to be so reasonably paid that the peasants have no interest in lynching them .
Yves here .
For the record , in the 1980s , people in the industry were greedy on a much more modest scale .
A nice ( and I mean nice , not ostentatious ) apartment on the Upper East Side , private school for the kids , summer home , nanny , and a BMW or equivalent meant you were successful .
And pretty much all i-Bankers , those at Goldman included , were careful not to flaunt their wealth .
There was genuine horror when the story broke that Mike Milken made $ 500 million in a single year .
It was seen as not as a titanic achievement , but as confirmation that something crooked must be up at Drexel .

A simple illustration of the Gamburtsevs inferred from new gravity data
Enlarge Image
Scientists who mapped one of the most enigmatic mountain ranges on Earth have given a first glimpse of their data .
An international team spent two months in 2008/ 9 surveying the Gamburtsevs in Antarctica - a series of peaks totally buried under the ice cap .
The group has told a major conference in the US that the hidden mountains are more jagged than previously thought .
They are also more linear in shape than the sparse data collected in the past had suggested .
This latter finding hints at a possible origin for the mountains whose existence has perplexed scientists for 50 years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" If you have a linear structure it makes them more like the Alps or the Appalachians , " explained Dr Michael Studinger from the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory ( LDEO ) of Columbia University , New York .
" These are mountain ranges that formed by the collision of tectonic plates . "
But he stressed that the analysis of the survey data was in its infancy and the team would publish their final assessments in forthcoming papers in the formal scientific literature .
The conditions during the survey were extremely harsh
Dr Studinger is one of the leading scientists on the AGAP ( Antarctica 's Gamburtsev Province ) project .
He has been speaking here at the American Geophysical Union 's ( AGU ) Fall Meeting , the world 's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists .
The mountains were discovered by a Soviet team during the International Geophysical Year in 1957 - 8 .
Their detection was a complete surprise because the rock bed in the middle of the Antarctic continent was assumed to be relatively flat .
It led many to speculate that the Gamburtsevs might be old " hot spot " volcanoes that had punched their way through the Earth 's crust , much like the Hawaiian islands have done in the middle of the Pacific .
EXPANDING ICE SHEET BACK NEXT 1 of 4
The range has since become the subject of intense scientific fascination because it was almost certainly a nucleation point some 30 million years ago for the huge ice sheets now covering Antarctica .
Studying them has been immensely difficult , however .
Conditions are brutal ; temperatures can go below - 80C .
It was only with the concerted effort organised around International Polar Year in 2007 - 8 that a full - scale aerogeophysical survey became possible .
Two instrumented Twin- Otter aircraft were flown out of remote field camps and collected a range of data .
They crisscrossed the hidden peaks , flying a total of 120,000 km .
They gathered gravity , magnetic and ice thickness information , took radar images of the rock bed and the layers within the ice ; and made a map of the ice - sheet 's surface with a laser .
" We have now reached a point in the data processing that allows us to start scientific work with the data , " Dr Studinger told BBC News .
ANTARCTICA'S GAMBURTSEV MOUNTAINS
Aircraft flew over the surface , taking images of the ice and rock underneath
The shallowest ice covering the mountains is hundreds of metres thick .
The deepest ice detected is about 4,800 m thick .
The mountains themselves are standing about 2,500 m above sea level .
It is now clear the range has a defined linear trend , in contrast to the previously mapped circular feature , and that this trend strikes predominantly to the north - east .
The data also reveals a very rugged landscape with high peaks and deeply incised valleys which have been worked in the past by both river and ice processes .
" Before we had this data we could n't see the valleys and therefore we had no way of being able to quantify the role of glacial and fluvial processes which is key to understanding cryosphere and climate evolution , " said Dr Fausto Ferraccioli from the British Antarctic Survey .
Studying what happened in these valleys could give clues as to how fast the Gamburtsevs became encased in ice .
The Twin Otter planes flew back and forth across the ice
The survey also detected pockets of liquid water at the base of the ice and the team will now try to work out if and how these ponds might be interconnected .
" We 're seeing evidence of water in the very centre of the ice sheet , " said Dr Robin Bell , also from LDEO .
" We 're really excited about being able to use this dataset to see how valleys that were carved by rivers and then overprinted by glaciers are now driving waters underneath the ice sheet . "
In addition , Dr Ferraccioli said it was possible a location could be found where ices might be drilled to retrieve information on the ancient climate of Antarctica .
" There could be ice that is older than 1.2 million years - somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 million years , " he told BBC News .
" We will have to do an analysis of the ice layers .
But I think it 's going to be quite a challenge because the topography is very rough and the layers are quite buckled . "
Chinese scientists reported in June the results of survey data they had acquired at the Gamburtsevs .
This was , however , just a 30 km by 30 km square .
In the AGAP project , over 20 % ( one - fifth ) of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was explored .
The AGAP field stations were in the middle of nowhere

I was pretty excited when I came up with the idea of examining and showcasing some of the most famous beer and alcohol - related websites from a number of countries around the world .
After all , who does n’t like the odd drink now and again ?
( Well , besides me — I ca n’t stand alcohol in any form . )
Surely this would make for an interesting article that would elicit quite a few comments .
Well , if that ’s the result , it would n’t be for the reasons I suspected when beginning to research this piece .

Surely this would make for an interesting article that would elicit quite a few comments .
Well , if that ’s the result , it would n’t be for the reasons I suspected when beginning to research this piece .
Instead , I ’ve concluded — due to problems related to typography , accessibility , and usability — that the apparent “ beauty ” present on many of the websites related to this industry is merely “ skin deep ” .
To put it quite bluntly , the designers and developers people responsible for decision - making in the beer and alcohol website industry should be ashamed of themselves for creating such horrendous user experiences .
My analysis here will attempt to inspire modern - day designers and developers to avoid imitating the superficial design and development techniques employed by these web professionals .
You may also be interested in the following related posts :
But I wo n’t just focus on the negative .
There are some positive things to be mentioned , and a showcase of some of the nice sites is certainly in order , so that will round out the article ( and might even fool a few of the “ I ’m here for the pictures ” visitors ) .
The Painful “ Age Verification ” Screen
Something that is common to nearly every site I found when researching this article is that all the sites require that you confirm your date of birth before you can view the content of the site .
Obviously , alcohol is a very serious issue , and reasonable precautions must be taken to ensure that the owners of these sites are not encouraging underage drinking .
So , typically , a site will have a “ date picker ” form where the website visitor can enter their date of birth ( month , day , and year ) , as shown below on the Corona website :
A Legal Requirement ?
Or a Waste of Time ?
Since it is impossible for such a welcome screen to actually ensure the user is really old enough to drink , then why not simplify this process ?
You ’ll notice that the welcome screen on the Corona website also asks the user to enter their country of residence , which further complicates the process of entering the site .
But do n’t get me wrong ; I am not suggesting that alcohol - related websites remove the age verification screen .
In most countries , they ’re probably required by law to do this .
I ’m suggesting that they make this process easier for the user .
First of all , if you want to know what part of the world your website visitors are from , use Google Analytics ( or similar technology ) , or track IP addresses .
Do n’t waste your visitors ’ time with a question that they could lie about anyhow .
I certainly hope the owners of these sites are not depending on those statistics for any serious demographic analysis .
But more importantly , since the user can enter any date of birth they want , and the site will never permanently block a person that enters a non-qualifying date , why not just have a simple screen that clearly asks if they are of drinking age in their country of residence ?
It was surprising how many sites did not have a simple means of entering .
Below are two of the few examples that I found that had a user - friendly intro page :
Christiania Vodka
JETT VODKA
At the very least , if you must ask for their age , why not just ask for the year ?
It ’s true that the person ’s exact day of birth could determine whether or not they ’re qualified to enter , but let ’s be honest here — this screen is n’t stopping anyone .
And you ca n’t drink a website .
So simplify the process and get on with what you really want people to see .
During my research , I wondered if there were any laws in Canada or the United States that required the use of such a splash page .
I contacted Labatt Breweries of Canada and I was informed that there was no law requiring the age verification screen , but that it was a company policy to have the user enter their date of birth .
Okay , that ’s fair enough .
But I wondered why they would opt for the complicated version over the simple examples shown above .
The woman I spoke to reemphasized that it was a company policy to have the user enter their exact date of birth .
She suspects it ’s the same for most other companies as well .
I had also contacted Anheuser - Busch but had n’t heard back from them .
Maybe the site owners are ensuring that they do n’t risk any legal trouble ( regardless of laws ) , thinking that the more difficult the process , the better it would look in their behalf .
But considering the age form is n’t really stopping anyone from entering , it ’s more likely that these sites suffer from poor usability management and tend to fall back on bad habits that were carried over from the old days of the web design industry .
Also , some sites did have a simplified version of the age verification screen ( as shown above ) , so there really is no reason for the overly complex version of that screen .
If anyone involved in the alcohol website industry would like to provide some feedback on this matter in the comments , I will make any corrections as needed .
Unnecessary Complications
Some age verification screens are complicated for no good reason , and certainly for no legal reason .
Take for example the Budweiser landing page :
After selecting the month and day you were born , the years are shown in 10 - year blocks , with the start of each decade representing each block .
In order to select the specific year you were born , you have to hover over the appropriate block , then slowly move your cursor until the year you want appears .
What a usability nightmare !
The Samuel Adams website goes beyond ridiculous in who it allows to enter .
Initially the user is presented with this screen :
Then , after you ’ve entered a date of birth , you ’re informed that you ’ve “ signed in ” ( which is not technically correct and can potentially be confusing ) and now you have to reenter your year of birth :
It ’s safe to say the Samuel Adams ’ website architects have turned the bad intro page into an art form .
Yet another example that has two different age verification screens is the Rémy Martin website .
When you first visit , you ’re presented with this screen , unnecessarily created with a barely usable Flash - based date picker :
Then you ’re redirected to a completely different domain , and once again are asked to enter your age :
The site colors and branding are different from the first screen , leaving the user wondering if they ’re even still on the correct website .
I really do n’t know what they ’re thinking with this dual age verification system , but it ’s obvious that the site architects have little knowledge of modern website usability best practices .
Below is another overly - complex age verification screen , on the ZIMA website .
Try to find your year of birth in this unnecessary mess :
Another problem with the age verification screen was that some sites required you to manually enter a 4 - digit year , while others allowed you to choose a year from a < select > box .
The Busch Beer site is one of a few sites that expects the user to enter the year in just two digits :
After customarily entering a year in 4 - digit text format , or from a familiar select box , this 2 - digit option comes as a bit of a surprise .
So naturally , when I tried to enter the site , I typed a 4 - digit year beginning with 19 — and the “ 19 ” part stuck .
I got this error message :
What if I was born in 1919 ?
Well , after some experimentation , I discovered that anyone born before 1930 is considered “ too old to drink ” ( which is fine ) , but despite initially receiving an error message , if you continue to attempt to enter a year prior to 1930 , the site instead redirects the user to Worlds of Discovery , “ a place of enjoyment for people of all ages . ”
All usability problems aside , that was pretty funny .
You may have also noticed the 1999 - style “ site requirements ” notification in the above screenshots .
Another strong reminder that the sites we ’re dealing with here seem to be managed and developed by people who have not done a whole lot of research on modern design and usability trends .
Overuse of Superficial Elements
What makes a website “ cool ” today , is not the same as what made a website “ cool ” 8 years ago .
In fact , if you did n’t know any better , after visiting 10 or more alcohol - related websites , you ’d think it was 2001 .
It was astounding how many of these sites employed self - indulgent , superficial techniques that make the entire experience quite a drag .
While perusing some of these sites , I often had no idea what was clickable , when an animation was going to finish , or where a particular sound was coming from .
Too Much Flash Animation
Most modern developers understand that creating an entire website in Flash is rarely a good choice .
Granted , in some industries Flash is useful for full sites .
Kids websites and games sites are two good examples .
But for the most part , the use of Flash in the alcohol web design niche is often unnecessary and seems to be used in a trendy way because of the false assumption that a complex
Flash site equates to a “ classy , upscale ” experience .
As mentioned , around 2001 , that may have been the impression that users got , but that ’s not the case anymore .
The Seagram ’s Gin website is one of many examples of a full Flash website , an extremely common practice in this industry .
Why Not JavaScript - Based Animation ?
I ’m not saying that these sites should never use Flash .
Some of the sites I visited had some complex user interactivity that would certainly require the use of Flash - based technology .
But in many cases , animation and effects could be implemented through good semantic code manipulated unobtrusively with jQuery or another JavaScript library .
For example , the Finlandia vodka website has a mostly - Flash interface with promo boxes that could have been done with plain HTML and JavaScript :
Another site that overused Flash is the Three Olives Vodka website .
Take a look at the screen capture below :
The content section displays the different vodka flavors , with a Flash - animated rollover effect for each bottle — which is understandable since the animation is somewhat complex .
But the entire site is created in Flash , including the very static logo , top navigation , and text - based footer .
All of those sections could have been done using conventional coding methods , making the site cleaner and more usable .
In fact , many of the animations on this site could have been accomplished with JavaScript , making the experience much more up - to - date , intuitive , and flexible for future development .
The BACARDI website is another one done completely in Flash , including the header , footer and dropdown menus — all of which could have been done with HTML and JavaScript without losing anything aesthetically :
Another 8 - year - old web design trend used on many commercial alcohol sites is the “ skip intro ” button , which is obviously a symptom of what was discussed in the previous section — overuse of Flash .
Below are a few examples of sites with Flash intros that have the option to be “ skipped ” .
ZYR Vodka
Bombay Sapphire® Gin
Mount Gay Rum
Even worse , after verifying your age , the Jameson Irish Whiskey website loads up a Flash intro of a super - fancy animated 3 - D cube that does not even have a “ skip ” button :
Auto - Playing Sounds and Video
When Flash is overused , it ’s inevitable that embedded sounds will be also .
Sound should generally only be triggered by the user , and should always have an obvious method for toggling or reducing the volume .
Many of the sites I investigated failed miserably in this regard .
After passing the age verification screen , the Corona website plays an intro-style photo animation with music playing .
As seen in the screen shot below , there is no way to skip this animation and no way to turn off the sound .
The Bud Light website does n’t even wait for you to pass the age verification screen to trigger automatic “ ambient sounds ” ( people talking in the background , like at a party ) .
The sounds are mildly annoying — but at least there ’s an easy - to - locate on / off switch in the top right corner of the screen .
The Blue Moon Brewing Company website is a very beautifully - designed but nightmarishly - unusable site .
It ’s done with a book - style look that has nice animation , but is really out of place on the modern web .
After verifying your age , a lightbox - style overlay initiates to advertise something about New Year ’s Eve .
This overlay is accompanied by the sounds of Auld Lange Syne — with no apparent method to disable the song .
The Michelob website plays a video during the age verification , and again when the site loads .
In both cases this is done without initialization from the user .
In this case , they were n’t annoying and obtrusive , and they were very brief — so I ’ll give them credit for a much nicer and more usable experience than some of those we ’ve already considered .
A better option would have been to have a large play button to indicate the video is there , and allow the users to initiate it at their leisure .
The SKYY Vodka website plays a series of videos after you verify your age .
At first glance , there is no apparent way to disable the videos or the sound .
But when you roll your mouse over the video area , a video toolbar appears allowing you to pause the video and / or turn off the sound .
Better than some of the other options we ’ve considered , but considerably less than user - friendly .
And now for the Russian Standard Vodka website .
What can I say about this horrendous , irritating , and unusable monster of a site ?
It ’s a full Flash , fluid - width site that embeds a giant video as the background in the Flash movie , and , as is common , does not have an obvious way to disable this annoying video that shocks you to your very core — until you realize that clicking anywhere on the background of the movie will toggle the pause / play option .
A true usability nightmare , and one of the most self - indulgent techniques you ’ll ever see on a web page .
They were n’t the only ones to implement this bad practice , however .
The Hennessy website similarly has a giant auto - playing background video with no apparent method to pause or stop it .
The sound can be muted , but the background plays a series of videos with no end in sight .
There were so many more examples of sites that embedded sounds and videos .
It ’s amazing how the sites in this niche hold so much in common in the area of bad practices .
The designers and site architects seem to live in their own little world of “ trendy ” web design and have , for the most part , failed to break out of many old - school techniques from which most modern designers have moved on .
“ Mystery Meat ” Navigation ( in 2009 ? )
Until I started researching this article , I thought mystery meat navigation was an old - school practice that was overcome by a modern - day movement of user - centric design — but that is obviously not the case in the commercial alcohol website industry .
Because of the many superficialities , the overuse of Flash , and other self - indulgent design tendencies , many of the sites in this industry suffer from this “ mystery meat ” or “ Where ’s Waldo ? ” phenomenon — that is , pages where the user has no idea what is clickable and what is not .
Take a look at some of the screen shots below and see if you can clearly identify the clickable elements .
Below each screen shot I ’ve included some explanations to decrypt the “ mystery ” elements so you can see how unusable some of these sites really are .
San Miguel Beer
On the San Miguel Beer website ( above ) , in addition to the navigation bar links , nearly all the graphical elements in the content area are clickable , including the car , the truck , all the doors on the building , and signs .
Who knew ?
Widmer Brothers Brewery
On the Widmer Brothers Brewery site ( above ) , there is a “ mystery ” link associated with each of the following elements : Both Widmer brothers , the big glass of beer , the lemon slice , the bottle cap , the keychain , the laptop , and the dart .
Malibu Rum
After enduring through the auto - playing “ island ” sounds , repeating animations , and the obtrusive “ drink mixer ” overlay advertisement , the Malibu Rum site visitor is presented with a semi-underwater island scene with “ mystery meat ” navigation as the focal point of the page .
The five primary page elements ( the mirror ball , the binoculars , the coconut , the bottle , and the drink mixer ) , however , are not the only clickable items ; there ’s also the satellite dish in the background .
Up to this point , all the examples of “ mystery meat ” navigation display a graphic or text hint , on mouse over , that explains what the clickable item points to .
The next example does n’t even go that far .
Mount Gay Rum
The Mount Gay Rum site ( above ) is all Flash , and the main content area is a book with pages that turn when clicked .
First of all , finding the exact spot to click on the corner of each page is not the smoothest experience .
But there are other clickable elements outside of the book object ; you can click the liquor bottle ( the barely - visible object in the top left , not the one in the content area ) , the glass of rum with ice , and the red hat ( top right ) .
In my experience , after turning the pages and clicking the mystery items multiple times , I still do n’t know what those extra mystery links are for , and why they ’re not labelled .
From my research , many of the sites that do not suffer greatly from the problems discussed above , and are actually fairly usable , incorporated outdated trends and layouts .
A few examples are shown below .
The Miller Lite website is too small for modern screen resolutions .
The Martell Cognac website has tiny font sizes and other small elements .
Beefeater Gin has small navigation text and even smaller drop - down menu text .
The 4Copas Tequila site is somewhat old - looking , uses small typography all over its pages , and has an outdated vertical navigation bar .
The Jack Daniel ’s site is too dark , and many sections are almost unreadable because of the small typography .
Showcase of the Best Sites
As promised , although this article did come down quite hard on the designers and developers of many alcohol - related websites , there are many sites that are well - designed , usable , and do not overuse Flash animation and other obtrusive techniques .
Many of the sites I ’ve already considered are actually nicely designed ( usability issues aside ) .
Therefore , this last section is not necessarily showcasing sites that are “ pretty ” , but instead taking all factors into consideration to compile a list of the highest quality sites , in line with modern web design and development standards and best practices .
Some of these sites have a few of the weaknesses I ’ve discussed , but generally are more intuitive , non-obtrusive , and easier to navigate .

Conclusion
In no way does this article mean to imply that the designers of these sites are not talented .
In fact , most of the designs presented here are far beyond anything that I could personally accomplish .
But , as web developers have learned in recent years , beauty in web design does not guarantee success — and in many cases , a quest for a more visually appealing experience can often weaken the more important aspects of a website .
As shown by the final showcase in this article , not every site in the beer and alcohol website niche is unusable or superficial .
But the number of poorly - executed design and navigational techniques and the overwhelming amount of self - indulgent elements I ’ve discussed here make it clear that this industry has some important ground to make up in usability , accessibility , and best practices .
The SKYY Vodka website plays a series of videos after you verify your age .
At first glance , there is no apparent way to disable the videos or the sound .
But when you roll your mouse over the video area , a video toolbar appears allowing you to pause the video and / or turn off the sound .
Better than some of the other options we ’ve considered , but considerably less than user - friendly .
And now for the Russian Standard Vodka website .
What can I say about this horrendous , irritating , and unusable monster of a site ?
It ’s a full Flash , fluid - width site that embeds a giant video as the background in the Flash movie , and , as is common , does not have an obvious way to disable this annoying video that shocks you to your very core — until you realize that clicking anywhere on the background of the movie will toggle the pause / play option .
A true usability nightmare , and one of the most self - indulgent techniques you ’ll ever see on a web page .
They were n’t the only ones to implement this bad practice , however .
The Hennessy website similarly has a giant auto - playing background video with no apparent method to pause or stop it .
The sound can be muted , but the background plays a series of videos with no end in sight .
There were so many more examples of sites that embedded sounds and videos .
It ’s amazing how the sites in this niche hold so much in common in the area of bad practices .
The designers and site architects seem to live in their own little world of “ trendy ” web design and have , for the most part , failed to break out of many old - school techniques from which most modern designers have moved on .
“ Mystery Meat ” Navigation ( in 2009 ? )
Until I started researching this article , I thought mystery meat navigation was an old - school practice that was overcome by a modern - day movement of user - centric design — but that is obviously not the case in the commercial alcohol website industry .
Because of the many superficialities , the overuse of Flash , and other self - indulgent design tendencies , many of the sites in this industry suffer from this “ mystery meat ” or “ Where ’s Waldo ? ” phenomenon — that is , pages where the user has no idea what is clickable and what is not .
Take a look at some of the screen shots below and see if you can clearly identify the clickable elements .
Below each screen shot I ’ve included some explanations to decrypt the “ mystery ” elements so you can see how unusable some of these sites really are .
San Miguel Beer
On the San Miguel Beer website ( above ) , in addition to the navigation bar links , nearly all the graphical elements in the content area are clickable , including the car , the truck , all the doors on the building , and signs .
Who knew ?
Widmer Brothers Brewery
On the Widmer Brothers Brewery site ( above ) , there is a “ mystery ” link associated with each of the following elements : Both Widmer brothers , the big glass of beer , the lemon slice , the bottle cap , the keychain , the laptop , and the dart .
Malibu Rum
After enduring through the auto - playing “ island ” sounds , repeating animations , and the obtrusive “ drink mixer ” overlay advertisement , the Malibu Rum site visitor is presented with a semi-underwater island scene with “ mystery meat ” navigation as the focal point of the page .
The five primary page elements ( the mirror ball , the binoculars , the coconut , the bottle , and the drink mixer ) , however , are not the only clickable items ; there ’s also the satellite dish in the background .
Up to this point , all the examples of “ mystery meat ” navigation display a graphic or text hint , on mouse over , that explains what the clickable item points to .
The next example does n’t even go that far .
Mount Gay Rum
The Mount Gay Rum site ( above ) is all Flash , and the main content area is a book with pages that turn when clicked .
First of all , finding the exact spot to click on the corner of each page is not the smoothest experience .
But there are other clickable elements outside of the book object ; you can click the liquor bottle ( the barely - visible object in the top left , not the one in the content area ) , the glass of rum with ice , and the red hat ( top right ) .

If you ’re reading this and thinking that I ’ve chosen a few specific examples to serve as a basis for an overblown opinion , you should know that there were dozens of other examples of poor usability and downright annoyances that I did n’t include .
I also did not discuss special needs users , graceful degradation , semantic markup , and table - based layouts — any of which could have provided further evidence that these sites , for the most part , are downright awful .
Maybe there are underlying reasons for many of the decisions made in these designs .
Those reasons could be due to business politics , legal issues , or even a failure to encourage forward thinking — so I will acknowledge that some of these criticisms could be , upon further analysis , overly harsh .
Or maybe these problems have something to do with the possibility that these designers are exposed to a lot of free alcohol … ?
Hmm …
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : new installment of failure framework
We 'd like to announce the next installment of the Failure Framework .
Based on feedback , our main goals in this release is to reduce the number of external dependencies and avoid complications with monad transformer libraries at the core of the framework .
We have made the following changes : * Failure is not tied directly to monads anymore .
The main typeclass is Failure , which provides the failure function .
MonadFailure , ApplicativeFailure and FunctorFailure are provided for convenience .
*
The Failure typeclass is now located in the failure package , which has no dependencies .
All code dealing with transformers and mtl has been factored into control - monad - failure and control - monad - failure - mtl , respectively .
In addition , we are simultaneously releasing the following packages : * safe - failure provides safe versions of dangerous , non total functions , such as head , by returning failures .
It depends exclusively on failure .
* attempt provides a concrete data type for handling extensible exceptions as failures .
It depends exclusively on failure .
* control - monad - attempt provides a monad transformer for attempt using the transformers library .
We do not provide currently an mtl version of this package , but can provide one if there is demand .
* control - monad - exception , explicitly typed , checked exceptions with monadic stack traces .
Below are the links to the packages just released .
Enjoy !

The Winter Meetings are going on right now , and , despite that Twitter seems to have exploded with hot stove rumors , the chances of anything really huge happening are pretty slim .
A three - way trade here or a too - high contract offer to John Lackey there is pretty much all we can hope to expect .
One thing we know for sure , though , is that we wo n’t be seeing any record contracts being dealt out in Indy this week .
In fact , it ’s been a long time since we last heard the words “ the new highest paid player in baseball ” .
It was nine years ago Thursday , when Tom Hicks ( yes , the same Tom Hicks who has piled the Rangers under mountains of debt ) signed Alex Rodriguez to the richest contract in sports history , totalling 10 years and $ 252 million .
Since then , we ’ve had a few different players take the mantle of “ 2nd Highest Paid Player ” ( and we ’ve even had A - Rod outdo himself ) , but no one has yet been able to de- throne the Yankees ’ third baseman from his place on high .
And it ’s not looking like anyone will in the near future .
Which makes it a perfect time to look back at the history of the highest paid player in baseball .
Using newspaper accounts of the signings , and my rough knowledge / recollections , I was able to trace back the title of “ highest paid player ” in baseball all the way back to Nolan Ryan ’s 4 year , $ 4 million contract signed in the winter of 1979 .
For example , when Mike Piazza signed his then - record seven - year , $ 91 million contract with the Mets on Oct 26 , 1998 , the New York Times article announcing the signing said this : “ Piazza surpassed pitcher Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox , who last December signed a six - year contract averaging $ 12.5 million a year , as the highest - paid player in baseball history . ”
If I then went back to the article announcing Pedro ’s contract signing , it would tell me that Greg Maddux and Barry Bonds were the last two players to hold the title , and so on .
While this proved a little tricky , especially in the mid-80s , when the press had n’t decided on a good standard for judging contacts , etc. , I was able to fill in all the gaps .
And by “ all the gaps ” , I mean every single player who , at the time of their contract signing , was considered the highest paid player in baseball – even if it was for only a day or two .
So , the three days that Rickey Henderson was at the top of the charts in late - 1989 , or the two days that Mike Hampton owned the largest total contract ever , are accounted for here .
There are a few caveats before I get to the list :
For the list , I only considered the player whose average annual salary over the life of his contract was the highest at the time of signing .
Just because the Twins gave Gary Gaetti some weird three year contract in 1989 that allowed him to choose how much of his total four million he got paid each year does n’t mean that we should consider him the highest paid player in baseball .
The same with Dan Quisenberry and his odd real - estate deal he signed with the Royals that made his earnings for 1989 almost $ 3 million .
This also means that ridiculously backloaded contracts do not knock someone off the list just because their average annual salary is less than the salary the backloaded player earned that year .
If I had to go into those nuances , then I ’d be facing something like this every season .
I ’ve tried to use the terms at the time they were signed as the value of the contract .
Ryne Sandberg , for example , signed a four - year , $ 28.4 million contract ( $ 7.1 mil / yr ) in 1992 , but retired before the contract ended .
If we adjusted for the money he actually earned , his average annual salary would drop below $ 7 million .
But that would n’t accurately reflect the baseball world as of 1992 , so I did not make those adjustments .
I also tried to track the highest total contract value as it was broken .
This usually went hand - in - hand with the highest average annual salary , but not always .
Mike Hampton ’s $ 123 million contract , for instance , was far and away the largest ever total package at the time it was signed , but his $ 15.3 million average annual salary was less than Carlos Delgado ’s $ 17 million average annual salary .
Hampton made my list , though , because the total package is newsworthy in itself .
Finally , while I made every effort to verify my completeness from Ryan to A - Rod , I suspect that I may have missed one or two players , especially there in the mid-80s .
If anyone can show that I skipped over someone who , for however briefly , was the highest paid player in baseball by average annual salary , please let me know .
I ’d be happy to include them .
That should be it for the caveats .
On to the list !
( click “ Read More ” to continue reading ) A Timeline of the Highest Paid Player in Baseball 11/19/79 : Nolan Ryan ( Houston Astros ) , 3 years / $ 3.5 million , $ 1.17 million Average Annual Salary ( AAS ) [ source ]
The first $ 1 million - man , Ryan made great use of the new economic frontier when he went home to Texas in the winter of 1979 .
His total contract was for 4 years and $ 4.5 million ( including bonus ) , but only the first three years were guaranteed .
Those details were n’t all that important , though .
Breaking the $ 1 million barrier was all that mattered .
12/15/80 : Dave Winfield ( New York Yankees ) , 10 years / $ 25 million , $ 2.5 million AAS [ source ]
1/26/81 : Dave Winfield ( New York Yankees ) , 10 years / $ 20 - 24 million , $ 2 - 2.4 million AAS [ source ]
Winfield ’s contract was initially signed and announced in December 1980 .
The value was given at approximately $ 25 million – a base salary of about $ 1.6 million per year plus a cost - of - living adjustment each year not to exceed 10 % .
It did n’t take long for Steinbrenner to freak out , though , saying that he misunderstood the terms .
The two parties later renegotiated the contract to drop the cost - of - living adjustment down some .
I could never find a consensus value for the new contract .
Some would refer to it as a $ 24 million contract , while some would say $ 20 million or $ 22 million .
Since the exact value was hard to pinpoint , it was a little tough to determine if someone ’s contract ( like George Foster , Gary Carter , Mike Schmidt , Jim Rice , or Ozzie Smith ) definitely exceeded Winfield’s .
In the end , though , I stuck with Winfield because I could never convince myself that any of the other contracts were absolutely bigger than his .

9/4/85 : Eddie Murray ( Baltimore Orioles ) , 5 years / $ 13.5 million , $ 2.7 million AAS [ source ]
Murray ’s contract was either 5 yrs / $ 13 mil or 5 yrs / $ 13.5 mil , depending on if you included the signing bonus .
I credit Murray with the extra $ 500,000 , since that stays in step with how we value contracts today .
Not that it mattered when compared to Winfield ’s contract .
Either way , Murray was earning the highest average annual salary by September 1985 .
2/16/89 : Orel Hershiser ( Los Angeles Dodgers ) , 3 years / $ 7.9 million , $ 2.63 million AAS [ source ]
The exact total of Murray ’s contract does matter here , though .
Without the signing bonus , Hershiser squeaks into the lead , but falls slightly behind if it is included .
Like I said , I tend to think Murray should still be ranked # 1 here .
I mostly include Hershiser to point out what happened that week .
On February 8 , Dwight Gooden signed a 3 yr / $ 6.7 million extension ( $ 2.23 mil/yr ) .
On February 15 , Roger Clemens signed a 3 yr / $ 7.5 million extension ( $ 2.5 mil/yr ) .
The next day , February 16 , Hershiser reached his agreement .
It was a good week for the three pitchers .
**EDIT
4/19/89 : Frank Viola ( Minnesota Twins ) , 3 years / $ 7.9 million , $ 2.63 million AAS [ source ]
Reader martin_s pointed this out in the comments below .
After winning the 1988 AL Cy Young , he entered into some contentious negotiations with the Twins .
At one point , it was reported that he would be signing an $ 8 + million contract , and then he said that the negotiations were done for the year .
In the end , he ended up signing a deal equal to Orel Hershiser ’s , making the two 1988 Cy Young winners twin highest paid players .
11/17/89 : Bret Saberhagen ( Kansas City Royals ) , 3 years / $ 8.9 million , $ 2.97 million AAS [ source ]
On November 15 , 1989 , Bret Saberhagen won his second American League Cy Young award in convincing fashion .
Two days later , the Royals rewarded him by making him the highest paid player in baseball .
The title would n’t last very long …

The title would n’t last very long …
11/22/89 : Kirby Puckett ( Minnesota Twins ) , 3 years / $ 9 million , $ 3 million AAS
11/28/89 : Rickey Henderson ( Oakland A’s ) , 4 years / $ 12 million , $ 3 million AAS
12/1/89 : Mark Langston ( California Angels ) , 5 years / $ 16 million , $ 3.2 million AAS [ source ]
Five days later , the Twins bested the Royals by making Kirby Puckett the first $ 3 million man in baseball .
Six days later , Rickey Henderson matched Puckett in average annual salary but also received an additional year on the contract .
Three days after that , the Angels lured free agent Mark Langston to the Big A with a five year , $ 16 million contract .
Owners were bursting at the seams that winter to spend their money .
12/11/89 : Mark Davis ( Kansas City Royals ) , 4 years / $ 13 million , $ 3.25 million AAS [ source ]
And it was n’t over .
Less than two weeks later , the Royals made another splash , this time signing the National League Cy Young winner , closer Mark Davis , to the newest “ highest paying contract in baseball . ”
That ’s right , the winter of 1989 , the Kansas City Royals not only signed both reigning Cy Young winners , they signed them each to , what was at the time , the highest salary in baseball .
Those were different times .
1/17/90 : Dave Stewart ( Oakland A’s ) , 2 years / $ 7 million , $ 3.5 million AAS [ source ]
1/22/90 : Will Clark ( San Francisco Giants ) , 4 years / $ 15 million , $ 3.75 million AAS [ source ]
The hot stove cooled down for a few weeks but , in mid-January 1990 , the Bay Area heated it right back up .
First , Oakland ace Dave Stewart signed a two - year extension that made him the highest paid player in baseball .
Five days later , San Francisco ’s slugging first baseman Will Clark bested him with a four - year , $ 15 million deal .
4/9/90 : Don Mattingly ( New York Yankees ) , 5 years / $ 19.3 million , $ 3.86 million AAS [ source ]
The Yankees got into the mess a few months later , as Opening Day approached , signing Mattingly to a five year contract .
A good chart of high - value contracts at the time can be found here .
6/28/90 : Jose Canseco ( Oakland A’s ) , 5 years / $ 23.5 million , $ 4.7 million AAS [ source ]
But it was Canseco who broke the bank that season .
His five year extension signed in the middle of the 1990 season gave him an average annual salary of $ 4.7 million , nearly $ 1 million - per - year more than Mattingly .
2/8/91 : Roger Clemens ( Boston Red Sox ) , 4 years / $ 21.521 million , $ 5.38 million AAS [ source ]
The following winter , Clemens became baseball ’s first $ 5 million - man .
At this point , most players whose contracts made them the highest paid player in baseball were players signing extensions with their old teams .
That would change some in the ’90s .
12/2/91 : Bobby Bonilla ( New York Mets ) , 5 years / $ 29 million , $ 5.8 million AAS [ source ]
Bonilla , for example , left Barry Bonds and the Pirates for the Mets and their nearly $ 6 million / year deal .
3/2/92 : Ryne Sandberg ( Chicago Cubs ) , 4 years / $ 28.4 million , $ 7.1 million AAS [ source ]
Sandberg , of course , stayed on with the Cubs , but not until they made him the game ’s first $ 7 million / year player .
As I said earlier , he retired before the end of his contract , so he did n’t earn the full $ 28.4 million .
Still , there was no way for anyone to know that at the time .
8/24/92 : Cal Ripken , Jr. ( Baltimore Orioles ) , 5 years / $ 32.5 million , $ 6.5 million AAS * [ source ]
For Cal ’s 32nd birthday , the Orioles awarded him the largest total package in baseball history .
By making the deal for five years , he sacrificed the title of “ highest paid player in baseball ” , but he did become the sport ’s first $ 30 million - man .
12/6/92 : Barry Bonds ( San Francisco Giants ) , 6 years / $ 43.75 million , $ 7.29 million AAS [ source ]
Bonds broke through after he declared free agency from the Pirates in the winter of 1992 .
The three - time National League Most Valuable Player went home to San Francisco and the $ 43 million contract offered by new owner Peter Magowan .
It would keep Bonds as the top paid player for a few years .
1/7/93 : Cecil Fielder ( Detroit Tigers ) , 5 years / $ 36 million , $ 7.2 million AAS [ source ]
Unless , of course , you follow the strange math on display here .
Basically , the argument is that , considering the way a signing bonus is counted in the salary formula ( including interest , etc. ) , Bonds ’ $ 7,291,667 average annual salary drops below Fielder ’s $ 7,200,000 .
It ’s a nitpicky little argument , and not one I agree with , but I figured I ’d include it here for the heck of it .
1/31/96 : Ken Griffey , Jr. ( Seattle Mariners ) , 4 years / $ 34 million , $ 8.5 million AAS [ source ]
One of the most memorable events in Seattle Mariners ’ history happened in October 1995 , when the Mariners squeaked passed the Yankees in Game 5 of the ALDS .
Griffey , of course , played a key role in that fifth and deciding game .
Four months later , the Mariners signed Kid Griffey to a four year contract that averaged out to $ 8.5 million per year , blowing Bonds and Fielder out of the water .
11/19/96 : Albert Belle ( Chicago White Sox ) , 5 years / $ 55 million , $ 11 million AAS [ source ]
But the biggest blow came that November , ten months later .
Cleveland ’s surly star , Albert “ Do n’t Call Me Joey or I ’ll Run You Over ” Belle tested the market and found a taker in the White Sox ’s Jerry Reinsdorf .
By the time the contract was signed , the $ 9 million / year and $ 10 million / year barriers had been blown past and Albert Belle was sitting pretty at $ 11 million / year .
It was a huge leap forward .
The Associated Press had a good table describing the state of players ’ salaries at the time .
4/2/97 : Gary Sheffield ( Florida Marlins ) , 6 years / $ 61 million , $ 10.17 million AAS * [ source ]
As the 1997 season started , the still young Florida Marlins made a splash by inking Gary Sheffield to the biggest contract extension in history .
The average salary did not beat Belle ’s $ 11 million per year , but the total package of $ 61 million was the largest ever for a major leaguer .

4/20/97 : Barry Bonds ( San Francisco Giants ) , 2 years / $ 22.9 million , $ 11.45 million AAS [ source ]
Bonds also signed a contract extension that April ( apparently , teams were trying to beat the luxury tax by signing extensions after the season began ) .
It was only a two - year extension this time , but it put Bonds back atop the salary boards at nearly $ 11.5 million per year .
8/10/97 : Greg Maddux ( Atlanta Braves ) , 5 years / $ 57.5 million , $ 11.5 million AAS [ source ]
That summer , the Braves made Greg Maddux the first pitcher in six years to be the highest paid player in baseball with a five - year extension .
Maddux ’s agent , Scott Boras , apparently made Maddux being the highest paid player in baseball an important part of the deal .
“ This deal does n’t happen if there was n’t a shortage of pitching , ” he said .
” Our industry is starved for pitching . ”
12/10/97 : Pedro Martinez ( Boston Red Sox ) , 6 years / $ 75 million , $ 12.5 million AAS [ source ]
And that was clearly evident two months later , when the Red Sox made Pedro Martinez the league ’s first $ 12 million man .
For the first time since the winter of 1989 , two pitchers claimed the title of “ highest paid player in baseball ” consecutively .
At least this time it was for two of the greatest pitchers ever , and not Mark Davis .
10/26/98 : Mike Piazza ( New York Mets ) , 7 years / $91 million , $ 13 million AAS [ source ]
Pedro reigned as baseball ’s top earner for just about a year .
In October 1998 , Mike Piazza , who had been shuttled around the league that summer in anticipation of his free agency , cashed in with the Mets .
His seven year deal made him baseball ’s first $ 90 million man and it ’s first $ 13 million / year player .
The industry may have been starved for pitching , but that did n’t mean that Piazza would n’t get his payday .
11/25/98 : Mo Vaughn ( Anaheim Angels ) , 6 years / $ 80 million , $ 13.33 million AAS [ source ]
But maybe it was just that the industry was starved for immobile sluggers as well .
Less than a month after Piazza signed his big contract , the Anaheim Angels of Anaheim topped it by signing Mo Vaughn away from the Red Sox .
12/12/98 : Kevin Brown ( Los Angeles Dodgers ) , 7 years / $ 105 million , $ 15 million AAS [ source ]
But neither of those are the deals that people remember from that winter .
That honor belongs to the Los Angeles Dodgers , Scott Boras , and Kevin Brown , who worked together to make Brown baseball ’s first $ 100 million man .
( I wrote some more about this signing and Kevin Brown ’s Dodgers debut earlier this year . )
The seven - year , $ 105 million contract shocked just about everyone .
2/10/2000 : Ken Griffey , Jr. ( Cincinnati Reds ) , 9 years / $ 116.5 million , $ 12.94 million AAS * [ source ]
As the 2000 season approached , it became more and more apparent to everyone that the Mariners would not be able to keep Ken Griffey , Jr. , at the end of the season .
Which meant , of course , that Seattle would have to deal him somewhere .
You do n’t let someone as singularly great as Griffey walk - away , after all .
Eventually , the Mariners and Reds agreed on a trade while the Reds and Griffey agreed on a deal .
The numbers that they came up with surprised everyone in their reasonableness .
Griffey did not top Brown ’s $ 15 million average annual salary , though he did surpass him in the size of the total package .
8/11/2000 : Roger Clemens ( New York Yankees ) , 2 years / $ 30.9 million , $ 15.45 million AAS [ source ]
Roger Clemens and the Yankees agreed to one of the strangest contract extensions ever in the summer of 2000 .
The Yankees reported the deal as three years and $ 30.9 million , or $ 10.3 million per year .
However , the terms of the deal guaranteed Clemens two years and the entire $ 30.9 million .
That would imply , then , that , if Clemens were to have picked up that player option for the third year , he would ’ve been working for free .
Which makes you wonder if the Yankees thought we were all idiots that year .
When you do the real math of two years and $ 30.9 million , you see that Clemens broke through as the league ’s top paid player .
10/20/2000 : Carlos Delgado ( Toronto Blue Jays ) , 4 years / $ 68 million , $ 17 million AAS [ source ]
But it would n’t last long , of course .
Not in the winter of 2000 .
Two months later , the Blue Jays and Carlos Delgado agreed to a four year contract extension that made the first baseman the highest paid player in the game at $ 17 million per year .
But I do n’t think people really remember Delgado ’s time atop the board because of what happened six weeks later …
12/8/2000 : Mike Hampton ( Colorado Rockies ) , 8 years / $ 123 million , $ 15.38 million AAS * [ source ]
… when Mike Hampton parlayed two great years ( in the * ahem * Astrodome and Shea Stadium ) into the largest contract ever handed out .
And it just happened to be with the Colorado Rockies .
It ’s still remembered as one of the craziest contracts ever , but it might be thought of even worse if it was n’t for what happened two days later .
12/10/2000 : Alex Rodriguez ( Texas Rangers ) , 10 years / $ 252 million , $ 25.2 million AAS [ source ]
What do you say about A - Rod ’s ten - year , $ 252 million contract ?
This was a 24 - year old shortstop who could hit 40 home runs , bat .320 , and play gold glove defense year - in - and - year - out entering free agency at the prime of his athletic abilities and at the peak of baseball ’s money - crazy era .
There was just no way that he was going to earn a modest contract .
That said , Tom Hicks certainly played his hand poorly in the negotiations , bidding against himself at seemingly every turn .
The $ 252 million is astounding not because of its sheer size but because it was $ 50 - 80 million more than anyone else seemed willing to offer .
( Good chart . )
12/13/2007 : Alex Rodriguez ( New York Yankees ) , 10 years / $ 275 million , $ 27.5 million AAS [ source ]
It ’s amazing , but , even seven years later , A - Rod still reigned as the highest paid player in baseball .
It goes to show just how high Tom Hicks and Scott Boras set that bar back in the winter of 2000 .
It ’s almost fitting , then , that the only person to top A - Rod ’s $ 252 million deal is A - Rod himself , who went about doing it in the worst possible way ( by interrupting the World Series to announce his free agency and then crawling back to the Steinbrenners weeks later ) .
He did manage to extend the life of his contract and raise his average annual salary to a ridiculous $ 27.5 million a year , so it was n’t for naught .
If A - Rod can continue his home run hitting ways and march on past Mays , Aaron , Ruth , and Bonds , he ’ll earn himself an additional $ 30 million .
That is far from certain , though .
That ’s it .
Every player that I could find who held on to the title of “ highest paid player in baseball ” for even a day since Nolan Ryan signed the first $ 1 million - a - year contract in 1979 is included here .
It might be a while still before we can add on to this list .
In the meantime , though , it should serve as a pretty good look at how baseball has changed since the advent of free agency .
Please feel free to let me know if I missed anyone .
Machinarium wastes no time at all getting you familiar with its world , dropping you directly into the action without any form of introduction .
You 're a robot who has been trapped in some sort of prison - like facility and you need to escape .
That 's all you know .
There is no exposition at all — largely because there is no actual dialog in the game — so the bits of story you do pick up throughout the adventure are sparse but meaningful .
Though initially appearing to be nothing more than a cute adventure starring quirky robots , the game slowly reveals itself to be a touching tale of separated lovers and a crumbling society straining underneath an oppressive leadership .
Think of it as Wall - E meets 1984 with a steampunk makeover .
Of course , since there is no written or spoken dialog — character interactions are conveyed solely through animations and thought bubbles — the story can be easy to miss , so it 's not entirely mandatory .
But for those who take the time , there is much to enjoy .
The world created by Amanita Design feels undeniably real .
You 'll see elderly robots heading to church and musicians playing in the street .
Flies pester a bartender while robotic cats snooze on rooftops .
And when the main character stands still for too long , he begins to daydream about his missing girlfriend .

But while the story is what will keep you interested as the game moves along , the visuals are what will grab you .
Machinarium sports an absolutely stunning art style , with completely hand - drawn characters and backgrounds that are packed with detail and personality .
The various robots you encounter are all distinct , as are the various different areas , which makes the idea of exploring that much more enticing .
And with the smooth character animations , the game looks , moves , and feels like a top - tier animated movie .
The same goes for the soundtrack in the game , which features subtle , ambient music and sound effects that feel very organic .
When it comes to actually playing the game , though , things are pretty straightforward .
Machinarium is a point - and - click adventure through and through , though it 's not without its own unique twists on the format .
The majority of your time will be spent collecting items and solving various puzzles , which allow you progress to new areas where you can collect more items and solve more puzzles .
There are also a few minigames to be encountered — including a full - blown Space Invaders clone — that help add some variety .
But for the most part the gameplay is very traditional .
There are a number of very difficult problems to solve , but the frustration that this would normally induce is negated by a very clever hint system .
At any time you can receive a hint that gives you a vague idea of what exactly it is you 're supposed to be doing .
If that 's not enough , there is also an in - game walkthrough that outlines how to go about doing whatever it is you 're supposed to be doing .
It can be accessed at any point in the game , but there is a twist : each time you use the walkthrough , you first must complete a level of a simple 2D side - scrolling shooter .
This forces you to do at least a little work for your hints , forcing you to think twice before immediately reaching for the easy answer to a problem .
Even though the gameplay is fairly standard , the presentation and story make this a game that 's hard not to recommend .
This is a world that 's just begging to be explored , and one of the finest point - and - click adventures in recent memory .

How would the American legal system punish conjoined twins if one committed a murder while the other was completely innocent ?
Introduction
Lets consider , for the sake of argument , that we are dealing with dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins , conjoined twins with two heads sharing one body .
Each twin controls one half of the body , neither can control the other ’s half of the body , and neither can feel what the other feels .
This is the physiology of the Hensel twins , Abigail and Brittany Hensel .
Further , you must accept that these are two separate individuals because : 1 ) they have two separate consciousnesses , 2 ) they exhibit distinct personalities , or 3 ) they each had to pass the driving exam .
They are entangled singletons  two consciousnesses in one continuum of skin whose individuality is defined partly by their conjoining ( see bio-ethicist Alice Domurat Dreger ) .
When considering the punishment for one guilty conjoined twin , it is necessary to put aside all of the factual considerations that may arise when one conjoined twin commits a murder to the detriment of her innocent , connected sibling .
Put aside the idea that the innocent twin had any control over the guilty twins hand .
Put aside the idea that the court may impute the guilty action to the innocent twin , finding her an accomplice in the commission of this murder .
Put aside the idea that the court could find that the innocent twin had some duty to stop the murder from occurring .
To accept any of these ideas is to find the conjoined twins entirely innocent or entirely guilty and runs outside the scope of this problem .
Accept , for the purposes of this problem , that the jury has found one twin guilty and the other is merely an innocent bystander — she did not participate in the act nor could they have stopped the homicide from occurring .
The question posed is not purely speculative .
According to 18th century French historian Henri Sauval , a murder of the kind presented was perpetrated in the 17th century by Italian conjoined twins .
Born in 1617 in Genoa , two boys were held together by the stomach .
One twin was completely healthy while the other was mute , deaf , and blind .
Sauval records that the healthy twin stabbed a man to death and was tried , convicted , and sentenced to death .
However , the twin was not executed on account of the innocence of one of its component halves . 
It was impossible to put one to death without twin killing the other .
Unfortunately , Sauval failed to mention whether they were subsequently incarcerated or released after the death sentence was commuted , leaving this scenario ripe for legal analysis in the abstract .
Findings of Guilt
Before dolling out punishment , there must be a finding of guilt .
The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution provides  No person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . 
When we speak of due process , we speak of fundamental fairness : the prosecution must prove all of the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt through a fair procedure before a fair finder of fact .
Crimes deal with conduct which society deems anti-social and therefore deserving of punishment .
The term conduct is used in a broad sense to cover the two distinct components of a crime : 1 ) the act and 2 ) the state of mind accompanying the act .
Therefore , when the Legislature passes a law outlawing a particular crime it will include a definition of the act and the requisite mental state to commit the crime .
A crime cannot be consummated without fulfilling both of the elements of act and intent .
Under federal law , murder is defined as follows :  Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . 
18 U.S.C. § 1111 ( a ) .
Here , Congress has defined the act of murder as  the unlawful killing of a human being  while the state of mind to commit a murder is malice aforethought .
Malice aforethought is one of those lofty legal concepts that exists mainly so scholars can debate its meaning .
Essentially , malice aforethought is a deliberate intention to take away the life of a fellow creature ,  according to the California Penal Code .
Cal. Penal Code § 188 .
In order to convict someone of murder , the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the proscribed act and harbored this requisite mental state .
The paradox presented with this problem is that although we have two inextricable entwined people , only one twin can be convicted of the crime .
As in most criminal prosecutions , the jury serves as the finder of fact and must make the determination of guilt .
For the purposes of this argument , we must suppose that only one twin can be convicted of the crime .
Otherwise there is no legal dilemma .
Once there has been a finding of guilt , the court attempt to determine the punishment for this crime , being ever respectful of the innocence of one of the twins .
Punishment
The broad purposes of the criminal law are to make people do what society regards as desirable and to prevent them from doing what society considers to be undesirable .
To achieve this end , the State allocates punishment for bad acts as opposed to rewards for good acts , emphasizing the discouragement of undesirable rather than the encouragement of the desirable .
There are several theories underlying punishment , each with specific ends and particular means .
These theories include :
Deterrence — Deterring the criminal or society ( by way of example ) from committing crime by giving him an unpleasant experience such as jail time .
Incapacitation —
Incapacitating the criminal by removing him from society to protect the populous from further criminal conduct .
Rehabilitation — Rehabilitating the criminal through appropriate treatment or training .
Retribution — Retribution , or justice , is imposed on criminals by society for the wrongs they have caused .
Proposed Punishments
1. Capital Punishment
The death penalty stands as the most impractical of all the potential punishment choices .
As there is only one conclusively guilty actor in the pair , the court would have to find a way to kill only the guilty twin .
In the novel The Siamese Twin Mystery by Ellery Queen ( 1933 ) the authors considered the practical angles of this problem , including how to electrocute one Siamese without damaging the other , and in the end resolved the problem by clearing the twins of the crime .
Depending on the extent of the conjoining , which in this case is substantial , it is likely impossible to kill one without killing the other .
While this punishment would protect society from further harm by either twin , the execution of an innocent person runs so afoul of due process and the morals of American society , capital punishment cannot be used in this case .
2. Life Without Parole
As an alternative to the death penalty , Courts hand down sentences of life without parole .
This represents sufficient leniency by the court but still raises constitutional concerns of jailing an innocent person for the duration of her life .
Again there is the problem of denying someone their liberty without convicting them of a crime .
There lies an exception to this doctrine under the criminal law for criminal forfeitures .
This is when the State seizes property used in the commission of a crime ( houses , cars , boats ) even though the true owner had no knowledge of its illicit use .
Under this doctrine , the injured , innocent owner can seek remittance of the property from the State .
This concept lends itself by analogy to a murder involving only one conjoined twins .
The State would presumably be in its rights to seize the unlawfully used property ( i.e. their shared body ) but the innocent twin would be given the opportunity to remit forfeiture in their body as a “ joint tenant in common . ”
3. Separation
To consider more extreme approaches to punishing the guilty twin , the Court could order the twins separated so that the guilty twin may be punished .
Even if this Solomonic option were possible in this case , as physiologically it appears impossible , this action raises grave Constitutional concerns .
The Supreme Court has held that the body to be inviolate , providing slim exceptions to this rule as in the testing blood alcohol content , chemical castration , and the death penalty .
This punishment smacks of the Sharia law practice of chopping off a convicted thiefs hand .
Furthermore , it is hard to argue that separation would only punish one of the twins as each would be left immobile , one half of a complete body .
Separation surgeries have some success as in the case of Jodie and Mary Attard ( although this surgery was undertaken knowing full well that it would and did kill the weaker twin ) .
Modern scholars estimate the rate of successful separation surgery at around 5 % ( see also the Bijani twins ) .
With such dismal rates , sentencing conjoined twins to separation surgery would be the equivalent of a death sentence .
4. Suspended Sentence
If the Court finds that the Constitutional limits of due process are so great that neither twin may be punished , the Court may be obligated to let the twins go free .
This would be the ultimate downward departure from sentencing guidelines .
Exercising this option calls to attention the balancing of American morals : which do we hold higher , the punishment of an innocent life or freeing a guilty one ?
To allow a convicted murderer to go free spits in the face of retribution and that holy notion of justice .
Furthermore , Justice Scalia might argue , this option yields the ultimate killing machine : a person who cannot be punished for murder because their physiology precludes punishment .
In light of this concern remember that the circumstances of the murder are so unlikely that it has only occurred once in known history .
However , say the conjoined twin did kill again , it is hard to imagine that a jury could bifurcate the finding of guilt across the twins for a second time .
5. Monetary Sanctions
Finally , monetary sanctions may satisfy the underlying problem presented .
While it is hard to accept monetary sanctions in the place of traditional punishment , this option may be the only permissible alternative .
Primitive and ancient societies relied on a form of tort damages , known as wergild ,  to compensate the families of murder victims and to control crime .
The Germanic tribes had some success with this option until the Norman Conquest of the 9th century which did away with the practice .
The problem with this punishment is that the average person would be reticent to assign a monetary value to surrender his life as he would get no utility from the money .
Tort law , on the other hand , provides monetary compensation in wrongful death lawsuits , assigning millions for the loss of life .
However , here we speak of the criminal law of murder , not the civil law of tortious liability .
Monetary sanctions have never been popular in the modern era .
Additionally , it is hard to argue that monetary sanctions would affect only one member of a conjoined twin pair .
Conclusion
As actors under American criminal law , conjoined twins present paradoxical obstacles to the application of traditional methods of criminal punishments .
The Western notion of individuality precludes such duplicitous beings from orthodox measures to remedy criminal action , particularly the crime of murder .
Constitutional limitations of due process and guarantees of life , liberty and property militate against equal treatment of these actors under the law .
I believe that within our Constitutional framework , the only thing to be done in this situation is to release the conjoined twins .
Even if the jury sentenced the conjoined twins to death , the court would have to commute the sentence and release the twins .
The guarantees of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit punishing an innocent actor .
Furthermore stare decisis , the doctrine that states that courts must follow the precedent of preceding and higher courts , presents an additional danger .
If the court decided to punish the innocent twin despite her innocence , there would be nothing to stop the State from punishing others who have not been convicted of committing crimes ( see also enemy combatants , plea of not guilty by reason of insanity , etc. ) .
While this solution may seem like a grave injustice to society , consider the innocent parties injured through mistrial , the criminals released because of shortcomings of shoddy police work , and statutes of limitations preventing the delayed filing of charges despite ironclad certainty .
Such is the nature of our legal system .
With these limitations come the freedoms and guarantees of the Constitution , preventing an overreaching government from undue interference into the lives of private citizens and frivolous legal action .

Hard cases make bad law .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citadel Broadcasting Corp , the third - largest U.S. radio broadcaster , said on Sunday it filed for the bankruptcy protection , as the radio industry continues to be hard hit by depressed advertising revenue .
Citadel , whose network consists of 165 FM stations and 58 AM stations , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under a prenegotiated deal with more than 60 percent of its senior lenders .
The deal would convert its $ 2.1 billion secured credit facility into a new term loan of $ 762.5 million , meaning about $ 1.4 billion of debt would be extinguished , it said .
As part of the deal , senior lenders would receive a share of the new term loan and 90 percent of the new common stock in reorganized Citadel .
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in Manhattan .
Farid Suleman , Citadel ’s chief executive officer , said the company ’s “ business will continue as usual ” and it would seek to emerge from restructuring as quickly as possible .
Citadel , also the owner of ABC Radio Networks , which it took on debt to buy from the Walt Disney Co in 2006 , has struggled along with the rest of the industry .
In the latest quarter , it reported a 14 percent drop in revenue to $ 183 million , and a quarterly loss of 8 cents per share versus a profit of 10 cents per share a year earlier .
Citadel said that to fund its restructuring it has reached an agreement with lenders to access about $ 36 million of cash on hand .
It will also use all cash flow from operations , it said .
The company listed total assets of $ 1.4 billion and debts of $ 2.5 billion , according to a bankruptcy court document .
Buyout firm Forstmann Little & Co holds 28.7 percent of the company ’s shares , according to the document .
( OPRAH.com ) --
There are many practices from biblical times that are best left in the past .
Stoning adulterers comes to mind .
As does sacrificing oxen .
But let me tell you about one dusty Middle Eastern custom that deserves a comeback : tithing .
For those who skipped Sunday school , tithing is the practice of giving 10 percent of your annual income to the needy .
You donate one out of every ten dollars ( or shekels or sheep ) to the orphans , the widows , the destitute , or the temple high priests .
Granted , some folks in 21st - century America still tithe ( devout Mormons , for instance , are expected to cough up 10 percent ) .
But the practice has largely gone the way of pharaohs and women named Bathsheba .
Which is n't surprising .
Tithing is hard as hell , especially in these lean times .
I first learned about tithing a few years ago .
At the time , I was trying to follow every rule in the Bible -- a journey I chronicled in a book .
The Bible told me to tithe .
So I tithed .
When I told my wife , Julie , about my plan to tithe , she fretted .
In general , she 's much more magnanimous than I am .
She 's a sucker for those charities that send you free sheets of return - address labels with little cartoons of a Rollerblading Ziggy , along with a heartbreaking brochure about lymphoma .
I tell her it 's emotional blackmail .
She ignores me and mails them checks .
Oprah.com : How to give smart
But even for Julie 10 percent is high , especially with the ridiculously expensive prospect of raising children in New York City .
Julie asked whether I could count my literary agent 's fee as a tithe .
She was only half - joking .
" Can you at least do 10 percent after taxes ? " she said .
That night I called a friend who 's a Lutheran pastor .
" You should n't get too legalistic , " he said .
" Give what you can .
And then give some more .
It should feel like a sacrifice . "
A.J. Jacobs challenge to you : Day of Extreme Politeness
I studied my Bible for insight .
It seems that in the time of ancient Israel -- before the Romans took over -- no one paid taxes per se .
The tithes were the taxes .
And the tithing system was as complicated as any 1040 form .
The farmers gave to the priests , the temple - keepers , the temple itself , the poor , the widows , and the orphans .
So I decided after - tax tithing was probably okay .
I calculated 10 percent of my projected salary .
It was n't a huge number -- but that was precisely the problem .
If I were making $ 10 million a year and had to give away $ 1 million , that would have been easier .
Although many modern tithers give to their church , I decided to go directly to the needy .
I spent hours browsing the Web site CharityNavigator.org .
It 's sort of a Michelin guide to aid organizations .
( Even this leads to coveting -- they list the salaries of these charity CEOs , and some break half a million . )

I settled on several organizations focusing on children and widows , two groups the Bible says are always in need .
One was called Feed the Children , another Save Darfur .
Oprah.com :
How to give when dollars are tight
The giving was painful .
I mean , 10 percent ?
That would have an impact on our lives .
Vacations would need to be scaled back , new furniture would have to wait .
It was a huge amount .
When I pressed " send " on the donations , my palms got wet , my heart rate spiked .
But it was a pain mixed with pleasure .
When the confirmation e-mails pinged in , I felt good .
There 's a haunting line from the movie " Chariots of Fire . "
It 's spoken by Ian Charleson , who plays a deeply religious sprinter in the 1924 Olympics .
He says : " When I run , I feel His pleasure . "
And as I gave away money , I think I might have felt God 's pleasure .
Which is odd .
Because I 'm agnostic .
I do n't know if there 's a God or not , but still I felt some higher sense of purpose .
It was like a cozy ember that started at the back of my neck and slowly spread its warmth through my skull .
I felt like I was doing something I should have done all my life .
That feeling of pleasure when giving -- scientists actually call it the warm - glow effect -- is n't strong enough to get most Americans to cough up 10 percent , though .
According to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research , the average American donates about 3 percent of his or her salary to charity .
Low - income workers are the most openhanded set , donating an average of 4.5 percent .
( Of course , there are many exceedingly generous high - income people .
Angelina Jolie has said she gives away a third of her income .
The pastor Rick Warren reverse tithes -- he gives away 90 percent of his profits from his megaselling books . )
Oprah.com : 6 ways giving makes you healthy
I must confess that I have n't tithed every year since .
I 'm a quasi tither .
This year I donated about 7 percent of my income .
Tithing for me is a goal that I want to meet but sometimes do n't .
( I will , however , be tithing the writer 's fee for this article .
How can I not ? )
I 've developed some strategies to help make tithing easier .
The key is to make it concrete .
Try thinking in terms of time .
Every ten minutes of work , you are essentially doing one minute of volunteering for the needy .
Six times an hour you 're doing a mitzvah !
Since I 'm a writer , I also tell myself this :
One out of every ten words belongs to someone deserving .
In that previous sentence , it was the word deserving .
I also try to remember what I teach my sons .
Sharing is caring , I always tell them .
If my son had two lollipops in his pocket , and a friend asked for one , I 'd tell him to fish one out of his pocket and hand it over .
It 's the proper thing to do .
I should practice what I preach .
Finally , I try to think of tithing as a sort of cosmic 10 percent tip .
Scientists say that gratitude is like a psychological wonder drug .
And by tithing , I 'm saying thank you to the universe -- or to God or to fate or to whatever you believe in -- for allowing me to be alive .
I want to acknowledge how lucky I am to have food , a roof , a bed , a warm shower , and a father who did n't sacrifice me on top of a mountain .
That deserves a donation to the Big Tip Jar in the sky , do n't you think ?

Tiger Woods ' sponsors continue to drop him
AT&T says it will no longer sponsor top golfer Tiger Woods , who announced earlier this month that he would take an indefinite break from the sport .
The company joins Accenture and Gillette in dropping support for the golfer after he admitted to " infidelity " to his wife .
AT&T 's logo appeared on the golfer 's bag .
The company did not comment on its reasons for dropping Woods .
AT&T said it would continue to sponsor the AT&T National PGA event in July .
In a terse statement , AT&T said : " We are ending our sponsorship agreement with Tiger Woods and wish him well in the future . "
The deal had been billed as a " multi- year " agreement when it was announced at the beginning of 2009 .
Severed ties
The golfer became the first sportsman to earn more than $ 1bn from sponsorship deals and endorsements .
But a whole list of them have now loosened or severed their ties with him .
Apart from consulting firm Accenture and razor maker Gillette , the watchmaker Tag Heuer has scaled down its use of the star , while drinks manufacturer Gatorade discontinued a line of Tiger Woods - branded energy drinks .
It is not clear how much these deals separately brought in .
AT&T also has not said how much its contract was worth .
A recent University of California study suggested the total economic damage of the Tiger Woods affair to all involved parties could amount to as much as $ 12bn .
Soul searching
Tiger Woods announced in December that he would take a break from his sport , after allegations from a string of women that they had sexual relations with him .
He said at the time : " After much soul searching , I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf .
I need to focus my attention on being a better husband , father , and person . "
Woods is married with two children .
Even though surveys show they are part of the demographic group that makes the heaviest use of pot , white people in New York are the least likely to be arrested for it .
Last year , black New Yorkers were seven times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession and no more serious crime .
Latinos were four times more likely .
[ NYT ]
Mr. Bloomberg ’s chief criminal justice aide , John Feinblatt , declined to discuss the city ’s approach to marijuana arrests , or the findings of the study .
But through a spokesman , he issued a statement maintaining the pot arrests have helped drive down violent crime .
No matter how you frame it , most people still struggle with the concept that marijuana laws are enforced unfairly .
I do n't see what 's so complicated about this :
You can't explain away a gaping disparity like that .
This is not just a matter of cultural differences in marijuana using behavior .
White people smoke herb in the streets of New York , too .
There is no bigger factor at play here than the discretionary choices police make about who to approach and investigate .
It really is that simple and that unfair .
But just because it 's racist does n’t mean it 's bad , says the city :
Even if I believed that stopping a million people a year in the streets of New York is necessary to drive down violent crime , that still does n’t mean you have to arrest them when marijuana is discovered .
None of this even begins to make any sense , and it comes as no surprise that city officials are loathe to attempt an explanation for it .
If you want to reduce violent crime , try legalizing marijuana so there 's one less thing to fight over .

The reviews for millionaire skate - boarding guru Tony Hawk ’s latest game , including Elder - Geek ’s own , were far from positive .
The tycoon recently came forth to combat the critics of Tony Hawk Ride in an interview with Canadian newspaper The Sudbury Star , stating that reviewers had already made up their mind about the product before testing it out .
“ They were ready to discredit it before they even tried it , and if it did n’t play exactly how they imagined it … then they passed it off , ” said Hawk .
” I do n’t agree with people who say the board ’s not responsive .
I think that they ’re just not giving it a fair shake .
And I think a lot of them came into it with an attitude that it ’s going to suck . ”
“ I know that ( Ride ) is super fun , and I think there ’s a misconception that I just stick my name on a game , ” he added .
“ I brought this idea to Activision , and I saw it through , I ’ve been playing it every step of the way and I am very proud of it . ”
Given the near universal opinions of most reviewers , do you think Tony Hawk ’s criticism of the reviewers is valid or invalid ?

Advertisement A Nigerian man has been charged with attempting to destroy a plane after he allegedly tried to detonate a bomb on a passenger jet arriving in the US .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , was overpowered by passengers and crew shortly before the Northwest Airlines plane landed in Detroit from Amsterdam .
The US says the bomb consisted of a high explosive and a syringe .
A judge told Mr Abdulmutallab of the charges at a Michigan hospital where he is being treated for injuries .
He was formally charged with attempting to destroy the plane and with placing a destructive device on the aircraft .

US District Judge Paul Borman read Mr Abdulmutallab his charges in a conference room at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor .
Agents had brought the detainee into the room in a wheelchair , dressed in a green hospital robe and with a blanket over his lap .
Asked whether he understood the charges against him , he responded in English " Yes , I do " , the Associated Press reports .
Dutch authorities earlier confirmed that Mr Abdulmutallab had flown from Lagos to Amsterdam , before changing planes to Detroit .
The Department of Justice alleges that when he boarded the plane in the Netherlands he had " a device attached to his body " .
It said a preliminary FBI analysis found that the device contained PETN , also known as pentaerythritol , a high explosive .
All the passengers and crew of Flight 253 were interviewed by investigators .
Mr Abdulmutallab went to the bathroom for about 20 minutes before the incident , court documents say .
When he got back to his seat , he said he had an upset stomach and he pulled a blanket over himself , the affidavit continues .
" Passengers then heard popping noises similar to firecrackers , smelled an odour , and some observed Abdulmutallab 's pants , leg and the wall of the airplane on fire , " the Department of Justice said in a statement .
Blankets and fire extinguishers were used to douse the flames .
" Passengers reported that Abdulmutallab was calm and lucid throughout .
One flight attendant asked him what he had had in his pocket , and he replied ' explosive device ' , " the statement continued .
' Explosives in underwear '
Mr Abdulmutallab reportedly told investigators he had links to al - Qaeda and had received the explosives in Yemen .
US network ABC is reporting that Mr Abdulmutallab has apparently given investigators detailed information about his month - long training by al - Qaeda .
The suspect is being treated for burns in a Michigan hospital
The explosives were sewn into his underwear in Yemen , ABC reported , for what was supposed to be a suicide attack .
Nigeria has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident and said they will " co-operate fully " with the US investigations .
Members of a wealthy Nigerian family have confirmed to journalists that he is the son of the former chairman of First Bank of Nigeria , the BBC's Caroline Duffield reports from Lagos .
The Dutch counter - terrorism agency NCTB said the suspect boarded a KLM flight from Lagos to Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport , then connected to the Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit .
A preliminary investigation found that security procedures were followed correctly , and the man had a valid US visa .
The NCTB said in a statement it could not rule out the potential for dangerous items to pass through security , especially objects that current security technology cannot detect .
Meanwhile , police in London are searching a house where Mr Abdulmutallab is thought to have lived .
University College London said it had a student with a similar name enrolled on a mechanical engineering course until mid-2008 , but could not confirm whether this was the same person being questioned by US authorities .
' Unpredictable measures '
Dutch passenger Jasper Schuringa , 32 , who was sitting on the opposite side of the plane to the man , said he did not hesitate to act when he realised something was not right .
Security measures have been tightened at US airports " Suddenly we heard a bang and then there was smoke and fire and I just knew this is a terrorist attack .
" I did n't hesitate a moment , just wanted to stop it with whatever I can do . "
The suspect 's name was in a database indicating " a significant terrorist connection " although it did not appear on a " no- fly " list , said New York congressman Peter King , a member of the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee .
US President Barack Obama , on holiday in Hawaii , has ordered increased security for air travel .
The US Department of Homeland Security said " additional screening measures " had been put into effect since the incident .
" These measures are designed to be unpredictable , so passengers should not expect to see the same thing everywhere , " Homeland Secretary Janet Napolitano said .
Air Canada announced that passengers on flights to the US would not be able to leave their seats in the final hour of flight , nor have access to cabin luggage at that time .

We were warned at Cambridge , your grace , of the dangers of what is termed fideism .
December 10 , 2009
Eric Ruder explains what the Department of Homeland Security 's move against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio will mean for immigrants .
JOE ARPAIO , the zealous anti-immigrant sheriff of Maricopa County , Ariz. , has finally suffered a setback in his crusade to humiliate , demonize and terrorize undocumented workers under his jurisdiction .
After receiving thousands of complaints and initiating a civil rights investigation by the Justice Department , the Obama administration stripped Arpaio and his deputies of their power to enforce federal immigration laws .
For the last two years , Maricopa County sheriffs have been authorized , under an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , to check the immigration status of people they suspect are undocumented when enforcing compliance with traffic laws or making arrests for any other reason .
The Obama administration 's decision to allow this policy to continue came under criticism from immigrant advocacy organizations .
" The Department of Homeland Security is making a historic mistake if it continues its relationship with Sheriff Joe Arpaio , " said Paco Fabian , a spokesperson for America 's Voice .
" The federal government is lending its full force and legitimacy to a rogue cop certain to go down in history as a serial violator of civil rights and an enemy of the Latino community . "
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio
Arpaio's many transgressions of the civil rights of immigrants include jailing undocumented workers in tent cities in Arizona 's brutal summer heat , cutting the cost of food for inmates under his control to 20 cents per day , forcing men to wear pink prison garb and putting women on chain gangs .
After DHS announced that it was rescinding his authorization to check immigration status , Arpaio held a press conference and lashed out at federal officials , calling them " liars " and pledging to continue his crusade using state laws .
And he promised to personally drive undocumented workers to the border and deport them if federal authorities refuse to take them into custody .
WHILE THE DHS action is welcome , Arizona has a host of laws and regulations that drive undocumented workers in the state into the shadows .
On November 24 , for example , a new law went into effect requiring state , city and government employees in Arizona to report any undocumented immigrant who requests a public benefit .
Government workers who fail to make such a report could face up to four months in jail .
And under the terms of the law , if any taxpayer feels that the law is not being properly enforced , they have the right to file suit against a city or state agency .
The law has created widespread fear in the Latino community .
" When it comes to my daughter 's health , I wo n't play , " said José , an undocumented worker whose daughter is a U.S. citizen and is currently getting treatment for a liver transplant .
" I 'll take her to the doctor .
But I feel between a rock and a hard place .
If I get deported , then how am I going to care for her ? "
As journalist Valeria Fernández wrote , " Jazmin , an undocumented mother , has n't taken her son-- again , a U.S. citizen -- to see the doctor in three days because she fears she could be deported .
She 's also afraid of sharing her identity because she thinks immigration authorities might come after her since she has a pending application to renew the state health care insurance of her child . "
In early December , the Arizona Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Arizona League of Cities and Towns that asked for the law to be stayed -- leaving churches , pro-immigration attorneys and other advocacy groups scrambling to use the Spanish - language media to offer advice to people in José 's and Jazmin 's situations before tragedy strikes .
The war on migrants crossing into the U.S. through the harsh deserts of Arizona also continues .
Predator drones -- the same unmanned surveillance aircraft used by the U.S. military in the skies over Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan -- patrol the border between Mexico and Arizona ( as well as Texas and California ) .
Recently , Walt Staton , an activist who works with the border rights group No More Deaths , was sentenced to 300 hours of community service picking up trash and one year of probation for the " crime " of leaving plastic jugs filled with water along the hundreds of miles of trails used by border crossers .
Apparently unaware of the irony , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service argued that the plastic jugs left for immigrants endanger wildlife -- even though thousands of border crossers have died from dehydration and heat exposure trying to cross into the U.S. , the majority in the area where Staton was leaving water bottles .
THE OBAMA administration pledged to lead the way in passing comprehensive immigration reform in 2010 , but the decision by DHS to take away Arpaio 's authority to enforce federal immigration laws should n't be understood as proof of the administration 's commitment to the cause .
In announcing the general outlines of the administration 's position on immigration reform in November , DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano argued for a " three - legged stool " approach -- tougher enforcement laws against undocumented workers and employers who hire them , a streamlined system for legal immigration into the U.S. , and a " tough and fair pathway to earned legal status " for undocumented workers already here .
The emphasis on enforcement should n't come as a surprise for those who know Napolitano .
In a Los Angeles Times opinion piece , Jeffrey Kaye wrote :
Napolitano 's attitudes toward immigration have hardened over the years .
First elected governor [ of Arizona ] in 2002 with support from the Latino electorate , she opposed a 2004 Arizona ballot measure that sought to bar illegal immigrants from receiving some public social services .
The following year , voicing skepticism about the effectiveness of Bush administration plans to improve fences at the border , she famously proclaimed , " You show me a 50 - foot wall , and I 'll show you a 51 - foot ladder . "
However , since becoming chief of the Homeland Security Department , the agency responsible for the border fence , she has promised to complete the unfinished portions and has stepped up immigration audits of employers .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) has signaled that he plans to move immigration reform rapidly through the Senate -- in part by demonstrating that Democrats are serious about enforcement of anti-immigrant laws .
According to Kaye :
Schumer , who as chairman of the Senate 's immigration subcommittee will take a lead role in drafting legislation , has said that a bipartisan immigration bill is doomed " if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not believe that Democrats are serious about enforcement . "
Schumer even denounced use of the term " undocumented workers , " suggesting that it conveys legitimacy and signals that the government " is not serious about combating illegal immigration . "
Napolitano also boasted recently that " more than 111,000 criminal aliens " were identified through a fingerprinting program called Secure Communities -- even though 95 percent of these " criminals " were guilty of nothing more than traffic violations and expired visas .
According to a New York Times editorial :
It is easy to understand that the administration wants to sound as tough as possible as it gets ready to battle deep - seated resistance to real immigration reform ... That makes it all the more important for the administration to avoid conflating illegal immigration and serious crime .
Laws must be enforced , but doing it this way hurts the innocent , creating a short line from Hispanic to immigrant to illegal to criminal .
Having brown skin , speaking Spanish , seeming nervous in the presence of flashing police lights -- none of those things say anything about whether you are here illegally or not , are deportable or not .
But any one of them can be enough to get you pulled over in jurisdictions across the country .
As on other issues like health care reform and the war on Afghanistan , the Obama administration has refused to stand with majority sentiment in favor of real change to U.S. immigration laws .
In 2007 , just after the defeat of the Bush administration 's immigration bill , 63 percent told Pew Research Center that they favored legislation that would provide a " pathway to citizenship , " and today , despite tough economic times , the same proportion still favors this " pathway to citizenship . "
" Even when the provision was described as ' amnesty , ' a majority still supported it [ in 2007 ] -- though by a smaller margin of 54 percent to 39 percent , " according to the Pew Poll .
How much more support for amnesty would there be if Obama and the Democrats would only make a coherent case for amnesty in order increase this already solid base ?
Actions against anti-immigrant bigots such as Arpaio are refreshing to see .
Recently , a group of about 100 students heckled Arpaio during an appearance at Arizona State University , forcing him to leave the stage 45 minutes into the event .
But we will also have to put pressure on Obama and the Democrats to demand full amnesty for all undocumented workers if Washington begins talk of new immigration legislation .
SAN FRANCISCO , Oct. 26 - A team of Stanford electrical engineers has discovered how to modulate , or switch on and off , a beam of laser light up to a 100 billion times a second with materials that are widely used in the semiconductor industry .
The group used a standard chip - making process to design a key component of optical networking gear potentially more than 10 times faster than the highest - performance commercial products available today .
The team reported its discovery in the current issue of Nature , which was published on Wednesday .
Such an advance could have broad applications both in accelerating the already declining cost of optical networking and in potentially transforming computers in the future by making it possible to interconnect computer chips at extremely high data rates .
Currently , the communications industry uses costly equipment to transmit data over optical fibers at up to 10 billion bits per second .
However , researchers are already experimenting with optically linked computers in which components may be located on different sides of the globe .
Cheap optical switches will also make it possible to create data superhighways inside computers , making it possible to reorganize them for better performance .
