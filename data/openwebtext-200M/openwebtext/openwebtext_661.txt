A Scottish financier who was the single biggest donor to the Liberal Democrats after giving the party £ 2.3 m used money fraudulently obtained from a former chief executive of Manchester United , a court heard yesterday .
Michael Brown , 42 , promised annual returns of up to 50 per cent to rich clients who invested in his bond - trading business based in Mayfair , London .
Instead , it is alleged , their money was used to fund the lavish lifestyle of a multimillionaire – and Britain 's third largest political party .
A jury at Southwark Crown Court heard that in his efforts to portray himself as a " wealthy and influential man " , Mr Brown , who is being tried in his absence , made a series of donations in 2005 , including the gift to the Liberal Democrats in the months before that year 's general election .
The donation was the biggest in the history of the party , which at the time was led by Charles Kennedy .

Martin Edmunds QC , for the prosecution , said that far from being Mr Brown 's own money , the payment was directly funded from $ 10 m ( £ 6.5 m ) invested in the Glasgow - born traders ' financial business by Martin Edwards , the former chairman and chief executive of Manchester United , who made a substantial fortune when he sold his interest in the football club in 2000 .
The contribution to Liberal Democrat coffers was just one example of Mr Brown 's largesse with clients ' cash , which included the purchase of a Range Rover with a personalised number plate , a £ 300,000 entertainment system for his villa in Majorca and a £ 2 m private jet , the court heard .
Mr Brown , who operated from Spain and London , told investors he would use his investment vehicle , Fifth Avenue Partners Ltd , to trade in A - rated bonds and gave a guarantee that their capital would not be touched .
He offered profits of 36 to 50 per cent .
But the jury was told the allegedly bogus trader did not carry out a single transaction .
Instead , the money provided by clients was used to make " profit " payments to other investors , as well as funding his lifestyle and business expenses , which included a flat and offices in Mayfair costing £ 106,000 a year in rent .
Renovations to the office in Upper Brook Street , close to the American embassy , cost £ 237,000 and included the purchase of the Range Rover complete with a £ 35,000 number reading " 5AVE " , after his company .
Mr Edmunds said : " Mr Brown never had any intention of trading in bonds .
His representations to Mr Edwards were all just lies to get hold of his money .
He then used the money to create the illusion he was trading .
Money comes in , money comes out , apparently to pay pretend profits on these pretend bond deals that never actually took place , and apparently to pay for Mr Brown 's extravagant lifestyle , his business expenses and donations . "
The jury was told that the financier had chosen not to attend the start of the month - long trial but that his actions should not be seen as an admission of guilt .
Mr Brown denies nine charges , including the theft of more than $ 11 m between February and May 2005 , and laundering his clients ' money .
He is also accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice by seeking to persuade Mr Edwards to drop a criminal complaint against him when the alleged fraud was uncovered .

The court heard that at the height of his scheme in early 2005 , Mr Brown presented the image of an " important and well - connected man " , which ran contrary to CVs found in his Spanish home following his arrest .
The deal with Mr Edwards , which was set up through an intermediary who had signed an agreement with Mr Brown to introduce clients to his business , was sealed at a meeting in the financier 's flat in February 2005 , during which the bond trader boasted of being educated at Gordonstoun public school and of a long career in the City .
The court heard that neither claim was true .
A " biography " in which Mr Brown stated he had a degree in hotel catering and institutional management from Strathclyde University , and also enjoyed a successful career in the music business , winning several Grammy award nominations , was also false .
In reality , Mr Brown had a City & Guilds qualification in catering .
Mr Edmunds said : " It is the old story .
If you tell people a big enough lie , people swallow it .
If you donate a total of £ 2.3 m to the Liberal Democrat Party then you come across as important .
You create the illusion of a wealthy , influential man . "
The court heard that the former football club executive invested a further £ 1.8 m in the scheme .
After agreeing the initial investment , Mr Brown took Mr Edwards to lunch at his gentlemen's club , the Caledonian in Belgravia , where the financier later made a £ 100,000 donation towards the restoration of its library .
Mr Edmunds said : " It was Mr Edwards ' money that was used to fund that donation to the Caledonian Club .
We really say there is no such thing as a free lunch . "
The case continues .
Everyone has places to go , people to see , and the need to figure out how to get there .
Navigation systems have been developed to help with the last bit ( people and places are up to you ) , but still require you to have the address written down so you can enter it when you get down to the car .
At least , that was the way of things until recently .
In a press release earlier this week , Pioneer announced the creation of an iPhone® application called AVIC FEEDS App to use with the AVIC - U310BT and AVIC - Z110 BT in - dash navigation systems .
The app is intended to allow the phone and navigation systems to connect to each other and pass information via the Bluetooth® .
For those of you lucky enough to be an owner of both , you are in for a treat or two .
AVIC FEEDS
App will allow users to search for points of interest or take photos , which are automatically geotagged , to be accessed later via the in - dash systems for those spur of the moment return visits .
This use of saved photos sounds like the better of the two features .
Think of all the times you have been wandering around and seen some place that you just do not have the time to stop and see .
Sure , you can probably remember the name of the place and / or the cross streets , but now you do not have to .
Added bonus , you have a record of what the front looked like to confirm you found the place .
Sounds good to me .
Oh , best of all , AVIC FEEDS App is free .

Online jihadists have already used YouTube , blogs and other social media to spread their propaganda .
Now , a group of internet Islamic extremists is putting together a plan for " invading Facebook . "
" We can use Facebook * * to fight the media , " notes a recent posting on the extremist al - Faloja forum , translated by Jihadica.com .
" We can post media on Facebook that shows the Crusader losses . "
" We have already had great success in raiding YouTube , " the poster adds .
" American politicians have used Facebook to get votes , like the house slave Obama . "
Groups like al - Qaida were pioneering users of the internet — to train , share ideas and organize .
But some observers , like George Washington University professor Marc Lynch , see a reluctance to embrace Web 2.0 tools like Facebook .
" One of the biggest problems for a virtual network like AQ today is that it needs to build connections between its members while protecting itself from its enemies .
That 's a filtering problem :
How do you get your people in , and keep intelligence agents out ? " he asks .
But as Jihadica.com author and West Point Combating Terrorism Center fellow William McCants notes , the proposed Facebook invasion " is not an attempt to replicate
[ existing ] social networks . "
Instead , " the members of the campaign want to exploit existing networks of people who are hostile to them and presumably they will adopt new identities once they have posted their material . "
The al - Faloja poster suggests seven " brigades " work together within
Facebook .
One will distribute videos and writing of so - called
" martyrs . "
Another will spread military training material .
Most of them will work in Arabic , presumably .
But one of the units will focus just on spread English - language propaganda through Facebook .

" I really think we are descended from the Romans , " said Song Guorong , 48 , who with his wavy hair , 1.8 - metre frame and strikingly long , hooked nose stands out from his short , round - faced colleagues .
Studies claiming Liqian has Roman ancestry have greatly excited the impoverished county in which it is situated .
The village is now overlooked by a pillared portico , in the hope of attracting tourists .
The town 's link with Rome was first suggested by a professor of Chinese history at Oxford in the 1950s .
Homer Dubs pulled together stories from the official histories , which said Liqian was founded by soldiers captured in a war between the Chinese and the Huns in 36BC , and the legend of the missing army of Marcus Crassus , a Roman general .
In 53BC Crassus was defeated by the Parthians , an empire occupying what is now Iran , putting an end to Rome 's eastward expansion .
But stories persisted that 145 Romans were taken captive and wandered the region for years .
Professor Dubs theorised that they made their way eastwards as a mercenary troop , which was how a troop " with a fish - scale formation " came to be captured by the Chinese 17 years later .
He said the " fish - scale formation " was a reference to the Roman " tortoise " , a phalanx protected by shields on all sides and from above .
Gu Jianming , who lives near Liqian , said he was surprised to be told he might be descended from a European imperial army .
But the birth of his daughter was also a surprise .
Gu Meina , now six , was born with a shock of blonde hair .
" We shaved it off a month after she was born , but it just grew back the same colour , " he said .
" At school they call her ' yellow hair ' .
Before we were told about the Romans , we had no idea about this .
We are poor and have no family temple , so we do n't know about our ancestors . "
The hypothesis took almost 40 years to reach China .
During Chairman
Mao's rule , ideas of foreign ancestry were not welcome and the story was suppressed .
The blood tests are part of a project by scientists and historians after local authorities loosened control over genetic research .
The results will be published in a scientific journal .
But Professor Xie Xiaodong , a geneticist from Lanzhou University , cautioned against over - enthusiasm .
" Even if they are descendants of the Roman empire , it does n't mean they are necessarily from the Roman army , " he said .
" The empire covered a large area … so anything is possible . "
The issue has split the university 's history department .
Professor Wang Shaokuan said that the Huns themselves included Caucasians , Asians and Mongols .

For Philip Larkin the annus mirabilis was 1963 when " sexual intercourse began " .
But Rome was a couple of jumps ahead , and this month Italy is celebrating the start of the " Dolce Vita " years which began , all agree , 50 years ago this month , in November 1958 , with an impromptu striptease in a Roman trattoria .
La Dolce Vita , " The Sweet Life " , was the title of one of Federico Fellini 's most seductive films and naturally grew to encompass the liberated era that inspired it .
Suddenly everything became possible , to the shock of many at the time .
In 1958 Olghina di Robilant was a penniless young Venetian countess struggling to make a living in the Italian capital , and that November her rich friend Peter Howard Vanderbilt agreed to cheer her up by bankrolling a birthday party for Olga – her 24th .

Now 74 , she remembers Rome as safe , cheap , innocent and puritanical .
" There were no crowds , no pushing , no corruption , no unsavoury ambition .
The paparazzi , for example , took photos with the agreement of the stars . "
She threw her party in Rugantino , a trattoria in Trastevere , and one of the guests was the commissar of the local police station .
" The party was going very nicely when Peter Howard said to me , ' Come and see who 's sitting at the bar . '
It was this woman caked with make - up like a clown and wearing very little clothing – an Armenian dancer called Aïché Nana .
I said , ' I do n't remember inviting you ' – and she ran to the dance floor and started dancing by herself , a thing nobody did .
Then Anita Ekberg , the Swedish film star , arrived , without Fellini , though I had invited him , and Anita on the dance floor started pulling down her suspenders .
And then the Armenian woman started stripping , and suddenly the flash bulbs were popping and the police commissar said , ' Stop her ! ' and I said ' You 're the policeman , you stop her ! '
So he did , and they threw her out .
The commissar made the photographers hand over their film .
And then the party resumed and went on until six in the morning . "
But one of the photographers hung on to his shots of the striptease , and next morning Olghina woke up to find the papers screaming about the " Roman orgy at Rugantino's " .
" It was quite untrue , " she said , " but it took on a life of its own and went on like a tsunami . "
The photographer was called Tazio Secchiaroli .
Thanks to Cinecittà , the film production studios on the east side of the city , Rome had become a popular location for Hollywood films , and the foreign stars and writers began hanging out in the bars of Via Veneto .
" My father was a news photographer , " says Davide Secchiaroli , " but he and a few friends decided to go to Via Veneto and photograph the stars there . "
His work documented the city 's unique mix of aristocratic tradition , religious superstition and celebrity glitz – and then he ran into Fellini and it was a meeting that changed everything .
Fellini put him into his film as the jobbing snapper Paparazzo – the coinage that named an entire tribe – and his random daily patchwork of jobs became the film 's narrative frame .
" The reality was first photographed by my father , " says Mr Secchiaroli , whose father died in 1998 , " then transformed by Fellini 's great imagination . "
Aïché Nana 's striptease is immortalised in the film , but perhaps the most famous scene is that in which Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg wade at night into the waters of the Trevi Fountain .
This , too , was borrowed from life .
" I was the first to dive into the fountain , " boasts Olghina di Robilant .
" It was November and freezing .
I did n't have two pennies to rub together , and one of my friends said , ' I 'll give you 10,000 lire if you jump in . '
So I just dived in , grazing my nose on the bottom , and it inspired the scene in the film . "
Today all the old - timers agree that Rome has gone to the dogs .
The crowds and permanent police guard make diving into Trevi Fountain an unattractive proposition .
Rugantino 's trattoria is now a McDonald's , while Via Veneto , according to Enrico Lucherini , agent to the stars , " is terrible now , full of shoe shops and tourist restaurants charging € 15 for a coffee " .
The film caused a huge scandal when it came out , and narrowly avoided being banned .
At the premiere , one outraged signora spat in the director 's face .
" We were furious with him , " says Olghina , " because it was n't a decadent city .
Fellini , who comes from Rimini , based the film on gossip .
He was n't yet part of the city 's life – he was like a maid looking through the keyhole . "
Yet no one denies that Fellini crystallised an amazing vision of Rome .
At least one person was in Fellini 's debt for the rest of his life : Tazio Secchiaroli , the original paparazzo , became the director 's privileged stills photographer .
Far from ambushing stars , he became personal photographer to Sophia Loren for more than 20 years .
KIROLIRWE , Congo ( Reuters ) - Congolese rebel leader Laurent Nkunda threatened on Tuesday to take his eastern guerrilla war westwards to the capital Kinshasa unless the government agreed to talks on the country ’s future .
Defiant in the face of international moves to end the conflict in east Democratic Republic of Congo , Nkunda rejected complaints by human rights groups against him , saying he “ did n’t give a damn ” about the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
“ I ’ve done no wrong to my people ... nobody can reproach me for anything , ” the slim , bespectacled rebel chief said in an interview at his hilltop headquarters in North Kivu province .
Nkunda , who belongs to and defends Congo ’s Tutsi minority but also demands a better government for the whole country , last week suspended a major advance toward North Kivu ’s provincial capital Goma that displaced tens of thousands of civilians .
The United Nations and foreign aid groups are now scrambling to address a humanitarian emergency described as “ catastrophic ” by relief workers in a country where more than 5 million people have died in a decade from conflict , hunger and disease .
Wearing a green beret and beige camouflage uniform and carrying a cane topped with a silver eagle ’s head , Nkunda said that if his offer of talks was not accepted by President Joseph Kabila , he would end a ceasefire in North Kivu .
“ If they refuse to negotiate , it will mean they will be ready to only fight and we will fight them because we have to fight for our freedom , ” Nkunda said , surrounded by verdant hills that have earned North Kivu the name “ Africa ’s Switzerland . ”
The atmosphere there was peaceful , in sharp contrast to the anguish and suffering of refugees packed into camps around Goma , who are clamoring for food and protection from violence .
But 50 km ( 35 miles ) to the northeast at Kiwanja , Nkunda ’s men fought a gun battle with the Pareco Mai - Mai militia , some of whose fighters backed Kabila during the war but which , like Nkunda , had signed a peace deal for North Kivu in January .
U.N. peacekeepers at a mobile operations base were caught in the crossfire but none were injured , a U.N. spokesman said .
Nkunda , a former army general who commands a 4,000 - strong guerrilla force , said his next offensive would not stop at Goma , where U.N. peacekeepers have reinforced positions , but aim for Congo ’s capital Kinshasa , over 1,500 km ( 950 miles ) to the west .
“ Goma is just a place to pass through ...
When they force us to come down to Goma we wo n’t stop there , ” he said .
Congo ’s government has refused to talk with Nkunda since his latest offensive and accuses neighbouring Rwanda , also a former Belgian colony , of backing him -- a charge denied by Kigali .

“ I ’m not from Rwanda and I claim nothing for Rwanda , ” said Nkunda , who led his rebel cabinet in a prayer before a meeting .
U.N. peacekeepers say their 17,000 - strong force , the world ’s largest peace mission , is badly stretched across a country the size of Western Europe , where violent armed groups abound , often profiting from its rich reserves of copper , cobalt and gold .
In New York , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon asked the Security Council to approve sending more than extra 3,000 soldiers and police to eastern Congo .
But there was no sign it would discuss the request any time soon .

ECONOMIC RISKS
International efforts are under way to hold a peace summit between Congo and Rwanda and tackle the humanitarian emergency .
Since 2006 elections that returned Kabila to power , hopes rose that the vast central African nation had finally left behind the 1998 - 2003 war that left the economy in ruins .
Investor interest in Congo ’s mineral treasure trove has risen in the last two years .
But Central Bank Governor Jean - Claude Masangu said on Tuesday weak demand for metals in the global financial crisis will push economic growth below 10 percent next year and force a scaling back of mining projects .
Masangu listed the humanitarian crisis in the east , and the pressures of military spending , as economic risks .
Rebel chief Nkunda said the negotiations he sought with the government should focus on “ good governance and security . ”
“ To become head of state is not my ambition , ” he said .
Rights groups accuse his men of recruiting child soldiers and the ICC has issued a warrant for one of his commanders .
ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo said on Tuesday crimes like rape and mass displacements in the Kivus would not go unpunished .
Nkunda backed the idea of a peace summit between Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame , but called for an “ internal solution ” for east Congo ’s conflict , which nevertheless traces its origins back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
At a refugee camp near Goma , ragged children with swollen bellies mobbed U.N. mission chief Alan Doss , demanding food .
Doss said the U.N. force had brought in more troops to Goma from other parts of the country .
“ But we ’re robbing Peter to pay Paul , MONUC is thinly stretched , ” he told Reuters .

Yesterday , we looked at President - elect Obama ’s stance on transparency .
As we noted , Obama ’s record on the issue is n’t spotless , but he did make promises during the campaign to run a far more transparent presidency .
This morning , Obama ’s transition Web site , change.gov , offered some details on " using cutting - edge technologies " to create " a new level of transparency , accountability and participation for America 's citizens . "
Among the ideas listed on the site :
Centralize Ethics and Lobbying Information for Voters : Obama and Biden will create a centralized Internet database of lobbying reports , ethics records and campaign finance filings in a searchable , sortable and downloadable format .
Obama and Biden will create a centralized Internet database of lobbying reports , ethics records and campaign finance filings in a searchable , sortable and downloadable format .
Require Independent Monitoring of Lobbying Laws and Ethics Rules : Obama and Biden will use the power of the presidency to fight for an independent watchdog agency to oversee the investigation of congressional ethics violations so that the public can be assured that ethics complaints will be investigated .
Create a Public " Contracts and Influence " Database :
As president , Obama will create a " contracts and influence " database that will disclose how much federal contractors spend on lobbying , and what contracts they are getting and how well they complete them .
As president , Obama will create a " contracts and influence " database that will disclose how much federal contractors spend on lobbying , and what contracts they are getting and how well they complete them .
Expose Special Interest Tax Breaks to Public Scrutiny : Obama and Biden will ensure that any tax breaks for corporate recipients — or tax earmarks — are also publicly available on the Internet in an easily searchable format .
Obama and Biden will ensure that any tax breaks for corporate recipients — or tax earmarks — are also publicly available on the Internet in an easily searchable format .
Sunlight Before Signing :
Too often bills are rushed through Congress and to the president before the public has the opportunity to review them .
As president , Obama will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days .

Shine Light on Earmarks and Pork Barrel Spending : Obama 's Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks
Act will shed light on all earmarks by disclosing the name of the legislator who asked for each earmark , along with a written justification , 72 hours before they can be approved by the full Senate .
We ’ll be watching to see what happens after January 20th .
The facility is
The space Pionen now occupies was originally built during the Cold War era as a nuclear shelter .
Located below 30 meters of solid bedrock the space was completely redesigned during 2007 - 2008 .
Now Boasting 11,950 sq ft of space it houses the Network Operations Center ( NOC ) for all of Bahnhof 's operations .
One of five data centers , it is the largest and is manned by a 15 member team of senior technical staff .
Backup power is generated by two Maybach MTU diesel engines that produce 1.5 Megawatts of power and were originally designed for submarines .
The cooling is handled by " Baltimore Aircoil fans producing a cooling effect of 1.5 megawatts " which is enough to cool several hundred rack - mounted servers .
Triple redundant internet backbone pipes are split across fiber and copper and delivered via multiple physical paths into the mountain .
Underneath Stockholm , deep in the bedrock exists a data center better than any high tech lair Hollywood could probably dream up .
Bahnhof , one of Sweden 's largest ISP's has created a bunker of high tech goodness that is surely to astound .
The facility is called Pionen and once you get past the 16 inch thick entrance doors into the once nuclear bunker now converted to a data center , the spectacular sights that await are simply breathtaking .
Replete with waterfalls , greenhouses , German submarine backup engines , and simulated daylight this facility has the added benefit of being able to withstand an almost direct hit by a hydrogen bomb .

In an interview over at Pingdom , when asked about the motivation behind Pionen , Jon Karlung , CEO of Bahnhof said “ Rather than just concentrating on technical hardware we decided to put humans in focus .
Of course , the security , power , cooling , network , etc , are all top notch , but the people designing data centers often ( always ! ) forget about the humans that are supposed to work with the stuff . ”

“ Since we got hold of this unique nuclear bunker in central Stockholm deep below the rock , we just could n' t’t build it like a traditional – more boring – hosting center , ” he said .
“ We wanted to make something different .
The place itself needed something far out in design and science fiction was the natural source of inspiration in this case – plus of course some solid experience from having been a hosting provider for more than a decade . ”
Regarding the design of the facility , he said “ I ’m personally a big fan of old science fiction movies .
Especially ones from the 70s like Logan ’s Run , Silent Running , Star Wars ( especially The Empire Strikes Back ) so these were an influence , “ said Karlung .
“ James Bond movies have also had an impact on the design .
I was actually looking for the same outfit as the villain ‘ Blofeld ’ in Bond and even considered getting a white cat , but that might have been going a bit far ! ”
Before Construction
University of Queensland neuroscientists have discovered the crucial role a specific gene plays in forming the neural tube , the earliest identifiable structure in the developing brain and an essential precursor to the entire central nervous system .
While investigating neural tube closure in the clawed toad ( Xenopus laevis ) and in zebrafish , Associate Professor Helen Cooper at the Queensland Brain Institute ( QBI ) has , for the first time , described one of the processes that drive this crucial stage of brain development , which is common to all vertebrates .
“ Globally , neural tube closure defects occur in about one - in - a - thousand human pregnancies , resulting in malformations of the central nervous system and conditions such as spina bifida or anencephaly , ” Dr Cooper said .
In spina bifida , for example , incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube leads to incorrect development of the spinal cord , often resulting in significant disability .
“ Although it has been known for some time that regular intake of folic acid before conception greatly reduces the incidence of neural tube abnormalities , scientists are still trying to understand the complex interplay of genes during this crucial early stage of brain development . ”
“ Our laboratory has now established that a copy of one particular gene ( Neogenin ) is essential for proper formation of neural folds , the first stages in the development of neural tubes .
“ If the neural folds do not develop then the neural tube cannot close , resulting in neural tube defects , ” Dr Cooper said .
“ And just as importantly , our lab has also discovered that Neogenin is vital for differentiation of neural stems cells throughout the development of the early central nervous system . ”
Neuroscientists studying early brain development often investigate zebrafish because these small freshwater animals produce several hundred embryos , which develop rapidly and are almost totally transparent from fertilisation to hatching ( about 48 hours ) , allowing scientists to view brain development as it happens .
Dr Cooper 's research : “ Neogenin and RGMa control neural tube closure and neuroepithelial morphology by regulating cell polarity ” is published in this week 's edition of the Journal of Neuroscience .

It used to be that being buried under a pile of large , sweaty men was the worst thing that could happen to you playing Rugby - but then it turned out a herpes virus can cause a skin disease called " scrumpox " and it spreads through physical contact .
Researchers have discovered that a new strain could be even more pathogenic - and it's now also found among sumo wrestlers in Japan .
" Scrumpox " , or herpes gladiatorum , is a skin infection caused by the herpes virus , which can cause coldsores .
It is spread through direct skin - to - skin contact so it is common among rugby players .
Symptoms can start with a sore throat and swollen glands and the telltale blisters appear on the face , neck , arms or legs .
The disease is highly infectious , so players who are infected are often taken out of competition to stop the virus from spreading .

" Scientists in Japan believe that a strain of herpes virus called BgKL has replaced the strain BgOL as one of the most common and pathogenic , causing a skin disease in sumo wrestlers , " said Dr Kazuo Yanagi from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo , Japan .
" We wanted to see if this is the case , so we studied the spread of the disease in sumo wrestlers in Tokyo . "
The researchers looked at samples taken from 39 wrestlers diagnosed with herpes gladiatorum , who were living in 8 different sumo stables in Tokyo between 1989 and 1994 .
Tests showed that some of the cases were primary infections , being the first time the wrestlers had been infected .
However , in some cases the disease had recurred several times .
" Herpes virus can hide in nerve cells for long periods of time and symptoms can reappear later , " said Dr Yanagi .
" Our research showed that the BgKL strain of herpes is reactivated , spreads more efficiently and causes more severe symptoms than BgOL and other strains .
This is the first study to suggest that the recurrence of herpes gladiatorum symptoms in humans may depend on the strain of virus . "
Professional sumo wrestlers live and train together in a stable called a heya .
This makes studying the spread of herpes virus easier .
Their living arrangement suggests that the source of primary herpes infections among sumo wrestlers in each stable was their fellow wrestlers .
" Two of the wrestlers died as a result of their infections , so cases like this do need to be investigated , " said Dr Yanagi .
" This research will aid future studies on herpes and may help identify herpes genes that are involved in recurrence and spread of the disease .
We hope it will also contribute to the development of medicines to stop the disease from spreading and recurring in infected patients . "
The paper " Analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 restriction fragment length polymorphism variants associated with herpes gladiatorum and Kaposi's varicelliform eruption in sumo wrestlers " was published in the October issue of the Society for General Microbiology 's Journal of General Virology .
Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPhone 's gaming platform is already a huge hit .
And it 's starting to get more fun : Companies are starting to roll out games that take advantage of the phone 's Internet features for live , multi-player gaming .
The latest :
SF - based game publisher Zynga is launching " Live Poker , " which lets you play free Texas Hold 'em ( no gambling ) against 1.4 million daily players on their Web game , or against your real friends from Facebook , MySpace , Bebo , or Hi5 .
The game uses Facebook 's newish " Facebook Connect " feature so you can sign in with your Facebook login and password without leaving " Live Poker . "
It 's free for the iPhone and iPod touch ; a $ 9.99 version offers a " larger chip package " and access to tournaments .
Palo Alto - based iPhone software publisher Tapulous has issued an update to its popular Guitar Hero - for - the - iPhone game " Tap Tap Revenge , " which includes online gameplay .
The game advertises it as a work - in - progress feature , but it worked well in our test .
( Our tapping skills , however , are n't nearly as good as this pigeon's . )
" Tap Tap Revenge " has been downloaded more than 2.5 million times , so there 's a good chance you 'll always have people to play against .
( And hey , look ... ads ! )
A good start , and something that could give the iPhone another advantage over consumer - focused rivals like the Google ( GOOG ) G1 and BlackBerry Storm ( RIMM ) .
But we 're still waiting for something that looks as fun as this wacky video , which leaked several weeks before the iPhone 3G was announced .

It Is Unbelievable What a Tub of Soil Can Do
As discussed on the forum , Jon and I attended the presentation on the EMF Balancer given by Peter Webb .
In more ways than one , the product , as well as the presentation , were quite unbelievable .
It is not my purpose to assert whether the product actually works or not .
I think that the EMF Balancer speaks for itself , at least to critical thinkers .
Instead , I will just reiterate the claims that Peter made , as far as I could understand them , at the presentation .
Where a claim sounded incredible , which was most of the time , I made sure to ask Peter to repeat it or explain it .
In fact , my questioning became so intrusive at times that it prompted seat - shifting amongst the 20 or so attendees .
But the presentation turned out not to be just about the EMF Balancer , but about Peter himself , who seems to be quite the Renaissance man as far as New Age discoveries go .
The things with which Peter says he has been involved are quite amazing , and I saved the best claims for last .
If anyone thinks that I have misrepresented what Peter said , then I suppose they can always contact him directly .
He did not seem reticent about explaining his theories and accomplishments at the presentation , although he does seem to have had some bad experiences with the government shutting down his ventures and stealing his patents , so he might question your motives .
The Welcome
Jon and I were welcomed at the Shaklee business centre in the Market by Bill McBurney , the host and a natural health product distributor , and Steve Priebe , the local distributor for EMF Balancers .
I quite liked both of these guys .
They were genial , welcoming and eager to share with us their secrets to improved wellness .
I have absolutely no doubt that they genuinely believed in their products ’ capabilities and were more motivated to help people improve their lives than to turn a profit .
( If you detect a note of sarcasm in the rest of the article , it does not apply here .
These were two genuinely nice , well - meaning people . )
In fact , although the meeting amounted to a sales opportunity for both Bill and Steve , neither of them was really prepared at the end of the night to sell anything .
This was a shame because Bill had teased us with VIVIX , an anti-aging formula that is “ alive and raw ” and ten times more powerful than anything on the market , and Steve was approached by audience members who wanted to take home some EMF Balancers even though he did n’t bring any to sell .
As Jon and I took our seats in the back row , we noticed that there was a large EMF Balancer on the floor behind us .
There were also a number of different types on the table in the front .
We were also told there was one installed by the electrical panel .
Those already familiar with EMF
Balancers will already know that , in a house , you always install one at the electrical panel and then one at the furthest diagonal of the house .
Before we got started , all of the Balancers were turned on their sides ( this turns them off ) , and Jon was asked to do the same with the one near us on the floor .
EMF Free Zones
Steve handed out literature and was keen to show us a placard that they want to start displaying at sites with EMF Balancers installed .
It declares the site an EMF Free Zone , and it has the picture of a high tension electricity tower with the universal NO symbol superimposed over it .
Steve indicated that the Swedes are way ahead of us with this initiative and that these zones will improve everyone ’s health , especially those with “ electromagnetic hypersensitivity ” ( ESH ) .
This seemed like a great opportunity to jump into the theory , so I asked if we would not be able to receive cell phone calls in the room or if you would n’t be able to receive television or radio signals in your house if Balancers were installed .
Well , this was the first but far from the last time I showed my general ignorance for this whole concept .
EMF Balancers do not block EMFs .
In fact , an EMF meter shows no difference in reading , we were told , whether the Balancers are operating or not .
Peter even tried to give us a demonstration with an EMF meter , but the demo got distracted when the room lights did not prove to be as EMF polluting as needed .
The pronouncement that EMF Balancers do not reduce or eliminate EMFs seemed to really concern one member of the audience who , I deduced , was seriously hoping to rid his home of EMFs .
He continued the line of questioning from me to confirm his disappointment and then asked why they called them EMF Free Zones in that case .
Peter responded , “ What else are you going to call them ? ”
Good point .
One should n’t let facts get in the way of a good marketing slogan .
Geopathic Lines
I have to admit that I was way over my head when it came to the theory underlying these Balancers .
I will tell you what I understood from Peter ’s talk , but I did n’t realize that my general science background was so wanting .
Apparently , the Earth is covered with geomagnetically induced lines that people in the audience variously called Ley lines , Hartmann lines or geopathic lines .
I like that last term because it infers a disease quality to the Earth geomagnetic field .
In any case , when I asked what geopathic lines were , the audience seemed to collectively roll their eyes as if to say that I was living in a fool ’s paradise not knowing .
Apparently , geopathic lines run North - South and East - West , and at this latitude , Peter said that they are about four feet apart .
The problem with geopathic lines seems to be , according to Peter , that they act as a conduit to bring bad vibrations onto your property and they can be disturbing to be on top of .
Peter sells quite a few Balancers to farmers , and he declares that cattle get behavioural problems since they ’re always trying to get off the geopathic lines .
( He also informed us that cattle can develop a charge standing on a geopathic line and so they end up peeing on one another to keep from grounding themselves with their urine stream and getting a shock in the vitals . )
Peter also said that every crack in the road pavement has a geopathic line running through it .
So what does this have to do with EMFs ?
I ’m not really sure , although I asked a few times for an explanation .
I got the impression that the theory is pretty adaptable .
Geopathic lines can’t draw EMFs into your house or else an EMF meter would detect the increase , which we were told did not happen .
The best I could understand is that everything has a resonant frequency , and if you live near bad things , like gas stations or high tension towers , then the resonant frequencies of those bad things will be conducted into your house by the geopathic lines .
I was indeed living in a fool ’s paradise .
If only there was something to break up those lines .
EMF Balancers
One day , Peter was hiking in Wyoming and running his fingers through his hair .
After a while , he noticed his hair sticking up and realized that the Wyoming clay had special electrostatic properties .
That was the eureka moment for EMF Balancers .
Peter realized that , if you took a PVC tube , filled the bottom part with a layer of clay from Utah ( which has negative ionic properties ) , the middle part with a combination of calcium carbonate and kelp , and the top part with a layer of clay from Wyoming ( which has positive ionic properties ) , then the resulting figure - 8 electromagnetic circuit would allow the device to disrupt geopathic lines .
Brilliant !
The best inventions are the ones that seem so obvious after the fact .
Now you can understand why EMF Balancers have to stand upright to operate .
If the top is up , then they are ON ; if the top is down or if they are on their sides , then they are OFF .
But how do you know that this is true , especially when an EMF meter does not register any change between the device being on or off .
The answer , of course , is by dowsing .
Steve demonstrated .
Remember that the Balancers were all set on their sides at the beginning of the presentation , including the one behind Jon and me .
So naturally Steve ’s dowsing rods were going haywire .
Steve asked Jon to turn the Balancer behind us up , which Jon got up to do .
Sure enough , Steve ’s dowsing rods went still .
Steve then asked Jon to turn the Balancer on its side , which Jon did but then apologized for having previously turned the Balancer upside down by mistake .
…
No one batted an eye .
Jon and I exchanged glances of disbelief ; then Jon shrugged his shoulders and sat down .
After the presentation , when Jon asked about this seeming contradiction in the theory , Steve told him that , despite what Peter had said , EMF Balancers still work a bit when they are upside down .
Besides breaking up geopathic lines , what else can EMF Balancers do ?
Well , according to Peter :
They make the molecular structure of water bigger , which is healthier .
They prevent staph infections and MRSA .
They cause cows to produce more milk .
They make plants healthier because they mask the IR signal that plants give off due to sickness , which deters pests and allows farmers eliminate pesticide use .
( EMF Balancers are not just for the home and barn anymore .
Peter can now offer whole farm systems .
He even has bags of Soil Balancer that you can till into the soil . )
Farms never get hit by lightning after they have been installed .
In cars , they reduce friction in and increase oxygen to the engine .
( In fact , Peter has owned four cars that have each logged 500,000 kms with only oil and tire changes .
I was surprised to hear that he has driven two million kms . )
Programming EMF Balancers
I asked if the Balancers were tuned or restricted in the sympathetic frequencies with which they could operate .
Well , it turns out that Peter programs them .
In the old days , he used to have to pour the soil over different rock minerals , since each mineral has a different natural frequency , but he now has a way of programming the soil by machine .
He gives the Balancers wide - spectrum programming , but he improves them regularly .
That led me to ask if it was then better to get a later version of the Balancers or if people could get theirs upgraded .
Well , Peter was way ahead of me on that one .
You see , he programs all of them daily , free of charge .
And how does he do that ?
By radionics , Peter said .
Again , excuse me if my general scientific ignorance is showing , but I had never heard of radionics , so I asked what it was .
My questions inspired a collective sigh from the audience .
I think they were embarrassed for me and knew that there was not enough time in the presentation to get me up to speed .
I just had to trust Peter on this one .
Radionics gives him the ability to program every EMF Balancer in the world , without having to know where they all are , on a daily business .
Apparently , the silica chips in the Balancers acts as a receiver .
I had n’t heard about the silica chips until that point .
Have You Ever Been in an EMF Balanced Building
Jon and I have experienced the sanctity and serenity of sitting in a room devoid of geopathic intrusion … I guess .
If you want the same experience , Steve handed out a list of places where he says EMF Balancers have been installed in the National Capital Region .
I have no way in knowing if the list is accurate .
It includes a lot of CAM and wellness type places , but it also includes The Diver ’s Warehouse , Tudor Hall Conference Facilities , Pizzaro ’s Restaurant , Mont - Bleu Ford , George Petric Ford , American Graffiti Automotive , Allright Automotive … and the Louis Riel and Trillium Schools in Vanier .
These last two locations got our immediate attention , and so I asked a lot of questions to make sure I was not mistaken that EMF Balancers had been installed in two public elementary schools .
( Note : Jon and I have begun corresponding with the schools as a follow - up to this discovery .
This investigation will be covered in another article . )
I was not mistaken .
According to Steve , six Balancers have been installed in Louis Riel and five in Trillium .
Why so many , I asked .
Was it based on area or volume ?
No .
Apparently , EMF Balancer coverage is beyond Steve ’s ability to determine , and so he had to phone Peter for advice .
Peter admitted that it was a bit of an art , but he has being doing this for so long that he has a feel for it .
In fact , Peter says that he can tell if a building has EMF Balancers installed ( and turned right - side up , presumably ) by just walking in the door .
Peter then said that he has found that the effect of EMF Balancers goes up exponentially with the number of devices .
That makes some sense in that one Balance can protect a room , while a pair can manage a house .
However , by my reckoning , six Balancers would cover about 500 - 600 square miles .
I wondered if the six in Louis Riel were , in effect , protecting most of Ottawa .
Well , what I did n’t know is that EMF Balancers automatically know where property lines are and stop their effect at them .
In fact , after the presentation , Steve took me out onto Cumberland Street to show me how his dowsing rods began to rotate at the edge of the sidewalk at the road .
( In fact , the rods spun so much that I thought I could see his wrists move . )
I take it from that demonstration that the Shaklee Centre owns the city sidewalk right up to the road .
Things I Never Knew
It would be wrong to refer to Peter only as the inventor and producer of EMF Balancers .
He is , in fact , a polymath .
I tried to keep the above discussion on a single narrative line , but what I failed to include were the amazing statements of fact that Peter interspersed throughout his presentation .
Here is a list of but a few :
EMFs make your body acidic .
The clockwise polarity of EMFs prevents half of the minerals you consume from being absorbed .
Digital clocks negatively affect pituitary glands .
Compact fluorescent bulbs contain mercury and therefore negatively affect pituitary glands .
( Pituitary glands seem quite vulnerable . )
Kinesiology tests show differences in muscle strength when cell phones are on or off .
In the UK , 60 percent of teenagers in jails have autism .
All electrical wiring in New Zealand is underground ( which makes me wonder about the epidemiological study of the effects of above - ground , high tension wires done in Aukland around 1997 )
In all of Europe ( or perhaps specifically in Austria or Switzerland or Germany ) , you are required to have a dowser certify your property for geopathic lines or you must divert them around your property with a copper wire .
( Strangely , none of my friends who have lived in Europe has told me about this . )

PR -123-2008
WITH Barack Obama 's election to the presidency , the evangelical moment in US foreign policy has come to an end .
The United States remains a nation of believers , with Christianity the tradition to which most Americans adhere .
Yet the religious sensibility informing American statecraft will no longer find expression in an urge to launch crusades against evil - doers .
Like our current president , Obama is a professed Christian .
Yet whereas George W. Bush once identified Jesus Christ himself as his favorite philosopher , the president - elect is an admirer of Reinhold Niebuhr , the renowned Protestant theologian .
Faced with difficult problems , conservative evangelicals ask WWJD :
What would Jesus do ?
We are now entering an era in which the occupant of the Oval Office will consider a different question :
What would Reinhold do ?
During the middle third of the last century , Niebuhr thought deeply about the complexities , moral and otherwise , of international politics .
Although an eminently quotable writer , his insights do not easily reduce to a sound - bite or bumper sticker .
At the root of Niebuhr 's thinking lies an appreciation of original sin , which he views as indelible and omnipresent .
In a fallen world , power is necessary , otherwise we lie open to the assaults of the predatory .
Yet since we too number among the fallen , our own professions of innocence and altruism are necessarily suspect .
Power , wrote Niebuhr , " cannot be wielded without guilt , since it is never transcendent over interest . "
Therefore , any nation wielding great power but lacking self - awareness - never an American strong suit - poses an imminent risk not only to others but to itself .
Here lies the statesman 's dilemma :
You 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't .
To refrain from resisting evil for fear of violating God 's laws is irresponsible .
Yet for the powerful to pretend to interpret God 's will qualifies as presumptuous .
To avert evil , action is imperative ; so too is self - restraint .
Even worthy causes pursued blindly yield morally problematic results .
Niebuhr specialized in precise distinctions .
He supported US intervention in World War II - and condemned the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended that war .
After 1945 , Niebuhr believed it just and necessary to contain the Soviet Union .
Yet he forcefully opposed US intervention in Vietnam .
The vast claims of Bush 's second inaugural - with the president discerning history 's " visible direction , set by liberty and the Author of Liberty " - would have appalled Niebuhr , precisely because Bush meant exactly what he said .
In international politics , true believers are more dangerous than cynics .
Grandiose undertakings produce monstrous byproducts .
In the eyes of critics , Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo show that all of Bush 's freedom talk is simply a lie .
Viewed from a Niebuhrean perspective , they become the predictable if illegitimate offspring of Bush 's convictions .
Better to forget utopia , leaving it to God to determine history 's trajectory .
On the stump , Obama did not sound much like a follower of Niebuhr .
Campaigns reward not introspection , but simplistic reassurance : " Yes , we can ! "
Yet as the dust now settles , we might hope that the victor will sober up and rediscover his Niebuhrean inclinations .
Sobriety in this case begins with abrogating what Niebuhr called " our dreams of managing history , " triggered by the end of the Cold War and reinforced by Sept. 11 .
" The course of history , " he emphasized , " cannot be coerced . "
We 've tried having a born - again president intent on eliminating evil .
It did n't work .
May our next president acknowledge the possibility that , as Niebuhr put it , " the evils against which we contend are frequently the fruits of illusions which are similar to our own . "
Facing our present predicament requires that we shed illusions about America that would have offended Jesus himself .
Obama has written that he took from reading Niebuhr " the compelling idea that there 's serious evil in the world " along with the conviction that evil 's persistence should not be " an excuse for cynicism and inaction . "
Yet Niebuhr also taught him that " we should be humble and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things . "
As a point of departure for reformulating US foreign policy , we could do a lot worse .

The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) floats gracefully above the blue Earth after release from Discovery 's robot arm after a successful STS - 103 servicing mission in December 1999 .
FOR MORE INFORMATION FOR MORE INFORMATION
News from SPACE.com Science and space news on USATODAY.com
In light of the most recent glitch on the Hubble Space Telescope , a serious equipment failure that means the observatory is unable to send data back to Earth , some are beginning to wonder , is Hubble still worth saving ?
The answer , according to many scientists , is yes .
RELATED : Hubble glitch will delay repair mission until 2009
The failure of a device called the Side A Science Data Formatter , used to send images and other data from Hubble back to Earth , is a problem , but likely one that can be fixed .
The glitch was announced Monday by NASA .
Engineers now plan to switch the observatory over to a spare " Side B " part currently on board , and perhaps send up a replacement device on the next space shuttle servicing mission , which had been scheduled for October but now has been delayed to early next year .
Glitches happen
Though it may sound like one setback too many for the aging observatory , scientists say Hubble still has a lot of life in it yet .
" Of course it 's worth upgrading Hubble , " said Mario Livio , an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md. " The part that failed even has as redundant side to it .
If all goes well , science operations could be up as early as the end of this week .
So you should n't worry about that .
It 's definitely not the end of the world . "
The now - broken electronics box had been working steadily since the telescope launched in April 1990 .
" These things happen .
It 's been up there in orbit , outside the protective atmosphere of the Earth for 18 years , " said Heidi Hammel , an astronomer at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Co . " Glitches happen .
It 's an incredibly robust instrument .
Think about your computers — you do n't still use computers that are 18 years old . "
Maybe we should give the old scope a break and forgive its failings now and then , since it has served us so well for so long , scientists say .
In fact , rather than be discouraged by the glitch , some are celebrating the fact that it occurred now , right before a planned upgrade mission .
If the malfunction had occurred after the shuttle mission to Hubble , then operations could still be switched over to the redundant part onboard , but that would leave the telescope without a backup if that part failed again , or if the spare part did n't work at all .
Now , though , scientists have the option of sending up a new device to replace the broken one , leaving the telescope in a less vulnerable position .
" It 's probably better it failed now than the week after the servicing mission was done , but it does frustrate all of us that were looking forward to a mission two weeks from now , " Hammel said in a phone interview .
" But I 'd rather we 'd waited and did it right . "
Worth the money ?
The failure is not just costing more time , but also more money .
For every month NASA delays the shuttle servicing mission , Hubble 's cost jumps by $ 10 million to keep ground systems running and a team in place .
But telescope team members argue that the bloat to Hubble 's price tag is nowhere close to pushing it over the edge of costing more than it 's worth .
" I do n't see this failure as putting us over the fence and causing NASA to want to throw up its hands and say , ' Hey , all the hundreds of millions of dollars we 've spent on the hardware and readiness for this mission , we 're just gonna chuck it , you know , this is just a little too much for us , ' " Preston Burch , Hubble manager at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , told reporters at a Monday teleconference .
" We 've got a lot of options here .
I do n't see [ NASA officials ]
Ed Weiler and Mike Griffin or myself throwing in the towel because we 've got to spend a few more tens of millions to pull this mission off .
You know , I think we 're definitely going after this . "
Since all of the instruments planned to be installed during the servicing mission have already been built , and most of the training and preparations for the upgrade made , calling it off now would be a waste , many argue .
" We 've got these new instruments that are ready to go , they 're down there ready to fly , " Hammel said .
" I think it 's absolutely worthwhile . "
The engine still works
But some critics have questioned the wisdom of investing in keeping the aging Hubble going , when we could be spending money to build a brand new telescope to replace it .
Hubble has cost a total of about $ 10 billion over its lifetime , including its past servicing missions , estimated Ed Weiler , associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C.
Its initial cost was about $ 1.6 billion , he said .
Given that the upcoming servicing mission will cost about $ 900 million , it could be seen as a bargain compared to building and launching a new observatory from scratch .
" The thing about telescopes is that the mirror is the main component , " Hammel said .
" Once that 's built , you do n't need to build new ones , you just need to swap out the instruments .
There 's nothing wrong with Hubble 's mirror .
It 's great . "
She compared a telescope with a working mirror to an old car with a good engine left .
It makes more sense to swap out tires and other elements of the car than to simply buy a new one , since the most important element still functions fine .
" If at some point , there 's a glitch that is not recoverable , then you 're done , but as long as the glitches can be solved and repaired , it 's sort of like an old car — you do n't want to let it go when it 's still running , " she said .
And the upgrades to Hubble are n't coming at a sacrifice to building new telescopes .
Plans for the James Webb Space Telescope are progressing ; the roughly $ 4.5 billion observatory is currently slated to launch in 2013 .
However , that observatory will work in the infrared range of light , rather than the visible like Hubble , so James Webb is n't really a replacement for Hubble , but a parallel instrument .
Hubble 's last picture Ultimately , scientists say the recent glitch does n't darken Hubble 's long - term prospects .
" I have no doubt that that we can service Hubble and make it into a telescope that will be even better than what Hubble has been so far , " Livio told SPACE.com .
" So far Hubble has been this amazing telescope that really changed all our views of the universe .
I see the next five years as perhaps being even better than what we 've seen . "
Once the servicing mission has finally been completed , especially if the astronauts are able to install a new Side A Science Data Formatter , Hubble should be in the best shape it 's ever been .
" If we are going to do this final servicing mission and spend the money involved and launch seven astronauts , we thought it would be proper due diligence if we assured that this mission would leave Hubble with a good solid five - or six - or seven - year future , " Weiler said .
And , when the day comes that Hubble finally takes its last picture , scientists say they will know the whole endeavor had been worth it , because the telescope has already changed our understanding of the cosmos many times .
" The whole Hubble program has just been a fabulous testament to the NASA science community and the NASA astronaut community , " Hammel said .
" I hope things do n't go wrong but if they do , we just have to accept that .
The Hubble program has been so fantastically successful .
It 's more than what anyone expected . "

IT happens to all of us : the moment when one finds out that more megapixels and better photographs are n’t always the same thing .
To be disabused of the Megapixel Myth  this decade ’s analog of the Megahertz Myth  can lead to an existential buyer ’s crisis in miniature .
Disbelief , at first , gives way to a sort of embarrassing self - questioning :
You mean , 15 megapixels is n’t three times better than 5 megapixels ?
This year ’s model is n’t better than last year ’s ?
I spent all that money upgrading  for nothing ?
The panicky consumer is then faced with the choice of dumping digital electronics and becoming a Luddite , or learning about camera technology and taking control of purchasing decisions .
Upon pursuing this latter path , one soon realizes that all is not lost .
Newer generations of digital cameras and camcorders , which almost always have more megapixels or higher resolutions , still tend to produce great output .
WHATEVER YOU'RE AFTER , THIS ISN'T IT Yes , this is one of those annoying 404 errors .
Sorry !

Thousands of protesters rallied against the Iraq War at the Republican Convention on Monday .
The thousands of protesters were almost all peaceful .
I had US cable news on all day off and on , and never saw anything on it about the protests .
Some teenager was pregnant , which is not their business or mine , but that was what they were talking about .
Protesting the Republican Party ’s warmongering and lethal corruption for the past 8 years – a record that has made it impolitick for George W. Bush to attend the conference of the party he still technically leads– now that was unworthy of public comment .
A few at the rally were accused of breaking windows or throwing bottles at the police .
284 arrests were made .
The press accounts suggest that in some instances police acted overly aggressively ( i.e. unconstitutionally ) , moving in on protesters who were peaceful .
Over the weekend , police seized printed materials and protest plans from some of the organizers and arrested a handful , charging them with conspiracy to commit civil disorder .
Gee , you could have arrested Martin Luther King every day of the week on that charge .
That something was very wrong with at least some of the police response in Minneapolis is demonstrated by the arrest and manhandling of Amy Goodman and two of her staff members .
They were there as press .
They were not throwing anything .
I know them , and have been on the show numerous times .
They are honest , committed people , and if they say they were wrongly treated , they were .
Over the weekend , Democracy Now !
reporter Elizabeth Press had been arrested , apparently for planning to film police response to the protests .
Among those arrested was Amy Goodman ( video below ) , who was later released .
This site gives
Amy ’s side of the story :
‘ ST . PAUL — Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman and producers Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar have all been released from police custody in St. Paul following their illegal arrest by Minneapolis Police on Monday afternoon .
All three were violently manhandled by law enforcement officers .
Abdel Kouddous was slammed against a wall and the ground , leaving his arms scraped and bloodied .
He sustained other injuries to his chest and back .
Salazar ’s violent arrest by baton - wielding officers , during which she was slammed to the ground while yelling , “ I ’m Press ! Press ! , ” resulted in her nose bleeding , as well as causing facial pain .
Goodman ’s arm was violently yanked by police as she was arrested .
On Tuesday , Democracy Now ! will broadcast video of these arrests , as well as the broader police action .
These will also be available on : Democracynow.org .
Goodman was arrested while questioning police about the unlawful detention of Kouddous and Salazar who were arrested while they carried out their journalistic duties in covering street demonstrations at the Republican National Convention .
Goodman ’s crime appears to have been defending her colleagues and the freedom of the press .
Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher told Democracy Now ! that Kouddous and Salazar were arrested on suspicion of rioting , a felony .
While the three have been released , they all still face charges stemming from their unlawful arrest .
Kouddous and Salazar face pending charges of suspicion of felony riot , while Goodman has been officially charged with obstruction of a legal process and interference with a “ peace officer . ”
Democracy Now !
forcefully rejects all of these charges as false and an attempt at intimidation of these journalists .
We demand that the charges be immediately and completely dropped . ’
Ever since Bush and his gang came to power , there has been a concerted attempt to destroy the First Amendment right to peaceful assembly .
New York City recently settled with antiwar protesters illegally arrested in spring of 2003 , paying $ 2 million .
Those protesters , remember , had been trying to avert the catastrophe that was the Iraq War , or at least not have it go without public expression of dissent .
Ironically , Democracy Now ! is among the few news programs that tries to deliver real news to the American public , not the babysitting pap that passes for such so often in the corporate media .
Of course , in our Bushwellian State , its staff would have to be arrested for committing News .
Hang in there , Amy .
History has a mysterious way of creeping up on those that fail to study it .
Somehow , with all the talking heads going crazy , you would think this housing market has no parallel in history .
When you hear that the national median home price has never gone down there is always the caveat of “ since the Great Depression . ”
I ’ve written 3 articles about the Great Depression ( letter from a lawyer , letter from a president of a bank , and 3 main reasons why this bubble is worse ) highlighting eerie similarities of this credit bubble to the Roaring 20s .
Keep in mind during the 1920s the nation was engulfed with Coolidge prosperity and all things business were here to stay .
In fact , today we are going to examine a few paragraphs from an amazing book by Frederick Lewis Allen called Only Yesterday written in 1931 which examines the decade of the 1920s in great detail .
A reader of this blog recommended this book sometime ago and I ’m glad I had the chance to read this in depth analysis of the 1920s from an author with an uncanny ability to retell history .
Dispute it all you want but there is a chapter in the book called Home , Sweet Florida that if one did n’t see the date , could be published in the Miami Herald dated 2007 .
Let us compare and contrast the past with our current housing debacle :
“ There was nothing languorous about the atmosphere of tropical Miami during that memorable summer and autumn of 1925 .
The whole city had become one frenzied real - estate exchange .
There were said to be 2,000 real - estate offices and 25,000 agents marketing house - lots or acreage .
The shirt - sleeved crowds hurrying to and fro under the widely advertised Florida sun talked of binders and options and water - frontages and hundred thousand - dollar profits ; the city fathers had been forced to pass an ordinance forbidding the sale of property in the street , or even the showing of a map , to prevent inordinate traffic congestion .
The warm air vibrated with the clatter of riveters , for the steel skeletons of skyscrapers were rising to give Miami a skyline appropriate to its metropolitan destiny .
Motor - busses roared down Flagler Street , carrying “ prospects ” on free trips to watch dredges and steam - shovels converting the outlying mangrove swamps and the sandbars of the Bay of Biscayne into gorgeous Venetian cities for the American homemakers and pleasure - seekers of the future .
The Dixie Highway was clogged with automobiles from every part of the country ; a traveler caught in a traffic jam counted the license - plates of eighteen state among the sedans and flivvers waiting in line .
Hotels were overcrowded .
People were sleeping wherever they could lay their heads , in station waiting - rooms or in automobiles .
The railroads had been forced to place an embargo on imperishable freight in order to avert the danger of famine ; building materials were now being imported by water and the harbor bristled with shipping .
Fresh vegetables were a rarity , the public utilities of the city were trying desperately to meet the suddenly multiplied demand for electricity and gas and telephone service , and there were recurrent shortages of ice . ”
So first we must realize that real estate frenzies have occurred in the past .
In addition , the idea of people waiting to bid on property not currently built occurred during the 1920s in Florida .
And all those high - rise condos waiting to come online in 2008 or 2009 ?
Florida again seems to be ground zero of the real estate frenzy .
Even the out of town investors going zero down on a mortgage for a property that is n’t even built is something that happened long ago .
Reminds many people of the multiple license plates in Arizona a few years ago of people extending their credit to buy a pre-fab construction only to flip it a few months down the road .
Like any boom , this did n’t happen overnight back then either .
What events led to Florida being the prime location ?
Let us take a look :
“ For this amazing boom , which had gradually been gathering headway for several years but had not become sensational until 1924 , there were a number of causes .
Let us list them categorically .
1 . First of all , of course , the climate - Florida ’s unanswerable argument .
2 . The accessibility of the state to the populous cities of the Northeast - an advantage which Southern California could not well deny .
3 . The automobile , which was rapidly making America into a nation of nomads ; teaching all manner of men and women to explore their country , and enabling even the small farmer , the summer - boarding - house keeper , and the garage man to pack their families into flivvers and tour southward from auto - camp to auto - camp for a winter of sunny leisure .
4 . The abounding confidence engendered by Coolidge Prosperity , which persuaded the four - thousand - dollar - a - year salesman that in some magical way he too might tomorrow be able to buy a fine house and all the good things of earth .
5 . A paradoxical , widespread , but only half - acknowledged revolt against the very urbanization and industrialization of the country , the very concentration upon work , the very routine and smoke and congestion and twentieth - century standardization of living upon which Coolidge Prosperity was based .
These things might bring the American businessman money , but to spend it he longed to escape from them - into the free sunshine of the remembered countryside , into the easy - going life and beauty of the European past , into some never - never land which combined American sport and comfort with Latin glamour - a Venice equipped with bathtubs and electric iceboxes , a Seville provided with three eighteen - hole golf courses .
6 . The example of Southern California , which had advertised its climate at the top of its lungs and had prospered by so doing : why , argued the Floridians , could n’t Florida do likewise ?
7 . And finally , another result of Coolidge Prosperity : not only did John Jones expect that presently he might be able to afford a house at Boca Raton and a vacation - time of tarpon - fishing or polo , but he also was fed on stories of bold business enterprise and sudden wealth until he was ready to believe that the craziest real - estate development might be the gold - mine which would work this miracle for him .
Crazy real - estate developments ?
But were they crazy ?
By 1925 few of them looked so any longer .
The men whose fantastic projects had seemed in 1923 to be evidences of megalomania were now coining millions : by the pragmatic test they were not madmen but - as the advertisements put it - inspired dreamers .
Coral Gables , Hollywood - by - the - Sea , Miami Beach , Davis Islands - there they stood : mere patterns on a blue - print no longer , but actual cities of brick and concrete and stucco ; unfinished , to be sure , but growing with amazing speed , while prospects stood in line to buy and every square foot within their limits leaped in price . ”
Did someone write this yesterday ?
The book title is still accurate even though 1931 is a distant memory .
The same arguments used in 1925 are being used in the current marketplace regarding housing .
First , the main argument for Florida and Southern California is the weather .
We ’ve dubbed it the sunshine tax .
So this argument for pumping ludicrous mortgages is n’t something new .
Next , we have the argument of proximity to locations and centers of employment .
Another argument used by many housing pundits pushing these overpriced units .
None of these things changed ( after all we still have the sun ) and this is nearly 100 years ago .
Subdivide and conquer seems to be the mantra in real estate booms .
The author makes a unique point about the primal desire for families to reunite with a more tranquil life at the cost of working like a maniac to afford the mortgage on a home in an urban area .
A Catch - 22 that many families in 2007 are facing .
And the marketing and advertising tactics have n’t changed .
Have you seen the current ads for Florida housing ?
“ Your home with the tranquility of Venice ” or “ Come escape to your own private Paris . ”
What they are implying is that your subdivided cookie cutter home is somehow similar to condensed apartment style living from Europe .
Last time I checked not many Parisians or Italians had 2 car garages to support monster Hummers and Expeditions .
So this yearning for European style tranquility is highly misplaced because even Europeans do not live this way .
But the underlying implication is “ you too can get away from the stressful congested freeways and 12 hour work days in the city ” at least for a few hours in your private palace even though you have to work like a maniac to afford your exotic - high - flying - zero - down mortgage .
But did people get caught up in the frenzy like this current boom ?
“ Yes , the public bought .
By 1925 they were buying anything , anywhere , so long as it was in Florida .
One had only to announce a new development , be it honest or fraudulent , be it on the Atlantic Ocean or deep in the wasteland of the interior , to set people scrambling for house lots .
“ Manhattan Estates ” was advertised as being “ not more than three fourths of a mile from the prosperous and fast - growing city of Nettie ” ; there was no such city as Nettie , the name being that of an abandoned turpentine camp , yet people bought .
Investigators of the claims made for “ Melbourne Gardens ” tried to find the place , found themselves driving along a trail “ through prairie muck land , with a few trees and small clumps of palmetto , ” and were hopelessly mired in the mud three miles short of their destination .
But still the public bought , here and elsewhere , blindly , trustingly - natives of Florida , visitors to Florida , and good citizens of Ohio and Massachusetts and Wisconsin who had never been near Florida but made out their checks for lots in what they were told was to be “ another Coral Gables ” or was “ next to the right of way of the new railroad ” or was to be a “ twenty - million - dollar city . ”
The stories of prodigious profits made in Florida land were sufficient bait .
A lot in the business center of Miami Beach had sold for $ 800 in the early days of the development and had resold for $ 150,000 in 1924 .
For a strip of land in Palm Beach a New York lawyer had been offered $ 240,000 some eight or ten years before the boom ; in 1923 he finally accepted $ 800,000 for it ; the next year the strip of land was broken up into building lots and disposed of at an aggregate price of $ 1,500,000 ; and in 1925 there were those who claimed that its value had risen to $ 4,000,000 .
A poor woman who had bought a piece of land near Miami in 1896 for $ 25 was able to sell it in 1925 for $ 150,000 .
Such tales were legion ; every visitor to the Gold Coast could pick them up by the dozen ; and many if not most of them were quite true - though the profits were largely on paper .
No wonder the rush for Florida land justified the current anecdote of a native saying to a visitor , “ Want to buy a lot ? ” and the visitor at once replying , “ Sold . ”
Greed has an interesting way of coming back into the mainstream .
As the author points out , even places that were 15 , 20 , or 30 miles away from the prime locations were selling like crazy simply because the real estate tornado frenzy brought these places into the fold .
Think of the Real Homes of Genius , the Inland Empire , Arizona , Nevada , and Florida .
One need only look at the current headlines of current Florida housing to find similar parallels from the above .
Why are housing pundits so quick to dismiss history without taking a critical eye of what happened in the past ?
Do they somehow think they are above the narrative of history ?
Is this time really different ?
They want you to believe that they have found the new calculus of housing success .
Well as you are seeing , this bust is playing out exactly like it did almost 100 years ago .
To continue with the chapter , it appears that speculation was rampant just like it was during our boom :
“ Speculation was easy - and quick .
No long delays while titles were being investigated and deeds recorded ; such tiresome formalities were postponed .
The prevalent method of sale was thus described by Walter C. Hill of the Retail Credit Company of Atlanta in the Inspection Report issued by his concern : “ Lots are bought from blueprints .
They look better that way ….
Around Miami , subdivisions , except the very large ones , are often sold out the first day of sale .
Advertisements appear describing the location , extent , special features , and approximate price of the lots .
Reservations are accepted .
This requires a check for 10 per cent of the price of the lot the buyer expects to select .
On the first day of sale , at the promoter ’s office in town , the reservations are called out in order , and the buyer steps up and , from a beautifully drawn blueprint , with lots and dimensions and prices clearly shown , selects a lot or lots , gets a receipt in the form of a `binder ’ describing it , and has the thrill of seeing ` Sold ’ stamped in the blue - lined square which represents his lot , a space usually fifty by a hundred feet of Florida soil or swamp .
There are instances where these first - day sales have gone into several millions of dollars .
And the prices ! …
Inside lots from $ 8,000 to $ 20,000 .
Water - front lots from $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 .
Seashore lots from $ 20,000 to $ 75,000 .
And these are not in Miami .
They are miles out - ten miles out , fifteen miles out , and thirty miles out . ”
Wait .
Did they say people needed 10 percent down ?
We out did the speculative bubble of the 1920s since we cut out that measly 10 percent down and went zero down and sometimes people got cash - back at closing !
This reminds one of sales even in Orange County California where new subdivisions sold out the first day .
People waited in line for days to get on a list for the chance to purchase a home at a hyper inflated price .
Looking back people must feel that they were waiting in line to be punched in the face by Mike Tyson .
And what about the metal cranes covering the Florida skyline ?
Many of these units wo n’t hit the market until 2008 and 2009 at the peak of the bubble decline .
Fascinating how greed can overtake an entire population .
And lets be honest , how many of these people actually had visions of buying a Miami condo to live and raise a family for an entire generation ?
I would venture that the percent can be counted on one hand .
What kind of rhetoric was used to pump these new paradise resorts ?
Let us take a look :
“ Steadily , during that feverish summer and autumn of 1925 , the hatching of new plans for vast developments continued .
A great many of them , apparently , were intended to be occupied by what the advertisers of Miami Beach called “ America ’s wealthiest sportsmen , devotees of yachting and the other expensive sports , ” and the advertisers of Boca Raton called “ the world of international wealth that dominates finance and industry . . . that sets fashions . . . the world of large affairs , smart society and leisured ease . ”
Few of those in the land - rush seemed to question whether there would be enough devotees of yachting and men and women of leisured ease to go round .
Everywhere vast new hotels , apartment houses , casinos were being projected .
At the height of the fury of building a visitor to West Palm Beach noticed a large vacant lot almost completely covered with bath - tubs .
The tubs had apparently been there some time ; the crates which surrounded them were well weathered .
The lot , he was informed , was to be the site of “ One of the most magnificent apartment buildings in the South ” - but the freight embargo had held up the contractor ’s building material and only the bathtubs had arrived !
Throughout Florida re- sounded the slogans and hyperboles of boundless confidence .
The advertising columns shrieked with them , those swollen advertising columns which enabled the Miami Daily News , one day in the summer of 1925 , to print an issue of 504 pages , the largest in newspaper history , and enabled the Miami Herald to carry a larger volume of advertising in 1925 than any paper anywhere had ever before carried in a year .
Miami was not only “ The Wonder City , ” it was also “ The Fair White Goddess of Cities , ” “ The World ’s Playground , ” and “ The City Invincible . ”
Fort Lauderdale became “ The Tropical Wonderland , ” Orlando “ The City Beautiful , ” and Sanford “ The City Substantial . ”
Location , location , location .
Speculation , speculation , speculation .
I was going through this weekend ’s LA Times and an inordinate amount of space is given to real estate advertisements .
In fact , most of the ads are housing related .
For example , you have your multiple electronic stores telling you how to fill up every nook in cranny of your place with 60 inch plasma TVs and state of the art refrigerators that make ice out of thin air .
All for 0 percent financing over 24 months .
And then we have all the ads about majestic beds and sofas that are fit for King Tut himself .
Even the King did n’t have access to American Express !
And then we have the housing ads .
I was looking at some condo ads in Florida and you would think that you are buying the most fantastic , stupendous , amazing , fabulous , and gorgeous 1,200 square foot piece of land in the entire universe .
You may want to buy stock in Thesaurus publishers with the amount of adjectives these advertising and marketing agency use for housing .
With the benefit of foresight , we know how the bubble of the 1920s ended but we are still uncertain how this current market will unfold .
As humans , we like hearing things in a narrative form .
If A happens then B happens which obviously leads to C happening .
We are terrible at constructing real - time narratives because we are living the moment and have a hard time stepping back and examining the landscape from a bird ’s eye view .
Call it existential living .
For the sake of forecasting , how did the 1920s Florida housing market end and can we learn anything from it ?
“ Perhaps the boom was due for a “ healthy breathing - time …
As a matter of fact , it was due for a good deal more than that .
It began obviously to collapse in the spring and summer of 1926 .
People who held binders and had failed to get rid of them were defaulting right and left on their payments .
One man who had sold acreage early in 1925 for twelve dollars an acre , and had cursed himself for his stupidity when it was resold later in the year for seventeen dollars , and then thirty dollars , and finally sixty dollars an acre , was surprised a year or two afterward to find that the entire series of subsequent purchases was in default , that he could not recover the money still due him , and that his only redress was to take his land back again .
There were cases in which the land not only came back to the original owner , but came back burdened with taxes and assessments which amounted to more than the cash he had received for it ; and furthermore he found his land blighted with a half - completed development .
Just as it began to be clear that a wholesale deflation was inevitable , two hurricanes showed what a Soothing Tropic Wind could do when it got a running start from the West Indies .
No malevolent Providence bent upon the teaching of humility could have struck with a more precise aim than the second and worst of these Florida hurricanes .
It concentrated upon the exact region where the boom had been noisiest and most hysterical - the region about Miami .
Hitting the Gold Coast early in the morning of September 18 , 1926 , it piled the waters of Biscayne Bay into the lovely Venetian developments , deposited a five - masted steel schooner high in the street at Coral Gables , tossed big steam yachts upon the avenues of Miami , picked up trees , lumber , pipes , tiles , debris , and even small automobiles and sent them crashing into the houses , ripped the roofs off thousands of jerry - built cottages and villas , almost wiped out the town of Moore Haven on Lake Okeechobee , and left behind it some four hundred dead , sixty - three hundred injured , and fifty thousand homeless .
Valiantly the Floridians insisted that the damage was not irreparable ; so valiantly , in fact , that the head of the American Red Cross , John Barton Payne , was quoted as charging that the officials of the state had “ practically destroyed ” the national Red Cross campaign for relief of the homeless .
Mayor Romfh of Miami declared that he saw no reason “ why this city should not entertain her winter visitors the coming season as comfortably as in past seasons . ”
But the Soothing Tropic Wind had had its revenge ; it had destroyed the remnants of the Florida boom .
By 1927 , according to Homer B. Vanderblue , most of the elaborate real - estate offices on Flagler Street in Miami were either closed or practically empty ; the Davis Islands project , “ bankrupt and unfinished , ” had been taken over by a syndicate organized by Stone & Webster ; and many Florida cities , including Miami , were having difficulty collecting their taxes .
By 1928 Henry S. Villard , writing in The Nation , thus described the approach to Miami by road : “ Dead subdivisions line the highway , their pompous names half - obliterated on crumbling stucco gates .
Lonely white - way lights stand guard over miles of cement side - walks , where grass and palmetto take the place of homes that were to be ….
Whole sections of outlying subdivisions are composed of unoccupied houses , past which one speeds on broad thoroughfares as if traversing a city in the grip of death . ”
In 1928 there were thirty - one bank failures in Florida ; in 1929 there were fifty - seven ; in both of these years the liabilities of the failed banks reached greater totals than were recorded for any other state in the Union .
The Mediterranean fruitfly added to the gravity of the local economic situation in 1929 by ravaging the citrus crop .
Bank clearings for Miami , which had climbed sensationally to over a billion dollars in 1925 , marched sadly downhill again :
1925 ………………………..
$ 1,066,528,000
1926 ………………………….. 632,867,000
1927 ………………………….. 260,039,000
1928 ………………………….. 143,364,000
1929 ………………………….. 142,316,000
And those were the very years when elsewhere in the country prosperity was triumphant !
By the middle of 1930 , after the general business depression had set in , no less than twenty - six Florida cities had gone into default of principal or interest on their bonds , the heaviest defaults being those of West Palm Beach , Miami , Sanford , and Lake Worth ; and even Miami , which had a minor issue of bonds maturing in August , 1930 , confessed its inability to redeem them and asked the bondholders for an extension .
The cheerful custom of incorporating real - estate developments as “ cities ” and financing the construction of all manner of improvements with “ tax - free municipal bonds , ” as well as the custom on the part of development corporations of issuing real - estate bonds secured by new structures located in the boom territory , were showing weaknesses unimagined by the inspired dreamers of 1925 .
Most of the millions piled up in paper profits had melted away , many of the millions sunk in developments had been sunk for good and all , the vast inverted pyramid of credit had toppled to earth , and the lesson of the economic falsity of a scheme of land values based upon grandiose plans , preposterous expectations , and hot air had been taught in a long agony of deflation .
For comfort there were only a few saving facts to cling to .
Florida still had her climate , her natural resources .
The people of Florida still had energy and determination , and having recovered from their debauch of hope , were learning from the relentless discipline of events .
Not all Northerners who had moved to Florida in the days of plenty had departed in the days of adversity .
Far from it : the census of 1930 , in fact , gave Florida an increase in population of over 50 per cent since 1920 - a larger increase than that of any other state except California - and showed that in the same interval Miami had grown by nearly 400 per cent .
Florida still had a future ; there was no doubt of that , sharp as the pains of enforced postponement were .
Nor , for that matter , were the people of Florida alone blameworthy for the insanity of 1925 .
They , perhaps , had done most of the shouting , but the hysteria which had centered in their state had been a national hysteria , enormously increased by the influx of outlanders intent upon making easy money ” .
And so the boom ended in a spectacular fashion .
The peak hit in 1925 and steadily declined through the Great Depression .
And as the author points out , this was during a time when the country was supposedly prospering .
Does n’t this remind you of the current administration touting our record low unemployment rate and record high home ownership rate ?
You would think we are in the apex of financial success with a minor bump in housing .
But markets in Florida and California are hitting massive defaults .
Keep in mind we are only in stage one of this housing bear market .
Looking at the past as a reference , we know that there will be pain in the next few years .
Even if Bush and others are pushing for income relief on debt forgiveness , this means society will carry the burden .
After all , if someone bought a $ 500,000 home and it was foreclosed and sold for $ 450,000 – should n’t the lender and buyer shoulder some responsibility ?
We will be heading down this moral hazard road for months .
Even looking at current default rates in Southern California , many people in default have loans that are 2 years or younger .
Now either the lender did a horrible job looking at the buyer ’s financial situation in which they should be liable , or a buyer speculated either knowingly or unknowingly .
I have empathy for a family that was conned from an FHA fixed mortgage into a $ 200,000 subprime mortgage at 10 percent with prepayment penalties .
No reason for this except higher commissions .
But a person buying a $ 500,000 home trying to flip it for $ 600,000 ?
See why I have an issue raising the caps ?
Most people think the money will evaporate like some sort of Vegas magic act .
Yet the public as a whole , even those who did n’t participate in this speculating frenzy , will be on the hook if no one directly involved is willing to shoulder the responsibility of gambling [ speculating ] in a housing bubble .
How about the lender , home owner , and the Wall Street players shoulder some of the debt forgiveness instead of asking for a government handout ?
Why is n’t anyone going after the MBS market or the hedge funds ?
After all , some one did buy these exotic mortgages .
So what are some other viable solutions ?
Lenders can modify terms on 30 year mortgages and extend the duration or drop rates ; yet this would suppose that buyers actually bought homes to live in for the longterm .
Speculate together , pay together .
If you can cut through the green tangled vines of bail out rhetoric , the bottom line is someone is n’t happy because the music stopped and they are left standing with no chair .
Back to the Florida boom and bust , it would be wrong to think that the real estate fever in the 1920s was only specific to Florida .
Other cities had similar booms as well :
“ The final phase of the real - estate boom of the nineteen - twenties centered in the cities themselves .
To picture what happened to the American skyline during those years , compare a 1920 airplane view of almost any large city with one taken in 1930 .
There is scarcely a city which does not show a bright new cluster of skyscrapers at its center .
The tower building mania reached its climax in New York - since towers in the metropolis are a potent advertisement - and particularly in the Grand Central district of New York .
Here the building boom attained immense proportions , coming to its peak of intensity in 1928 .
New pinnacles shot into the air forty stories , fifty stories , and more ; between 1918 and 1930 the amount of space available for office use in large modern buildings in that district was multiplied approximately by ten .
In a photograph of uptown New York taken from the neighborhood of the East River early in 1931 , the twenty most conspicuous structures were all products of the Post - war Decade .
The tallest two of all , to be sure , were not completed until after the panic of 1929 ; by the time the splendid shining tower of the Empire State Building stood clear of scaffolding there were apple salesmen shivering on the curbstone below .
Yet it was none the less a monument to the abounding confidence of the days in which it was conceived .
The confidence had been excessive .
Skyscrapers had been overproduced .
In the spring of 1931 it was reliably stated that some 17 per cent of the space in the big office buildings of the Grand Central district , and some 40 per cent of that in the big office buildings of the Plaza district farther uptown , were not bringing in a return ; owners of new skyscrapers were inveigling business concerns into occupying vacant floors by offering them space rent - free for a period or by assuming their leases in other buildings ; and financiers were shaking their heads over the precarious condition of many realty investments in New York .
The metropolis , too , had a future , but speculative enthusiasm had carried it upward a little too fast . ”
Compare this to the current metal cranes that stand up like a Brontosaur head in the middle of many metro cities .
You see them in San Diego , Miami , and Orange County .
Take a plane over Arizona and Nevada and you ’ll see a jigsaw of subdivided land and spectacular urban sprawl .
Are we growing this fast ?
Looking at population statistics it does n’t seem that the building is in proportion to our growing demand for housing ; we may have overbuilt a tad bit .
Considering that many baby - boomers are looking to downsize , many homes should be coming online in the next 5 to 10 years simply because of the natural occurrence in the shift of demographics .
Many will downsize and retire to less urban areas , thus creating more inventory .
A question many are wondering is “ will there be another bubble after this one ? ”
Considering we went from a technology bubble to a housing bubble , I think we ’ve had enough for two decades .
The cost of owning a home in certain areas , as many families are realizing , comes at too high of a cost .
A society can only prosper so long via debt spending .
So what happened after the boom in Florida ?
“ After the Florida hurricane , real - estate speculation lost most of its interest for the ordinary man and woman .
Few of them were much concerned , except as householders or as spectators , with the building of suburban developments or of forty - story experiments in modernist architecture .
Yet the national speculative fever which had turned their eyes and their cash to the Florida Gold Coast in 1925 was not chilled ; it was merely checked .
Florida house - lots were a bad bet ?
Very well , then , said a public still enthralled by the radiant possibilities of Coolidge Prosperity : what else was there to bet on ?
Before long a new wave of popular speculation was accumulating momentum .
Not in real - estate this time ; in something quite different .
The focus of speculative infection shifted from Flagler Street , Miami , to Broad and Wall Streets , New York .
The Big Bull Market was getting under way . ”
Maybe we will finally see the decade long obsession with real estate go away .
However after the boom in the 1920s , people decided to go back and gamble on US Steel , General Electric , General Motors , Woolworth , and Radio .
Keep in mind that the economy did n’t shift gears over night .
From the peak in September of 1929 it took approximately 3 years to hit bottom in 1932 .
Will we have another Great Depression ?
Probably not since there are many other factors in our current economy that are vastly different .
However , a recession and a deep one at that , is almost a foregone conclusion .
I highly recommend that you read Only Yesterday by Frederick Lewis Allen because it ’ll give you a fascinating and enlightening view of the 1920s and how an important defining time for America still impacts us today .
We will always have booms and busts , otherwise known by a nicer name , the business cycle .

Biden son headed to Iraq
The oldest son of Vice President - elect Joe Biden is scheduled to deploy to Iraq by Thanksgiving , according to sources familiar with the plans .
That will put a new spotlight on the new White House and the war zone .

Capt .
Beau Biden , who is Delaware 's first - term attorney general , is scheduled to leave Fort Bliss , Texas , for Iraq in the next two weeks , along with just over 100 other members of the 261st Tactical Theater Signal Brigade of the Delaware Army National Guard .
The elder Biden saluted the crowd after speaking briefly to the unit in early October before it headed from Dover to Fort Bliss to train for Iraq .
" I 've come here many times before as a Delawarean , as a United States senator , " he said , according to CNN .
" But today I come , as you prepare to deploy , as a father — a father who had some sage advice from his son this morning : ' Dad , keep it short , we 're in formation . ' ...
My heart is full of love and pride .
...
You are the best demonstration of both our nation 's greatness and ... our people 's goodness .
...
Let me simply say , thank you , thank you for answering the call of your country .
...
So stay strong , stand together , serve honorably ... may God bless you and may he protect you . "
Beau Biden , 39 , is often mentioned as a possible replacement for his dad in the Senate .

REDEFINING HUMOR
The submarine is believed to be called the Nerpa
At least 20 people have died in an accident on a Russian nuclear submarine when a fire extinguishing system was activated by mistake .
Russian Pacific
Fleet spokesman Igor Dygalo said both sailors and shipyard workers died in the accident , which occurred during sea trials .
The dead were suffocated by freon gas , which is used to put out fires as it removes oxygen from the air .
The vessel was not damaged and there was no radiation leak , Mr Dygalo said .
It is the worst incident for the navy since the sinking of the Kursk submarine in 2000 , which left 118 dead .
Injured evacuated Military prosecutors are investigating the incident , but the name and class of the submarine involved have not been officially revealed .
There were 208 people on board at the time , 81 of whom were servicemen .
The dead are reported to be six sailors and 14 civilians .
Twenty - one injured people , reported to be suffering from various degrees of poisoning , were transferred from the submarine to the destroyer Admiral Tributs and taken to hospitals near Vladivostok .
1 . Personnel working in front section of submarine affected when fire extinguishers set off unexpectedly
2 . Affected area may have been sealed off , trapping personnel inside .
There were more staff than usual on board as submarine was undergoing tests
3 . Fire extinguishers release freon gas , which displaces breathable oxygen , causing workers to suffocate
4 . Twenty people die and 21 are injured Personnel working in front section of submarine affected when fire extinguishers set off unexpectedly Affected area may have been sealed off , trapping personnel inside .
There were more staff than usual on board as submarine was undergoing tests
Fire extinguishers release freon gas , which displaces breathable oxygen , causing workers to suffocateTwenty people die and 21 are injured
The dead were transferred to morgues nearby after the vessel , which had been undergoing sea trials in the Sea of Japan , returned to port at Bolshoi Kamen , near Vladivostok , in the far eastern Primorsky territory .
Capt Dygalo said the incident happened after the fire extinguishing system " went off unsanctioned " .
But questions are being asked about why there were so many casualties .
Vera Sanzhonova , the wife of one of those on board , said she had not had word about her husband since the accident .
" My husband is not in the list of injured , and not in the list of dead .
Many have already called their wives and said that they are okay , but he has n't called me .
I know that some people have not been identified yet , " she said .
The BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says that in normal cases of a fire on board a submarine , the area would be evacuated and sealed off before pumping in freon gas .
RUSSIAN SUBMARINE DISASTERS
6 Sept 2006 : Two die after fire in Viktor - III class Daniil Moskovsky 28 Aug 2003 : Nine die after decommissioned November class K - 159 sinks 12 Aug 2000 : 118 die in sinking of Oscar - II class Kursk 7 Apr 1989 : 42 die after fire in Soviet - era Komsomolets
The gas removes oxygen from the air - to put out the fire - but if anyone is still trapped inside that area , they face suffocation .
Vladimir Markin , an official from Russia 's top investigative agency , later said forensic tests had confirmed that freon was the cause of death .
Reports say the incident occurred in the nose of the submarine .
The nuclear reactor , which is in the stern , was not affected .
" I declare with full responsibility that the reactor compartment on the nuclear - powered submarine is working normally and the radiation background is normal , " Capt Dygalo said , quoted by Itar - Tass news agency .
Indian link A shipyard source told the RIA Novosti news agency the vessel was the K - 152 Nerpa , an Akula - class submarine , but this has not been confirmed .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Nerpa is due to be leased to the Indian navy , and Indian naval personnel were due to travel to Vladivostok earlier this month to train on board the submarine ahead of its transfer , according to the website Indian Defence .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is being kept fully informed about the incident , his press service said .
Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Kolmakov and Navy Commander - in - Chief Vladimir Vysotsky are flying to the scene of the incident .
Russia 's worst submarine disaster happened in August 2000 , when the nuclear - powered Kursk sank in the Barents Sea .
All 118 people on board died .
The then president , Vladimir Putin , was criticised for being slow to react to the incident and reluctant to call in foreign assistance .

For the record single engine planes are not the safest .
However , Connell was very familiar with both the plane and the airport .
On the ground at the time of the crash it was clear cloudy skies , 33deg , 13 mph winds from the WNW , and it might have just begun to mist .

Be kind and careful what you say .
The man was my uncle and a great man in many ways .
He in no way participated in any thing involving fraud .
He was a strict man of faith who travelled on his own will a couple times a year to help impoverished with his entire family .
The man was a man of love and diligence and passion for his work .
The world will miss Michael Connell .
My heart hurts for my aunt , his wife and kids who are left behind .
May God bless them and him in the afterlife .
I was there to witness him bring New Media from his basement in Cleveland first hand to where he had landed up until recent months .
He did nothing but bring good to the world of political presence on the web and in the world .
He always followed a strict code of ethics governed by his faith with the God and Catholicism .
His Nephew and idealizer

You are pathetic .
Edward no one doubts Connell 's sincerity and passion .
Though some might argue that some of his enterprises follow a more Rovian type of ethics , like the Swiftboat websites .
And even the destruction of all the White House emails which your uncle was intimately involved with .
( google Almacy and GovTech ) I do n't think anyone has ever claimed he was n't a good person or a good Christian , just that he might have done things he thought served a greater good .
It is a tragedy what happened and hopefully some audio from the ATC will give more insight into what happened .
What kind of mechanical problems caused this accident because it was n't weather or pilot error .
I hope everyone will pray for his wife and children .

In all probability he most likely did , with all the loose fittings on the fuel lines .
Could explain
the fire as the fuel leaked into the fuselage .
I think " whacked " is the term they used in the olden days .
I figure that the investigation will probably show that some other ( newly ) dead guy did it ... Like Bruce Ivins

How convenient , that whenever a story like this breaks , someone like Edward comes along " long time reader ; first time commentor " , to distract .
I 'm sure Connell 's nephew reads Brad Blog all the time .
Funny he never commented before .
The overall picture is this : when you look at each individual Rove - connected incident , you can explain away any one of them .
Oh , the plane happened to crash !
When you stack together ALL the Rove - related incidents , then it 's impossible they 're all accidents .
PERIOD !!!!

Thanks ,
Em. I was almost dead of fatigue when I started to try to track that down last night , and I dropped before I could get to it .
Because ... well ... it seems to me that he would n't have gotten into a small airplane willingly , let alone fly one , with the threat , the very , very credible threat , hanging over his head , but maybe he was so absorbed in his nerd work and faith that he truly did n't realize the dimensions of that threat ...?
It 's almost a damn slogan nowadays whenever anybody does anything virtuous , or even threatens to , in government : Whoa , better not be gettin ' on any small planes ....

So more digging and Connell 's 1997 Piper Saratoga should have a range of at least 800 miles .
His flight was only 300 miles .
There is no way he ran out of gas .
There could have been mechanical problems or icing .
One things is that based on FlightAware altitudes , he may not have had enough height to be able to glide into the airport .
He was only about 2000 - 3000 ft up and about six miles from airport , so too far to glide in assuming the engine stopped ( of course ice will limit gliding even more ) .

It only goes to show like I said , the FBI / DHS / CIA / NSA / Pentagon are miserable failures .
When people are yanked from Government jobs or starting to be forced out because of corruption , their time is up , or they step down ; instead of immediatly yanking their security clearances , denying access to government buildings , grabbing up their computers and going through it all with a fine tooth comb , they instead allow them into the buildings , back to their computers , full security clearance access , onto their networks , making their votes , doing their crap .
It 's sugar in the gas tank .
It 's a wrench in the gears .
It 's handfuls of FOD thrown into the intake without a cover !
All the laws were passed to snoop on us , and take away our rights , choreograph us into little domestic terrorists , meanwhile when the corruption instead comes from within , or oath breaking , they turn their heads and ignore it .
This will end up being another giant question mark in history .
If Bush admininstration people do the research , how can it really be trusted ?
Even if actually was pilot error , there will never be trust as to the final reason .

Clearly nobody is taking IT security seriously in our government .
They are all too happy to dish out laws for us , but when it comes to their own shit they fail .
When jobs that someone does are bad .
e.g. missing email , webhosting political sites and election results .
( seems like there were other problems too )
Anyway when someone is doing a job that bad , and in a place like that , and is being questioned about it and says he 's being threatened .
Why was n't everything brought to a halt to find out ?
Why was n't he protected or arrested ?
Not doing that is like saying you do n't care about security .
Just the machinery and laws behind it to be used for your own agenda .
For all we know the guy could been wiping / var / log / var / cache / var / mail and / var / spool for someone .

Carol : Immediately after " election " 2004 , Norm Coleman was vociferously calling out election fraud " conspiracy theorists . "
He took point on this , and I immediately knew he was a Neocon election theft front man .
That of course meant that Wellstone was targeted and the Coleman election was obviously stolen .
Christ , if you assume criminality , this stuff then becomes detective work 101 , not conspiracy theory .
Sadly , one has to also assume that someone got to Kucinich , too , who 's about as good as we have right now .
Kucinich 's planned 9/11 hearings were killed last year and have not been rescheduled .
Who killed them ?
Did Kucinich himself do it out of fear ?
Did Pelosi warn him or order him off ?
Of course , corporate media , if you 've read this far , go back into your shells and just assume we 're all batshit crazy .
Do n't let things like the fact that our country is run by confessed war criminals make you think that our leaders have anything but our best interest at heart .
It 's all just mistakes and bad intel .
Certainly none of the rapacious , malevolent behavior of the Bush crew was deliberate .
Mistakes happen .
Planes crash .
Steel skyscrapers mysteriously implode every day .
Millions of people in foreign countries are accidentally wiped out when we invade .
No one could have foreseen any of it ( except for the people who planned it . )
Hey , do n't you have a missing girl or a celebrity tantrum to report on ?
Sure you do .

Jayzus ..
I 'm trying not to jump to conclusions - after all , there 's still an FAA investigation , so we do n't know what happened .
But if you 've ever been up in a small plane before with an experienced pilot , you know how thorough their pre-flight check is .
The best we can hope for is that people with integrity and NO TIES TO THE GOP OR ROVE impounded the parts of the plane , will keep it beyond the reach of anyone who stands to gain from his death , and wo n't let go of this until we find out the truth .
( And do n't tell me he ran out of gas , I 'm not buying it ) BTW , Edward , if you 're for real ( and I know you understand our skepticism if you 've been reading here ) , my heart goes out to you and your family for your loss .
If you cared as much about your uncle as you say you do , you should take the lead in pushing for a thorough investigation .
This is n't the first time someone close to exposing those connected with election fraud issues has suddenly died , after it came out that they were gathering evidence or were about to testify .
However noble you may have thought your uncle to be , he was associating with some very shady people - and had apparently already been threatened by those people .
Make no mistake , there are those who would consider him expendable if they thought his death provided a way to cover their tracks .

He might have run out of gas if his plane had been tampered with , a miniature explosive attached somewhere strategically in its engine , and since he was returning home from somewhere else , he easily might n't have checked at all .

do n't trust initial description of the plane type becuase there are often wrong .
many planes are registered under company names and regiatered in other states for tax purposes too

here is a list of 391 piper registered in Ohio but again do n't trust the plane type ( especially model ) from initial reports and state will probably be Delaware becuase of corporate shelter laws regardless of where plane is based .

Stark county coronor quoted has saying briefcased on board .
( someone better get a court order to freeze that stuff fast )
and receipts from breakfast in Washington from Friday in his wallet .
Also witnesses heard him flying in fast and he attempted to land .
does n't sound like ice on wings which makes you drop like a stone without much control since wings lose lift .

"
“ The plane was just torn apart , ” said Harry Campbell , chief investigator with the Stark County coroner ’s office .
He estimated debris from the aircraft was scattered over about 100 yards .
The aircraft apparently had flown out of Pennsylvania , said Campbell .
Stark County Coroner P.S. Murthy was on the scene and is scheduled to perform an autopsy on Connell today .
Campbell found receipts in Connell ’s wallet showing he had breakfast Friday in Washington , D.C. Connell was dressed in a business suit , he said .
Two suitcases and other personal items had been on the plane , Campbell said .
Neighbors heard the crash and called 911 .
Nancy Beisler , who lives across the street , said she was inside when she heard the plane “ buzzing ” over her home .
“ I thought something exploded and ( my husband ) thought something happened to me , ” she said .
“ I said , ‘ I ’m OK ’ and he said , ‘ Call 911 , it ’s something across the street , ’ ” Beisler said .
“ ...
And unfortunately it was all flames . ”
“ You could tell it was very close and it kept getting closer and closer , ” neighbor Christina Pastore - Bucher said .
“ It buzzed right over the house , and you heard a crash — it was an impact . ”
“ It had instantly burst into flames . ”
Noting that fuel may have spilled , Pastore - Bucher said , “ the fire was kind of going to both sides . ”
Pastore - Bucher is used to hearing planes fly over , but “ this one , you knew it was so fast , it was so low . ” "

Thanks for all the data George .
Re comment # 48 and all the flames from spilled fuel ... if he ran out of gas ... those flames would n't be there , right ?
This is just a layman 's comment because I know squat about airplane impacts ( other than jetliners do n't disintegrate upon impact in PA or DC , AND that jet fuel does n't burn hot enough to melt steel , that much I know ! ) so is that a reasonable point to make , to rule out the ' ran out of fuel ' argument ?

I bet they find airplane parts at the crash site .
I bet they are able to verify those parts as the plane that crashed .
To this day .... not one single piece of airliner debris has EVER been verified in any way from any of the 4 planes from any of the 4 locations from 911 .
Not one piece !
There are 3.1 million pieces that can identify a standard 757 .
Thats almost 13 million pieces and not ONE SINGLE PIECE has ever been verified outside of the Bush regime .
NONE .
ps....videos , photos , and witnesses have never counted as evidence of a plane crash .
Only verifiable wreckage counts .
The WMD 's in Iraq had videos , photos , and witnesses until the world wanted to verify a single piece of WMD .
Then the lie fell apart .
If these criminals are willing to kill millions based on staged and conspired lie .... some of their own " clan " means nothing to them .

MOAS 7 - may - 2008
One week after the crash outside Caracas , Venezuela of a twin-engine Piper Navajo ( N6463L ) , an air of intrigue surrounds almost everything about the flight , including the plane 's ownership , passengers , and pilot .
Woven into one small story about a plane crash in Venezuela that killed seven people are visible threads from two perennial American cover-ups : one surrounding vote fraud , and one covering - up the CIA 's role in drug trafficking .
For anyone interested in the news that gets left out of the newspaper , its ' a Perfect Storm .
The Mother of All Scandals .
The downed plane 's relevance to the ongoing story of vote fraud in America involves the identity of it's passenger , Jose Alfredo Anzola , a 34 - year old founder of Smartmatic , a Venezuela - based election company whose American subsidiary counted one in every three votes in the 2004 Presidential election , while engaged the whole time in heated controversy over allegations the firm counting America 's votes had hidden ties to —of all people — Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez .
The connection between last week 's plane crash and the ongoing saga of CIA Drug trafficking begins 43 - year old Mario Donadi Gafaro , the veteran drug pilot at the controls of the twin engine plane .

" During this process a number of irregularities were discovered .
At four different points in the night vote tallies for Al Franken decreased significantly even as tallies for Norm Coleman continued to increase from the previous timed tally .
These four points are indicated on the graph below by the arrows .
Decreases in Al Franken 's tally of 7903 votes occurred at 2:04 am , 105 votes at 3:42 am , 9529 votes at 3:58 am , and 3313 votes at 5:20 am .
A total of 20,850 votes appear to have been subtracted from Al Franken 's total throughout the evening .
At only one point that we could determine was there a decrease in Norm Coleman 's vote tally .
This occurred at 2:09 am where 4252 votes were subtracted . " we r seeing this evidence more and more , bbv has found similiar losing votes and impossible numbers recently in california , louisiana and other places the time slices basically show , it doesnt matter what the machine records as numbers can be adjusted at any point to get the predetermined result i can only hope that enough of us realize what is going on that somehow democracy will survive different times when i have been frustrated with being so powerless , posting impossible numbers and peops not commenting ..... 99 explained , we have seen so many " impossible " numbers we cant pay attention any more well they can " unfuel " planes in mid flight , suicide witnesses but THEY can not hide the numbers being manipulated .. good post carol

Re different speeds to and from destination - probably fighting a head wind in one direction .
Re why they lost track at 3000 ft - some radar stations probably lose aircraft when they get below a certain height .
just guesses Someone said pitot tube detects ice on wing .
Not true .
Pitot tube detects airspeed by testing the air pressure in the forward direction with the air pressure from the side .
Either hole can be easily clogged ( beleive it or not bee ( like yellow jackets ) heads fit snuggly in there and often clog them ) and it is one of the most important things to check on preflight and any good pilot does it .
one could get clogged by ice though .
would have to check weather conditions at the time to see if descending through icing conditions was an issue .
could also check with other planes pilots arriving and departing at the same time .

A fight between rival gangs in a Guatemalan prison has left seven prisoners dead , five of them beheaded , officials said .
Inmates at the Pavoncito prison , south of Guatemala City , displayed the heads of some of the dead prisoners , reporters who witnessed the scene said .
The violence broke out after a group of gang members was transferred to Pavoncito from another prison .
Violence is common in Guatemala 's overcrowded prisons .
The riot lasted about five hours before prison guards and police regained control of the prison .
The other two prisoners died in a hospital of gunshot wounds , said Guatemalan prisons system spokesman Rudy Esquivel .
" This is a dispute between prisoners belonging to different gangs , who bring their conflicts with them when they are locked up , " he said .
Inmates in Guatemalan prisons often have easy access to weapons and members from rival gangs are able to carry on their disputes behind bars .
Stop Bush from Shunting the All But Certain Post - Withdrawal Collapse onto the Next President ...
Jon Ponder Byon
10/2/2008 , 9:19 am PT
Guest Editorial by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
The bailout of Wall Street is the rancid pickle on an economic crap sandwich that is a result of 30 years of conservative deregulation / trickle - down ideology .
The fact that the Bush appointees who devised the original bailout plan are from the same gene pool as the neo-cons , cronies and heckuva - jobbers who turned America into a torture state , spied on Americans , drowned New Orleans , stole two national elections , corrupted the Department of Justice and took the country to war on the false pretext of bringing democracy to Iraq but then screwed up their true intent --- to steal its oil --- should have been reason enough to kill the plan on sight .
But that 's not going to happen .
As inept and ineffectual as they are at everything else , the Bush team is highly practiced at forcing Congress to act in haste .
Six years ago this month , Karl Rove and the White House political shop " created a reality , " as one of them has described it , that there was an urgent need to push the Iraq war resolution through Congress just days before the midterm elections .
Now we know that the only urgency was Rove 's need to get Senate Democrats who were potential Bush rivals in the 2004 presidential election on the record about the war before the election .
Iraq post - invasion has been a disaster , but the vote on the resolution was stunningly successful in hobbling the campaigns of both John Kerry and Hillary Clinton .
Now , in what is either a horrendous coincidence or the most elaborate ( and apparently botched ) October Surprise in presidential campaign history , as Bush prepares to slouch off to Crawford for good , he is pushing one last crisis down our throats .
As with his invasion of Iraq , it will probably be years before we know if this latest crisis is " real , " or if it was fumbled attempt by the White House to change the game in John McCain 's favor .
It certainly feels like we 're being played again ...
The White House , with the able assistance of the corporate media , has created a very plausible semblance of a crisis .
What 's troubling is the fact that in a crisis , ironically , there is no time for critical thinking , and the Bush team has a pattern of creating crises that are useful to them .
If there were time for investigation and analysis , it 's possible , though by no means certain , that a rational solution tailored to specific challenges could be developed --- or at least there might be time to ask questions and consider alternatives .
Here , for example , is a question George Bush has not been asked :
If the economic crisis we 're facing is the potentially devastating debacle he says it is , how can we continue to afford the extravagance of the $ 3.3 billion a week it costs to occupy Iraq ?
In his pursuit of Bush 's third term , John McCain has been lecturing us for months about how well things are going in Iraq .
The metrics certainly seem to indicate that U.S. and Iraqi forces have brought down the level of violence , either through the Surge or by use of a new top - secret weapon .
Just yesterday there was a report from Baghdad that U.S. commanders were transferring control of the 100,000 - strong Sons of Iraq militia to the Iraqi military .
At a cost of $ 10 billion a month , withdrawing now --- by New Year 's 2009 , for example --- would prevent us from having to borrow another $ 120 billion from the Chinese and other governments next year .
It is likely that Iraq will collapse after we leave .
If this is true now , after five years , then it 's likely to be true no matter how long we stay .
Given that fact , it makes no sense to continue needlessly spending money on the occupation .
Withdraw on Bush's Watch
There 's another , more karmic reason to withdraw immediately .
Two years ago , Bush slipped up and accidentally told the truth about his " exit plan " for Iraq .
" We 're not leaving , " he said at a news conference in August 2006 , " so long as I'm the President . "
Shunting the all but certain collapse of Iraq after we leave onto the next president would fit George Bush 's lifelong pattern of screwing things up and leaving his messes for others to fix .
In the run-up to the war , in a rare display of principle , then Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Bush about the risk of screwing up Iraq by saying , " If you break it , you buy it . "
Of course , Bush did screw up , but he did not buy it .
The American taxpayers are picking up the trillion dollars tab .
And , much more profoundly , it 's the hundreds of thousands of dead U.S. soldiers and Iraqi men , women and children who have truly paid the price for Bush 's folly .
Eight months ago , NBC's Ann Curry asked George Bush if he thought there was a connection between the drag on the economy and the $ 3 billion per month the United States is borrowing to pay for his occupation of Iraq .
His answer will not surprise you ( see the video above right ) :
CURRY : Some Americans believe that they feel they ’re carrying the burden because of this economy .
BUSH : Yeah , well …
CURRY : They say we ’re suffering because of this .
BUSH : … I do n’t agree with that .
CURRY : You do n’t agree with that ?
It has nothing do with the economy , the war — spending on the war ?
BUSH : I do n’t think so .
I think actually the spending in the war might help with jobs .
CURRY : Oh , yeah ?
BUSH : Yeah , because we ’re buying equipment , and people are working .
I think this economy is down because we built too many houses and the economy ’s adjusting .
( Shorter Bush :
The cash I 'm giving my fatcat war - profiteer buddies trickles down on the little people .
That 's why we call 'em " peons . " )
As the time ticks away toward January , it is obvious that not only are George Bush and Dick Cheney not going to be impeached , they are not going to be held accountable for the damage they have done to our democracy , the military , the economy or our standing in the world .
As has been noted before , they will only receive the same mild rebuke given to Cheney 's old boss , Richard Nixon :
They will grow old in disgrace .
Unfortunately , unlike Nixon , neither Bush nor Cheney will be at all bothered by the fact that they are embarrassments to themselves and the nation .
At the moment , it appears that McCain and Sarah Palin are flaming out .
Barack Obama has said he will withdraw troops soon after he takes office .
So why wait ?
Why not force George Bush to some responsibility for two of his messes --- Iraq and the economy --- on his watch ?
Uma Thurman Speaks Before NYC Supreme Court ( PHOTOS )
and a host of other celebrities appeared before the judicial bench at Manhattan 's New York Supreme Court today .
As former jurors , they were invited to take part in Jury Appreciation Day .
The event is used to educate the public that if celebrities can do it so can the rest of us .
Signage in the courtroom proclaimed : Jury Duty , Serve With Pride .
Besides Uma , other former jurors on hand were Neil Sedaka , Katie Couric , Nathan Lane , Ed Burns , Kathleen Turner and Vera Wang .
They were there to ' testify ' that jury duty is a privilege , an honor , is educational and interesting .
Lane shared this with the crowd , " The Revolutionary War was fought so you could serve jury duty .
This I did n't know . "
Katie Couric recalled that her favorite line about jury duty came from sex expert Dr. Ruth Westheimer : " It 's a great way to pick up guys . "
Accompanying Thurman was her mega rich fiance ' Arpad Busson .
The London based French financier has two sons from a previous relationship with supermodel Elle McPherson .

Here are some useful links .

The most usable database , though , is managed by IBM .

Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation has called for a boycott .
As for Amazon : Jeff Bezos declined to comment on patent issues for this article , citing the pending litigation ; but now he has released an " open letter " on the subject .
The original State Street Bank decision , by Judge Patti B. Saris , was brilliantly reasoned and offered a path of sanity .
It should not have been reversed .
Finding absurd patents is shooting fish in a barrel .
Many
Web sites are devoted to these ; you could start with this one , called , oddly enough , Patently Absurd .
 J. G. W hen twenty - first - century historians look back at the breakdown of the United States patent system , they will see a turning point in the case of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com and their special invention : " the patented 1 - click feature , " Bezos calls it .
Not everyone who knows Bezos as the new - minted billionaire founder of the world 's leading Internet retailer knows that he's also an inventor , but he is .
It says so on U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411 , " Method and System for Placing a Purchase Order via a Communications Network . "
Every good invention needs a story , and Jeff Bezos has one for one - click ordering .
He 's laying it out in federal court , where already , at the height of the holiday shopping season , he won an injunction forcing his chief competitor , Barnesandnoble.com , to add deliberate complication to its ordering process .
In ways that could not have been predicted even a few years ago , the patent system is in crisis .
A series of unplanned mutations have transformed patents into a positive threat to the digital economy .
The patent office has grown entangled in philosophical confusion of its own making ; it has become a ferocious generator of litigation ; and many technologists believe that it has begun to choke the very innovation it was meant to nourish .
The one - click story starts like this : A young man founds a company called Amazon.com in the obligatory garage , with a bit of money raised from his family .
Soon his tiny crew begins selling books on line .
Their customers use a " shopping cart . "
Of course , there is n't a real shopping cart , because the customers are n't really at these stores , and there are n't really stores at all .
There is just a tiny picture of a shopping cart , and if you click on it with the mouse , the screen displays a list of items you have selected for purchase .
Illustration " Procedure for Simultaneously Walking and Chewing

But . . .
Amazon applies to the government for a trademark on the name " 1 - Click " and a patent on the . . . well , on what , exactly ?
Not the idea , because pure abstractions may not be patented .
Not the program code , because copyright law protects this .
But Amazon received its patent in September and instantly sued Barnes and Noble over its similar " Express Lane . "
Amazon won an injunction in December forcing its competitor to insert a superfluous mouse click .
( " Please be sure to click this button , " Barnes and Noble begs plaintively .
" If you do n't , we wo n't get your order ! " )
The one - click injunction capped a burst of skirmishing in 1999  the start of what promises to become furious , wide - ranging courtroom warfare  over who will control electronic commerce .
As the year 2000 begins , few of America 's e-commerce leaders are not targets of patent litigation .
The battles to come will determine whether the essential tools and building blocks will continue to spread rapidly through the community of software designers and Internet pioneers , or whether they will be cordoned off as the private property of particular companies .
Amazon just got a new patent for a system of letting Web sites refer customers in exchange for commissions  its " affiliate " program .
Sure enough , Barnes and Noble has a nearly identical affiliate program .
So do thousands of other online merchants , now feverishly calling their lawyers yet again .
Can Amazon really own this ?
For better or worse , the struggle will redefine our understanding of what an invention is , in our complex , technocratic age .
P atents long served as a fundamental cog in the American machine , cherished in our national soul .
We are the land of Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and Alexander Graham Bell , where Congress is empowered by the Constitution t o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries .
Hence the patent office , charged with the enforcement of a Faustian bargain : inventors give up their secrets , publishing them for all to see and absorb , and in exchange they get 20 - year government - sanctioned monopolies on their technologies .
This arrangement fueled industrial progress in the early United States by encouraging investment in research and rewarding inventors who published their work rather than cloaking it in trade secrets .
Now , however , during the short span of the Internet revolution , the patent system has begun to disintegrate by growing out of control .
The United States is issuing patents at a torrential pace , establishing new records each year , and it is expanding the universe of things that can be patented .
Patents began in a world of machines and chemical processes  a substantial , tangible , nuts - and - bolts world  but now they have spread across a crucial boundary , into the realm of thought and abstraction .
Software and algorithms used to be unpatentable .
Recent court decisions and patent - office rule - making has made software the fastest growing patent category , and companies are rushing to patent the most basic methods of doing business .
" This is a disaster , " says Lawrence Lessig , a Harvard law professor and cyberspace expert .
" This is a major change that occurred without anybody thinking through the consequences .
In my view , it is the single greatest threat to innovation in cyberspace , and I 'm extremely skeptical that anybody 's going to get it in time . "
The litigation is spreading fast .
Multi-Tech Systems has just sued the three leading PC makers , Compaq , Dell and Gateway , over patents on transmitting data over a communications line .
A St. Louis patent broker is suing Yahoo over a " method of effecting commerce in a networked computer environment in a computerized system "  that is , shopping on line .
Another Internet startup , Priceline.com , has patented its Internet version of an ancient auction technique , the name - your - price " reverse " auction , and is suing Microsoft 's Expedia.com travel service .
Microsoft , meanwhile , has infuriated much of the Internet community by patenting a well - known " style sheet " technology just as it was being adopted as standard by the World Wide Web consortium .

The Patent That Never Was
Inventors rank high in our pantheon of heroes .
If someone has a great idea that makes life a little better for millions of people , surely fortune and fame are fair compensation .
Yet , when it comes to rewarding and protecting the greatest achievements , the history of twentieth - century invention suggests that the patent system has at best a mixed record .
[ To article . ] sidebar ] .
This is just the beginning .
Patents marking off broad swaths of electronic commerce will soon be pouring from the patent office , unwelcome surprises to whole categories of new entrepreneurs .
In the last few months , companies have gotten patents for keeping calendars on the World Wide Web , for downloading Web pages at regular intervals , for storing documents in databases , for " real - time shopping , " for auctioning cars , for creating profiles of users ; for search engines , for payment systems , and for variations of every other fundamental gear and lever in the theoretical machinery of on - line business .
Just as insidiously , biotech companies are getting thousands of patents granting them rights to exploit particular pieces of the human genome  the DNA common to all of us .
For that matter , the most trivial slices of off - line life are winning patent protection : for example , measuring breasts with a tape to determine bra size ; and executing a tennis stroke while wearing a knee pad ( U.S. 5,993,336 : " The tennis racket is swung toward a tennis ball so as to hit the tennis ball with the racket . . . " )
Many of these patents are harmless .
Most are narrower , when read carefully , than they sound at first .
Others are multimillion - dollar lawsuits in embryo .
Every week , hundreds of new data - processing patents are issued , and if you are an entrepreneur with an e-commerce business plan , you will soon be cross-checking it against these patents .
Wo n't you be using a " metering mechanism for distribution of electronic information " ?
( Intel owns it . )
" Tracking the purchase of a product and services over the Internet " ?
( InfoSpace.com . )
A " method and system for constructing queries " ?
( Microsoft . )
" Expanding web documents by merging with linked documents " ?
( IBM . )
Each of these patents is a tiny masterpiece of logic and disputation .
Each represents , by definition , a restraint on trade , a layer of regulation , expensive overhead in the free - market economy .
The exclusive rights conveyed by a patent automatically translate into higher prices for consumers somewhere along the chain .
The Supreme Court saw the downside more than a hundred years ago .
" It creates a class of speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement , and gather its foam in the form of patented monopolies , which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country , " the Court wrote .
" It embarrasses the honest pursuit of business . "
Patent lawyers and officials argue that each patent represents a good idea and that good ideas deserve to be rewarded ; but does every good idea deserve a twenty - year government - sponsored monopoly ?
" We like to say right to exploit , " the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks , Q. Todd Dickinson , says cheerfully .

Quantum weirdness even stranger than previously thought .
Two photons can be connected in a way that seems to defy the very nature of space and time , yet still obeys the laws of quantum mechanics .
Can information travel faster than light ?
PUNCHSTOCK
Physicists at the University of Geneva achieved the weird result by creating a pair of ‘ entangled ’ photons , separating them , then sending them down a fibre optic cable to the Swiss villages of Satigny and Jussy , some 18 kilometres apart .
The researchers found that when each photon reached its destination , it could instantly sense its twin ’s behaviour without any direct communication .
The finding does not violate the laws of quantum mechanics , the theory that physicists use to describe the behaviour of very small systems .
Rather , it shows just how quantum mechanics can defy everyday expectation , says Nicolas Gisin , the researcher who led the study .
“ Our experiment just puts the finger where it hurts , ” he says .
The study is published in Nature1 .
Spooky and unsettling
In the everyday world , objects can organize themselves in just a few ways .
For example , two people can coordinate their actions by talking directly with each other , or they can both receive instructions from a third source .
“ We think space and time are important because that 's the kind of monkeys we are . ”
Terence Rudolph
Imperial College London
In both these cases , the information is communicated at or below the speed of light , in keeping with Einstein ’s axiom that nothing in the Universe can go faster .
But quantum mechanics allows for a third way to coordinate information .
When two particles are quantum mechanically ‘ entangled ’ with each other , measuring the properties of one will instantly tell you something about the other .
In other words , quantum theory allows two particles to organize themselves at apparently faster - than - light speeds .
Einstein called such behaviour “ spooky action at a distance ” , because he found it deeply unsettling .
He and other physicists clung to the idea that there might be some other way for the particles to communicate with each other at or near the speed of light .
But the new experiment shows that direct communication between the photons ( at least as we know it ) is simply impossible .
The team simultaneously measured several properties of both photons , such as phase , when they arrived at their villages and found that they did indeed have a spooky awareness of each other ’s behaviour .
On the basis of their measurements , the team concluded that if the photons had communicated , they must have done so at least 100,000 times faster than the speed of light — something nearly all physicists thought would be impossible .
In other words , these photons cannot know about each other through any sort of normal exchange of information .
Framed
The team also ruled out other possible reasons for the apparently coordinated behaviour .
For example , one could imagine that the photons might have shared information before they left Geneva — but Gisin ’s measurements showed that they could not .
A second test ensured that the scientists in the two villages were n’t missing some form of communication thanks to Earth ’s motion through space .
According to Einstein ’s theory of relativity , observers moving at high speeds can have different ‘ reference frames ’ , so that they can potentially get different measurements of the same event .
The Geneva results could possibly be explained if the two photons were communicating through a frame of reference that was n’t readily apparent to the scientists . "
The entangled photons were sent to the villages of Satigny and Jussy , some 18 kilometres apart .
M- Sat Ltd/SPL
But theoretical calculations2 have shown that performing tests over a full spin of the globe would test all possible reference frames .
The team did just that , and they got the same result in all cases .
The bottom line , says Gisin is that “ there is just no time for these two photons to communicate ” .
The experiment shows that in quantum mechanics at least , some things transcend space - time , says Terence Rudolph , a theorist at Imperial College London .
It also shows that humans have attached undue importance to the three dimensions of space and one of time we live in , he argues .
“ We think space and time are important because that ’s the kind of monkeys we are . ”
If you are baffled by the result , fear not — you ’re not alone .
“ For me , honestly , it does n’t make any sense , ” says Gisin .
“ I do n’t think we can today claim that we have a good story to tell how this all happens . ”
He hopes that the work will stimulate theorists to come up with new ways of explaining the spooky effect .
Scientists say they have found a workable way of reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by adding lime to seawater .
And they think it has the potential to dramatically reverse CO 2 accumulation in the atmosphere , reports Cath O'Driscoll in SCI 's Chemistry & Industry magazine .
Shell is so impressed with the new approach that it is funding an investigation into its economic feasibility .
' We think it 's a promising idea , ' says Shell 's Gilles Bertherin , a coordinator on the project .
' There are potentially huge environmental benefits from addressing climate change -- and adding calcium hydroxide to seawater will also mitigate the effects of ocean acidification , so it should have a positive impact on the marine environment . '
Adding lime to seawater increases alkalinity , boosting seawater 's ability to absorb CO 2 from air and reducing the tendency to release it back again .
However , the idea , which has been bandied about for years , was thought unworkable because of the expense of obtaining lime from limestone and the amount of CO 2 released in the process .
Tim Kruger , a management consultant at London firm Corven is the brains behind the plan to resurrect the lime process .
He argues that it could be made workable by locating it in regions that have a combination of low - cost ' stranded ' energy considered too remote to be economically viable to exploit -- like flared natural gas or solar energy in deserts -- and that are rich in limestone , making it feasible for calcination to take place on site .
Kruger says : ' There are many such places -- for example , Australia 's Nullarbor Plain would be a prime location for this process , as it has 10 000 km3 of limestone and soaks up roughly 20 MJ / m2 of solar irradiation every day . '
The process of making lime generates CO 2 , but adding the lime to seawater absorbs almost twice as much CO 2 .
The overall process is therefore ' carbon negative ' .
' This process has the potential to reverse the accumulation of CO 2 in the atmosphere .
It would be possible to reduce CO 2 to pre-industrial levels , ' Kruger says .
And Professor Klaus Lackner , a researcher in the field from Columbia University , says : ' The theoretical CO 2 balance is roughly right ... it is certainly worth thinking through carefully . '
The oceans are already the world 's largest carbon sink , absorbing 2bn tonnes of carbon every year .
Increasing absorption ability by just a few percent could dramatically increase CO 2 uptake from the atmosphere .
This project is being developed in an open source manner .

In More Questions on the Path to Combinatory Python I wondered how to write an ' add ' function such that not only
( add ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) == 4
worked but also things like :
( add ) ( add ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) == 6 ( add ) ( 1 ) ( add ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) == 6
If we throw in a unary function like ' neg ' then things like this should work too :
( neg ) ( 5 ) == - 5 ( neg ) ( neg ) ( 5 ) == 5 ( add ) ( 3 ) ( neg ) ( 2 ) == 1
Here 's how I started to think about it .
An expression such as ( add ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) could be described as having the signature " 200 " .
It consists of subexpressions requiring , respectively 2 , 0 and 0 arguments .
Just ( add ) ( 2 ) would have a signature " 20 " which is equivalent to a signature of 1 .
Using this notion :
( add ) ( add ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) has signature 22000
( add ) ( 1 ) ( add ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) has signature 20200
( neg ) ( 5 ) has signature 10
( neg ) ( neg ) ( 5 ) has signature 110
( add ) ( 3 ) ( neg ) ( 2 ) has signature 2010
It is easy to see that for an expression to be complete ( i.e. not partial ) it must have a signature ending in 0 .
But there is slightly more to it that than .
Basically , start off with a score of 1 and work from left to write , every " 2 " you encounter increases the score by 1 and every " 0 " decreases it by 1 .
A " 1 " has no effect .
When you hit a score of 0 you 're complete .
Every complete signature has a particular bracketing of function application .
For example , expressions of signature 112100 can be evaluated as follows :
def eval 112100 ( a , b , c , d , e , f ) : return a ( b ( c ( d(e ) ) ( f ) ) )
and each partial signature has a function that can dispatch evaluation to another function depending on the number of args the next arg takes ( relying on a function like add being annotated with add.args = 2 ) .
def eval 1121 ( a , b , c , d ) : return lambda e : ( eval11210 if e.args == 0 else eval11211 if e.args == 1 else eval11212 if e.args == 2 else ... ) ( a , b , c , d , e )
I was still struggling to implement this in a recursive way that could handle unlimited depth and then I saw in a comment that Eric Wald came up with a solution :
def combinatoric ( n ) : def decorator ( f ) : @wraps ( f ) def wrapper ( x ) : if callable ( x ) : return lambda y : combinatoric ( n ) ( f ) ( x ( y ) ) elif n > 1 : return combinatoric(n - 1 ) ( wraps ( f ) ( partial ( f , x ) ) ) else : return f( x ) return wrapper return decorator
and so you then say
@combinatoric ( 1 ) def neg( x ) : return -x @combinatoric ( 2 ) def add( x , y ) : return x + y
and it all works .
The use of wraps is optional but including it means partial add will have the name add not wrapper .

Love and hate are intimately linked within the human brain , according to a study that has discovered the biological basis for the two most intense emotions .
Scientists studying the physical nature of hate have found that some of the nervous circuits in the brain responsible for it are the same as those that are used during the feeling of romantic love – although love and hate appear to be polar opposites .
A study using a brain scanner to investigate the neural circuits that become active when people look at a photograph of someone they say they hate has found that the " hate circuit " shares something in common with the love circuit .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The findings could explain why both hate and romantic love can result in similar acts of extreme behaviour – both heroic and evil – said Professor Semir Zeki of University College London , who led the study published in the on - line journal PloS ONE .
" Hate is often considered to be an evil passion that should , in a better world , be tamed , controlled and eradicated .
Yet to the biologist , hate is a passion that is of equal interest to love , " Professor Zeki said .
" Like love , it is often seemingly irrational and can lead individual to heroic and evil deeds .
How can two opposite sentiments lead to the same behaviour ? "
The study advertised for volunteers to take part in the study and 17 people were chosen who professed a deep hatred for one individual .
Most chose an ex-lover or a competitor at work , although one woman expressed an intense hatred for a famous political figure .
Professor Zeki and John Romaya of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology analysed the activity of the neural circuits in the brain that lit up when the volunteers were viewing photos of the hated person .
They found that the hate circuit includes parts of the brain called the putamen and the insula , found in the sub -cortex of the organ .
The putamen is already known to be involved in the perception of contempt and disgust and may also be part of the motor system involved in movement and action .
" Significantly , the putamen and the insula are also both activated by romantic love .
This is not surprising .
The putamen could also be involved in the preparation of aggressive acts in a romantic context , as in situations when a rival presents a danger , " Professor Zeki said .
" Previous studies have suggested that the insula may be involved in responses to distressing stimuli , and the viewing of both a loved and a hated face may constitute such a distressing signal . "
One major difference between love and hate appears to be in the fact that large parts of the cerebral cortex – associated with judgement and reasoning – become de-activated during love , whereas only a small area is deactivated in hate .
" This may seem surprising since hate can also be an all - consuming passion like love .
But whereas in romantic love , the lover is often less critical and judgemental regarding the loved person , it is more likely that in the context of hate the hater may want to exercise judgement in calculating moves to harm , injure or otherwise exact revenge , " Professor Zeki said .
" Interestingly , the activity of some of these structures in response to a hated face is proportional in strength to the declared intensity of hate , thus allowing the subjective state of hate to be objectively quantified .
This finding may have implications in criminal cases . "
Ohio voters , wrong only twice when picking the president in the last 108 years , remain nearly split over their choice for the White House , according to a new Ohio Newspaper Poll .
But while the race remains a statistical dead heat , more voters are siding with Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , who has erased Republican Sen .
John McCain 's previous lead in the Buckeye State and now holds a 3 - point advantage , 49 percent to 46 percent .
The poll , when compared with the two previous Ohio Newspaper Polls , suggests the Illinois senator has momentum on his side .
The latest poll of 886 likely voters , conducted Oct. 18 - 22 , also asked Ohioans their views on the Iraq war and national security , issues where McCain holds an advantage .
But with the economic crisis eclipsing all other issues , especially in Ohio , Obama has been able to keep the race focused on pocketbook issues , to his benefit .
The poll shows that support for Obama has increased by 7 percentage points since the first poll was taken in mid-September .
McCain 's support has declined by 2 percentage points since then , and he has lost ground with white voters and with men .
The polls were conducted by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati and have a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points .
Eric Rademacher , interim co-director of the institute , says that Obama has an edge but that the highly charged race and partisan electorate make the contest similar to the unpredictable one four years ago .
" It is very possible that 2008 could be a repeat of 2004 , when the race for Ohio was decided by just 2 percentage points , " he said .
The campaign in Ohio , which has been marked by negative television advertising and harsh rhetoric , is also potentially volatile because 11 percent of voters surveyed said they might change their minds .
Just 3 percent remain undecided .

Both campaigns and special - interest groups are trying to sway these voters by flooding them with last - minute negative messages in the mail .
The Ohio Republican Party , for instance , mailed a flier last week that misrepresents Obama 's relationship to William Ayers , a one - time member of the Weather Underground , an anti-government group responsible for bombings in the 1970s , including one at the Pentagon .
" This is the story of William Ayers . . . Terrorist .
Radical .
Friend of Obama , " the four - page flier reads on the front .
Another one from the party attacks Obama for his support of gun-control bills , though the flier fails to give his complete position on the issue .
A Democratic - leaning special - interest group , Bring Ohio Back , sent voters a flier featuring a picture of a battered woman and including the false charge that McCain does n't support certain women 's issues and the Violence Against Women Act .
" Those kind of messages are really a target for undecided people and those who might change their mind , " Rademacher says .
When a voter gets in the voting booth , Rademacher says , these messages could trigger " a second thought . "
Undecided voter Diana Schneider of Grove City said her decision will come down to the candidates ' positions on two issues : the economy and immigration .
" I 'll support the one who will do more to bring the economy back where it was at , " said Schneider , 60 , a retired federal employee who is still studying their positions .
" Until we can get up on our feet and stop shipping our jobs overseas , we need to get people back to work before letting more foreigners in the country . "
The presidential race has been defined by the nation 's economic troubles , especially the recent Wall Street meltdown and the Main Street credit crunch , which has refocused both voters and the candidates ' policies on job creation , taxes and health care .
Throughout the campaign , Obama has argued that McCain , an Arizona senator , would continue the " failed economic policies of President Bush " while Obama would provide relief to the middle class .
Obama also has attacked McCain 's health - care plan , especially in TV ads .
In the second Ohio Newspaper Poll , released two weeks ago , voters said Obama would do a better job of handling the economy than McCain .
But it was only a slight advantage , 47 percent to 44 percent .
McCain charges that Obama 's tax plan would hurt small - business owners .
More recently , McCain has attacked his rival 's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy as tantamount to socialism .
Despite such attacks , the highest - income voters moved away from McCain , compared with previous polls .
Of those who said they earn more than $ 60,000 , 49 percent side with Obama , 47 percent with McCain .
Obama lost ground with voters earning between $ 40,000 and $ 60,0000 , though he still holds a 6 - point advantage with them .
Such demographic data , however , have a higher margin of error than the overall poll because the sampling size of subgroups is smaller .
Delores Balogh of Struthers is a 71 - year - old retiree who says she 's voting for Obama because she has connected with his economic plan .
" McCain has n't mentioned anything about our jobs that have been shipped overseas , " she said .
" I think Obama is intelligent and is focused on things like hospitalization . "
The latest poll also asked voters about national security , the top issue in the 2004 election , which helped President Bush defeat Democratic Sen. John Kerry .
But the issue has been overshadowed by the economic crisis .
A large part of McCain 's candidacy has been his national - security experience , reflected in his ads as well as his campaign 's theme , " Country first . "
And he has an advantage on the issue .
One of every two voters believes McCain would do a better job in dealing with the situation in Iraq .
And by a wide margin -- 52 percent to 39 percent -- voters say they believe McCain would do the best job protecting the country from future terrorist attacks .

The Ohio News Organization that commissioned the three recent Ohio Newspaper Polls is a cooperative formed this year by the state 's eight largest newspapers to share news and features .
The newspapers in the group include the Akron Beacon Journal , the Blade , the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Columbus Dispatch , Dayton Daily News , The Plain Dealer , the Canton Repository of Canton , and Youngstown Vindicator .
The newspapers commissioned the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati to conduct today 's poll , which was done by surveying 886 likely Ohio voters Oct. 18 - 22 .
The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points .
Two earlier Ohio Newspaper Polls were published in the eight newspapers on Sept. 14 and Oct. 12 .

And by a wide margin - 52 percent to 39 percent - voters say they believe McCain will do the best job protecting the country from future terrorist attacks .
Stay - at - home mom Angela Roehrenbeck , 42 , of Canal Winchester , says McCain is the clear choice on national security .
" I like the fact that he fought for our country and that he has a record we can see and he has experience , " she said .
The electorate in Ohio , though , remains conflicted by the war in Iraq .
A majority say the decision to go to war was wrong .
But more voters -- 37 percent -- say the war has made the United States safer than the 23 percent who say it has made the nation less safe .
Thirty - eight percent said the war made no difference in the country 's safety .
Voters break along party lines on the question of whether the next president should set a specific timetable to withdraw from Iraq .
Overall , 52 percent of voters do not support setting a timetable .
McCain 's hard - line policy on the Iraq war turned off Democrat Drew Abbott , 46 , a Cincinnati restaurant owner , small - scale real estate developer and self - described former independent voter .
Abbott says he was n't initially against McCain .
But McCain 's obstinate position became a concern .
" I think he is wedded to the concept of our winning , " Abbott said .
" He thinks we are going to win it .
We are not . "
Abbott , who has spent a lot of time in Europe , says he is dismayed " at how the world looks at us . "
He shared a story about a recent business trip to London , where he was treated by a physician from Iraq .
Afterward , she asked if he minded an impolite question : " Why have you destroyed my country ? "
" I said , ' I do n't know , ' and ' I 'm sorry , ' " Abbott recalled .
Roehrenbeck , however , feels the United States is winning in Iraq .
She worries that success there is being overshadowed by the economy and believes McCain needs to stay on that message .
" People always want money in their pockets , " she said .
" I do think McCain needs to hit home on the economics because that 's where people 's hearts are right now .
People do need to look .
Obama will raise taxes . "
The poll also asked voters about immigration , which has received virtually no attention from candidates this year .
Fifty - six percent of voters said illegal immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens , while 27 percent said they should be deported .
Fifteen percent said the United Sates should allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country to work for a limited time .
With a little more than a week before the election , the poll reflects
Ohio 's divided electorate that 's long been a bellwether .
No Republican has ever won the White House without winning this state .
That might explain why McCain and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , have campaigned aggressively in Ohio during the last two weeks .
Palin has visited Ohio four times since Oct. 12 , appearing one day with McCain , who has visited three times .
He returns to Ohio on Monday .

Happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you , happy birthday Red Button , happy birthday to you !
It is 10 years since the BBC launched its first pilot of the Red Button in the UK .
And two years since Channel 4 dumped the interactive service , its chief executive Andy Duncan branding it " clunky and inefficient " .
So who was right – Channel 4's Duncan or BBC director general Mark Thompson ?
There 's only one way to find out .
Fight !
I worry that I do n't use the red button enough .
But on the odd occasion when my mind has flickered towards the irritating little icon in the corner of the screen , I have found it an oddly unsatisfying experience .
The interactive news pages are slow to load and irritating to use .
It is hardly surprising that it suffers in comparison with the web , but I sometimes find myself yearning for the good old analogue days of Teletext .
Anyone else remember Debbie 's Diary on 4 - Tel ?
Thought not .
I also hit red for Strictly Come Dancing 's " expert commentary " on the celebrity contestants – while they were dancing !
Exciting in theory , entirely unenlightening in practice , I switched off .
Then there is the opportunity , during big live football matches – there are not quite as many of these as there used to be on the BBC – to switch to an alternative commentary , such as BBC Radio 5 Live .
This I quite like - if only to avoid Motty .
In the main the red button is of most use during big events , such as Wimbledon , the Olympics and Glastonbury , where you can break away from the main channel and watch something of particular interest to you .
But in this respect it is not so much " interactive " as a whole load of extra TV channels that come and go on demand .
Still , if it 's interactive you want , you can have it .
To mark its 10th birthday , red button fans are being treated to an EastEnders quiz , Bob the Builder karaoke and a whole load of other stuff I wo n't be touching with a 10 foot remote .
But it must have something going for it , with 11 million people hitting the red button every week .
Eat that , Andy Duncan !
The BBC has also come up with their 10 top Red Button highlights from the last 10 years .
Woo - hoo !
There is no word yet on whether the Red Button will be hosting a 10th birthday party , attended by all his best buddies – Set Top Box , Wireless Willy , Dave DAB radio , Barry BlackBerry , Ian iPlayer , Ione Sky + …
Anyway , here are those top 10 moments , according to the BBC .
How were they for you ?
1. Test The Nation , the UK's " first truly interactive quiz " , says the BBC , which has been back 16 times since it launched in 2002 .
I did the first one .
Not bothered since .
2 . In 2002 the Chelsea Flower Show " brought interactivity to a new audience " .
Green fingers , red button .
3 . The BBC 's live music coverage has been interactive since 2003 - Glastonbury , T in the Park , Reading and Leeds , the BBC Proms …
4 . In 2004 , BBC Red Button broadcast a live interview from an astronaut orbiting in the international space station – a first for interactive television .
Missed it .
5. BBC Northern Ireland staged its first ever interactive quiz in 2004 – Would You Pass the Eleven Plus ?
6. Strictly Come Dancing 's Len Goodman got behind the Red Button in 2005 to teach viewers a different dance each week .
7 . More than half - a- million viewers pressed red to watch extended coverage and access up - to - the - minute results from the UK General Election in 2005 .
8 . " Fans of Doctor Who have been accessing weekly episode commentaries from the likes of Russell T Davies and David Tennant since 2006 " .
I have only seen one Who episode since Eccleston left .
How wrong am I ?
9. CBeebies favourites Charlie and Lola went interactive in 2007 with an exclusive premiere of a new song and some corking karaoke .
I love a singalong !
Maybe they could do a David Bowie one .
10 .
The 2008 Beijing Olympics saw the launch of the new Sport Multiscreen , featuring up to six different streams , plus news , results and statistics .
Mayor Fenty's Family Welcomes Baby Girl
The Fenty family in 2006 : Michelle , Matthew , Adrian , Andrew .
( Jahi Chikwendiu - The Washington Post )
It 's a girl !
And her name is Aerin .
The family of D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty welcomed its much - anticipated baby girl this morning -- the first female born into the mayor 's family in three generations .
Michelle Fenty , 38 , gave birth at 6:08 a.m. Monday to Aerin Alexandra Fenty at an undisclosed hospital in the city .
Nine pounds , one ounce ; 21 inches .
The mayor , 37 , was in the delivery room , and big brothers Andrew and Matthew , both 8 , saw their sister soon after .
" Everyone 's in good health and spirits , " said the mayor 's rep , Mafara Hobson .
Michelle Fenty told us last month that -- despite all the doctors ' promises to the contrary -- she was still convinced she was going to have another boy to join the twins ; she kept buying blue things when she went shopping .
But yes , they did paint the nursery pink -- want to see pictures ?
Just so happens we 've got some here .

Those of you who were reading the site in February will recall my astonishment at Love , the forthcoming procedurally - generated moderately - multiplayer online world by one - man studio , Eskil Steenberg .
Steenberg is a man of remarkable talent , both artistic and technical , and what I saw on his laptop screen at GDC impressed me more than any high - profile release of recent years .
A wondrous , impressionistic MMO world that facilitates player creativity and encourages co-operation , that looks incredible and sounds too ambitious to be true .
It ’s a bold , brave project of independent game development .
We ’ve got the first moving images of Steenberg ’s project after the jump .
This text will be replaced
[ If you see “ this text will be replaced ” you need to turn off your adblocker . ]
You can see the smoky visuals , the player - editing landscapes , the combat , the abstract entities of the Love world .
We ’ll be asking Steenberg to explain his game in a little more detail in the coming weeks .
In the meantime read my previous conversation with Steenberg , and visit his site .
The game , naturally , will be done when it ’s done .
Debunking the Maverick Myth By Shannyn Moore I laugh every time I hear Sarah Palin described as a " Maverick " .
Let me tell you , it is a myth !
Alaska sports nearly as many corrupt politicians as we have mosquitoes .
To be a " Maverick Republican " in Alaska , all you have to do is NOT have your house raided by the FBI , NOT be indicted , or NOT be sitting in a federal prison for selling your vote to the oil or prison industry .
Considering she has just hired an attorney to defend her in the state 's investigation of abuse of power , she no longer qualifies as a " maverick " even by our own weak standard .
Alaska is often described as a " Red State " , but more Alaskans are registered to vote as Independent or non-partisan than Democrat and Republican combined .
For years , evidence was presented to multiple governors and state attorney generals of the corruption between Big Oil and elected legislators .
All fell on oily deaf ears .
Frank displayed obvious nepotism in his appointment of his own daughter to his US Senate seat .
Lisa Murkowski nearly lost her Alaska State House Seat in a runoff after a close election before her appointment .
Frank eliminated the longevity bonus for seniors living in Alaska .
Frank relaxed oil and mining permitting regulations .
Frank collapsed the Habitat Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game into the Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) .
Habitat was responsible for holding DNR to high environmental regulatory standards to protect fish and wildlife .
Frank bought a jet to replace the official state plane against the wishes of the People and the Alaska State legislature .
The new jet would not have the capability to land on most of the rural gravel runways in Bush Alaska .
Sarah Palin sold the jet at a $ 592,600 loss once elected .
Frank combined frequent Lower 48 personal and ROS travel on the new state jet .
In most cases , thousands of dollars would have been saved had Frank and his wife just flown first class .
Frank secretly negotiated a corporate giveaway via a new oil net profits tax that would threaten 85 % of Alaska ’s state revenue stream .
Frank pardoned Whitewater Engineering .
An Alaska jury found the Bellingham company guilty of negligently murdering employee Gary Stone .
Frank thought the verdict was too tough and issued a pardon on his last day in office .
I sat through hours of testimony and trials of the self named Corrupt Bastards Club .
Yes , the CBC , all with emblazoned hats and shirts .
Hours of FBI secret filming of Room 604 in Juneau ’s Baranof Hotel , played like a grainy episode of the Sopranos meets Gunsmoke .
Endless bottles of booze , swagger , swearing , and the cartoon laughter of powerful oil men buying powerful legislators filled the federal courtroom .
The selling of votes was enraging , selling them so cheap was insulting .
The FBI and the Department of Justice have been hard at work in the 49th State .
I showed up at Ted Steven ’s house when the raid of the most senior Republican Senator was in progress .
Our one and only congressman for Alaska is under multiple investigations ; not only by the FBI , but by his own colleagues in Congress .
Former Senator and Governor Frank Murkowski must be squirming since his former Chief of Staff , Jim Clark , pled guilty a few months ago .
We have three former state officials serving time for selling their votes to Big Oil , one for selling his to the prison industry , and more on the way .
John McCain loves his “ maverick ” title , and wants to crown Sarah with it as well .
A “ maverick ” in Washington D.C. would n’t vote with George Bush 90 % of the time , and a “ maverick ” in Alaska just has to stay out of the sites of the law .
Well , Sarah has now hired an attorney to take care of her needs during an investigation of her abuse of power .

This 11th hour " leak " is supposedly a fully assembled new MacBook Pro , expected to be announced today by Steve Jobs at the Apple event in Cupertino , California .
It tallies pretty much completely with the previous shots we 've seen of the upper case , with the recessed , chiclet keyboard , magnetic latch and in / out ports arrayed along the left side ( see picture below for the side view ) .
In the picture we see a 15 " MacBook Pro , and there will be a 13 " MacBook , also in aluminum .
Apple 's one button mouse obsession ?
Over .
Look at the trackpad and you 'll see no buttons at all .
The pad is apparently made from glass , just like the screen of the iPhone , and can be pressed to get a physical click , similar to that of the new Blackberry Storm .
The pad does n't look like glass in the picture , but hey , John Gruber over at Daring Fireball , who reports on the trackpad , has seen the picture too – and and he's not usually given to discussing rumors without clearly stating so .
The other internal oddity is that Apple is putting not one , but two NVIDIA graphics chips inside , both of which will be real , full on GPUs , with their own discrete RAM .
These wil be the 9400 M and the 9600M GT .
If GPUs are the new MHz , this makes a lot of sense , although it is certainly a rather new way of shoehorning extra power into a computer .
Further : The 17 " MacBook Pro may be on its way out .
It 'll get a speed and storage bump today , but when they 're gone , they 're gone .
It might be a discontinuation of the line , or maybe Apple is just concentrating on making enough of the 15 " model for now .
The speculation over an $ 800 MacBook is also , apparently , crap , although the Boy Genius says it has confirmed a $ 900 item in the lineup .
Gruber thinks that the regular , low - end white MacBook , will remain on sale , dropped from its current $ 1100 to $ 1000 .
The new metal MacBook will also reportedly gain a proper GPU and lose its FireWire port .
The prices , cribbed from Daring Fireball :
MacBook Pro Current MacBook $ 1099 : 2.1 GHz , white , 1 GB memory , 120 GB disk $ 1299 : 2.4 GHz , white , 2 GB memory , 160 GB disk $ 1499 : 2.4 GHz , black , 2 GB memory , 250 GB disk New MacBook $ 1299 : 2.0 GHz , 2 GB memory , 160 GB disk $ 1499 : 2.4 GHz , 2 GB memory , 250 GB disk
The real test of these pictures , though , is whether or not they make the current models look immediately dated .
The answer is a big " yes " .
Jesus Diaz over at Gizmodo has mocked up a picture based on these new shots and it is gorgeous .
That black ( still too - big ) bezel , the squared - off ( and rather brick - like ) base and the optically thin curved lid all make me want one .
Anybody want to buy a slightly used , 2.4GHz MacBook Pro ?

Mr. Blurrycam reveals the updated MacBook Pro [ Engadget ]
Cryptographers have long joked about rubber - hose cryptanalysis : basically , beating the keys out of someone .
Seems that this might have actually happened in Turkey :
According to comments allegedly made by Howard Cox , a US Department of Justice official in a closed - door meeting last week , after being frustrated with the disk encryption employed by Yastremskiy , Turkish law enforcement may have resorted to physical violence to force the password out of the Ukrainian suspect .
Mr Cox ’s revelation came in the context of a joke made during his speech .
While the exact words were not recorded , multiple sources have verified that Cox quipped about leaving a stubborn suspect alone with Turkish police for a week as a way to get them to voluntarily reveal their password .
The specifics of the interrogation techniques were not revealed , but all four people I spoke to stated that it was clear that physical coercion was the implied method .

2011/4/8 : This is no longer an actively maintained project .
I apologize , I must move on with current events .
This is a Javascript library that sandwiches PNG image support into IE6 without much fuss .
You can use PNGs as the SRC of an < IMG /> element or as a background - image property in CSS .
If you attempt the latter , you will find that , unlike with vanilla usage of AlphaImageLoader , background - position and background - repeat work as intended .
As a bonus , " fixed " elements will respond to a commonly used set of Javascript style assignments , as well as the A : hover pseudo - class .
Table of Contents
Long story short , this uses Microsoft 's implementation of VML instead of Microsoft 's AlphaImageLoader filter .
I stumbled upon the notion that PNG images show up correctly in a VML fill element while working on DD_roundies .
Thereafter , some Googling revealed that a few people had already known about this .
The intended implementation is pretty easy :
Download a copy of the DD_belatedPNG Javascript file - please do not hotlink mine , I am on a shared host .
Refer to it in your document ( second line of the example code a few bullets down ) .
In another script node , add function calls to DD_belated PNG.fix ( ) .
. fix ( ) requires one argument : a text string representing a CSS selector .
requires one argument : a text string representing a CSS selector .
Here is an example : <!--[ if IE 6 ] >
< script src=" DD_belatedPNG.js " ></ script >
< script >
/* EXAMPLE */
DD_belatedPNG.fix ( '.png_bg ' ) ;
/* string argument can be any CSS selector */
/* . png_bg example is unnecessary */
/* change it to what suits you ! */
</script >
<![endif ] -->
As of 0.0.3a , you can roll a bunch of CSS selectors into one argument , just like how you 'd do a selector group in a CSS file : fix ('.example1 , .example2 , img ' ) ;
Due to popular demand , here is some documentation for how to " fix " elements on a pick - and - choose basis .
Refer to the DD_belatedPNG script as noted earlier .
Call DD_belatedPNG.fixPng ( yourElement ) , with the sole argument being an HTMLDomElement instead of a CSS selector .
( Based on the normal usage approach )
Invoking DD_belatedPNG.fix ( ) adds a line of CSS to the document via DOM .
adds a line of CSS to the document via DOM .
The selector of this CSS is provided by the first argument for fix , which should be a string ( such as # content div ) .
, which should be a string ( such as ) .
The declaration of this CSS is an MSIE - proprietary behavior - basically a Javascript expression bound to elements on the fly , without walking through a NodeList collection .
The content of the behavior executes a function with each matched element as its sole argument .
The first duty of this function is to reset its own style .
behavior to no longer have a value ; allowing behaviors to continue unchallenged is a recipe of for CPU - eating disaster .

The function then examines the element 's dimensions , location , and styles using offsetWidth , offsetHeight , offsetLeft , offsetTop , and currentStyle

It copies the matched element 's .
To support various positioning and repeat background properties , some of the VML element gets a style.clip rectangle .
You cannot use ' body ' as the CSS selector argument for the fix ( ) function .
The VML is positioned using sibling DOM relationships !
You cannot create a previousSibling of < body > , so trying to do so fails ( badly ) .
As an alternative , you can wrap the contents of the < body > element with a wrapper element , and apply the background style and fix function to that instead .
It is not a question of getting it to work , it is a question of performance .

0.0.8a / 2009.06.30 ( source.js / packed.js ) " DD_belated PNG is undefined " error should occur less often now .
Auto - cleansing of VML artifacts when printing ( or performing a print - preview ) - thanks to Rémi Prévost !
Allowing CSS padding of < IMG /> elements in strict rendering mode .
Stricter adherence to JSLint .
Switched to YUI Compressor for packed copy of lib .
No JS error messages in Firefox ( et al ) , if you choose to not include the lib through conditional comments .
0.0.7a / 2009.01.01 ( source.js / packed.js )
New feature : alpha filter value copying ( in other words : opacity support , allows fades to happen for instance ) .
Bug fix : saying fix ( 'img ' ) ; froze IE6 in less than a second .
Basically the size - finder images were n't being protected from them being matched and " fixed " ( and they would , in turn , ask for more elements to be appended to the document - INFINITE LOOP ) .
Notice : some under - the - hood function names changed because I got sick of typing long ones .
Performance improvement : matched elements wo n't get " fixed " if a PNG src or background image is n't detected .
This means you can be lazy .
Performance improvement : according to Fiddler2 , images get cached correctly -- most of the time .
I believe there is still an issue to solve related to latency .
Performance improvement : appending " size finder " images to the document in a more intelligent , less greedy , as - needed basis .
< IMG /> support kinda sucked , but no one reported it .
Improved it anyway .
0.0.6a / 2008.12.14 ( source.js / packed.js )
Edges of fixed elements are no longer fuzzy ( except for floated elements , and only sometimes , and it goes away on mouseover ... weird ) - the one pixel gap problem has been mostly solved .
Few people noticed , but it bugged me , and was VERY hard to fix .
0.0.5a / 2008.12.12 ( source.js / packed.js )
Hopeful memory improvement : now setting DD_belatedPNG to null in an onbeforeunload listener .
Hopeful memory improvement : various VML manipulation methods used to be copied onto each matched element .
Figured out how to just have them in the DD_belatedPNG namespace and keep everything working properly .
Should have done this initially .
0.0.4a / 2008.12.11 ( source.js / packed.js )

Advertisement A passenger plane has made an emergency landing in Western Australia after some 40 people were hurt following a " sudden change in altitude " , officials say .
The Qantas Airbus A330-300 flying from Singapore to Perth with 313 people on board landed at Learmonth Airport near Exmouth after making a mayday call .
Qantas said there was no sign yet as to what caused the altitude change , but officials suspect it was turbulence .
Emergency services , including medical personnel , met the plane on landing .
Three cabin crew and more than 30 passengers sustained injuries , 15 of them serious , including fractures and lacerations , officials said .
Several people were taken to the hospital in Exmouth .
The Royal Flying Doctor Service also sent two aircraft to Exmouth to help transport the injured to the state capital Perth , about 1,100 km ( 700 miles ) south of the town , if necessary .
' In - flight upset '
The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau said the plane had been cruising in level flight when it experienced a " sudden in - flight upset " which resulted in injuries to a number of cabin crew and passengers , primarily in the rear of the aircraft .
They put two people in the seats in front of us - when I looked up they had their backs on the ceiling
Nigel Court , passenger
The pilot declared a mayday and diverted the plane to make an emergency landing at the remote Learmonth airport on the north - western Australian coast , " where it landed without further incident " , the statement added .
One of the passengers , Nigel Court , said the sudden change in altitude had caused mayhem on board .
" They put two people in the seats in front of us .
When I looked up they had their backs on the ceiling .
My wife was the same - she crashed head first into the roof above us , " he told the Reuters news agency .
" We had either the captain , or the first officer , in the area just behind us and he got caught unaware as well as , as well as a number of the cabin crew , one of who broke his leg as well . "
Qantas said there were no details available at this stage as to what caused the altitude change , but one local police officer said it was severe turbulence .
" We have had some information that it possibly was turbulence , but we have n't had that confirmed at this stage , " Sgt Clifford told ABC .
However , Western Australia Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan later told the Sydney Morning Herald that he understood the incident had been caused by " some sort of systems failure " .
He said his force 's State Crisis Centre in Perth had been activated .
Seven ATSB investigators are also preparing to travel to Learmonth in order to investigate the incident .
Qantas is sending two smaller planes to the airport to bring stranded passengers to Perth .
Safety review
The Australian flag - carrier prides itself on having a good safety record , but a spate of recent incidents has dented its image , correspondents say .
QANTAS INCIDENTS 7 October : Airbus A330 makes emergency landing in Western Australia after " sudden change in altitude " injures up to 40 people 2 Aug : 767 returns to Sydney after hydraulic fluid leak in wing 28 July : 737 returns to Adelaide with landing gear cover problem 25 July : 747 diverted to Manila after hole appears in fuselage
Oxygen bottle behind Qantas blast
In July , a Qantas Boeing 747 flying from Hong Kong to Melbourne was forced to make an emergency landing after an oxygen cylinder caused an explosion which blew a large hole in the fuselage .
Later that month , one of the airline 's Boeing 737s returned to Adelaide after a landing gear bay door failed to close .
Days later , a Boeing 767 bound for Manila needed to return to Sydney after a hydraulic fluid leak was detected .
The Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority subsequently launched a review of the airline .
Officials said they had no evidence of falling safety standards , but that it was " prudent " to take a closer look .

WASHINGTON  Zero percent interest rates !
It sounds like free money , or maybe a promotional deal from General Motors to get people to buy Hummers .
Are zero rates coming to the Federal Reserve ?
As it happens , the Fed is surprisingly close to that point already .
On Wednesday , the central bank lowered its target for the federal funds rate  the rate that banks charge each other on overnight loans  to 1 percent from 1.5 percent .
But in practice , the actual federal funds rate fluctuates slightly around its target as the Fed carries out its open - market operations in the money markets .
And because banks and financial institutions have been so frightened about lending in the last month , the actual Fed funds rate has been below 1 percent for the last two weeks .
On Tuesday , it averaged only 0.67 percent .
A growing number of analysts now predict that the economy is so weak that the Fed will have to reduce its official target to zero if it wants to jumpstart the stalled economy .
It ’s amazing .
The events in Greece take an increasingly Syndicalist turn and new clashes arise between the police and the Anarchists .
But as these events unfold in the land that birthed both Democracy and Anarchism , the “ self - styled ” and “ self - described ” Anarchists , as the media has been describing them , are being increasingly becomming the victims of propaganda .
World wide , media outlets are painted the Anarchists ( as per usual ) as hooded bandits indiscriminately destroying whatever is in their path out of a lust for chaos and violence .
The following extracts are taking from this article , care of ManBear2 Pig on the Forums of the Libertarian Left , demonstrates this .
Firebombs and breaking glass , tear gas and burning cars .
The images from Greece this month were enough to put the fear of youth into the hearts of European leaders .
…
Experts speak of another worry , which is the seemingly anachronistic resurgence of vague radical movements , loosely called anarchist , which hark back to the destructive ideology of Mikhail Bakunin , the 19th - century Russian revolutionary , and to the rebellious rhetoric of the 1960s and 1970s .
Some of it is n’t that threatening , like recurring play of the 1979 song , “ Another Brick in the Wall , ” by Pink Floyd , on Alpha radio during the week - long protests in Athens .
“ We do n’t need no education / We do n’t need no thought control / No dark sarcasm in the classroom , ” goes the angry refrain .
But the violence was n’t far behind the slogans .
By the third day of rioting , the estimated damage in Athens and Thessaloniki , Greece ’s two biggest cities , was more than € 1 billion , or $ 1.4 billion .
From these passages alone the reader is lead to believe that the Anarchists , in particular the Anarcho - Syndicalists are a random mob of violent thugs .
The specific reference to Russian revolutionary and the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s immediately takes the readers mind to the Soviet Union and the hippy ’s .
So what is the image we are given from this piece of journalistic writing ?
The Anarchists are “ a bunch of violent hippy communists that model themselves after Che Guevarra . ”
Think I ’m exaggerating ?
Read this paragraph :
The role of these so - called anarchists in the weeklong protests is still not clear .
But their message – loaded with anti-capitalist , anti-government and anti-globalization themes – is unmistakable .
Also clear is their bent for violence .
Ca n’t make it much clearer than that .
What ’s better is that there is absolutely no understanding of the position of the “ self - described ” Anarchists .
No attempt is even made to research the background and provide a general idea of what they stand for and why they are anti-government , anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation .
Neither is any decent information provided explaining the long running feud between the Anarchists and the Greek police or the economic circumstances that have lead to this saga .
The most important phrase , found frolicking through - out its unnatural habitat in the lines of text in this article , is the phrase , ‘ so - called Anarchists ’ .
It ’s a lovely little piece of political spin that does nothing but cause the reader to connect definition of anarchy as ‘ chaos ’ to this political group that incorporates it into their name .
You ’ll also see it appear in other forms such as , “ self - titled , ” and , “ self - described . ”
Even other Anarchists have taken the mainstream media line and so applied the same or similar terms to the Greek Anarchists based on the place that violence has taken in the uprising , regardless of cause , context and circumstance .
There is much propaganda being spread to marginalise the Greek Anarchists and polarise them from “ common decency . ”
Mainstream media outlets originally decried the violent protests as they took the police line — the same police line that involved 30 hooded teenagers attacking them with molotovs , bricks and all sorts .
Then they turned tail , reported that the kid was shot unjustly and now have returned to the side of the government by condemning the “ anachronistic ” and “ violent ” Anarchists .
The coverage of the protests has been non-specific and one - sided , which translates every report into something along the lines of , “ this is more stupid street fighting by stupid people who ca n’t understand that the boy was in the wrong and you should all get back to work . ”
Thank Christ for internet forums , the blogosphere and alternative media outlets , is all I have to say .
But hey let ’s end this on a different .
Seems the workers have taken over the union and town halls .
The action forms part of a strategy to counteract the designs of the union bureaucracy to distance its membership from the current revolt , and protest its management and mediation of workers ’ struggles in Greece .
The occupants aim to create a space in which to facilitate a grassroots and self organised workers response to the crisis , and bring the wider working class into the events unfolding on the streets of Greece .
Town halls in Athens and Thessaloniki have also been occupied in order to hold general assemblies .
The Monopoly board game has many different versions these days .
During my time it was just good ole , regular Monopoly ...

TALLAHASSEE , Fla . 
Nearly two years after a Florida congressman abruptly resigned over sexually explicit messages he sent to a teenage House page , law enforcement authorities here have concluded there is “ insufficient evidence ” to charge him with breaking Florida laws .
Commissioner Gerald Bailey of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , who was asked in September 2006 to look into the conduct of the congressman , Representative Mark Foley , Republican of West Palm Beach , said Friday that investigators were hampered by Mr. Foley ’s refusal and that of Congress to grant them access to Congressional computer files .
The department was investigating whether Mr. Foley violated Florida ’s computer child pornography and exploitation law , and a state law banning the transmittal of harmful material to minors via electronic equipment or devices .
“ F.D.L.E. conducted as thorough and comprehensive investigation as possible considering Congress and Mr. Foley denied us access to critical data , ” Mr. Bailey said in a statement .
“ Should additional information arise which is pertinent to this case , we will ensure it is appropriately investigated . ”

Try volunteering somewhere to meet potential friends who are passionate about the same causes as you are .
If joining a group or volunteering is too far out of your comfort zone , try striking up conversations with people you see regularly , like someone you sit next to in class or the cashier at your favorite store .
You could also try sitting with different people during lunch .
It 's OK if you 're nervous to talk to new people .
Just smile , stand up straight , and make eye contact so you seem friendly .
Once you 've talked a few times , try initiating a get - together by inviting them somewhere , like a sports game or a concert .
After you start hanging out , you 'll quickly become better friends !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Friday signed into law an extension of unemployment benefits , the White House said .
It gives seven more weeks of unemployment payments to workers who have exhausted their current jobless benefits .
For those in states with the highest unemployment rates , an additional 20 weeks will be allowed .
On Thursday , the government reported the number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits last week was at its highest level in 16 years and more than 4 million people were now receiving unemployment benefits .
International Herald Tribune
Gail Collins did another awesome op - ed about , Is Anybody Happy ?
She covered everything from George Bush ’s speech on Friday to the fatal mistake made by McCain in using “ Joe the Plumber ” as the centerpiece , in the final days of his campaign .
These are the excerpts that I found most noteworthy , also her lessons to be learned are too funny .
First of all , George W. Bush showed up on TV Friday morning to reassure Americans .
What could possibly be worse ?
Everybody knows that anything the U.S. president says is very likely wrong , and certainly wo n’t happen .
If he announced : “ I ’m sending government agents to Spokane to arrest the looters , ” we would expect that the officials would get lost , nobody would be arrested , and the looters probably never existed in the first place .
So hearts sunk throughout the United States when Bush appeared at a Chamber of Commerce gathering to say that the economy would recover .
“ America is the most attractive destination for investors around the globe .
America is the home of the most talented and enterprising and creative workers in the world , ” said the president , who also insisted that “ democratic capitalism remains the greatest system ever devised . ”
Which translates into :
All the money is going to Asia , nobody will ever get a job again and Karl Marx was right after all .
Bummer .
The Republicans are deeply depressed .
Only Sarah Palin is chipper , perhaps because , as she told her supporters , the staff wo n’t let her watch the news .
Maybe McCain ’s problem is not his temperament but his positions .
It ’s hard to be cheerful and self - satisfied when you ’re peddling an unpopular product .
With less than three weeks to go , saddled with an unpopular ideology and an unattractive candidate , the McCain campaign ’s deep thinkers decided the only possible hope was . …
Joe the Plumber !
Joe is , of course , the conservative guy from northwestern Ohio who told Obama : “ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more ” because he planned to buy a business that he hoped would reel in more than $ 250,000 a year in profits .
The Republican presidential campaign is now all Joe , all the time .
Obama ’s plan to give tax breaks to people making less than $ 200,000 a year is being described on a McCain Internet ad as “ welfare government handouts . ”
In Miami , Lieberman told a rally that McCain would “ fight for Jose el plomero ! ”
From Me ( Court ) To You (? )
In Britain , opposition politicians form a " shadow government . "
In Washington , think tanks form a " government in waiting . "
In Barack Obama 's Washington , one think tank in particularthe Center for American Progress .
Out with the old , in with the new ( AP ) That means that even as Obama transition leader John Podesta is coy about many of the details of just what the Obama administration will do , CAP President John Podesta has helpfully mapped them out in a book released yesterday .
So what 's in store on the energy and environment fronts ?
If the CAP 's blueprint really is more than just wonky advice , the Obama administration wo n't ...
A real tour de force here .
You may recall that Parker was one of the first , and only , conservatives to come out an admit that Sarah Palin was an embarrassment .
Here she takes on quite possible the GOP ’s biggest sacred cow , the religious right .
She calls it “ armband religion ” – which means , I think , wearing your religion on your sleeve ( but I ca n’t seem to throw off the feeling that she meant a bit of a fascism allusion here as well ) .
This is a hugely important piece – a must read .
Here ’s an excerpt :
As Republicans sort out the reasons for their defeat , they likely will overlook or dismiss the gorilla in the pulpit .
Three little letters , great big problem : G - O- D .
I ’m bathing in holy water as I type .
To be more specific , the evangelical , right - wing , oogedy - boogedy branch of the GOP is what ails the erstwhile conservative party and will continue to afflict and marginalize its constituents if reckoning does n’t soon cometh .
Simply put : Armband religion is killing the Republican Party .
And , the truth — as long as we ’re setting ourselves free — is that if one were to eavesdrop on private conversations among the party intelligentsia , one would hear precisely that ….
Which is to say , the GOP has surrendered its high ground to its lowest brows .
In the process , the party has alienated its non-base constituents , including other people of faith ( those who prefer a more private approach to worship ) , as well as secularists and conservative - leaning Democrats who otherwise might be tempted to cross the aisle … .
Religious conservatives become defensive at any suggestion that they ’ve had something to do with the GOP ’s erosion .
And , though the recent Democratic sweep can be attributed in large part to a referendum on Bush and the failing economy , three long - term trends identified by Emory University ’s Alan Abramowitz have been devastating to the Republican Party : increasing racial diversity , declining marriage rates and changes in religious beliefs .
Suffice it to say , the Republican Party is largely comprised of white , married Christians .
Anyone watching the two conventions last summer can’t have missed the stark differences :
One party was brimming with energy , youth and diversity ; the other felt like an annual Depends sales meeting .
With the exception of Miss Alaska , of course .
Even Sarah Palin has blamed Bush policies for the GOP loss .
She ’s not entirely wrong , but she ’s also part of the problem .
Her recent conjecture about whether to run for president in 2012 ( does anyone really doubt she will ? ) speaks for itself :
“ I ’m like , okay , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I ’m like , do n’t let me miss the open door .
Show me where the open door is ….
And if there is an open door in ( 20 ) 12 or four years later , and if it ’s something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ’ll plow through that door . ”
Let ’s do pray that God shows Alaska ’s governor the door … .
Given those facts , the future of the GOP looks dim and dimmer if it stays the present course .
Either the Republican Party needs a new base — or the nation may need a new party .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- U.S. military forces launched airstrikes on a Pakistani village early Wednesday morning , two Pakistani military sources told CNN .
The U.S. conducted airstrikes on a village in the border area of North Waziristan early Wednesday , sources said .
The strikes occurred about 1 a.m. in a village in North Waziristan , a mountainous region of northwest Pakistan near the Afghanistan border , a Pakistani military source said .
U.S. military sources could not immediately be reached for comment .
The sources said the U.S. military launched two or three missiles that struck at least one home .
The sources did not have any information on casualties or injuries .
According to The Associated Press , security officials say at least three people were killed and six wounded in the suspected U.S. missile strike .
The two , who commented on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media , did not say how they knew the U.S. carried out the strike , AP reported .
U.S. attacks in Pakistan have become a controversial issue in recent weeks .
In July , President Bush approved U.S. incursions in Pakistan to go after insurgents without consulting first with Islamabad .
Pakistan has expressed displeasure with the idea and asserted its right to defend its borders
Earlier this month , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he would not allow foreign nations to violate his nation 's sovereignty to pursue terrorists .
A week after that statement , Pakistani military forces fired shots at two U.S. helicopters .
They said the choppers had crossed into Pakistani territory .
U.S. military officials denied that , saying the helicopters had been in Afghan territory .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
If votes in the United Nations serve as a gauge of global opinion , 98.9 percent of the world opposes the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba , a measure imposed 46 years ago to isolate the communist - ruled island and bring down its leaders .
People watch the daily news on Mesa Redonda to follow up on the U.S election , in Havana November 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Enrique de la Osa
It failed on both counts .
As far as international opinion is concerned , the country that is isolated is the United States , not Cuba .
In the latest of 17 successive U.N. General Assembly resolutions on lifting the embargo , Washington mustered only two allies -- Israel and Palau , a Pacific island nation difficult to find on a map .
It has a population of 21,000 .
The Marshall Islands ( pop. 63,000 ) , which had voted with the United States from 2000 to 2007 , unexpectedly and without public explanation broke ranks this year and abstained in the vote , a non-binding resolution taken a week before the U.S. presidential election .
The count -- 185 countries in favor of lifting the embargo , three against -- speaks volumes about a bankrupt policy stuck in the Cold War era .
Will that kind of America versus the world line - up change under Barack Obama ?
Not necessarily .
The man who made history on November 4 by becoming the first black to be elected president of the United States has promised to “ ease ” sanctions if Cuba took “ significant steps toward democracy , beginning with freeing all political prisoners . ”
He has not said what it would take for the United States to end the embargo , kept in place by 10 successive U.S. presidents , both Democrats and Republicans .
During the Cold War , when Cuba was a heavily - armed outpost of the Soviet empire just 90 miles from Florida , a majority of Americans agreed with a hard line on a Communist government that violates human rights and holds political prisoners .
That attitude has been changing since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union .
According to a Zogby poll taken a week before the election , 60 percent of Americans believe that Washington should revise its policies toward Cuba .
In particular , 68 percent thought Americans should be allowed to travel to the island and 62 percent said U.S. companies should be allowed to trade with it .
If that happens , it wo n’t be soon .
Latin America in general and Cuba in particular are not likely to figure high on the agenda of a new president who is inheriting two wars and the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
American presidents tend to promise greater attention to southern neighbors but usually do not follow through .
“ I ’m not so idealistic as to think that the embargo will be lifted immediately , ” Cuban dissident and writer Jorge Olivera told Reuters Havana correspondent Jeff Franks .
“ But I expect better times as much for the United States as for Cuba .
I do n’t want to die without seeing an end to this conflict that began when I was born . ”
Worth noting : Under a 1996 law , the president needs congressional approval to lift the embargo or to recognize any government that includes Fidel Castro , who officially stepped down in February , or his brother Raul , who took over from him .
STATIC AND COUNTER -PRODUCTIVE
In the past , the most fervent opposition to ending the embargo -- the effects of which have punished the population for the actions of a leadership it did not elect -- has come from the Cuban - American community in South Florida .
But even this is changing .
“ U.S. policy toward Cuba is at best static and at worst counter - productive , a source of increasing frustration to many Cuban Americans , ” Jorge Mas Santos , chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation ( CANF ) , wrote late in October in a Washington Post opinion column that endorsed Obama .
CANF was set up in 1981 by Mas ’s father , Jorge Mas Canosa , with the express aim of overthrowing the government of Fidel Castro .
For years , the group exerted enormous influence on Washington policy makers -- as well as on presidential candidates keenly aware that winning the White House without winning Florida is a very difficult undertaking .
Obama won the state comfortably .
Cuban exiles , numbering around 650,000 , account for just over a quarter of the total population of the greater Miami area .
In the past , the Republican Party took the loyalty of most of them for granted -- Cuban Americans have traditionally voted four to one for Republicans .
The three Miami - based Cuban American Republicans who serve in the House of Representatives -- all supporters of the embargo -- were re-elected .
Their votes against changes Obama might propose once he takes office on January 20 can be taken for granted .
Some of the most pointed criticism of the embargo has come not from Democrats but from conservative businessmen who resent the fact that American business has been kept out of Cuba while most of the world is engaged there .
In the words of Tom Donohue , CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce : “ All you have to do is go over to Cuba and watch how the Spanish , the French , the Latin Americans and everybody else on the globe are building resorts or trying to invest , and we are sitting here with a 50 - year - old policy that does n’t work . ”
The prime beneficiaries from an end to the embargo would be American agricultural exporters .
“ But just about every industry could benefit , ” according to Donohue , “ for the simple reason that there is such pent - up demand .
Look at the cars they are running -- Jack Kennedy was in office when half of them were sent down there . ”

Independent consultant and member of the Motorists Legal Challenge group Richard Bentley said : " The number of fines suggests that there is something wrong with the limit .
We would need to know what time of day these alleged offences took place .
It could be that many of them took place at night when there were no works taking place , and that signage was incomplete . "
In the late ninth century a disastrous harvest precipitated by drought brought famine to China under the rule of the Tang dynasty .
By A.D. 907 — after nearly three centuries of rule — the dynasty fell when its emperor , Ai , was deposed , and the empire was divided .
According to the atmospheric record contained in a stalagmite , one of the causes of that downfall may have been climate change .
" We think that climate played an important role in Chinese history , " says paleoclimatologist Hai Cheng of the University of Minnesota , a member of the scientific team that harvested and analyzed the stalagmite from Wanxiang Cave in Gansu Province in northwest China .
The stalagmite reveals , for example , that the vital rains of the Asian monsoon weakened at the time of the downfalls of the Tang , Yuan and Ming dynasties over the past 1,810 years .
" The climate acted , " Cheng says , " as the last straw that broke the camel 's back . "
Composed of calcium carbonate leached from dripping water , the 4.6 - inch- ( 11.7 - centimeter - ) long stalagmite preserves a record of rainfall in this region , which is on the edge of the area impacted by the Asian monsoon .
The region gets less rainfall when the monsoon is mild and more when it is strong , the researchers explain today in Science .
These periods of strong and weak rains , when compared with Chinese historical records , coincide with periods of imperial turmoil or prosperity , as in the case of the expansion of the Northern Song Dynasty — a time of abundant harvests .
Further , the stalagmite record matches those of glacial retreat in the Alps , sediment records from Lake Huguang Maar in southern China and droughts from Barbados to Southern France .
In fact , the collapse of the Tang Dynasty coincides with that of the Mayan civilization — both due to extreme drought .
" We have demonstrated that the cave record correlates well with many other records , including the Little Ice Age in Europe , temperature changes [ across the ] Northern Hemisphere , and major solar variability , " Cheng notes .
Fluctuations in the sun 's intensity in the past seemed to play the key role in determining the strength of the Asian monsoon .
The record revealed over the past 50 years , however , paints a different picture , with man-made soot and greenhouse gases determining the rains ' strength .
" It is likely that the current globe warming trend or anthropogenic forcing will be accompanied by a weakening trend of Asian summer monsoons , especially in northwestern China , " Cheng says .
Perhaps that 's why China 's present rulers have been eager to act on man-made climate change .
A Marine infantry officer sends these observations on the terrorist tactics used at Mumbai .
During the Iraq War , two innovations have taken place : first , within the Marine Corps , the concept of the “ buddy pair ” or “ buddy team ” has spread dramatically , though it is still not doctrinal ( it should be ) .
The idea may have begun in the special forces , though I am not sure .
The advantage of smaller and smaller units of maneuver is that if they rehearse their actions and build cohesion within the unit , they develop ever greater levels of capability * at that level * .
A well - trained buddy pair with the right mindset and enough ammo can take over a city block , house by house , while under fire .
The other innovation that has taken place in Iraq is to take the Fire Team and make it into a motorized element , inside one vehicle .
This is less in favor now that everyone realizes that moving around in vehicles makes you seem more like robots to the locals and they then have less of a problem with killing you .
In any case , all of these changes have one large thing in common — a decentralizing of decisionmaking and maneuver .
It appears the attackers were organized into buddy pairs , allowing one to shoot while the other moved , and so forth .
Interestingly , the buddy pair has is a later innovation in small unit tactics and has only been slow to trickle through regular infantry formations .
In World War I , the smallest element of maneuver ( on paper ) might have been a battalion or company .
The Germans , in developing “ storm troop tactics ” then innovated even smaller maneuver elements , which we might call squads today .
The role of platoons and squads became only greater in WWII .
After WWII , General S.L.A .
Marshall conducted a massive study of the reactions of men in combat ( See “ Men Against Fire ” ) and the result of his work was the genesis of the Fire Team .
The Fire Team is now the smallest doctrinal unit of maneuver in the US military .
In the Marine Corps , it is led by a Corporal , includes an automatic rifleman with a Squad Automatic Weapon , and two more riflemen .
From what I can gather there are a few interesting observations to be made of the tactics in use in Mumbai :
And now in Mumbai it would seem we have seen the ultimate result : autonomous buddy - pairs , with a great deal of rehearsals and navigation practice , each with its own set of goals , possibly redundant comms with brevity codes .
I would imagine that each team had multiple preplanned routes to each of its objectives before they finally converged on the location for the last stand .
Along the way , as some have wondered , they may have stopped for quick logistics reloads of ammo and water .
Here are some thoughts , in no order :
1 . The school shooting at Columbine springs to mind when looking for analogies .
2 . One of the advantages of a buddy pair , as mentioned above , is the ability to fire and move .
One fires while the other moves , and then they switch .
In this way , moving from cover to cover , they take ground .
But this concept becomes interesting when considered against the fact that the terrorists seemingly had no one firing against them , and they did not have to disciplined in taking well - aimed shots . . .
3. . . .
A photographer noted how “ cool ” and “ professional ” they looked as they sprayed from the hip .
Shooting from the hip is not extremely professional , but this only is if one wants to take well - aimed shots .
Perhaps shooting from the hip is very professional if one wants to spray in across a broad angle while maintaining a wider field of view than if behind the sights of your weapon .
In other words , if facing no armed opposition , you have the luxury of spraying broadly , and the most dangerous thing to you is an armed threat that comes from outside your narrowed peripheral vision while using your iron sights .
4 . Note this sentence , from the AP article : “ They were n’t aiming at anyone in particular .
It was like they wanted to empty their magazines and do as much damage here as possible before heading to the Taj , ” I would argue that the terrorists , while being superbly motivated , and having planned intricately for their assault , are nevertheless poor marksmen .
Given the details that we are learning of their attack , the most surprising thing is that more people were n’t killed .
5 . It seems that there is a convergence taking place within the realm of small - unit tactics .
Infantry units , terrorists , police forces , criminal and narco - gangs , and so forth are all converging in terms of the tactics they use against one another .
The only tactical difference between 5 terrorist buddy pairs and a Marine rifle squad is their goal : the former seeks a position to create the most carnage indiscriminately for the longest period of time while the latter might be sweeping or clearing an area or conducting a manhunt , meaning it seeks to use the utmost precision in its application of force .
If I may presume : the terrorists have learned fire and movement from us , from watching us , and from reading our manuals , which are posted online .
But our tactics are not geared toward indiscriminate slaughter .
The question is , will they develop any tactical innovations that allow them that advantage ?
Enlarge By Lynne Sladky , AP Razor , a dog that can detect cell phones , poses with phones he found hidden in a box during a demonstration at the Broward Correctional Institution in Ft. Lauderdale , Fla .
Thousands of illegal cellphones are being smuggled into prisons , where inmates , including some on death row , use them to threaten victims , conduct drug deals , plot escape and seek legal help , prison officials say .
The phones , most operating on prepaid accounts bought by relatives and friends , often are not caught in searches at visitor entries .
" States are struggling with this , " says Eric Schultz , spokesman for the American Correctional Association .
In South Carolina , more than 1,000 phones were confiscated last year , corrections spokesman Josh Gelinas says .
In McCormick , S.C. , smugglers have used a makeshift launcher to shoot phones and drugs over 12 - foot prison fences for inmates to pick up .
Other states reporting problems : • Florida : Officials seized 336 phones last year , many from violent inmates .
Some prisoners used the phones to harass their victims , make drug deals and plan escape , prisons spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger says .
A state law that took effect last month makes inmate phone possession a felony .
Next month , the state will assign a Belgian Malinois to roam the prisons and sniff out the phones .
• Texas :
More than 700 cellphones have been seized so far this year , up from 580 last year .
" We 're picking up new cases every day , " says John Moriarty , the prison system 's inspector general .
In one 30 - day period , officials traced 2,800 calls and text messages to death row inmate Richard Tabler , who called a state senator about his appeal .
Texas is bringing in three phone - detection dogs .
• California : Cellphone seizures in 2008 have topped the 1,400 confiscated in 2007 , state prisons spokesman Paul Verke says .
An advisory group of state prison wardens is studying the problem .
Some states ' prison officials say federal law may actually help inmates by prohibiting the jamming gear that blocks calls .
South Carolina authorities planned to test that law Friday by hosting a jamming - technology demo .
Federal Communications Commission spokesman Robert Kenny would not say whether the agency would act against South Carolina authorities .

( CNN ) --
About 1 million people have been forced to flee because of fighting between rebel and government forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday , adding that it was investigating reports of camps being looted and torched .
A rebel spokesman said they were keeping to a cease - fire so aid can reach displaced Congolese .
Babou Amane , deputy spokesman for the National Congress for the Defense of the People , said rebel forces had retreated to about 9 miles ( 15 kilometers ) north of the city of Goma to create a " humanitarian corridor . "
Despite a rebel cease - fire declared late Wednesday , security in Congo 's North Kivu province was tenuous , with many aid organizations refusing or reluctant to venture out to help the homeless , authorities said .
About 50 medical personnel from Medecins sans Frontieres can move throughout the area relatively unobstructed and supplies are getting in , said Marie - Noelle Rodrigue , the agency 's local emergency coordinator .
" Security is a concern , of course , " Rodrigue said from Goma , the provincial capital .
" For the moment , we have not been stopped by anybody . "
Thousands of displaced residents are on the move and Medecins sans Frontieres has mobile clinics dispensing water and any other needed aid , Rodrigue said late Friday .
" We 're trying to move with the people , " Rodrigue said .
" We 're setting up mobile clinics where ever they are . "
There have been some isolated cases of cholera but no epidemics or other major health concerns , Rodrigue said .
" For the moment , it is still under control , " the 40 - year - old nurse said .
David Miliband , the foreign minister of Britain , and his French counterpart , Bernard Kouchner , were heading to Congo and neighboring Rwanda on Friday , their offices said .
France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , which is considering its options , officials have said .
In addition , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon asked Alain Leroy , the undersecretary - general for peacekeeping operations , to travel to the region , the organization said .
European Union Commissioner Louis Michel was in Kinshasa , the Congolese capital , on Friday and obtained " verbal agreement " from Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congo President Joseph Kabila to attend an emergency summit on the crisis to be held " in Nairobi [ Kenya ] under auspices of the United Nations , " EU spokesman John Clancy said .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was investigating reports that some camps for displaced persons had been " forcibly emptied , looted and burned , " according to a written statement .
In a written statement , the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees spokesman Ron Redmond said Friday afternoon , " UNHCR staff in Goma this morning reported the situation calm but tense .
Our office is open and our people are working , but security restrictions on movement remain tight . "
He said rebels controlled Rutshuru , where UNHCR has an office .
Rutshuru is 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) north of Goma , the provincial capital .
Redmond said the UNHCR was trying to verify " disturbing reports " from " humanitarian partners " about attacks on the camps near Rutshuru .
" We are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps , which include the UNHCR - administered sites of Dumez , Nyongera and Kasasa as well as several makeshift settlements , " he said .
Rebel leader General Laurent Nkunda said Thursday that he ordered a cease - fire for his forces because he wants start work with the U.N. mission in Congo , known by its French acronym MONUC , to allow people back to their homes .
" We are respecting our cease - fire . ...
We are waiting for the response [ to the corridor offer ] from the government and from MONUC , the U.N. forces , " Nkunda said .
" We want to have an agenda that we can discuss political issues with the government . "
Nkunda , a Tutsi , has repeatedly blamed the Congolese government for failing to protect the Tutsi tribe from Rwandan Hutu militia in Congo .
Hutu rebels have been active in the jungles of eastern Congo since Rwanda 's 1994 genocide , according to the United Nations .
The United Nations estimates that during the 100 days of the genocide in Rwanda , the Hutu majority killed 800,000 Tutsis and and moderate Hutus .
The top U.S. diplomat for Africa said Friday that she was encouraged that the deadly conflict wo n't grow into " something that looks like genocide . "
Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer spoke to CNN International by phone from Kigali , Rwanda , Congo 's neighbor , where she planned to meet Saturday with Rwandan President Paul Kagame .
Frazer , who visited Thursday with Congo President Joseph Kabila , was making diplomatic rounds to deliver a U.S. message : " We understand the need for the Rwandans and the Congolese to work together to try to end the human crisis that 's unfolded in North Kivu , as well as to cooperate together to address the negative forces in the eastern Congo . "
One of the negative forces , she said , is the National Congress for the Defense of the People rebel force led by Nkunda , which fought government forces for four days until a cease - fire was declared late Wednesday .
Frazer said she would impress upon Kagame the need for continued cooperation between Rwanda and Kabila 's government .
" Eastern Congo is very , very unstable right now .
...
There have been attacks and counterattacks between rebels and the Congo military , " she said .
Asked about the possible danger that the rebels could overrun Goma , Frazer said tensions seemed to be lessening .
" But I am growing confident that both President Kabila and President Kagame have been speaking to each other .
" They 've exchanged envoys .
...
They are engaged in the type of discussions that will be necessary to prevent such an attack on Goma as well as some type of ethnic reprisal that could lead to something that looks like genocide . "
Frazer said the United States also recognizes the limitations of MONUC , whose soldiers have lent support to Congolese troops .
The United States has said for some time that they need more troops and specialized forces , even for a limited time while diplomatic measures are being pursued , she said .
On Thursday , MONUC spokesman Kevin Kennedy said U.N. troops , numbering a few hundred , were struggling to keep the peace in Goma , a city of about 1 million people , and the surrounding countryside .

BOSTON  Last month , voters approved a statewide measure decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana .
Now , wary authorities say , comes the hard part .
They are scrambling to set up a new system of civil penalties before Jan. 2 , when the change becomes law .
From then on , anyone caught with an ounce or less of marijuana will owe a $ 100 civil fine instead of ending up with an arrest record and possibly facing jail time .
It sounds simple , but David Capeless , president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association , said the new policy presented a thicket of questions and complications .
One of the most basic , Mr. Capeless said , is who will collect the fines and enforce other provisions of the law .
For example , violators under 18 will be required to attend a drug awareness class within a year , but it is unclear who will make sure that they do so .
The fine increases to $ 1,000 for those who skip the class .
A complicating factor , said Mr. Capeless , the district attorney in Berkshire County , is that state law bans the police from demanding identification for civil infractions .
Oct. 22 , 2008  --
Scientists are planning to take advantage of global climate change and catch evolution in the act .
They hope to collect millions of seeds from wild plants over specific time intervals and , for the first time , document how individual plants adapt to changes in the climate .
" Changes in climate are already beginning to have detrimental effects on many species , and we want to understand that , " said evolutionary biologist Steven Franks of Fordham University , one of the leaders of the project .
The project is called the " Resurrection Initiative " because the goal is to provide future scientists with pristine seeds collected during this period of relatively rapid climate change .
Someday , those seeds could be planted alongside members of the same family so that changes could be documented , thus providing a better understanding of the fundamentals of evolutionary change .
This seed bank would be different from the many other existing banks , including the now - famous Svalbard Global Seed Vault on the island of Spitsbergen , Norway , where seeds are being collected from around the world to help preserve species that are now in danger of going extinct .
The purpose of the new bank would be basic science on evolutionary changes , with the possible goal of using that information to help stop some species from dying out , not simply replacing them after they are gone .
" It 's a perfect opportunity right now to understand how organisms evolved in response to changing conditions , " said Franks , indicating that there is some urgency in getting the project going on a broad scale as soon as possible .
Leading experts on various aspects of evolution , from an array of institutions across the country , are involved in the project .
The evolutionary seed bank is the brainchild of Arthur E. Weis , who is now at the University of Toronto .
Weis invited the experts to a meeting last year at the University of California , Irvine , when he was on the faculty there .
The meeting , sponsored by the National Science Foundation , resulted in a paper published in the October issue of the journal BioScience , outlining the project .
Funding has not yet been secured , but the NSF , which sponsors most academic research in this country , is clearly interested .
Evolutionary biologist Susan Mazer of the University of California , Santa Barbara , an expert on wild flowering plants and a member of the group , said one goal is to create baseline data " by collecting seeds at a given point in time and archiving them under ideal environmental conditions so that they all stay alive , and so that 10 , 20 and 30 years down the road , we can compare them to seeds that we collect in the future to see how the gene pool has changed . "
The genesis of the project actually dates back a few years ago when Franks , lead author of the paper , was Weis 's graduate student .
" We were both interested in looking at evolutionary responses to climate change , " Franks recalled .
Franks zeroed in on plant that thrives in southern California , Brassica rapa , or wild mustard .
He began collecting seeds from several areas , documenting where and when he collected then , and when the individual plants flowered -- some early in the season , some much later .
California went into a five - year drought , laying a perfect framework for studying whether that sudden climate change forced evolutionary changes in the plants .
At the end of that time , Franks collected seeds from the same plants , and then planted both the archived and the newly collected seeds in a controlled environment .
" There was an evolutionary shift to earlier flowering time following the drought , " Franks said in an interview .
Using the wide range of tools now available to geneticists , he was able to determine that the shift was reflected in the genes of the plants , or as biologists would say , the later plants selected ( mutations ) for earlier flowering .
It was n't a huge change , ranging from 1.9 days in one group of plants to 8.6 days in another .
The scientists call it a " microevolutionary change , " but it was significant .
Earlier blooming allows the plants to take advantage of a cooler spring , and thus produce stronger seeds that are more likely to survive in a drier climate .
It was clearly a case of capturing evolution in the act .
That is precisely the way evolution works .
Not giant leaps , but tiny steps .
However , what works for one plant may not necessarily work for another .
So the scientists want seeds from many plants to capture the many phases and directions of evolution .
" By rearing samples of ancestral populations , we could resurrect actual genotypes that existed centuries ago , " they state in their paper .
" Differences between modern and ancestral populations would directly document evolutionary change over known time intervals .
We call for an organized effort to accomplish what earlier naturalists did not : systematic collection and preservation of current genetic diversity for future analyses of evolution of phenotypes in conjunction with environmental change . "
It could be possible to begin the project on a limited scale , with very little funding , but the scientists believe that would waste precious time .
They want to start out on a large scale , involving many institutions and many different types of plants .
" The resurrection approach may be especially pertinent given current global climate change , which is occurring at rates and scales not seen for millennia , " they state in their paper .
In other words , the time to strike is now .
John McCain 's campaign tries on new messages like Paris Hilton tries on new shoes .
But since Sarah Palin entered the race , they 've managed to deliver at least one consistent rallying cry :
We are the ticket of small - town values .
Small - town mythology has become the cornerstone of Palin ’s pitch to voters .
She spoke about “ Main Streeters like me ” in the vice presidential debate and talked up “ Joe six - pack . ”
In her speech before the Republican National Convention , she told the audience that the nation grows “ good people in our small towns , with honesty , sincerity , and dignity . ”
Palin ’s speech channeled Thomas Jefferson , who wrote to a friend in 1785 , “ Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens .
They are the most vigorous , the most independent , the most virtuous , and they are tied to their country , and wedded to its liberty and interests by the most lasting bonds . ”
But the Jeffersonian portrait she sketched of rural America does n’t tell the whole story .
Palin did n’t touch on the fact that small towns are hemorrhaging young people , who grow up and leave in search of opportunity .
She did n’t mention that hope is scarce in some towns , as a 2008 survey ( pdf ) of rural Midwesterners completed by the University of New Hampshire ’s Carsey Institute found .
Only 15 percent of those asked to forecast the future of their communities believed life there would be better in 10 years .
Palin did n’t explain to the nation that small towns have fallen on hard times .
Nor did she promise rural Americans that a Palin vice presidency would mean a better future was on its way .
Because that was n’t really the point .
Palin peddles small - town nostalgia and an outdated image of the “ average American ” to cast shadows of doubt on her enemies , not to offer solutions to her friends .
The Wasilla gal is George Bush , the guy you ’d like to swill beer with , in fierce pumps and trendy glasses .
She embodies the same everyman appeal that Bush did and uses it to stoke the kind of fear and division that made Karl Rove a household name .
But at a time when the country is fighting two wars abroad and trying to piece the economy back together at home , can the politics of cultural resentment still turn the election for Republicans ?
Probably not .
To understand why , take a look back at the Republican National Convention , when McCain campaign manager Rick Davis told the Washington Post , “ This election is not about issues . ”
If it was , the McCain camp looked to be fighting a losing battle as the campaign entered the home stretch : An ABC News / Washington Post poll released Oct. 13 reported that 68 percent of likely voters preferred Obama ’s positions on the issues , with only 29 percent preferring McCain’s .
But the poll found those voters favored McCain ’s personal qualities over Obama ’s 61 percent to 34 percent .
The takeaway ?
McCain ’s best shot at the White House was to make the campaign a referendum on character .
You might think that would mean we’d be hearing a lot about McCain ’s dark days in Vietnam in these final weeks .
But instead , the campaign has shaped its character attacks almost singularly around the image of Sarah Palin .
They ’ve deployed Palin ’s small - town biography to tell the story of a fabled “ real America ” that the terrorist - friendly Obama , as Palin and others paint him , is n’t a part of .
At an Oct. 16 fundraiser in Greensboro , North Carolina , Palin declared that , “ the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit , and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America . ”
She went on that in these “ pro-America areas of this great nation …we find the kindness and the goodness and the courage of everyday Americans . ”
“ I bet bin Laden feels like a real asshole now , ” Daily Show host Jon Stewart responded on the following Tuesday ’s show .
“ What ?!
I bombed the wrong America ? ! ”
Stewart skewered Palin further saying , “ I guess if you ’re from New York City and you signed up to fight in Iraq and you died , I guess it does n’t count . ”
Palin ’s comments did n’t play much better beyond the Daily Show , either , and Palin eventually issued a half - hearted apology .
The fact is , most folks do n’t live in Palin ’s “ real America ” ; according to the New Republic , 84 percent of Americans live in the country ’s metro areas .
It 's true that rural voters play a disproportionate role in national elections .
Just look at in Ohio in 2004 , where they ignored pocketbook issues and handed George Bush the presidency because of his stances on issues like abortion and same - sex marriage .
Palin ’s job is to make sure rural voters put their values above their wallets again in 2008 .
But will they ?

Small - town America no longer looks like a place Republicans can easily clinch by devoting a little airtime to their opponent ’s Godless positions on abortion or gay marriage .
Robert P. Jones , president of Public Religion Research , told National Public Radio that those two hot - button wedges of 2004 are n’t even among religious voters ’ top five concerns this year .
With social issues taking a back seat to the economy , Republican dominance in rural areas is waning .
A late September poll by the Center for Rural Strategies showed McCain with a 10 - point lead over Obama in rural America .
The center 's newest poll , however , shows a dramatic shift .
Conducted in the first three weeks of October , the poll reports Obama leading McCain 46 percent to 45 percent among rural voters in 13 swing states .
Unlike past Democratic candidates , Obama has made a point of showing up in historically unfriendly territory , making sure rural swing voters hear his message .
Explaining to New York Times Magazine reporter Matt Bai how he won rural Nevada in the Democratic primary , Obama said , “ a lot of it just had to do with the fact that folks thought : Man , the guy is showing up .
He ’s set up an office .
He ’s doing real organizing .
He ’s talking to people . ”
According to Bai , Obama has 50 campaign offices in Virginia , 42 in Indiana , and 45 in North Carolina , all states his party usually writes off in national campaigns .
When he shows up , Obama appeals to rural voters with an economic message he 's been hitting for some time .
In July , for instance , he swung through rural Missouri on an economic tour , giving particular attention to his vision for the green economy of the future .
The McCain campaign , by comparison , has delivered a shaky economic message at best .
The economy simply is n’t what they want to talk about .
McCain adviser Greg Strimple Washington Post " href= " http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100303738_2.html?sid=ST2008100303878&s_pos= " target = " _blank " > told the Washington Post in early October , “ We are looking forward to turning a page on this financial crisis . "
But the page has not turned on our economic woes , and unfortunately for McCain , voters are interested in talking about it .
Nevertheless , McCain and Palin continue to push a campaign that celebrates the common man in lore more than substance .
Joe the Plumber , who has recently eclipsed Palin as the campaign ’s “ average ” sensation , is McCain ’s symbol du jour of the further economic pain a President Obama would impose on the country .
Yet Joe , at his current income level , would fare better under Obama ’s tax plan than McCain ’s , exposing deep imperfections in the relationship between McCain 's message and his policy .
McCain seized upon
Joe without vetting just as he seized upon Sarah , out of a belief that symbolism could trump candor .
Sarah Palin is indeed a powerful embodiment of a certain American story that has a tight hold on our imagination .
America was born as a nation of small towns , and we tend to celebrate presidential stories that originate there .
But that is no longer the America in which we live .
In 2008 , it 's a mistake to believe that there is only one quintessential American story or that Sarah ’s is any more American than Barack’s .

After the overwhelming response to the Hackit we posted about automated hard drive destruction last fall , we finally decided to test out some thermite hard drive destruction ourselves .
This has been done on The Screen Savers but they did not show up close results of the platters .
So , aluminum and black iron oxide were procured through eBay , and until it arrived we watched some YouTube videos that showed a lot of fire and no real results .
We decided to see what it would take to completely obliterate a drive .
With the amount of personal data stored on your computer , we all understand the importance of destroying the data that is stored on the platters of a hard drive before disposing of it .
There are many ways to destroy a hard drive ; software , physical disassembly , drills , hammers , magnets / electromagnets , and acid , but none are quite as outrageous and dangerous as thermite .
That ’s what we ’re going to do here today .
Follow along for pictures and videos of the results .
A couple different methods of containing the thermite above the hard drive were tried and we quickly found the best way is a clay flower pot with the drip tray for a lid .
An Altoids tin was also tried , but it burned up to quickly .
Molding a cement container was also attempted .
Since thermite is extremely hard to ignite , sparklers that were left over from the 4th of July were used , and offered a very reliable method of ignition .
Our goal was to completely destroy the drive while it was still in the computer case .
The theoretical application is to destroy the disk at a moments notice so it wo n’t fall into the wrong hands .
After testing multiple methods , placing about 1 pound of thermite in a clay flower pot and lighting from the drain hole in the bottom yielded the best results .
This could easily be placed in the 5.25 ″ bays above the drive .
A thermite reaction is a process in which the correct mixture of metallic fuels are combined with a metal oxidizer and ignited .
Ignition itself requires extremely high temperatures , but once ignited , thermite supplies its own source of oxygen .
It can potentially burn underwater when mixed properly .
Thermite is usually used to weld railroad ties together .
The most common thermite is “ black or blue iron oxide ( Fe3O4 ) , produced by oxidizing iron in an oxygen - rich environment under high heat ” and Aluminum ( Al ) .
Red iron ( III ) oxide ( Fe2O3 ) , commonly known as rust , can also be used .
There are many chemicals that can make thermite ; the mixtures used to make thermite therefore vary , causing confusing and changing mixture ratios .
Since the oxidation of one substance involves the reduction of another , this type of reaction is often called redox reaction .
In the following balanced reaction , 8 Al + 3fe3O4 = 4Al2O3 + 9 Fe +
Heat .
The element Al is oxidized , but Fe is reduced .
This reaction is also called a displacement reaction because Al displaces
Fe in the oxide .
Because of the nature of this reaction , the correct ratio of substances is important to ensure the optimum amounts of fuel ( aluminum ) and oxygen ( iron oxide ) within the mixture .
Thermite is very safe to handle because of the high ignition temperatures required , sparklers were used in this instance , however magnesium ribbon can also be used .
We think an electric pyrogen igniter would be a far better choice for ignition , instead of unreliable methods .
There are two important aspects to ensure a successful reaction .
Thorough / even mixing and smallest possible powder particle size .
If thermite is not adequately mixed , it may be difficult to ignite or maintain the reaction .
One problem when mixing thermite is the difference in weight between the aluminum and the iron oxide .
This causes them to separate out rendering the thermite useless .
The process used here with great success was five minutes in a rock tumbler .
Powder particle size is measured with a measurement called mesh .
Passing the powder through a mesh will determine the largest particle size , this reaction performs best with the smallest obtainable mesh size .
The mesh size for aluminum was 1200 mesh and black iron oxide was 300 mesh .
The total enthalpy or heat content released is - 3.677 kJoule per gram of Fe3O4 / AL thermite .
The ratio of Fe3O4 to aluminum powder by weight is about 3.22 to 1 , according to the reaction ’s stoichiometry .
The reaction photographed was 200 grams of Aluminum and 644 grams of black iron oxide yielding 2368 kJoules of heat .
This was more than was required to adequately destroy the hard drive , a smaller amount could have been used , and still destroyed the platters .
It would have even been better controlled , or better yet contained within the computer case .
What fun is that ?
Using thermite to destroy a hard drive is a very violent and destructive process .
Great care should be taken as the molten metal can splash and sputter for a long distance .
The reaction begins to sputter .
The thermite has just contacted the hard drive .
Things are really hot now !
Most of the reaction is completed .
The molten thermite , platters and most of the aluminum frame from the hard drive in the bottom of the case .
Above are the molten hard drive platters destroyed with 844 grams of thermite .
It takes about this much thermite contained directly above the drive to get the job done , if it is not you will just get a superficial fire .
Over all the destruction of the drive and platters was accomplished in all cases in a matter of seconds .
This is by far a guaranteed method of destroying data in a time of need .
We ’re pretty sure this will prevent most forensic data recovery methods .
Below is a video of Brainiac using thermite to burn cars and trying to stop the reaction with liquid nitrogen .
Here ’s the directors cut of the thermite video which contains 4 extra minutes :
Finally , please do not try this .
The new Concorde : Supersonic jet will get you from London to New York in just three hours
It is five years ago almost to the day that Concorde approached Heathrow airport under much fanfare and nostalgia on its last official flight before heading off into retirement .
In a move which for some people signalled a step backwards for technology , the Anglo - French aviation - engineering masterpiece touched down and with it the chance for people to experience supersonic air travel .
But now , an American firm is on the cusp of re-imagining the supersonic dream and confidently plans to have supersonic commercial aircraft back in the skies as a reality by 2015 .
The future :
It 's hoped the £ 47.5 million jet will be on the market by 2015
The Aerion Supersonic
Jet may not have the same grace and style and the size of the great Concorde , but the Aerion group are so sure that the plane will fly that they have pencilled in test flights for 2012 , with transatlantic testing to follow soon after .
Reaching a top speed of mach 1.6 the jet will once again put New York within three hours flight time of London .
The company are so confident in the design that they claim to have 50 interested parties , who have all paid the £ 150,000 deposit .
‘ It simply will change the way global business is conducted .
Flight times in general will be reduced about 40 percent , ’ says Jeff Miller , chief spokesperson for Aerion .
‘ Business and government leaders will be able to travel more in pursuit of opportunity .
And they will feel a lot better when they step off the airplane . ’
As everyone remembers Concorde was far from the budget airline options that are available now .
Historic : Concorde takes off for the last time from New York on October 24 , 2003
The Aerion Supersonic Jet will be no different .
‘ It ’s priced at £ 47.5 million - each , ’ explains Miller .
‘ To date , Aerion has more than 50 letters of intent secured by £ 150,000 deposits .
‘ The cost per nautical mile will be similar to today ’s large business jets . ’
The biggest advance in technology that the Aerion has improved upon Concorde is in its noise reduction ability .
Concorde was famously and some would say intentionally scuppered by jealous Americans who banned the plane from flying over U.S. territory at the speed of sound .
This immediately removed any advantage the small plane had over its larger competitors and ended the supersonic age before it had begun .
The Aerion aircraft can successfully fly at nearly the speed of sound without any significant noise impact and more amazingly has the ability to fly at mach 1.15 without emanating a sonic boom .

‘ This is due to the patented supersonic natural laminar flow ( SNLF ) technology that substantially reduces drag at supersonic as well as high - subsonic cruise speeds , ’ says Jeff Miller .
Despite the fact that the Aerion is obviously only ever going to be flown by those who can afford it , the very idea that commercial supersonic airliners are going back into the skies will please the enthusiasts .
‘ Aviation progress has always been synonymous with an increase in speed .
To be flying more slowly in this century than in the last seems like a step backwards . , ’ says Miller .
Admitting a huge debt of gratitude to Concorde , Miller impresses that the Aerion jet is a significant leap forward in aircraft technology .
Luxury :
The comfortable Aerion Jet will ferry private buyers at speeds of mach 1.6 , meaning New York will once again be within three hours flight time of London
‘ Concorde was a beautiful machine and a product of its time , but technology has moved forward and new designs such as the Aerion jet offer greater efficiency .
‘ Concorde was withdrawn due to high operating cost , which Aerion technology has successfully overcome , ’ says Jeff .
Aerion will start small but hope to have the technology and the capital to one day expand their operation beyond smaller aircraft to larger Concorde sized vehicles .
‘ With the success of the Aerion supersonic business jet , we expect to see supersonic flight becoming commonplace .
‘ With market acceptance it will be possible to fund the development of airliner variants , offering time savings to a much larger group of travellers , ’ says Jeff .
As incredible as it seems that Concorde was flying only five years ago , Aerion will be tearing across our skies in four , heralding a return to the skies of supersonic travel .
When Robert Tappan Morris was a graduate student at Cornell in 1988 , he had a clever idea : he would release a self - replicating program ( or " worm " ) onto the Internet , reportedly in an effort to highlight security problems in computer networks .
Morris 's worm exploited vulnerabilities in common computer systems , allowing it to propagate at will onto new computers via the Internet .
The worm was designed to use minimal computer resources , but in the wild its effect proved to be devastating .
Morris released his worm on November 2 , 1988 ( twenty years ago yesterday ) , directing instances of the program to report back to a host computer so that he could monitor its spread .
The epidemic spread faster than Morris had expected , aggressively infecting and reinfecting computers around the U.S. Infected computers became overloaded and unresponsive , causing system administrators to panic .
Within hours of its release , the worm had infected thousands of computers , and was n't nearly as well - behaved as Morris had hoped .
When Morris realized what was happening , he and a Harvard friend emailed information that would help stop the worm -- but it was too late , as email routes were already clogged ... by Morris 's worm .
System administrators and computer scientists banded together to fight the worm , disassembling the program and locking down its modes of transmission .
Others disconnected their systems from the Internet to avoid becoming infected .
Within two days the worm was largely eradicated , but Morris 's troubles were just beginning : he was eventually indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 , and the U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on the worm -- Morris had succeeded in focusing attention on computer security after all .
( The report actually begins with the text : " This is the first GAO report to be made available over the Internet .
GAO wants to know how many people acquire the report this way .
If you are reading this , please send mail to me swolff@nsf.gov and I 'll keep count for them .
Your name will not be saved or used . "
I have to wonder how many emails swolff@nsf.gov has gotten about the report over twenty years ! )
Pictured at left : the source code of Morris 's worm , on display ( in binary form on a 3.5 " floppy ) at The Computer History Museum .
Morris was sentenced to three years of probation , 400 hours of community service , a $ 10,050 fine , and the costs of his supervision .
Nearly twenty years after the worm was released , Morris is now a tenured professor at MIT ; his MIT homepage makes no mention of the worm .
To read more on the worm and its aftermath , check out a contemporaneous report by Bob Page written on November 7 , 1988 .
Network World also posted a nice retrospective of the worm last week .
RTM 's worm was also discussed at length in the classic Cyberpunk by Hafner and Markoff .

Where :
Turkey
What is it ?
Not to be confused with sports like bear wrestling , in which a man with huge balls goes up against a bear , camel wrestling is a Turkish sport in which two male camels slug it out .
The Tulu Camels are specially bred for the competition , and decked out with bells and colourful ornamentation .
They 're then sent into the ring with another camel to do battle over a hot camel - babe in heat .

The results are usually highly amusing .
Camels can win by either making their opponent fall , scream or gallop away in a comical leg - flapping manner .
Trainers try and install carious fighting methods in their camels .
These include wrestling from the right or left , tripping the other camel or one camel trapping the other 's head against its chest and then sitting down .
A camel 's grasp of advanced fighting practices is notoriously poor , however , and thus it seems they just clatter around , banging into each other until one topples over .
Origins :
Camel wrestling has been popular in the Aegean region of Turkey for centuries .
No one quite knows when it began , though some speculate it has been around since the caravan and nomadic periods .
We think that it began when two camel traders got bored and likely drunk .

Interesting Fact :
Because of the presence of a camel - babe , the male camels often get incredibly aroused , which culminates in a lot of viscous spittle and excitable urine being sprayed around the arena .
For some reason , ringside seats never sell that well .

" Imagine No Religion , '' the billboard message from the Freedom from Religion Foundation , has come to Harrisburg .
The invocation of John Lennon 's lyrics , set as if in stained glass , greets commuters along a busy city corridor at South Second and Mulberry streets .
The campaign to question religions value is focused mostly on state capitals so legislators will be aware they have a free - thought constituency , said Annie Laurie Gaylor , a co-president of the atheist and agnostic group .
The billboard , to be in place one month , went up Thursday .
Its unclear how much stir it will cause in Harrisburg .
The campaign has been to seven sites nationwide in the past year , and Gaylor said the only controversy to erupt was in Chambersburg , where the billboard was up for six months ending last spring .

NEW YORK , Nov. 15 ( UPI ) -- President - elect Barack Obama , in his first extended post - election interview , says one of his top priorities is preventing home foreclosures .
" We have not focused on foreclosures and what 's happening to homeowners as much as I would like , " Obama said in the interview to air Sunday night on " 60 Minutes , " the long - running CBS news show .

Asked about aid to the auto industry , Obama said he does not want to give car makers " a blank check . "
He added that a total collapse would be a disaster and the industry needs " a bridge loan to somewhere . "
Obama said he also plans to name at least one Republican to his Cabinet .
He said he has been spending time since the election reading Abraham Lincoln , who famously included many of his political enemies in his administration .
" There is a wisdom there and a humility about his approach to government , even before he was president , that I just find very helpful , " Obama said .
When interviewer Steve Kroft asked him if he has thought , since the election , " What did I get myself into ? "
Obama responded that he knows the challenges he faces are " enormous . "
He said his job between now and his inauguration is to get clear priorities and the right team for his administration .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices posted the biggest one - day dollar gain ever Monday as the dollar was punished by the government 's $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout plan and big investors scrambled to fill obligations as the October contract expired .
The October contract surged in afternoon trading , reaching as high as $ 130.00 - a more than $ 25 gain .
But it dropped back down to settle at $ 120.92 a barrel , up $ 16.37 from Friday 's close .
The gain eclipsed the $ 10.75 spike in oil on June 6 .
The rally reached a fevered pitch as the session neared its close , partly due to the fact that Monday was the last day of trading in the October oil futures contract , which typically results in volatile trading .
" A lot of the bullish factors that had been in this market that had been ignored are now coming home to roost , " said Peter Beutel , oil analyst at Cameron Hanover .
As of Tuesday , the front - month contract will be November , which settled up $ 6.62 to $ 109.37 .
Late - session spike :
Oil prices had been rallying throughout the day , but the late - day spike was due to investors covering their short positions as the October contract expired , according to Ray Carbone , a broker and trader at Paramount Options .
Short sellers bet the price of crude will fall , which helped send oil from nearly $ 120 a barrel late last month to near $ 90 at its lowest point .
Short sellers borrow crude at one price and then have to pay it back , at what they hope will be a lower price .
When the contract expired Monday , all those short sellers were forced to buy the October contract to pay back their debt , which sent the price of oil soaring .
Carbone seemed to think that it was one company that was responsible for most of the late - day surge .
" This is probably a position that could not be moved due to last week 's turmoil .
So it happened on the last day of trading for October , " said Carbone .
The surge in prices prompted one analyst to focus on how much of the market trades oil for investment purposes .
" It goes to show that we need to have our arms around the speculation , " said Beutel .
The investors who pushed up the price of oil Monday were the same " people who pushed us from $ 79 to over $ 147 . "
" It is all big investors , " added Beutel .
" When stocks , dollar go under pressure , they jump into oil and they do n't care who it hurts . "
Indeed , the role of intuitional investors and the issue of speculation in the oil market prompted a flurry of Congressional investigations when crude prices surged earlier this year .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the government agency that oversees the oil market , issued a statement late Monday saying it is " closely monitoring " the sudden jump in oil prices .
" We are working closely with NYMEX compliance staff to ensure that no one is taking advantage of the current stresses facing our financial marketplace for their own manipulative gain , " said CFTC Acting Chairman Walter Lukken in the statement .
As part of its investigation , the CFTC can compel testimony , under oath , and the production of information concerning the crude oil markets , including recent crude oil trading .
In addition , a handful of supply disruptions supported the oil market 's late - afternoon rally .
Refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast was still limited post - Hurricane Ike , violence in oil - rich Nigeria , and chatter of Saudi Arabia trimming production added fire to the rally , according to Andrew Lebow , a broker at MF Global .
As the price of oil is whipsawed by demand worries , Wall Street 's flailing crisis , investors are having a hard time grasping oil 's next move .
" Traders are trying to catch knives people are throwing from the top of buildings , " said Lebow .
Fed bailout : On Saturday , President Bush asked Congress for the permission to spend as much as $ 700 billion to purchase bad mortgage assets from already struggling financial institutions in an effort to shore up further losses as the credit crisis works its way through Wall Street .
The details of the government 's attempt to prop up the financial sector were still being negotiated , but the plan aims to stem any further losses on Wall Street and resume a flow of credit that has become frozen .
" The biggest news is that people are looking at the $ 700 billion plan as supportive of demand , supportive of the economy , " said Beutel .
" Everything we are looking at right now says demand has a chance to come back if the economy starts to strengthen . "
Oil prices had been trending lower on worries that demand was faltering but those concerns seem to be abating , according to one analyst .
" The fear has waned as far as the demand destruction " in the wake of the bailout news , said Neal Dingmann , senior energy analyst at Dahlman Rose .
" The bailout has really stabilized this market . "
The government plan " has put in some support levels in there , " at least temporarily , said Dingmann .
If the economy has a chance to recover , then the oil market hopes demand for energy would recover as well .
Weaker dollar : The Fed bailout " comes at a cost , the weaker dollar , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Alaron Trading .
Investors " will look to other currencies to park their money until this entire situation is defined . "
The money that the government was planning on spending as part of the proposal " is very debasing to the value of the currency , " said James Cordier , portfolio manager of OptionSellers.com .
Crude oil prices were rising as the value of the dollar fell , according to both Flynn and Cordier .
Crude oil is traded in U.S. currency around the globe , so as the dollar weakens , oil becomes more expensive in dollar terms .
The plan " sounds very inflationary at first blush , " said Cordier , and " it will be detrimental to the dollar while people sift through the intricacies of the bailout . "
However , while the surge of liquidity would devalue the dollar in the short - term , if the money for the bailout were " approved and spent , then we think the dollar would firm up , " said Cordier , as the bailout money helped restore confidence to the U.S. economy .
Demand :
As the nation 's economy softened and demand for energy fell off , oil prices have retreated from a record high of $ 147.27 a barrel , set on July 11 .
Oil prices have tended to decrease on signs of continued weakness for the economy and rally on signs of economic recovery .
The promise of increased liquidity in the nation 's economy was supporting oil prices .
" When the market was concerned that the economy was going to collapse , if nobody is lending anybody any money and there is no credit , there is not going to be a lot of energy demand , " explained Flynn .
While the promise of the Fed 's lifeline to the financial sector may prop up oil prices in the short term , Flynn and Cordier said oil prices were on a downward trend in the longer term .
" We have seen that these high prices are unsustainable , " said Flynn .
" People are going to be a lot more judicious with their energy use . "
Analysts said the bailout plan provided much - needed confidence at a critical moment , preventing crude oil prices from sliding even further .
However , " this knee - jerk reaction in commodities due to the U.S. dollar is short termed , " said Cordier .
" Demand for energy in the U.S. continues to be weak ; globally , demand is weak , too , " said Cordier .
Wild week , big moves :
As Wall Street was heaved around last week in a series of unprecedented shifts , so were oil prices .
After Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) announced bankruptcy , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) agreed to be purchased by Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) was resuscitated by a $ 85 billion loan from the government , oil prices decreased by more than $ 10 .
However , by Friday , oil prices gained back all of those losses and then some on speculation that the government 's proposed bailout plan for Wall Street would support the economy and bring demand for energy back to healthy levels .
On Sunday , federal regulators changed the status of Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) to bank holding companies , a move that opens the banks up to greater involvement in retail banking and more funding from the Federal Reserve .
The re-classification also means the investment firms will be under the Federal Reserve 's supervision .
Hurricanes : The Gulf Coast was still working to get back to full operation after hurricanes Gustav and Ike slammed the production and refinery - rich region .
According to the most recent situation report from the Department of Energy , 89.2 % of production in the region remained shut in and 75.4 % of natural gas production was still shuttered .
With 9 refineries in Texas still shut down , nearly 2.3 million barrels per day less oil have been processed in the region , according to the DOE .
As of Friday , personnel were still evacuated from 225 of 717 - or 31.4 % - of manned production platforms , according to a report from the Minerals Management Service .

Another AIG Resort ' Junket ' : Top Execs Caught on Tape KNXV discovers $ 343,000 secret gathering where AIG signs and logos were hidden .
November 10 , 2008  --
Even as the company was pleading the federal government for another $ 40 billion dollars in loans , AIG sent top executives to a secret gathering at a luxury resort in Phoenix last week .
Reporters for abc15.com ( KNXV ) caught the AIG executives on hidden cameras poolside and leaving the spa at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort , despite apparent efforts by the company to disguise its involvement .
" AIG made significant efforts to disguise the conference , making sure there were no AIG logos or signs anywhere on the property , " KNXV reported .
( click here to see the full KNXV report )
A hotel employee told KNXV reporter Josh Bernstein , " We can't even say the word [ AIG ] . "
A company spokesperson , Nick Ashooh , confirmed AIG instructed the hotel to make sure there were no AIG signs or mention of the company by staff .
" We 're trying to avoid confrontation , keep our profile low , " said Ashooh .
" Some of our employees have been harassed . "

" What do they have to hide , " asked Congressman Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) who said he had been promised by AIG CEO Edward Liddy that the company would stop such " junkets . "
" They came to us and said they were drowning and needed help .
A person who is drowning does n't jump up and start partying , " said Congressman Cummings .
Cummings said Liddy should resign as AIG CEO .
The AIG spokesman said Cummings " was mistaken " about the nature of the Phoenix event .
" It 's terrible , " said former AIG chairman Hank Greenberg .
" I do n't think the left hand knows what the right hand is doing there . "
AIG came under fire last month when Congressional investigators revealed its executives attended a seminar for independent insurance agents at another luxury resort , in Southern California .
The AIG spokesman said the meeting in Phoenix was for independent financial advisors and " was the kind of thing we have to do to run our business . "
Company officials confirmed the company spent an estimated $ 343,000 to sponsor the 2008 Asset Management Conference .
A spokesperson said much of the cost would be recouped from product sponsors at the conference .
KNXV said the president of AIG unit Royal Alliance Associates , Art Tambaro , stayed in a two - story Casita suite and worked out at the spa while others participated in seminars .
Tambaro and other AIG executives declined to comment when approached by KNXV .
The AIG spokesman said the Casita suite was provided for free by the hotel because it had booked so many rooms .
AIG confirmed that former football quarterback Terry Bradshaw had been scheduled to appear and sign autographs .
The company said it canceled Bradshaw 's appearance which was to have been paid for by another company that was a sponsor of the event .
AIG said it conducted a " top to bottom review " of expenses " to validate that only expenses required to ensure the meeting 's success are incurred . "
The president of the AIG Advisor Group , CEO Larry Roth declined to speak to KNXV .
A spokesman said the rooms at the luxury resort were made available at a discount rate of $ 189 a night .
The reports of the resort gathering came on the same day the U.S. Treasury announced it would invest $ 40 billion in AIG to bring the amount the federal government has put up to prevent the troubled insurance company from declaring bankruptcy to $ 150 billion .
" This action was necessary to maintain the stability of our financial system , " said Neel Kashkari , who heads the government 's bailout program .
" In return , " said Kashkari in a speech today , " AIG must comply with stringent limitations on executive compensation for its top executives , gold parachutes , its bonus pool , corporate expenses and lobbying . "
In addition to Roth and Tambaro , the AIG executives who spent last week at the Phoenix resort , according to KNXV , were Mark Schlafly , president and CEO , FSC Securities ' Gary Bender , senior vice president , Investment Advisory Services ; and Stuart Rogers , senior vice president .

A spokesman for Selfridges told the Guardian : " It 's vital that everyone bringing children to see Santa can be absolutely confident that the visit will be a happy one .
Unfortunately , this particular Santa did n't behave in line with his training or the standards we 've set so we acted swiftly and asked him to leave . "
A St. Louis company managing prescription benefits of 50 million people said Thursday it called the FBI to investigate an extortion plot threatening to expose personal information , including prescriptions , of millions of its clients .
Express Scripts said it has received an anonymous letter containing the names of some 75 clients that includes dates of birth , Social Security numbers and their prescriptions .
The letter threatens to expose millions of patient records if Express Scripts does not pay an undisclosed amount of money .
" We are cooperating with the FBI and are committed to doing what we can to protect our members ' personal information and to track down the person or persons responsible for this criminal act , " George Paz , the company 's president , said in a statement .
Paz added that , " as security experts know , no data system is completely invulnerable . "
The company said it has informed the 75 people whose data was breached , and has set up a website , esisupports.com to assist members .
The announcement comes shortly after three New Yorkers pleaded guilty to using hacked Citibank ATM card numbers and
PINs to steal $ 2 million from customer accounts .
Express Scripts said it received the letter in " early " October and is " unaware at this time of any actual misuse of any members ’ information . "
Federal district judge Dale A. Kimball has handed down the final judgment in the SCO case .
The decision dismisses SCO 's latest claims , grants declaratory relief to Novell , and sustains the court 's previous judgment that SCO owes Novell over $ 2.54 million ( plus interest ) for unjust enrichment .
SCO 's protracted legal shenanigan has been running for roughly five years now .
The company originally claimed that it owned the UNIX SVRX copyrights and that incontrovertible evidence had been uncovered that the open source Linux kernel was written using a significant amount of code that was misappropriated from SVRX .
In reality , SCO 's own internal audits of Linux source code turned up no evidence of copyright infringement ; meanwhile , Novell has turned out to be the rightful owner of the SVRX copyrights .
SCO managed to use its false claims to extract licensing revenue out of companies that were apparently uninterested in contesting its claims .
Novell took SCO 's claims to court and eventually triumphed , which pushed SCO off of the precipice and into bankruptcy .
Judge Kimball determined that SCO was subject to a contract with Novell , which it violated by lifting SVRX confidentiality provisions in a licensing agreement with Sun .
This move exceeded the authority granted to SCO under the terms of a 1994 asset purchase agreement that enabled SCO to sell limited SVRX licenses to third parties on behalf of Novell .
Judge Kimball also determined that SCO breached its fiduciary duty by neglecting to remit the requisite portion of the licensing revenue to Novell .
In addition to the $ 2,547,817 that SCO was originally ordered to pay to Novell in a previous judgment , SCO will also have to pay $ 918,122 in prejudgment interest and $ 489 per day from August 29 until November 20 .
SCO is in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings and does not presently have the resources to pay the amount in full .
A constructive trust has been established with $ 625,000 of SCO 's remaining resources .
SCO could still theoretically appeal , but it seems unlikely that the dying UNIX vendor can afford to do so .
Several of SCO 's attempts to reorganize have failed and a private equity firm that was in negotiations to resurrect SCO has backed away from the deal .
SCO 's own management has substantial doubts about the company 's future .
Despite all the legal decisions to the contrary , SCO 's number one man , Darl McBride , has continued to espouse his belief that Linux was built by stealing from UNIX .
Regardless of his opinion , SCO 's long battle is finally reaching a very undignified end .

Few people think of women as serial killers .
Perhaps this misconception is based on the stereotype of women being sensitive and compassionate .
For these brutal killers , sometimes the guise of nurturing helped them get in the door , but these ladies are just as depraved as their male counterparts .
1. Delphine LaLaurie
Estimated Body Count :
At least 10 ( but possibly as many as 90 )
Story : Delphine LaLaurie was the wife of a wealthy New Orleans physician in the early 1800s .
With long black hair and porcelain skin , all eyes focused on her when she threw glamorous parties .
Little did anyone know that the slightest mistake from a slave caused Madame LaLaurie to explode in rage .
She was charged with cruelty against one of her slaves — when the slave allegedly pulled her hair while brushing it , LaLaurie beat her mercilessly in the garden .
Another slave girl jumped to her death from a second floor window to escape Madame LaLaurie .
In 1834 , a fire ravaged the LaLaurie estate and after the firemen put out the flames , they smelled rotting bodies .
Pushing open the attic door , they were startled to see dead slaves chained to the walls , a woman with her lips sewn shut , half - dead slaves in cages , a man who received a forced sex change , women without skin , eviscerated slaves , and body parts strewn about the attic .
Capture :
The LaLauries escaped and were never seen again .
Years later , during renovations , contractors discovered the bodies of slaves that allegedly had been buried alive .
Punishment : None , though superstitious locals claim Madame LaLaurie suffers the otherworldly punishment of haunting her home , wailing for relief in French .
2. Juana " La Mataviejitas " 
Barraza
Estimated Body Count :
At least 10 ( but possibly as many as 40 )
Story : Juana Barraza ruled the Mexican women 's wrestling circuit as " The Silent Lady , "  but she became infamous for another moniker , " La Mataviejitas "  — the old - lady killer .
Starting in the 1990s , Barraza knocked on the doors of Mexico City 's elderly women , pretending to be a social worker .
Once inside , she grabbed a sock , piece of string or phone cord — whatever was handy — and strangled her victims to death ( until blood oozed from their ears ) .
Capture :
In 2006 , after strangling 82 - year - old Ana Maria Reyes with a stethoscope , Barraza fled from the scene , only to be captured close by .
Her prints matched those at 10 of approximately 40 crime scenes attributed to La Mataviejitas .
It took police a long time to find her because they were unsure if she was a man or a woman — or a man dressed as a woman , or a woman dressed as a man .
Her broad shoulders and the force she used to cause blood to seep from victims ' ears made police think she was a man .
Punishment : 759 years , though she may serve less than 50 years
3. Amelia " The Baby Farmer " 
Dyer
Estimated Body Count : Police found 12 babies linked to Dyer , but could only confirm she killed six .
They believed she murdered as many as 50 .
Story : In Victorian England , when a single woman found herself in a family way , she searched for a baby farmer , who raised the child .
In the late 1800s , women answered ads placed by Amelia Dyer , a married woman in her 50s who lived with her Christian husband in the Thames Valley region , and would raise the babies ( no one saw her husband because they were separated ) .
As soon as Dyer returned to her flat , she would strangle the infant .
Placing the baby in a bag , she dumped her victim into the Thames .
Capture :
As bargemen rowed across the river on March 30 , 1896 , they spotted a package .
When they opened it , they discovered a dead infant girl .
As the police examined the paper , they spotted a faintly written address .
Fearing the murderer would run , the police organized a sting operation where a female pretended to need Dyer 's services .
When Dyer opened the door for the woman , she found the police instead .
The police found 12 infants in the river , many with the same string around their necks .
Her house was full of baby items and as her crimes were publicized more women came forward saying they gave her their babies .
Punishment : Death .
On June 10 , 1896 , Dyer died by hanging at the Newgate Gallows .
4. Marie Noe
Estimated Body Count : Eight — although she had 10 children , two died of natural causes
Story : In 1948 , Philadelphia newlyweds Marie and Arthur Noe welcomed their first son , Richard , on March 7 .
On April 7 , Noe rushed her newborn to the hospital — he was n't breathing .
Doctors attributed it to sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) .
Noe had a second child , Elizabeth , in September 1950 .
In February 1951 , Noe returned to the hospital , clutching a dead infant .
SIDS again .
There were n't any marks on the child , broken bones , or bruises , or signs of neglect .
Year after year , Noe had a child and a few months later , she arrived at the hospital with a dead infant .
Nurses noticed
Noe never mourned her children .
After the birth of one of her sons , a nurse overheard Noe threaten him while trying to feed him , " If you do n't take this , I 'll kill you . " 
Some suspected foul play , but no one acted .
While giving birth to her last child , Arthur Joseph in 1968 , Noe had an emergency hysterectomy .
None of her children lived to age 2 .
Capture :
In 1998 , a reporter from Philadelphia magazine wrote a book and said Noe should be investigated because eight children from one family could n't all possibly die of SIDS .
When police interviewed her she admitted to smothering four of her children , but was n't sure what happened to the other four .
Punishment : She pleaded guilty in June 1999 .
She was sentenced to 20 years of probation with the first five years under house arrest .
5. Aileen Wuornos
Estimated Body count : 7
Story :
By the time Aileen Wuornos was in high school in Michigan , she was working as a prostitute .
After moving to Florida , she was married and divorced and spent time in jail for grand theft auto before she met Tyria Moore , a 24 - year - old motel maid .
Moore quit her job and Wuornos supported them by hooking .
When Wuornos met with Richard Malloy in 1989 , she shot him three times with a .22 caliber after he allegedly tried to rape her .
A few weeks later , police discovered another naked man shot to death with a .
22 .
In all , police found four more naked men , all murdered with a .22 , and a car of a man who was never found .
Capture : Wuornos and Moore were driving in a victim's car when they were in an accident .
The duo refused treatment even though Wuornos was bleeding .
After discovering the car belonged to one of the murdered men , the police circulated sketches of the women and began gathering evidence against Wuornos .
Authorities found some of Malloy 's possessions in a pawnshop with Wuornos ' thumbprints on them , and after a few weeks of surveillance , the police detained Wuornos on an outstanding weapons charge .
The investigators tracked down Moore , living with her sister in Pennsylvania .
They offered her immunity if she could convince Wuornos to confess , which she did .
Wuornos remained indignant and at her trial , she screamed belligerently .
Always her own worst enemy , she shrieked at Assistant State Attorney General Ric Ridgeway , " I hope your wife and children get raped . " 
Punishment : The State of Florida sentenced her to six death sentences ( police never found the body of Peter Siems and did n't charge her for the crime ) and she was executed by lethal injection on October 9 , 2002 .
6. Belle Gunness
Estimated Body Count : 40
Story :
As a 17 - year - old farmhand in Norway during the late 1800s , Belle Gunness learned she was pregnant by the son of the landlord .
Unwilling to marry her , he beat her until she miscarried .
He died a year later of an illness that resembled poisoning , and soon Gunness left for America .
Within three years of emigrating , she married Mads Sorenson .
In 1890 , Mads became violently ill and died — his death occurred on the only day two life insurance policies on him overlapped , netting his wife $ 8,500 .
A physician suspected strychnine poisoning , but the family doctor claimed he treated Mads for an enlarged heart and that caused his death .
Belle took the money and moved to LaPorte , Indiana , where she married Peter Gunness in April 1900 and became stepmother to his children .
Soon his young son died ( mostly likely caused by poisoning ) while he was alone with Belle .
In December 1900 , an iron meat grinder fell and cracked open Peter 's skull .
Soon after , suitors began arriving with money in hand to marry Belle Gunness and pay off her mortgage .
Man after man arrived , always leaving Gunness in the middle of the night .
When Gunness secured the money from her potential lovers , she killed them , dismembered them , and buried them in the yard .
It was suspected she might have fed some to the pigs .
Capture : None .
Gunness fired her handyman , Ray Lamphere — who was often seen digging holes around the house and in the pigpen .
She told her lawyer that Lamphere threatened to kill her and her children and burn down her house .
On April 28 , 1908 , fire broke out at the Gunness farm and authorities found four bodies in the basement — all decapitated .
Neighbors said the body was n't her ; Gunness was about 5 ' 8 and 200 pounds and the headless corpse was about 5 ' 3 and 150 pounds .
Later police found a piece of bridgework , which Gunness ' dentist said was hers , but there was no conclusive evidence she died there .
The police dug up the yard and found body parts from as many as 40 different people .
Police confirmed the decapitated bodies were Gunness ' children and stepchildren .
Soon families arrived in LaPorte , claiming their loved ones came to Gunness ' farm to marry her and never returned .
Punishment : None
7. Delfina and Maria de Jesus Gonzales
Estimated Body count : 91 ( 80 women and 11 men )
Story :
In the early 20th century , Delfina and Maria ran Ranchero El Angel , a bordello in Guanajuato ( 200 miles north of Mexico City ) .
The two recruited prostitutes with help wanted ads in the local paper .
When a woman became ill , lost her looks , or was worn out , the sisters killed her , dismembered her , and buried her on the property .
If a wealthy john arrived , the duo would kill him and keep his money .
Capture :
In 1964 , police raided what had become known as " the Bordello from Hell , " dug up the yard , and discovered the bodies .
Punishment : Each received 40 years in prison .
8. Enriqueta " The Vampire of Barcelona "  Marti
Estimated Body Count :
At least 12
Story :
In the late 1800s and early 1900s , when wealthy Barcelona residents wanted help with love or a cure for TB or syphilis , they visited Enriqueta Marti , who sold expensive curatives .
Meanwhile , Marti lured children to her home .
Before killing them — she used the rendered fat , bones , skin , muscles , and hair in her elixirs — Marti often prostituted the children .
Capture :
In March 1912 , two young girls , Angelita and Teresita , escaped from Marti's flat and told the police they witnessed Martin butchering a young boy .
Police searched Marti's properties and found body parts , jars of blood , fat , and recipe books written in Marti's hand , specifying the horrific ingredients she used in her potions .
Punishment : Marti's cellmates killed her before she went to trial .

The World Wide Web a term coined by the British technologist Kevin Ashton , is poised to revolutionize our understanding and interaction with our physical world .
Low power tags and microchips will allow all sorts of things to be connected via the web and servers .
Physical things are going to seamlessly connected to the Internet , spawning changes to our lives .
Here is how the Internet of Things will change the lives of city dwellers .
For several years now , we 've been hearing how the economy has n't rebounded after the last recession the way it has in the past .
People are buying less , and while jobs have returned , many of them are part time or at lower pay scales .
Economists have been using various models to explain why this is happening and why it might be something permanent .
What 's not being spoken about much , however , is the impact that technology is having on the economy , and why it 's acting as an anchor , dragging down both productivity and job creation .
It 's simple - Americans have less disposable income than they had prior to the invention of cable TV , smart phones and the Internet , because these new services cost so much .
The Simple Dollar explained it recently , most Australians , they said , have managed to keep up with inflation - relatively speaking they make as much as they have over the past several decades , compared to what things cost .
The problem is , they now have less to spend on consumables due to using their income for non-essentials such as cable television , Internet access , and more recently , smart phone service .

Psychological Effects of Partner Abuse Against Men : A Neglected Research Area
Denise A. Hines and Kathleen Malley - Morrison
Boston University
This article discusses the research on abuse against men in intimate relationships with a primary focus on the effects of this abuse .
We begin by discussing the incidence of physical aggression against men , then address methodological and conceptual issues associated with the incidence data .
We next review studies assessing the effects of aggression against men and discuss ways in which this research can be furthered and improved .
Finally , we discuss why men would choose to stay in these relationships and consider the scant research on emotional abuse against men .
In the early 1970s , the abuse of wives by their husbands finally gained the recognition and attention it deserved in the academic community and the public .
This recognition was long overdue , as wives tend to be victimized by their husbands at an alarming rate .
For example , according to the U.S. Department of Justice , in 1994 , 900,000 women were the victims of assault by an intimate partner ( Craven , 1997 ) .
Nationally representative surveys show an even bleaker picture :
In their 1975 survey of American families , Straus and Gelles ( 1986 ) found that , among wives reporting violence from their husbands in the previous year .
12.1 % said that they had been the victim of some sort of violence and 38 % reported that they had been the victim of severe violence .
This rate of severe violence toward wives equaled 2.1 million wives nationwide .
In their 1985 resurvey , Straus and Gelles found an apparent decline in the incidence of wife beating .
Specifically , there was a 27 % decrease in the rate of severe violence by husbands , which translated into 432,000 fewer cases of severe violence against wives .
Although the severe assault of 1.6 million wives is still not acceptable , Straus and Gelles argued that this apparent decline may have been the result of the increased attention that wife beating had received and the consequences that had been instituted for men who assault their intimate partners .
The effects of abuse against women are significant .
For instance , many women who are the victims of either minor or severe assaults by their intimate partners are physically injured .
Specifically , in Straus ’s 1985 nationally representative survey , 7.3 % of the women who reported being severely assaulted by their spouses needed to seek medical attention ( Stets & Straus , 1990 ) .
Similarly .
Makepeace ( 1986 ) found in a study of dating couples that 7.7 % of women sustained a moderate or severe physical injury as a result of the violence they experienced .
Cascardi , Langhinrichsen , and Vivian ( 1992 ) found even graver statistics : 15 % of the women who reported experiencing minor spousal abuse and 11 % of the women who reported experiencing severe spousal abuse reported suffering broken bones , broken teeth , or injury to a sensory organ .
In addition to these physical consequences , most abused women also suffer psychological consequences as well .
For example , abused women have been shown to experience fear and anxiety responses ( Follingstad , Wright , Lloyd , & Sebastian , 1991 ) ; depression ( Cascardi et al. , 1992 ; Stets & Straus , 1990 ) ; stress and psychosomatic symptoms ( Stets & Straus , 1990 ) ; posttraumatic stress symptoms such as intrusive memories , psychogenic amnesia , sleep problems , eating problems , hypervigilance to danger cues , exaggerated startle responses , irritability or anger responses , and psychosomatic symptoms ( e.g. , gastrointestinal problems , headaches , and chronic illnesses ; Walker , 1993 ) ; alcohol and drug abuse ( Kilpatrick , 1990 ) ; and low self - esteem and suicidal , self - destructive , self - mutilating , and assaultive behaviors ( Carmen , Ricker , & Mills , 1984 ) .
Although there is a substantial research literature addressing abuse against women and its consequences , the flip side of this issue , physical abuse against men and its consequences , is a less researched area .
Many of the previous1y cited studies provided some statistics on the rate of wives physically abusing their husbands , but there has been almost no research on the consequences of this type of abuse .
In this article , we will first review data on the prevalence of violence directed at husbands by wives .
Although the exact rate of this abuse is open to debate , we argue that there are enough male victims of violence by their wives to warrant attention to the consequences of that violence .
Next , we discuss the scant research that has been done on the consequences of this type of abuse and argue that more rigorous research is needed .
Finally , we discuss two areas that have received even less attention : ( a ) why men stay in abusive relationships and ( b ) emotional abuse against men and its effects .
Although at times throughout this article we consider the relative effects of abuse against men versus abuse against women , we are not arguing that the two forms of abuse can be equated .
Previous investigations considering violence by women as well as against women are included in our review because they are among the few studies actually providing data on the incidence and effects of abuse against men .
We do not doubt that in a society in which men are economically , socially , and politically dominant over women , women typically suffer more physically and psychologically from male - female violence than men do from female - male violence .
Although it seems as if the debate until now has been about who the greater victims are , men or women , the research has made it clear that , on average , women are the more devastated victims of spousal abuse because of the relative size of men and women and because of the above - mentioned social structure .
However , evidence that women are injured more seriously and more often does not mean that the male victims of intimate violence should be ignored .
It is our view that because many men are being victimized in their intimate relationships , the effects of this victimization are worth exploring .
Incidence of Physical Abuse Toward Men
Incidence reports of women abusing their husbands have appeared since the study of family violence began in the early to mid-1970s .
For example , in Gelles ’s ( 1974 ) groundbreaking study on domestic violence , he found that , in his clinical sample , “ the eruption of conjugal violence occurs with equal frequency among both husbands and wives ” ( p. 77 ) .
He also presented the following statements of women who abuse their husbands :
He would just yell and yell  not really yelling , just talk loudly .
And I could n’t say anything because he kept talking .
So I ’d swing .
( p. 76 )
I spent all that time by myself and sometimes the kids would get on my nerves ... so when I got mad I hit him .
( p. 76 )
I probably had no reason to get angry with him ... but it was such a bore .
I was trying to wake him up , you know .
He was such a rotten lover anyway .
So I 'd yell at him and bit him to stir him up .
( p. 151 )
Since Gelles ’s ( 1974 ) study , information regarding rates of violence by wives has come from several different sources .
First , crime statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice showed that in 1994 , 167,000 men were the victims of assault by an intimate partner ( Craven , 1997 ) .
Crime surveys , however , are assumed to provide low estimates of intimate violence against both men and women because many people are unwilling to label the physical violence they receive at the hands of an intimate partner a crime .
This reluctance may be even more pronounced for men than for women because men are supposed to be the physically dominant and aggressive partner : consequently , admitting to being victimized by a woman and labeling it a crime may be viewed as emasculating ( Steinmetz , 1977 ) .
A second source of data on violence by wives is the National Violence Against Women Survey , in which 8,000 men and 8,000 women were randomly telephoned and interviewed about their experiences with violent victimization .
This survey found that 7 % of the men reported being physically assaulted by a current or former wife or cohabitating partner over the course of their lifetime .
In addition .
0.8 % of the men reported being physically assaulted in the previous year ( Tjaden & Thoennes , 2000 ) .
This survey also may have underestimated the amount of violence against men because the respondents were told that they were being interviewed about “ personal safety ” issues , and many men may not have viewed the violence they received at the hands of their wives or girlfriends as a threat to personal safety .
A final source of data on violence against men is studies using the Conflict Tactics Scale ( CTS ; Straus & Gelles , 1986 ) , the most well known of which are the National Family Violence Surveys conducted in 1975 and l985 .
Using data from the National Family Violence Survey of 1975 , Straus ( l980 ) found that 11.6 % of the husbands reported having experienced some sort of violence from their wives within the previous year .
Moreover , 4.6 % ( 2.6 million nationwide ) of husbands reported having been the victim of severe violence by their wives .
Severe vio1ence was defined as behaviors , such as kicking , punching , beating , or using a knife or gun , that have a high probability of causing physical injury .
Wives indicated that they had committed a median of three violent acts per year and tended to throw things at or kick their husbands as their “ favorite ” form of abuse .
Straus stated that he decided to present these findings on husband beating to show that violence cannot be understood in terms of a single factor , such as sexisrn , aggression , lack of self - control , or mental illnesses , as previously asserted .
In l985 , Straus and Gelles replicated their 1975 National Family Violence Survey .
Of 6,002 couples surveyed , 12.4 % of the husbands reported some level of physical assault by their wives in the previous year .
In addition , 4.8 % ( again 2.6 million nationwide ) reported being the victim of severe violence .
These numbers are particularly striking because , as mentioned previously , there was an apparent decline in the rate of wife beating from the previous national survey , but the rates of violence against husbands remained approximately the same ( Straus & Gelles , 1985 ) .
Straus ’s reports ( Straus , 1980 ; Straus & Gelles , 1988 ) of this high rate of violence by wives have been challenged on methodological and conceptual bases .
The methodological attacks on the results of the National Family Violence Surveys have focused primarily on the CTS , which was used in both studies .
Criticisms of the CTS include the following :
Respondents are asked about psychologically and physically aggressive acts in the context of conflicts ; violence against women , critics argue , often occurs outside of any conflict between partners ( e.g. , Marshall & Rose , 1988 ) .
Respondents are not asked about the effects of those aggressive acts , but , because of differences in size and strength , it is likely that women are more seriously injured from aggressive behaviors such as hitting and punching than men are from those same acts ( e.g. , Ferraro & Johnson , 1983 ; Marshall , 1992 ) .
Respondents are not asked about their motivations for aggressive acts .
This omission is important because women ’s aggression may be only in self - defense ( e.g. , Pleck , Pleck , Grossman , & Bart , 1977 - 1978 ) .
Supporters ( e.g. , Dobash & Dobash , 1988 ) of the first major criticism of the CTS  that it requests frequencies of specific nonaggressive and aggressive behaviors within the context of conflict  point out that much of male violence against women is arbitrary , unpredictable , and unrelated to any identifiable conflict .
Although it is clearly correct that not all violence occurs in the context of an immediate conflict , there is no evidence that either women or men will refrain from reporting a slap , punch , or beating merely because it seemed to come out of nowhere .
It seems likely that the introduction to the CTS , which emphasizes that all couples have conflicts and may use a variety of conflict tactics , makes it easier rather than more difficult for respondents to discuss the extent to which they have experienced each of the aggressive behaviors presented .
The second major methodological attack on the CTS emphasizes that superficially comparable acts , such as hitting and punching , can have much more injurious consequences when perpetrated by a man against a woman than when perpetrated by a woman against a man .
The critics are correct on this issue :
On average , women are injured more frequently and more severely at the hands of their husbands than men are at the hands of their wives ( e.g. , Cascardi et al. , 1992 ; Makepeace , 1986 ; Stets & Straus , 1990 ) .
However , the fact that men can be injured at the hands of their significant others and that many times they are injured severely , should not be ignored .
Finally , in addressing the third point raised by critics , that violence by wives is mostly in self - defense , Straus and Gelles ( 1988 ) noted that the “ meaning and consequences of that violence is easily misunderstood .
...
The same act is likely to be very different in the amount of pain or injury inflicted .
... [ Many ] of the assaults by women against their husbands are acts of retaliation or self - defense ” ( p. 19 ) .
Data from several studies on violence by battered women support this proposition ( e.g. , Saunders , 1986 ; Walker , 2000 ) .
Although we acknowledge that most battered women use violence in self - defense , the bulk of the research on motivations for violence in intimate relationships has shown that self - defense is not the motivation for women ’s violence in the majority of cases .
For instance , Follingstad et al. ( 1991 ) found that the major reasons reported by college women for using physical force against their partners were not attempts at self - defense but rather efforts to show anger , to retaliate for emotional hurt , to express feelings that they had difficulty communicating verbally , and to gain control over the other person .
Jealousy ( Makepeace , 1981 ) , anger , and confusion ( Cate , Henton , Koval , Christopher , & Lloyd , 1982 ; Henton , Cate , Koval , Lloyd , & Christopher , 1983 ) have also been cited as frequent motivations for violence among male and female college students .
Although women cited self - defense as a motivation significantly more often than men did , it was never the most cited motivation for violence by either sex .
In addition , other researchers have found that dominance and control are primary motives for female violence ( Felson & Messner , 2000 ; Rouse , 1990 ) , whereas still others have found that a high need for affiliation , when combined with life stress and low activity inhibition , is a strong motive for female violence ( Mason & Blankenship , 1987 ) .
In addition to the research on motives , other data from the 1985 National Family Violence Survey also fail to provide support for the interpretation that women ’s violence is mostly in self - defense .
Specifically , Straus and Gelles ( 1988 ) asked respondents who hit whom first and found that in 42 % - 45 % of cases , the wife hit first ( the differences in the percentages is a function of who reported , the wife or the husband ; these two numbers ate not significantly different from each other ) , whereas in 44 % - 53 % of cases , the husband hit first .
Although critics have argued that many times abused women will initiate their own violence to control the timing and place of violence by men , it appears that not all violence by wives can be considered simply a form of self - defense or retaliation .
Proponents of the usefulness of the CTS ( e.g. , Straus and his colleagues ) generally acknowledge that although , like all instruments , it is imperfect , there is good support for its reliability and validity as a measure of aggression in close relationships .
Moreover , despite the criticisms , it continues to be the most widely used measure of aggression in family and other intimate relationships and continues to provide powerful data concerning violence by and against women .
Although data on motivations for and effects of violence are crucial to processes of understanding , education , and intervention , Straus ( 1990 ) has made a powerful argument that motivations and effects are variables that should be studied as part of investigations of violence but should not be incorporated into the operational definition of violence .
Even Walker ( 1990 ) .
a strong critic of the CTS , has argued that when collecting data on violence and abuse , “ it is important to be precise in describing the actual acts that occur ” ( p. 23 ) , which is precisely what the CTS was constructed to do .
There has been some recognition by researchers who do not use the CTS that husband abuse may indeed be a problem that can be characterized as a serious social concern .
For instance , while treating the clients of a male batterers ’ program , Stacey , Hazlewood , and Shupe ( 1994 ) found that many of their cases were actually cases of mutual abuse .
They found that many couples tended to be mutually abusive and that the roles of victim and perpetrator were constantly shifting .
In addition , when studying responses of police officers in their study , Stacey et al. reported that the police would arrest the man as the batterer if the woman were the abuser because there was no counseling program for violent women available .
The police hoped that , by arresting the man , they could get the couple into a program .
The assumption was that if they arrested the wife , no counseling would be mandated and the husband would generally drop the charges .
However , because the man was arrested , he had to sign a statement that labeled him as the violent perpetrator .
This lack of help for women who abuse their husbands is quite common .
Indeed , one woman in Stacey et al . ’s sample remarked on the recovery of her battering husband by stating , “ [ Now ] he tries to understand my side of the argument .
He talks to me rather than hits me .
I still hit him , however .
I would like to enroll in a class in anger management , but the [ local ] shelter for battered women does not help women with this problem ” ( p. 63 ) .
Several studies have indicated that violence by women may be increasing .
For example , in a longitudinal study of 272 newlywed couples , O’Leary et al. ( 1989 ) found the following : Before marriage , 44 % of the women reported that they used physical aggression against their partners ; at 18 months after marriage , 36 % of the wives reported that they used aggression against their spouses ; and at 30 months after marriage , 32 % of the wives reported that they used aggression against their spouses .
This rate is 3 - 4 times that found in the 1975 and 1985 National Family Violence Surveys .
In addition , at each of these three time periods , the women were more likely to be stably aggressive , whereas the husbands were more likely to be stably nonaggressive .
O’Leary et al. also found that although 41 % - 57 % of the time any violence experienced was mutual , the differences between wife - only violence and husband - only violence were noteworthy .
Specifically , in 8 % - l3 % of the violent marriages , the husband was the sole perpetrator of the abuse , whereas in 16 % - 26 % of the violent marriages , the wife was the sole perpetrator .
Similarly , in the longitudinal National Youth Survey of 1,725 young adults , Morse ( 1995 ) found that across four time periods , 27.9 % - 48.0 % of the female partners perpetrated violence against their male partners .
In addition , 13.8 % - 22.4 % of the women perpetrated severe violence .
These rates for minor physical violence are 2 - 4 times greater than the rate found in the National Family Violence Surveys , and the rates for severe physical violence are 3 - 5 times greater .
When analyzing the dynamics or the relationships , Morse found that ( a ) between 48.5 % and 58.5 % of the violent couples were mutually violent ; ( b ) men were the sole perpetrators in 9.9 % - 13.9 % of the couples ; and ( c ) women were the sole perpetrators in 29.7 % - 37.7 % of the couples .
These results are similar to those of O’Leary et al. ’s ( 1989 ) study .
Finally , Morse ( 1995 ) asked the respondents in one of the assessment periods to report who used violence in the last most serious argument they had with their spouse .
Men were 2 times more likely than females to say that only their partner used violence , and women were 3 times more likely than men to say that only they used violence .
Finally , in a study that looked specifically at physical abuse against male college students , 40 % of those males surveyed reported that they were the recipient of physical aggression from their girlfriends , and 29 % reported that they received serious physical abuse at the hands of their girlfriends ( Simonelli & Ingram , 1998 ) .
Again , these rates are 3 - 6 times greater than those found in the 1975 and 1985 National Family Violence Surveys .
These studies show that female - perpetrated violence does indeed exist in relationships and cannot always be dismissed as merely self - defense .
Although women are more likely than men to use violence in self - defense , many women acknowledge that they have other motives for violence against their partners .
In addition , whereas self - defense may be a major motivation for many women in mutually violent relationships , violence in the 16% - 38 % of violent couples characterized by female - only violence is obviously not a matter of self - defense .
Many women report themselves to be capable of perpetrating violence against their partners , and the ramifications of this violence are worth exploring .
Effects of Physical Abuse Against Men
Physical Injuries and Death
The majority of studies that have assessed the victimization of men in marriages have compared these men to abused women .
Researchers mostly have attempted to ascertain whether abused women experience more physical injuries than abused men .
However , in this article we consider only the rate of physical injuries among men .
Overall , as previously stated , the studies have clearly shown that abused women are at higher risk for physical injury than abused men .
It should be emphasized , however , that these studies have also shown that abused men are at risk for physical injury as well .
For instance , Cascardi et al. ( 1992 ) found that 2 % of the men who reported experiencing minor or severe spousal abuse reported suffering broken bones , broken teeth , or injury to a sensory organ .
Similarly , Makepeace ( 1986 ) found that 2.2 % of the males in his sample of 2,338 students reported sustaining a moderate or severe physical injury as a result of the dating violence they experienced .
Finally , in an analysis of the results from the 1985 National Family Violence Survey , Stets and Straus ( 1990 ) found that 1 % of the men who reported being severely assaulted needed medical attention .
The results of these studies are logical , considering the relative size of the average man compared with the average woman .
Obviously , men can inflict more harm with their fists than women can , and they are more able to restrain an abusive partner than women are .
Some researchers , however , have pointed out that sometimes women may even the score by throwing things that could hurt their partners ( e.g. , dishes , boiling water , or a frying pan ) or by brandishing a weapon ( Langley & Levy , 1977 ) .
Perhaps this explanation is a reason why Morse ( 1995 ) and Makepeace ( 1986 ) .
compared with the injury rates in the previously mentioned studies , found even higher rates of injury among men .
Specifically , depending on the time period , 10.4 % - 19.6 % of the abused men in Morse ’s study sustained some type of injury at the hands of their wives ( Morse , 1995 ) .
Similarly , Makepeace ( 1986 ) found that 17.9 % of the abused men in his sample sustained a mild or moderate injury .
These rates of injury for abused men are noteworthy because they confirm that men can be injured by women .
In addition , although sources vary in reported frequencies of different forms of violence , it is clear that the effects of women ’s violence against men , like those of men ’s violence against women , can be lethal .
For example , using data from the Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ’s ) Uniform Crime Reports , Supplemental Homicide Report ( 1994 ) to analyze homicides between marital partners in the United States from 1976 through 1985 , Mercy and Saltzman ( 1989 ) found that “ husbands and wives were nearly equal in the risk of spouse homicide victimization ” ( p. 597 ) .
Whereas Mercy and Sa1tzman focused on marital partners , Browne and Williams ( 1993 ) analyzed a broader set of relationships and noted that FBI Uniform Crime Reports , Supplemental Homicide Report data for 1980 - 1984 indicated that “ whereas only 12 percent of male homicide victims were killed by a female partner , over one half  52 percent  of all women murder victims were killed by male partners ” ( p. 81 ) .
More recently the 1994 Uniform Crime Reports , Supplemental Homicide Report revealed that , in 1994 for homicides in which the victim - offender relationship was known , 31 % ( 1,394 ) of female victims over the age of 12 and 4 % ( 669 ) of male victims over the age of 12 were killed by an intimate .
Although most of these statistics indicate that women are more likely to be killed by an intimate than men are , it can not be denied that a substantial number of men are being murdered by their female partners  and , although some of these murders are undoubtedly in self - defense , there is no evidence that all of them are ( e.g. , Mann , 1988 ) .
Psychological Effects
Because men tend to be at low risk of physical injury at the hands of their female partners , the most fruitful avenues to pursue in research exploring the effects of abuse against men are the psychological effects .
The bulk of the research that has been done on the psychological effects of physical abuse against men has compared abused men to abused women on various psychological outcomes .
These studies certainly have been valuable in highlighting the potential consequences of this abuse on men .
In a study comparing the psychological effects of physical abuse on men and women , Follingstad et al. ( 1991 ) found that , following physical abuse , approximately 75 % of the abused men reported experiencing anger ; nearly 40 % reported being emotionally hurt ; nearly 35 % reported experiencing sadness or depression ; nearly 30 % reported seeking revenge ; nearly 23 % reported feeling the need to protect themselves ; approximately 15 % reported feeling shame or fear ; and approximately 10 % felt unloved or helpless .
In addition , in her longitudinal study , Morse ( 1995 ) found that 9.5 % of the younger males and 13.5 % of the older males reported experiencing fear in their violent relationships .
Stets and Straus ( 1990 ) researched the extent and severity of depression , stress , and psychosomatic symptoms manifested in both rnale and female abuse victims .
For both abused men and abused women , the higher the level of violence experienced , the more severe the depression , stress , and psychosomatic symptoms .
In addition to comparing abused men to abused women , Srets and Straus also used a more appropriate comparison group , nonabused men .
They found that abused men were significantly more likely to experience psychosomatic symptoms , stress , and depression than nonabused men  a result similar to that of Cascardi et al. ( 1992 ) .
who found that abused husbands had significantly greater levels of depression than nonabused husbands .
In a study that specifically addressed the issue of abuse against men , Simonelli and Ingram ( 1998 ) assessed psychological distress and depression among college men experiencing emotional or physical abuse in their present or most recent relationships .
They found that 90 % of their sample reported experiencing emotional abuse , 40 % reported experiencing physical abuse , and 29 % reported experiencing severe physical abuse .
Psychological distress and depression were significantly greater in men who reported being the recipient of either physical or emotional abuse than in men reporting no abuse .
In addition , being physically abused predicted 37 % of the variance in depression , whereas being emotionally abused predicted 14%- 33 % of the variance in depression ( depending on the emotional abuse scale used ) .
Finally , being emotionally abused predicted 15 % - 16 % of the variance in psychological distress .
Thus , abused men appear to be at substantial risk for experiencing depression and psychological distress .
In sum , the results of these studies show that abused men are at risk for emotional hurt , fear , helplessness , anger , revenge seeking , sadness , shame and humiliation , depression , stress , psychological distress , and psychosomatic symptoms .
However , these studies have a number of major weaknesses .
First , the researchers focused primarily on internalizing symptoms , which women experience at two times the rate of men in the population as a whole ; they did not examine more externalizing symptoms , such as alcoholism , that are more characteristic of a man ’s reaction to stressful events ( e.g. , Comer , 1992 ) .
Second , they also did not assess other symptoms that have been found to be prevalent in women who are abused , such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ; Walker , 1993 ) , and suicidal , self - destructive , self - mutilating , and assaultive behaviors ( Carmen et al. , 1984 ) .
Third , because the focus of many of these studies was the relative victimization of abused females to abused males , they did not specifically address the psychological consequences of physical abuse against men .
To gain a clearer picture of the consequences of abuse toward men , researchers need to study both the externalizing and internalizing behaviors of abused men compared with those of nonabused men .
Fourth , these studies were all cross-sectional studies .
It therefore is not possible to conclude that the physical abuse men experienced from their partners caused these symptoms .
It could also be the case that men who experience these symptoms are more likely to be victimized by physical abuse or that a third variable is the cause of both the symptoms and the abuse .
Without a longitudinal study , it is not possIble to draw any conclusions regarding causation .
Finally , these studies did not separate men who only experienced abuse from those who both experienced and perpetrated abuse .
This last point as an important one to stress .
None of the studies in the current literature seem to consider that the dynamics of a mutually abusive relationship may be very different from the dynamics of a relationship in which the man is the sole victim .
When couples are involved in a mutually abusive relationship , the line between victim and perpetrator is unclear and constantly shifting .
The causes and consequences of violence in these mutually combative relationships may be quite different from the causes and consequences of violence in relationships in which men refuse to fight back because of societal sanctions against hitting a woman , because of the potential damage they know that they could inflict ( Steinmetz , 1977 - 1978 ) , or because they are unable to ( Langley & Levy , 1977 ) .
For example , Langley and Levy ( 1977 ) reported an account of a police officer who called a crisis line to report that his wife beat him .
As Langley and Levy relayed :
He ... said : “ My woman drinks , and every Friday night when I come home , she just starts pounding on me ... ”
He said he ’d been severely beaten up by her several times and that he was big enough to fight back but that he did n’t want to beat her , and did n’t know where to turn to solve his problem .
He was very emotional .
( pp. 189-190 )
Langley and Levy ( 1977 ) also related the story of an elderly man who was married to a woman 31 years his junior who was severe1y battered by his wife for 14 years .
He displayed several bruises and scars .
One time his wife shredded his ear with her teeth , and she injured one of his eyes so badly that the doctor thought he might lose it .
These men who are the sole victims of violence in their intimate relationships should be assessed separate1y from men involved in mutually abusive relationships because the psychological ramifications could be quite different .
Why Do They Stay ?
Extensive research has been done to investigate why abused women would choose to stay with their abuser .
Explanations range from social and economic constraints against leaving to being the victim of learned helplessness ( i.e. , a syndrome in which the woman feels she is helpless to effect any change in her environment ) .
Other explanations focus on the woman ’s psychological dependence on her abuser such that whenever she moves toward separation from him she experiences distress at the prospect of losing this important relationship ( Dutton & Painter , 1981 ) .
Finally , the gravest concern for a battered woman is that if she leaves the relationship , her abuser will come after her and most likely kill her .
Indeed , statistics show that the most dangerous time for a woman in an abusive relationship is the time immediately after she leaves her abuser ( Craven , 1997 ) .
Several qualitative studies have attempted to explain why men would choose to stay in relationships that are abusive , especially when , compared with abused women , many of these men have the physical and economic resources to leave ( Pagelow , 1984 ) .
One explanation that has been forwarded relates to marriage .
When a couple marries , they merge their economic resources and living situations and make vows to each other of commitment and love .
This commitment to marriage has been found to be one reason men are reluctant to leave abusive situations ( Lupri , 1990 ) .
These men may genuinely love their wives , and their wives are apologetic after an incident ( Pagelow , 1984 ) .
Also , disclosure of the abuse by their wives would be extremely embarrassing for these abused men , especially because this type of abuse is the opposite of society ’s stereotypes , in which the man should be dominant and the woman submissive ( Flynn , 1990 ) .
These men may be unwilling to endure the snickers , innuendos , and sarcasm that they would probably have to face if they filed a formal complaint ( Langley & Levy , 1977 ) .
In addition , abused men , like abused women , may become used to a certain standard of living .
If they were to leave their wives , they most likely would have to move out of their homes , support their ( ex ) wives , and pay for their own living expenses as well ( Steinmetz , 1977 - 1978 ) .
In addition to being committed to the marriage , many men refuse to leave an abusive situation because of their children .
Because abuse of husbands is relatively unrecognized , it is difficult for abused men to use this defense in court to obtain custody of their children ( assuming that they are willing to admit they are abused ) .
In addition , mothers usually are awarded custody .
As one abased man related ,
She ran off with another man , but after a short time returned home .
I was told , principally by lawyers , that I must take her back .
For if I pressed a divorce action , she would be seen as a poor , aggrieved , helpless woman , and she would literally clean me out .
She could get eighty - five percent of my income and have our five children entrusted in her care .
( Langley & Levy , 1977 , p. 191 )
Therefore , many abused men refuse to leave for fear of leaving their children with abusive women .
They believe that if they stay , they can at least protect the children if necessary ( Gregorash , 1993 ; Steinmetz , 1977 - 1978 ) .
Finally , many men refuse to leave their abusive wives for the same reason that women refuse to leave their abusive husbands :
They are psycho1ogically dependent on them and excuse the abuse as being a result of certain circumstances , such as alcohol intoxication ( Pagelow , 1984 ) .
Although these qualitative studies are valuable in identifying issues related to male victimization , they lack the kind of quantitative information that would be more generalizable .
Although they provide a useful starting point for understanding why abused men may choose to stay with their abusers , they should be supplemented with more objective , quantitative data from representative samples .
Emotional Abuse
The scant research that has been done on the dynamics of emotionally abusive relationships has tended to concentrate on battered women .
However , even though many battered women have identified the degradation , humiliation , and fear they feel at the hands of their abusers as the most devastating aspect of their abuse ( Walker , 1984 ) , few researchers have looked at the specific effects of emotional abuse on either women or men , probably in part because of difficulties in defining emotional abuse ( Follingstad , Rutledge , Berg , Hause & Polek , 1990 ) .
Definitional Issues
Several researchers have attempted to define the concept of emotional abuse .
For example , on the basis of the work of Walker , 1984 and their own experience , Follingstad et al. ( 1990 ) described six components of emotional abuse : ( a ) verbal attacks ( ridicule , verbal harassment , name calling ) ; ( b ) isolation ( social or financial ) ; ( c ) jealousy / possessiveness ( even with family , friends , and pets ) ; ( d ) verbal threats of harm , abuse , or torture ; ( e ) threats to divorce , abandon , or have an affair ; and ( f ) damage to or destruction of personal property .
The abused women in their study said that isolation and jealousy / possessiveness were the most frequent types of emotional abuse , whereas verbal attacks and verbal threats of harm , abuse , and torture were the worst types of emotional abuse .
One of the most consistent findings in the research on emotional abuse is that it often coexists with physical abuse ( e.g. , Molidor , 1995 ; Simonelli & Ingram , 1998 ; Walker , 1984 ) .
In addition , in a longitudinal study of community couples , Murphy and O’Leary ( 1989 ) found that emotional abuse by either partner was one of the strongest predictors for the first instance of physical abuse by the other partner .
Even though emotional abuse tends to coexist with or predate physical abuse , emotional abuse can occur without physical abuse , and its effects are still devastating to those victimized by it .
Many emotionally abused women , for instance , have stated that the emotional abuse they experienced was worse than the physical abuse .
Indeed , Follingstad et al. ( 1990 ) found that 72 % of their sample of 234 battered women reported that the emotional abuse they received from their partners was worse than the physical abuse .
These women experienced ridicule and threats to leave , felt that the men were likely to carry out their threats , and felt that the abuse was justified .
In addition , most of these abused women experienced more emotional abuse than physical abuse .
Incidence of Emotional Abuse
The Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory ( PMI ) , a widely used inventory of emotional abuse that was originally developed by Tolman ( 1989 ) for use with married women , was altered by Kasian and Painter ( 1992 ) to assess emotional abuse in men and dating couples as well .
The PMI covers positive behaviors in relationships as well as behaviors intended to control a partner ( emotionally and socially ) or diminish a partner ’s self - esteem .
In addition , it assesses jealousy , verbal abuse , and withdrawal .
In a study of emotional abuse in 1,625 college - aged participants , Kasian and Painter ( 1992 ) found that males reported experiencing high levels of emotional abuse in their relationships .
Specifically , approximately 20 % reported isolating and emotionally controlling behaviors by their partners ; approximately 15 % reported the diminishment of their self - esteem by their partners ; approximately 20 % reported experiencing jealousy behaviors from their partners ; approximately 10 % reported experiencing verbal abuse from their partners ; and approximately 10 % reported experiencing withdrawal behaviors from their partners .
Similarly , using the PMI , Molidor ( 1995 ) found in a survey of 736 high school students that males reported experiencing an average of 23.41 emotionally abusive acts from their partners in the course of their relationship .
In addition , two studies showed that college men also experience high rates of emotional abuse .
Specifically , Simonelli and Ingrarn ( 1998 ) found that , as measured by the PMI , 90 % of their male sample reported experiencing emotional abuse .
The types of emotional abuse experienced most frequently were jealousy ( 77 % ) .
withdrawal ( 77 % ) , diminishment of self - esteem ( 63 % ) , verbal abuse ( 60 % ) , and social and emotional control ( 49 % ) .
Finally , Hines and Malley - Morrison ( 2001 ) found that 82 % of their college male sample reported being the recipients of emotional abuse .
Such data indicate that men are experiencing high rates of emotional abuse in their relationships .
Consequently , it is important to ascertain the effects of this type of abuse on them .
Effects of Emotional Abuse
The effects of physical abuse have been studied much more systematically than the effects of emotional abuse .
Although the bulk of this research has been done with women , one case study of an emotionally abused man exists in the literature .
Smith and Loring ( 1994 ) related the case of a man who was emotionally abused both as a child by his mother and as an adult by his wife .
This man stated that , during his marriage , his wife called him ugly , refused to walk next to him in public because she was ashamed to be seen with him , threatened to kill or castrate him while he was sleeping , taught their son to call him “ dummy ” and “ wimp , ” found the negative in everything he did ( including hugging her and buying her flowers ) , and accused him of having affairs .
He felt frightened for his life , blamed himself for everything , and lost 31 pounds .
Why did he stay with this woman ?
He said , “ There were times that she bought me gifts and said she loved me ; I occasionally felt a little kindness , and I thought maybe she would change .
It was enough to keep me clinging to her ” ( p. 2 ) .
This statement contains an important insight , as the researchers believed that this man suffered from traumatic bonding , in which the abuser alternates abusive behavior with kindness , creating a bond that involves intermittent positive reinforcement .
This type of bond is difficult to break .
Although the Smith and Loring ( 1994 ) case study is an important contribution to the literature , it does not reveal much about the effects of emotional abuse against men in general .
Only two studies have provided some indication of what the possible psychological effects of emotional abuse against men in general are .
Simonelli and Ingram ( 1998 ) showed that up to 90 % of men have been the victims of emotional abuse at least once in the previous year .
They then showed the relative contributions of both physical and emotional abuse to the variance in depression and psychological distress and found that experiencing emotional abuse accounted for 14%- 33 % of the variance in depression and 15 % - 16 % of the variance in psychological distress .
In addition , Hines and Malley - Morrison ( 2001 ) assessed the incidence of PTSD and alcoholism symptoms in 116 college men involved in dating relationships .
PTSD symptoms were assessed because they are common in women who are emotionally abused , and alcohol use was assessed because , as previously mentioned , men tend to respond to stressful events with externalizing behaviors such as alcohol use .
Hines and Malley - Morrison found that the more emotional abuse these men experienced in their relationships , the higher their symptom counts for PTSD and alcoholism .
Both of these relationships were statistically significant .
These three studies ( Hines & Malley - Morrison , 2001 ; Simonelli & Ingram , 1998 ; Smith & Loring , 1994 ) show that men suffer psychologically from the emotional abuse they experience at the hands of their intimate partners .
However , this research is only a first step in identifying the effects of emotional abuse against men .
Other possible outcomes and a wider age range of men need to be studied .
Also , to properly assess the causal relationship between abuse and adverse psychological outcomes in emotionally abused men , it is necessary to follow men longitudinally .
Conclusion
Research has shown that men can be victims of physical abuse in their intimate relationships with women .
According to several studies , including at least two nationally representative studies , women physically abuse men at a substantial rate .
This physical abuse takes the form of both minor and severe abuse , and it cannot always be dismissed as self - defense .
Research on the psychosocial problems resulting from abuse is what is most lacking in the literature on abused men .
Researchers know that abused men tend to suffer injuries , depression , and psychosomatic symptoms in response to their victimization .
However , for the most part , studies that have considered the experiences of abused men have done so in comparison with abused women , even though abused women are not always an appropriate comparison group .
To study the psychosocial adjustment of abused men , they should be compared with nonabused men .
In addition , most studies have tended to look at injuries and internalizing symptoms .
Although these obviously are important areas to assess , that most domestic violence incidents do not result in injury ( especially in men ) and that men tend to display externalizing , not internalizing , symptoms in response to stressful life events must be considered .
Therefore , the extent of externalizing symptoms such as alcohol and substance abuse in abused men should be assessed .
From reviewing several studies on abused women , we learned that possible PTSD - like reactions , self - mutilating behaviors and assaultive behaviors should be considered .
In addition , because the few studies that have addressed this issue are cross-sectional , longitudinal studies are needed so that causation can be inferred .
In addition , quantitative research regarding why men stay with their abusive partners is needed .
Although qualitative studies have shown that abused men stay with their wives because they may suffer from traumatic bonding , seek to protect their children , wish to maintain their current economic standard of living , are embarrassed by their situation or are committed to their marriages , quantitative research is needed so that these conclusions can be further validated and generalized .
Finally , research is sorely needed in the area of emotional abuse against men .
The research so far has shown that it occurs in a large percentage of relationships , and one qualitative and two quantitative studies have demonstrated that emotionally abused men can experience depression , psychologica1 distress , alcoholism , PTSD , weight loss , fear , and self - blame .
However , more research in this area is desperately needed .

More and more Italians now seem to be willing to brave death threats and testify against the powerful Neapolitan - based mafia , the Camorra , the BBC's Pascale Harter says .
Silvana Fuscito says she has helped break the silence over the Camorra Fifty - eight - year - old Silvana Fucito was terrified the first time a member of the Camorra came into her shop , put a gun on the counter and said " either you pay up or we 'll kill you " .
Yet this tiny woman , with her manicured nails and diamante hair clips , told her husband to step aside .
She would deal with the Camorra .
She hoped they would show respect to a woman .
Instead they threw a petrol bomb into her paint shop .
The collusion between politicians and criminal organisations represents the true strength of the Camorra and Mafia
Franco Roberti
Anti-mafia prosecuting judge
Her neighbours , who narrowly escaped with their lives , did not blame the Camorra - a criminal organisation with a multi-billion dollar turnover , considered more powerful today than the Sicilian Mafia .
Instead they blamed Silvana , for breaking the rules of what they call " the system " .
Nonetheless , Silvana reported the crime , sending 15 senior Camorristi ( Camorra members ) to prison .
' Removing mask ' " At first people threw me out of their shops , they were so frightened just to be seen with me , " says Silvana .
" But now they come to me for help .
Today we break the silence , we speak about the Camorra . "
Roberto Saviano now lives under a round - the - clock armed guard The Camorra kills someone on average every three days , so I only have to stop a random person on the street to find someone who has witnessed a murder first hand and ask if they gave their testimony to the police .
" No , no , no , " one woman tells me , " I would be afraid , no - one talks about this . "
She tells me the murder she saw took place at nine in the morning in a crowded square , and no - one talked to the police .
But the chief anti-mafia prosecuting judge in Naples tells me he has seen a slight increase in the number of people willing to testify against the Camorra , especially since the publication of a best - selling book by a local boy called Roberto Saviano .
" The Camorra grows rich on silence , " says Judge Franco Roberti .
" Since Saviano nobody in the world can say they do n't know what the Camorra is .
This is very important for the state , because it removes the mask of the Camorra , and by making it more recognisable it becomes more vulnerable . "
' Dead by Christmas ' Roberto Saviano 's book Gomorrah , a biblical wordplay on the hell the Camorra visits on the Campania region , has been made into a widely acclaimed film .
The Camorra set fire to the mansion as soon as it was confiscated
It might have made business more difficult for the Camorra , but there could also be another reason why the bosses hate it so much they have vowed to kill Saviano " by Christmas " .
It is glamour - not poverty - that sucks young people into working for the Camorra , local crime reporters tell me .
And it is this glamour that Giovanni Alluci is trying to chip away at .
A local economist , he petitioned the government to let him make over houses confiscated from the Camorra bosses .
On a tour of one such mansion , complete with Romanesque pillars and jacuzzi , Giovanni tells me he is going to turn it into a rehabilitation centre for disabled people .
" The swimming pool will come in useful , " he says .
The Camorra set fire to the mansion as soon as it was confiscated , but it is still recognisable as a copy of the boss 's house from the film Scarface - testimony in bricks and mortar to the gangsters ' fascination with their own image in the media and films .
Roberto Saviano says the Italian mafia love films about themselves , and Scarface is their favourite .
Even though it is about a Cuban , it chimes with their sense of their own glamour .
' To live and let live '
Before the death threats , when he made book tours , Saviano says women would come up him and tell him what a " mafioso face " he had - as a compliment .
Cars seized from the Camorra hint at their ' glamorous ' lifestyle " That 's when I understood , " he says , " women from northern Europe , influenced by films , perceive mafia men exactly how mafia men want to be perceived - that 's to say as real men , who risk their lives , who have money , who have balls .
" Its incredible to realise that the bosses want to be perceived that way , " he says .
Gomorrah is unlikely to be among the DVD collections of the Camorra bosses .
In it , Saviano shows them as seedy businessmen bereft of the code of honour that so fascinates journalists and film directors .
But Gomorrah is also an indictment of the Italian government , which long ago reached an agreement with the country 's mafias , to live and let live .
Camorra 's ' streets '
On a night time patrol with the carabinieri , Italy 's military police , we stop literally every few metres to make arrests .
But the carabinieri are only getting the drug buyers .
They point out the Camorra youths , manning their homemade roadblocks at the entrance to the sprawling housing estates , and tell me if they were to go in , the locals would pelt them with bottles .
Further down the road , a known Camorra crack - making factory faces the military barracks across the road .
The Camorra seems to shout " we own these streets " .
Judge Franco says the Italian state has yet to make combating organised crime a priority .
" On the contrary , " he says , " the collusion between politicians and criminal organisations represents the true strength of the Camorra and Mafia . "
Perhaps the actions of ordinary Italians like Silvana Fucito and Roberto Saviano will shame their government into doing more , because in speaking out Roberto Saviano feels he has " lost everything , knowing that without doubt the Camorra will take their revenge . "

UPDATE : Please read School District says suspended student ’s anti-Obama t- shirt caused ‘ disruption ’ for new information on the story .
The father of an Aurora fifth - grader said Monday he plans to sue after school officials suspended the youth last week when he would n’t remove a home - made T - shirt reading “ Obama a terrorist ’s best friend . ”
“ It ’s the public school system , ” Dann Dalton told Fox31 News , “ let ’s be honest , it ’s full of liberal loons . ”
Eleven - year - old Daxx Dalton wore the crudely handwritten shirt the day Aurora Frontier K - 8 students were urged to wear red , white and blue to express their patriotism .
School officials gave him a choice , he said , “ switching the shirt , or wearing it inside out , or getting suspended . ”
“ They ’re taking away my right of freedom of speech , ” Daxx told Fox31 report Christin Ayers .
“ If I have the right to wear this shirt , I ’m going to use it .
And if the only way to use it is get suspended , then I ’m going to get suspended . ”
Aurora Public Schools officials declined to comment on Dalton ’s suspension but told Ayers it ’s district policy to “ Respect a student ’s right to free speech , such as the right tto wear specific clothing . ”
A letter from the school shown on camera by Fox31 cited “ willful disobedience ” as a reason for the suspension .
It ’s not about politics , Dann Dalton said , but about his son ’s First Amendment rights .
“ The facts are , his rights were violated , ” he told Ayers .
“ Period . ”
It is n’t the first time Dalton , a self - described “ proud conservative , ” has made news testing the limits of First Amendment expression .
Dalton was among a group of anti-abortion protesters who marched through an Arapahoe County neighborhood to protest a Planned Parenthood doctor in July 2000 , according to a Colorado Springs Gazette story .
The protest came in response to a law passed that week by the Arapahoe County Commission that banned “ targeted picketing ” outside the physician ’s home .
The picketers , led by Bob Enyart , had been gathering at least once a month in the doctor ’s cul - de-sac .
“ This is God ’s work , ” said Dann Dalton , a Denver truck driver who took part in the protest along with his two young children .
“ They think this ordinance will end the problem , but now the entire neighborhood can enjoy the annoyance . ”
Aurora schools are no strangers to free speech controversies sparked by conservative students , either .
Two years ago in the neighboring Cherry Creek School District , a high school geography teacher made international headlines after a student recorded a lecture that included comparisons between the speaking styles of George Bush and Adolph Hitler .
The student , Sean Allen , passed the recording to a radio station and soon Fox News was airing it while blasting the Overland High School teacher for “ indoctrinating ” students .
The recording included the teacher , Jay Bennish , asking , “ Who is probably the single most violent nation on planet Earth ? ”
He agreed when a student said , “ We are . ”
A media circus descended upon Aurora and talk radio shows went wild over a number of Bennish ’s statements .
When students walked out of class in support of their teacher , Fox commentator Alan Colmes claimed students had walked out to protest his views .
Bennish flew to New York for an interview with the Today Show ’s Matt Lauer , where he said his comments were taken out of context and included contrary views expressed after the recording ended .
Civil rights lawyer David Lane represented Bennish , who contested a suspension from the classroom for failing to provide varying viewpoints for students .
The school board reinstated Bennish , who agreed to change his teaching style .
Daxx Dalton said on Monday he ’s willing to leave his anti-Obama shirt at home for a while .
“ Except on Election Day , ” he told Ayers , “ when I ’m going to wear it again . ”
John McCain and Barack Obama return to Pennsylvania today -- each for two - day swings in the state -- with Obama holding his largest lead in the state since Oct. 18 , according to the newest Muhlenberg College / Morning Call tracking poll .
Why is McCain trailing ?
A look at the crosstabs on the poll makes it pretty clear :
He 's getting crushed among independents and is only getting support from three - quarters of Republicans .
He 's hitting west , central and eastern Pennsylvania today and tomorrow to try to close these margins , but this data can't have the McCain camp overly optimistic heading into the final week .

Smart grid startup GridPoint Inc. got into the utility power storage business Tuesday , announcing that utility Xcel Energy had chosen its software to manage a wind power battery storage project .
Arlington , Va. - based GridPoint will control the flow of power between an 11 - megawatt wind farm in Luverne , Minn. and NGK Insulators ' 1 - megawatt , sodium - sulfur battery that is capable of holding 7.2 megawatt - hours of energy , the companies announced .
The battery storage project is expected to be complete in January 2009 .
While GridPoint has managed some small - scale storage for distributed energy generated at homes or businesses , Tuesday 's announcement was a first for GridPoint in the management of utility - scale power storage , Corsell said .
But with the need to store intermittent power from wind turbines and other renewable energy sources expected to grow rapidly , it likely wo n't be the last , he added .
" I believe the utility - scale energy storage model has huge potential , especially in connection with wind farm development , " Corsell told Greentech Media at the Greentech Innovations : End - to - End Electricity conference in New York .
That 's because wind turbines only generate power when the wind blows , meaning they need backup , or " firming " power that 's today usually provided by peaking natural gas - fired power plants , he said .
" Energy storage has the potential to eliminate the need for that firming resource , " Corsell said .
He would n't disclose how much GridPoint would be paid for the deal .
Beyond reducing the need for firming power , batteries can allow wind power to be stored when prices for power are cheap and sold at peak - price times in the afternoons - a key part of what GridPoint 's software will allow Xcel to do , Corsell said .
GridPoint 's software platform will also be tracking the battery system 's performance for the University of Minnesota , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Great Plains Institute .
The power will come from a wind farm owned by Minwind Energy LLC .
S&C Electric Company will install the battery and components from Japan 's NKG .
Sodium - sulfur batteries , which store power efficiently but require very high temperatures to operate , are among a number of energy storage solutions being offered by startups and established companies alike .
Other technologies include flow batteries , solid oxide fuel cells , thermal mass technologies , compressed air and others ( see Batteries for the Grid , Q&A : MegaWatt Storage Targets Utilities and Startup ES&P to Store Electricity in the Air ) .
Lux Research predicted in May that bulk energy storage for utilities could hit $ 50 billion if only 10 percent of installed wind power plants adopted it .
But because utilities are slow to adopt new technologies , Lux said the market would likely be limited to only $ 600 million by 2012 .
Minneapolis - based Xcel first announced its plans for the wind power battery system in February , but it is n't the first to look to batteries to smooth out the delivery of wind power ( see Batteries for the Grid ) .
In September 2007 , American Electric Power ( NYSE : AEP ) said it was installing 6 megawatts of NGK 's batteries to support its wind operations and also said it planned to install " at least " 25 megawatts by 2010 , according to a report from research firm Frost & Sullivan .
Northern California utility Pacific Gas and Electric also has plans to install a 5 - megawatt sodium - sulfur battery for backup purposes by 2009 .
And Tokyo Electric Power Co. , which partnered with NGK to develop its batteries , had two 6 - megawatt storage systems operating in Japan by 2001 .
GridPoint , founded in 2003 , has raised more than $ 200 million as it has moved from making products that monitor energy use for residential and commercial clients to creating its SmartGrid Platform , aimed at giving utilities the technology to manage the flow and storage of power at a moment 's notice .
Other companies in the fast - growing business of making the grid smarter include hardware makers like Trilliant , Silver Spring Networks , EnerNoc , GainSpan , SmartSynch , Tendril and Greenbox , to name a few ( see Acquisitions in Smart Grid : Get Used to It ) .
GridPoint raised $ 120 million in September and bought Seattle - based V2 Green , a company that makes technology to allow plug - in vehicles to communicate with and provide power back to utilities ( see GridPoint Gets $ 120 M , Buys V2 Green ) .
GridPoint previously had raised roughly $ 102 million before that in four rounds of funding , with investors including Goldman Sachs Group and Susquehanna Private Equity Investments , New Enterprise Associates , Perella Weinberg Partners , Robeco and the Quercus Trust .
In May , GridPoint was chosen by Xcel Energy to participate in the utility 's $ 100 million SmartGridCity initiative in Boulder , Colo. , aimed at deploying an array of smart grid technologies .
I want to thank my partner in this journey , a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke ....
I just received a very gracious call from Sen. McCain . [ UPDATE : Complete text of Sen. John McCain 's concession speech available here .]
He fought long and hard in this campaign , and he ’s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves .
He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine , and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader .
I congratulate him and Gov. Palin for all they have achieved , and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation ’s promise in the months ahead .
It ’s been a long time coming , but tonight , because of what we did on this day , in this election , at this defining moment , change has come to America .
It ’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical , and fearful , and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day .
It ’s the answer spoken by young and old , rich and poor , Democrat and Republican , black , white , Latino , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , disabled and not disabled –- Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of red states and blue states : we are , and always will be , the United States of America .
It ’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen ; by people who waited three hours and four hours , many for the very first time in their lives , because they believed that this time must be different ; that their voice could be that difference .
If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time ; who still questions the power of our democracy , tonight is your answer .
... for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware , the vice president - elect of the United States , Joe Biden .
I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years , the rock of our family and the love of my life , our nation ’s next First Lady , Michelle Obama .
Sasha and Malia , I love you both so much , and you have earned the new puppy that ’s coming with us to the White House .
And while she ’s no longer with us , I know my grandmother is watching , along with the family that made me who I am .
I miss them tonight , and know that my debt to them is beyond measure .
To my campaign manager David Plouffe , my chief strategist David Axelrod , and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics – you made this happen , and I am forever grateful for what you ’ve sacrificed to get it done .
But above all , I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to -– it belongs to you .
I was never the likeliest candidate for this office .
We did n’t start with much money or many endorsements .
Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington –- it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston .
It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause .
It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation ’s apathy ; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep ; from the not - so - young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers ; from the millions of Americans who volunteered , and organized , and proved that more than two centuries later , a government of the people , by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth .
This is your victory .
I know you did n’t do this just to win an election and I know you did n’t do it for me .
You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead .
For even as we celebrate tonight , we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime -– two wars , a planet in peril , the worst financial crisis in a century .
Even as we stand here tonight , we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us .
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they ’ll make the mortgage , or pay their doctor ’s bills , or save enough for college .
There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created ; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair .
The road ahead will be long .
Our climb will be steep .
We may not get there in one year or even one term , but America –- I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there .
I promise you –- we as a people will get there .
There will be setbacks and false starts .
There are many who wo n’t agree with every decision or policy I make as president , and we know that government ca n’t solve every problem .
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face .
I will listen to you , especially when we disagree .
And above all , I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it ’s been done in America for 221 years –- block by block , brick by brick , calloused hand by calloused hand .
What began twenty - one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night .
This victory alone is not the change we seek -– it is only the chance for us to make that change .
And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were .
It can not happen without you .
So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism ; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves , but each other .
Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything , it ’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers -– in this country , we rise or fall as one nation ; as one people .
Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long .
Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House –- a party founded on the values of self - reliance , individual liberty , and national unity .
Those are values we all share , and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight , we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress .
As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours , “ We are not enemies , but friends … though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . ”
And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn -– I may not have won your vote , but I hear your voices , I need your help , and I will be your president too .
And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores , from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world –- our stories are singular , but our destiny is shared , and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand .
To those who would tear this world down –- we will defeat you .
To those who seek peace and security -– we support you .
And to all those who have wondered if America ’s beacon still burns as bright –- tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth , but from the enduring power of our ideals : democracy , liberty , opportunity , and unyielding hope .
For that is the true genius of America -– that America can change .
Our union can be perfected .
And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow .
This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations .
But one that ’s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta .
She ’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing –- A nn Nixon Cooper is 106 years old .
She was born just a generation past slavery ; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky ; when someone like her could n’t vote for two reasons –- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin .
And tonight , I think about all that she ’s seen throughout her century in America –- the heartache and the hope ; the struggle and the progress ; the times we were told that we can’t , and the people who pressed on with that American creed :
Yes , we can .
At a time when women ’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed , she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot .
Yes , we can .
When there was despair in the Dust Bowl and depression across the land , she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal , new jobs and a new sense of common purpose .
Yes , we can .
When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world , she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved .
Yes , we can .
She was there for the buses in Montgomery , the hoses in Birmingham , a bridge in Selma , and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “ We Shall Overcome . ”
Yes , we can .
A man touched down on the moon , a wall came down in Berlin , a world was connected by our own science and imagination .
And this year , in this election , she touched her finger to a screen , and cast her vote , because after 106 years in America , through the best of times and the darkest of hours , she knows how America can change .
Yes , we can .
America , we have come so far .
We have seen so much .
But there is so much more to do .
So tonight , let us ask ourselves –- if our children should live to see the next century ; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper , what change will they see ?
What progress will we have made ?
This is our chance to answer that call .
This is our moment .
This is our time –- to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids ; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace ; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth –- that out of many , we are one ; that while we breathe , we hope , and where we are met with cynicism , and doubt , and those who tell us that we can’t , we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people :
Yes , we can .
Thank you ,
God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Strong discounts brought U.S. consumers to the stores on " Black Friday " -- the traditional first day of the holiday shopping season -- with estimated sales rising 3 % from last year , according to industry analyst ShopperTrak RCT Corp .
ShopperTrak said in a report Saturday that preliminary sales for Black Friday totaled $ 10.6 billion .
This year 's rise in sales , while lower than the 8 % increase seen for the day last year , comes despite plummeting consumer sentiment data and other economic turmoil .
" Retailers should be cautiously optimistic as deep discounts drove consumers en masse to various retail locations to spend , despite myriad economic pressures seen over the last two months , " Shopper Trak said .
Black Friday refers to the day after Thanksgiving , so called because many retailers begin to turn a profit on that day , moving from " red ink " to " black ink . "
Sales for the day are seen as a key harbinger for the overall holiday season .
Regionally , the South led the gains with a 3.4 % rise over 2007 , closely followed by the Midwest , up 3.0 % ; the West , up 2.7 % ; and the Northeast , gaining 2.6 % .
ShopperTrak cited retailers ' early openings and " numerous door buster specials " and other promotions .
" While this is an encouraging start for retailers , there 's no guarantee these deep discounts will continue after Black Friday weekend , which could slow spending , " said Bill Martin , co-founder of privately - held ShopperTrak .
" Additionally , consumers have just 27 days to shop this year as opposed to 32 in 2007 , which may catch some procrastinating consumers off guard , leading to lower sales levels , " he said .
The ShopperTrak National Retail Sales Estimate covers retailers of general merchandise , apparel , furniture , sporting goods , electronics , hobby , books and other related store sales .
Consumer survey also cheerful
Separately , a survey of shoppers for the National Retail Federation said Sunday that average spending over the Black Friday weekend -- both at physical stores and over the Internet -- rose 7.2 % from last year .
From Thursday through Saturday and including projected spending for Sunday , shoppers spent an average of $ 372.57 , compared to last year 's $ 347.55 , it said .
The retail group 's 2008 Black Friday Weekend survey , conducted by BIGresearch , also said more than 172 million shoppers visited stores and Web sites over the weekend , up from 147 million shoppers in 2007 .
The survey polled 3,370 consumers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 % .
The NRF said it continues to project that holiday sales will rise 2.2 % this year to $ 470.4 billion .
Obama 's Georgia call
A reader sends in the audio of Obama 's robocall on behalf of Georgia Senate candidate Jim Martin .
" I want to thank everybody who turned out and voted for me in November , " Obama says .
" I want to urge you to turn out one more time and help elect Jim Martin . "
He 's also done radio for Martin , but has n't visited the state , despite Georgia Democrats ' urgings .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House consulted with President - elect Barack Obama on the $ 13.4 billion loan package for automakers that President Bush announced Friday , both sides said .
President Bush said Friday that automakers must show they can be profitable businesses by March 31 .
The Bush administration briefed Obama 's transition team over the last several days about options under consideration , according to a transition aide not authorized to speak publicly , though the administration did not ask for Obama or his staff 's approval or opinion on the package or any of its specifics .
White House spokesman Joel Kaplan confirmed that there had been " consultations ongoing " between the two sides but he declined to go into specifics .
Bush said Friday the federal government would provide loans almost immediately to General Motors Corp. and Chrysler to prevent " an unacceptably painful blow " should the Detroit giants fail .
Bush said in normal economic circumstances he would not intervene to save the automakers but " in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action . "
Federal intervention is necessary , he said , to give auto buyers faith in their purchases of domestic vehicles .
" If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy , you worry that parts and servicing will not be available , and you question the value of your warranty , " Bush said .
" With consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers , it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover . "
Watch Bush announce help for GM , Chrysler »
Bush had expressed skepticism to Obama in their November 10 Oval Office meeting about a bailout of the car companies on the heels of bailouts of other industries , the Obama aide said .
Obama had urged Bush in the meeting to grant a short - term loan to the auto industry on the condition that significant changes were made toward long - term viability , the aide said .
The loans are designed to stabilize the two automakers through March , at which time they must show they are financially viable .
" If the firms have not attained viability by March 31 , 2009 , the loan will be called and all funds returned to the Treasury , " a White House statement said .
In a statement after Bush 's announcement , Obama said that allowing a collapse in the auto industry would have had " devastating consequences " for the economy .
" The auto companies must not squander this chance to reform bad management practices and begin the long - term restructuring that is absolutely required to save this critical industry and the millions of American jobs that depend on it , " Obama 's statement said .
A senior Bush administration official briefing reporters said he expected that GM and Chrysler officials will be signing the loan papers to access the cash later Friday .
Ford Motor Co. is in a better financial position than GM and Chrysler and is not included in the loan plan .
iReport.com : How does the auto bailout affect you ?
An additional $ 4 billion may be available in February , the Bush administration said .
GM has warned it will fall below the minimum amount of cash it needs to continue to operate without $ 4 billion in federal loans before the end of the month .
Privately held Chrysler said it will need $ 4 billion or it also will run out of cash early next year .
Financing will be drawn from the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , the fund set aside in October to bail out Wall Street firms and banks , according to the White House .
The president said Friday the plan will give the automakers a chance to show they can be viable outside a " disorderly bankruptcy , " which he said would drive the U.S. into a deeper recession with effects " far beyond the auto industry . "
The government will put other conditions on the loans , Bush said , including making pay competitive with foreign automakers with large U.S. operations such as Toyota and Honda .
Employees of foreign automakers generally make less than those in U.S. - owned plants .
The plan also puts limits on executive compensation and perks such as corporate jets and requires the automakers to adhere to fuel efficiency and emission standards and to open books to government scrutiny .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the conditions were included to " protect the taxpayers to the maximum extent possible . "
Chrysler Chairman and CEO Bob Nardelli thanked the administration for the loan .
" A letter of intent was signed which outlines the specific requirements that must be achieved , " Nardelli said in a statement .
" These requirements will require consideration from all constituents , requiring commitment first in principal , leading to implementation this coming year .
Chrysler is committed to meeting these requirements . "
Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally issued a statement Friday saying the loans for its competitors were welcome .
" The U.S. auto industry is highly interdependent , and a failure of one of our competitors would have a ripple effect that could jeopardize millions of jobs and further damage the already weakened U.S. economy , " Mulally said .
Sen . George Voinovich , R - Ohio , co-chairman of the Senate Auto Caucus , thanked Bush for acting .
" I am grateful the president stepped in to help thwart a disaster that would have sent our state over the cliff , " Voinovich said .
" There are millions of hard - working Americans today who can breathe easier this holiday season . "
Opponents of federal help for the automakers were not swayed Friday .
" It is deeply disappointing that the administration has chosen to use taxpayer dollars to delay the inevitable need to fundamentally restructure these companies , " Rep . Tom Price , R - Georgia , said in a statement .
" By bailing out automakers without real reform or long - term solutions , we are only protracting uncertainty and putting billions of tax dollars at grave risk . "
Rep. John Dingell , D - Michigan , said he was pleased Bush approved the loans but not happy with one of the conditions .
" It is irresponsible during a time of economic crisis for the White House to insist that workers take further wage cuts on top of the historic concessions they have already made , " Dingell said .
U.S. auto sales plunged to 26 - year lows last month as tight credit , rising job losses and weak consumer confidence have led to a virtual collapse in the auto market .
All the major automakers , including Asian firms such as Toyota , are cutting back production .
But the situation is particularly severe at GM and Chrysler .
In the last week , those two automakers announced shutdowns of assembly lines for at least a month , several weeks longer than the typical shutdowns during the December holiday season .
Lengthy shutdown is a worry for workers »

Encourage Women who are Working Their Families out of Poverty
Sherida Mkama lives with her husband and their ten children in Kamanga , Tanzania .
Since 1995 , all the money she made selling tomatoes at a local market went toward tuition and uniform fees for her children .
Trapped in the cycle of poverty , Sherida had no reason to hope that things could get better .
Then Sherida learned of FINCA from a friend and she joined the Tugeme Village Banking group .
She took out a first loan of $ 50 .
Sherida used her Village Bank loans to purchase spare parts for her bicycle so she could transport her tomatoes to the market and to buy seeds and fertilizer so she could grow her own tomatoes .
After investing in her business and paying for her children 's school fees , Sherida can now set aside savings for her family , and has a newfound sense of hope and confidence .
Of the 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty worldwide , 70 percent are women .
Poor women are the least able to access credit , and yet they often provide a substantial portion - or all - of the family 's income .
This method of providing small loans , called microfinance , gives them the opportunity to build or expand businesses that become crucial sources of income and economic vitality .
You can play pivotal a role in this extraordinary effort to provide a hand - up to poor working women around the world .
If you have the means , a small loan can forever change the life a poor woman seeking an opportunity - not a hand - out .
Right now , you can send a message of hope to a woman who is struggling to provide herself and her family with a better life .
When you get hungry , and I mean hungry , it ’s your body calling out for protein .
While you do n’t have to go full - time veg to green your lifestyle , many people are surprised to learn that simply cutting back on meat consumption is one of the most significant ways to help the planet .
And it does n’t require subsistence on tofu .
( Personally , I find tofu delicious , but it ’s one of those vegetarian protein sources people either really love or really do n’t . )
There are so many delicious options available that slipping out of meat mode is breeze .
Try one meat - free dinner a week , and build from there :
QUINOA
Your kitchen is not complete without highly nutritious quinoa .
Known as the “ Mother Grain ” of the Andes , quinoa ( pronounced KEE - nwah ) comes complete with all necessary amino acids , high iron content , a delicious nutty flavor , and a faster cooking time than rice .
Try it hot with steamed vegetables , cold in a salad , or in the ingenious form of quinoa pasta .
VEGGIE BURGER ( YES )
Even carnivores love a veggie burger – they no longer resemble sorry imitations of meat that is n’t that choice to begin with .
Amy ’s Kitchen makes the tastiest organic ones , in my opinion , but there are dozens out there .
Rare is the veggie burger that really tastes like meat , but I personally would n’t want that , anyway .
You ’ve got a variety of flavors to choose from , each typically made with protein - rich soy and organic vegetables .
ALMONDS
King of the nuts , the amazing almond is high in both protein and calcium ( it ’s a great low - carb snack with only a few grams of non-fiber carbohydrate per serving ) .
Try almond milk or Living Tree ’s naturally sweet organic almond butter , too .
For a real splurge , go for raw .
YOGURT
With a 4,500 year history , organic yogurt is here to stay .
Boasting protein , calcium and living cultures , organic yogurt with fruit slices makes for a healthy and filling breakfast or dessert .
Buy plain , organic , full - fat yogurt – it ’s the best for your body .
Low - fat yogurt is highly processed and flavored yogurts are very high in sugar and / or high - fructose corn syrup .
TEMPEH
O.K. , technically this is tofu .
But wait !
Organic and non-GMO tempeh , made from fermented soy beans and rice , is high in fiber and protein .
It has a nutty flavor and tastes amazing in a stir - fry or on a kabob .
I recommend Henry ’s Gourmet .
It ’s much nuttier and chewier than tofu , which will satisfy a serious protein craving .
LEGUMES
Legumes , like lentils , black beans and chickpeas are filling and high in protein and fiber .
A Middle Eastern staple , hummus is simple to make , making it one of my favorite foods !
CHEESE
Though it ’s not a vegan option , you can find cheeses that come from animals raised humanely ( look for artisan or organic choices ) .
Cheddar and mozzarella top the list of organic cheeses for protein content .
I recommend raw dairy if you ’re comfortable with that .
Here ’s a cheddar cheese scone recipe – simply substitute whole - grain flour .
ENJOY !
It ’s easy to get plenty of satisfying protein in your meals while still eating low on the food chain .

Sen. Barack Obama leads Sen. John McCain in CNN 's latest Electoral College estimates .
George W. Bush won Montana by 20 points in his re-election victory four years ago .
But it seems times have changed in the state .
CNN 's new Electoral College map , updated Sunday morning , moves Montana from " leaning John McCain " to " tossup . "
The move is partially based on the new CNN poll of polls in Montana , compiled Friday , which suggests that McCain has a 1 - point lead over his Democratic rival , Barack Obama , 46 percent to 45 percent .
Nine percent of voters are undecided .
" The fact that Montana is up for grabs has to be extremely unsettling for the McCain campaign , " said CNN Senior Political Researcher Alan Silverleib .
" Montana 's usually a reliably Republican state in presidential campaigns .
It 's been won by the Democrats only twice in the past half century .
If you 're a Republican and you 're fighting for Montana in the last few days of the campaign , you 're not in good shape . "
Three electoral votes are at stake in Montana , a state Obama visited in late August .
McCain , the Republican nominee , has not campaigned in Montana during the general election .
With Montana moving to " tossup , " CNN estimates that if the election were held today , Obama would win states with 291 electoral votes -- more than enough to capture the White House .

McCain would take states with 157 electoral votes , while states with a combined total of 90 electoral votes would still be up for grabs .
A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win .
The CNN Electoral College map uses such factors as the most recent state polling , voting trends , campaign visits and campaign advertising to estimate how a state would vote if the election were held today .
See the map
CNN is also moving Iowa , and its 7 electoral votes , from " leaning Obama " to " safe Obama . "
The latest poll of polls in Iowa , compiled Sunday morning , suggests Obama now has a lead of 14 percentage points in the state , 53 to 39 percent .
The state narrowly voted for Al Gore in the 2000 election and narrowly voted for Bush in the last presidential contest .
Iowa was the site of Obama 's first major political triumph in this long presidential campaign .
His victory in the Iowa caucuses at the start of this year propelled him towards the Democratic presidential nomination .
On Friday , tens of thousands of supporters gathered in Des Moines , the state 's largest city , to cheer on Obama at a rally .
But the state 's a very different story for McCain .
" John McCain has always had a somewhat cool relationship with Iowa voters , " Silverleib noted .
" He did n't seriously contest the Iowa caucuses in 2000 and 2008 , and he 's opposed ethanol subsidies -- a political kiss of death with Iowa voters .
Combine those facts with the backdrop of a struggling economy , and it's not terribly surprising that Obama is pulling away at this point . "

Hackers have done many interesting things with the Wiimote , and it's a little surprising that Nintendo has n't taken any cues from some of the great ideas that the online community has thought up .
The newest idea ?
Use the Wiimote and a pair of gloves to create a virtual theremin .
Yes , it works and yes , it 's awesome .
< div width = " 425 " < object = "
A theremin is an instrument that does n't need to be touched , you simply move your hands around two antennae to control volume and pitch .
If you 've ever watched an old sci - fi movie , you know the sound a theremin makes ; it 's that otherworldly trilling that you usually hear when flying saucers are on the screen .
Creating the effect using Wii hardware did n't seem very difficult , or expensive .
Ken Moore explains :
At just $ 35 , the Wiimote is an AMAZING piece of technology .
It has an infrared camera in it which tracks the position [ of ] up to 4 infrared light sources .
So I bought a pair of leather gloves , wired up a couple infrared LEDs to 1.5 volt batteries , and poked an LED through the tip of the index finger of each glove .
After using the Wiimote 's built - in blue tooth capability to hook the controller up to his computer , he wrote a program that converted the vertical placement of his left hand as volume , and then the horizontal placement of his right hand controls the pitch .
That information goes to a synthesizer , which converts the information to sound .
This looks like it would be a blast to play with , and it 's much less expensive than even a low - end theremin .
Nintendo , are you taking notes ?

HONG KONG  Chinese authorities have begun blocking access from mainland China to the Web site of The New York Times even while lifting some of the restrictions they had recently imposed on the Web sites of other media outlets .
When computer users in cities like Beijing , Shanghai and Guangzhou tried to connect on Friday morning to nytimes.com , they received a message that the site was not available ; some users were cut off on Thursday as early as 8 p.m .
The blocking was still in effect on Saturday morning .
But the Chinese - language Web sites of BBC , Voice of America and Asiaweek , all of which had been blocked earlier this week , were accessible by Friday .
The Web site of Ming Pao , a Hong Kong newspaper , was blocked earlier this week and still restricted on Friday .
Chinese officials had few explanations for the restriction on The Times ’s site .
“ Concerning your particular question , we ’re not really familiar with the details , ” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing , who declined to give his name .
“ Web site maintenance is not within the job purview of the Foreign Ministry . ”

We 've seen e-cigarettes before , and no one was really surprised to hear that inhaling liquid nicotine might not be the safest way to kick the habit .
Fifty - One , a new , more cigarette - looking e-cig , claims it 's better than previous products because you change the mouthpiece with every use so you 're not inhaling old leftover nicotine again and again ... plus they 've added a fake smoke effect when you exhale , which makes you look and feel cool .
Sound safer ?
Nope , probably not .
There are a host of other things just completely wrong with this product : it comes in five flavors ( tobacco , menthol , chocolate , vanilla and coffee ) and seems to be marketed to only the shadiest sectors of society -- gangsters , card sharks , thieves , private dicks , AKA our kind of people .
The starter kit also apparently includes a membership card in addition to all the regular stuff -- batteries , USB charger , poker chips -- and it 'll run you a not - so - affordable $ 149.95 , but you can probably score that at tonight 's shakedown , right ?
Young planets around other stars may be easier to spot because they stay hotter way longer than astronomers have thought , according to new work by MIT planetary scientist Linda Elkins - Tanton .
For a few million years after their initial formation , planets like Earth may maintain a hot surface of molten rock that would glow brightly enough to make them stand out as they orbit neighboring stars .
Elkins - Tanton , Mitsui Career Development Professor of Geology in the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , says the " magma ocean " stage for Earth - sized planets may last a few million years , much longer than previously estimated .
" That means we may actually see them elsewhere , as detection systems get better , " she said .
She will be presenting her new findings Tuesday , Oct. 14 , at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society 's Division for Planetary Sciences , being held this year in Ithaca , N.Y .
The research shows that even after the surface magma solidifies , within about five million years , it could stay hot enough to glow brightly in infrared light for tens of millions of years , providing a relatively long window for detectability .
The big problem for astronomers hoping to detect planets around other stars is the vast difference in brightness between the star and the planet , which shines only by reflecting light from its parent star .
But the difference in brightness in infrared wavelengths for a glowing , molten planetary surface would be much less , making the detection more feasible .
The long duration of the molten stage turns out to be the result of a two - stage process , Elkins - Tanton explained .
The initial heating , generated by a combination of radioactivity in the planet 's interior and the heat generated by the collision of millions of chunks of rock crashing together to form the planet , actually is quite short - lived :
The planet 's surface is expected to solidify quickly , within a few hundred thousand years , as originally thought .
But then a secondary upheaval begins , in which heavier iron - rich material that has solidified at the surface begins to sink toward the core , causing other hotter material to rise to the surface .
This " overturn " process , it turns out , produces the much - longer - lived molten surface , lasting for millions of years , she said .
Because the Earth 's crust is so dynamic , there is no material left from that initial epoch that could be studied to test this modelling , she said , but on other planets such as Mars or Mercury there might be early remnant rocks that could be tested .
The analysis also leads to specific conclusions about the surface composition of planets , so detection of certain specific minerals on Mercury , for example , which the MESSENGER spacecraft may be able to carry out when it begins its study of the planet in 2011 , might support the theory .
In addition , the detection of hot , young planets around other stars , which might become possible over the next several years , might provide another line of evidence to support this conclusion , she said .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA 's Mars Fundamental Research Program .

A new celebrity shopper has emerged !
The attention from Jeanne Cummings ’s much - talked - about Politico story has naturally focused on the $ 150,000 in luxury clothing purchased for Sarah Palin at Neiman Marcus , Sak ’s Fifth Avenue , and Barney ’s .
What has n’t yet gotten any attention is who bought it for her .
But buried in the same FEC disclosure form that revealed Palin ’s taste for the fine life is the name of the man who appears to have been her personal shopper : Jeff Larson .
Under FEC regulations , the RNC must file what is called a “ Schedule F form , ” which lists “ expenditures made by political committees or designated agents ( s ) on behalf of candidates for federal office . ”
This is presumably the same document from which Cummings drew for her story .
Here ’s a blow - up of the RNC ’s most recent Schedule F. I ’ve circled the controversial purchases — and the apparent purchaser — in red magic marker .
Along with the matching dates and dollar totals , note the “ Transaction ID Number , ” which clearly connects the questionable expenditures with reimbursement payments made to Larson .
( To totally wonk out for a second , the “ m ” stands for “ memo , ” which is included to provide an additional explanation of the transaction — basically , it links a disbursement with whatever was purchased . )

[ Yuri N. Maltsev , senior fellow of the Mises Institute , worked as an economist on Mikhail Gorbachev 's economic reform team before emigrating to the United States in 1989 .
This is his 1992 introduction to Requiem for Marx . ]
It was a Western fantasy that the man named to be general secretary of the Communist Party would not be a devoted Communist . "
Lenin 's slogan , " Marxism is Almighty Because It Is True , " was displayed practically everywhere in the former Soviet Union .
My first encounter with Karl Marx came in the first grade of elementary school in the city of Kazan on the banks of the great Volga River .
His picture was printed on the first page of the first textbook I opened .
" Dedushka Marx " ( Grandfather Marx ) , said the teacher pointing to the picture .
I was thrilled , for both of my grandfathers died in Stalin 's purges in the 1930s .
I ran home to my grandma to tell her she was wrong .
" I have a grandpa , " I said , and with his huge beard and smiling eyes , " he looks like Father Frost " ( the Soviet / atheist version of Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas , the patron saint of Russia ) .
Growing up in the Soviet Union , such early confusions are soon cleared up , for studies in Marxism were an unavoidable experience for everyone irrespective of age , class , social position , or nationality .
Even the convicts in prison , including those on death row , studied the " Shining Heights " of the " great liberating teacher . "
The works of Marx , Engels , and Lenin were published in the USSR in 173 languages with a total output of 480 million copies .
Many of them were exported .
I once met an Indian translator hired by the Political Publishing House to translate 50 volumes of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels into Malayalam .
He complained the project was stalled because the Soviet propaganda officers could not find another Malayalam translator to cross check his work .
In the Soviet Union , Marxism was not thought to be just an economic theory .
It pretended to be the universal explanation of nature , life , and society .
[ 1]
It was also a deadly weapon to be wielded against personal enemies .
As in the case of Nikolai Vavilov who was starved to death for violating Marxism because he adhered to the science of genetics , " a false science invented by the Catholic monk , Mendel . "
In the name of Marxism , the death toll reached 100 million ; the rivers of blood flowed from Russia to Kampuchea , from China to Czechoslovakia .
Hatred was the chief motivator of the socialist revolutionaries and their followers .
Lenin regarded politics as a branch of pest control ; the aim of his operations was the extermination of cockroaches and bloodsucking spiders , the myriad persons who stood in the way of his political ambitions .
Yet Western hagiographers have glossed over this atrocious ruthlessness of Marxists , as historian Richard Pipes has documented .
One of the common denominators between Leninists and government interventionists in the West is the belief that the problems of monopoly are the problems of ownership : only private monopolies acting out of greed are harmful .
These institutions are suppressing scientific and technical progress , polluting the environment , and engaging in other conspiracies against public well - being .
Government monopolies , however , were believed to be ethical and upright ; they substituted the " greed " of the profit motive with a " societal interest . "
Yet group bureaucrats who manage and operate the public sector are no less self - interested than those who manage and operate private business .
One important difference exists , though : unlike private entrepreneurs , they are not financially responsible for their actions and they operate without institutional constraints of cost control that private property and competition induces .
The enlightened minds of planners and technocrats cannot overcome the problem of economic calculation without market signals .
The failure of socialism in Russia , and the enormous suffering and hardship of people in all socialist countries , is a powerful warning against socialism , statism , and interventionism in the West .
" We should all be thankful to the Soviets , " says Paul Craig Roberts , " because they have proved conclusively that socialism does n't work .
No one can say they did n't have enough power or enough bureaucracy or enough planners or they did n't go far enough . " [ 2 ]
In contrast to the West , where Marxist tenets were doctrines of a counterreligion , few in the Soviet Union truly believed in the official ideology : not the state managers , not the professors , not the journalists .
[ 3 ]
It was not necessary that they do so , for Marxism was a means of political rent seeking and of coercive control , not a body of ideas held to by honest men .
The Soviet Union is now gone , as are the huge statues of Marx and Lenin that littered the East , and the good reputation of their systems of thought .
This collection of articles is the Requiem for Marx and the social and economic systems created in his name .
As with any funeral service , we look back on the life of Marxian ideas .
But unlike the ordinary funeral , we are not looking back fondly , for Marxism is as good an example of the maxim that " ideas have consequences " as can be found .
It does not speak well of the intellectual class that no body of ideas attracted a greater following in this century . [ 4 ]
It is beyond the capacity of economic analysis to calculate the opportunity costs of the socialist experiment in Russia .
But the human death toll from Stalin 's collectivization , purges , and Gulags is estimated by Russian historian Roy Medvedev at forty - one million people .
A popular Russian aphorism says : " The only lesson of history is that it does not teach us anything . "
" Despite the recent collapse of socialism and communism in Soviet Russia and Eastern Europe , socialism is alive and growing , " [ 5 ] Gary Becker has said .
It presents a mortal danger to economic freedom and the quality of life , and will for generations to come .
The scholars contributing to this volume write in the economic and historical tradition of the Austrian school , founded by Carl Menger with his book Principles of Economics ( 1875 ) .
The tradition emphasizes a deductive method , the role of choice and uncertainty in economic affairs , the power of market prices to coordinate economic activity , and the essentiality of private property for forming the basis of rational calculation .
The Austrian school is also the historical bête noire of the Marxian school .
Long before any other school came around to understanding the deep flaws in the Marxian approach , the Austrians had devoted an enormous amount of intellectual power to exposing its fallacies and dangers .
Carl Menger refuted the labor theory of value , his student Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk demolished Marx 's views of capital , F.A. Hayek showed the incompatibility between socialism and political freedom , and Ludwig von Mises attacked the core of socialist economic theory . [ 6 ]
It was Mises 's criticism that has proven to be the most prescient .
In his 1920 essay " Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth , " he argued that the socialist economy could n't properly be called an " economy " at all , since the system provides no means for rationally allocating resources .
It abolishes private property in capital goods , thereby eliminating the markets that produce prices with which to calculate profit and loss .
The absence of rational economic calculation , and the institutional structures that undergird it , prevents any realistic assessment of the proper uses and opportunity costs and resource allocation options .
" As soon as one gives up the conception of a freely established monetary price for goods of a higher order , " Mises wrote , " rational production becomes completely impossible . "
The central planners of an industrial economy will find themselves in a perpetual state of confusion and ignorance , " groping in the dark . "
" Marxism was a means of political rent seeking and of coercive control , not a body of ideas held to by honest men . "
" One may anticipate the nature of the future socialist society , " he said seventy years before the rest of the world was to become convinced .
" There will be hundreds and thousands of factories in operation .
Very few of these will be producing wares ready for use ; in the majority of cases what will be manufactured will be unfinished goods and production goods …
Every good will go through a whole series of stages before it is ready for use .
In the ceaseless toil and moil of this process , however , the administration will be without any means of testing their bearings . "
From my life and study in Moscow , I can attest to the truth of this prediction .
In an economy , nearly every consumption good requires several stages of production .
The more natural resources used and the more complex the technology involved , the more stages of production are required .
Yet lacking an ability to see a production process through to ends that consumers desire , Soviet socialism produced only military hardware , useless goods , goods to make other goods , while consumers were deprived of bare essentials . [ 7 ]
In the late 1980s , when glasnost at last permitted Soviet economists to speak out , they confirmed the death sentence that Mises had pronounced .
As Martin Malia put it , " through the voices of Nikolay Shmelev , Gavriil Popov , Vasiliy Selyunin , Grigory Khanin , Larisa Piyasheva , Mikhail Berger , and subsequently Grigoriy Yavlinksy and Yegor Gaidar , they offered us a portrait of the Soviet that was in full accord with the evaluations of … Ludwig von Mises , whose book contains hardly a single figure and not a word about GNP . " [ 8 ]
This powerful confirmation , Malia points out , led to " methodological smuta " ( " Time of Troubles " in Russian ) in Western economics .
A common mistake Western observers made was to think the Soviet Union 's fundamental problem was a lack of democracy .
They completely overlooked that the institutional structure of the political system cannot overcome the problem inherent in an economic system with no means of rational calculation .
The Soviet Union had a number of leaders who promised political reform , but none was able to put bread on the table .
In fact , the primary problem in the Soviet Union was socialism , and it is still far from being dismantled in the nations that once made up that evil empire .
The present " capitalist revolution " in Russia was best described by Russian publicist Viktor Kopin : it is a " quasi - democratic society with a quasi- market of quasi-legality and quasi-morality .
The predominant conclusion out of this is that freedom leads to the destruction of spirituality , crime , pauperization of the masses , and the emergence of a class of fat cats . "
The decades - long effort to eliminate markets destroyed the work ethic , the mass misallocation of resources through centralized investment , the demolition of the base for private capital accumulation , distorted means of economic calculation , and technology so obsolete that the capital value of industrial enterprises is zero or negative .
Most heavy industries were built during Stalin 's Industrialization Program in the 1930s and have not been updated since .
A huge part of Russian industrial stock is as productive as an industrial - history museum .
" When glasnost at last permitted Soviet economists to speak out , they confirmed the death sentence that Mises had pronounced . "
The crisis in socialist agriculture goes back to the 1920s and ' 30s , when millions of the most productive peasant households were branded as " kulaks , " and exiled to Siberia .
Most of them could not survive the hardships and purges and perished there .
Agriculture still has not recovered from this collectivization and blanket nationalization of property that turned owners into prison laborers .
At the beginning of the century , Russia exported wheat , rye , barley , and oats to the world market .
Today Russia is the world 's largest importer of grain .
Russia 's consumer prices index registered the inflation rate to be 1,240 percent in 1992 , instead of the promised 100 percent .
Even as the chairman of the Russian central bank blamed the government for not pumping enough liquidity into the system , Russia 's printing presses have not been able to keep up with demand .
Credit markets remain centrally controlled , and serious monetary reform is nowhere in sight .
Larisa Piyasheva — the only visible economist close to the Austrian school in present - day Russia — believes that total privatization alone will not solve all the problems , but without it , there is no hope .
She was fired by Yeltsin 's government due to '' budget cuts . " [ 9 ]
If the present looks bleak , the recent history of the Soviet Union remains widely misunderstood .
No one figure represents the confusion better than Mikhail Gorbachev .
In the West , he was and is considered the great reformer — witness the title of Princeton Professor Stephen Cohen 's New York Times op - ed , " Gorbachev the Great . "
If Gorbachev was a reformer , he was hardly the first Soviet politician to use so - called reforms to maintain power .
Lenin was a reformer too , and he resorted to extraordinary means to save communism .
As a result of Lenin 's efforts to impose real utopian socialism — not the bureaucratized model that existed until recently — the entire population was dying out .
Had he continued on that course , he would not have had any subjects to rule .
Then he initiated the New Economic Policy , which allowed markets and private property . [ 10 ]
According to historian Alec Nove , Lenin
kept stubbornly on the course of all - round nationalization , centralization , the elimination of money , and above all , the maintenance of [ grain requisitioning ] .
There was no pressure on him from his colleagues to change this policy .
Events , rather than the central committee , provided a potent means of persuasion .
Gorbachev too tried to save communism through other means .
That was the original point behind glasnost and perestroika ( and probably why these petty measures were so heralded in the West ) .
Even the KGB understood the need for reform .
As the chief ideologue of the KGB , Philip Bobkov , has said , " The KGB understood very well , back in 1985 , that the USSR would not be able to make further progress without perestroika . "
By the people in the Soviet Union Gorbachev was rightly considered to be just another Communist Party hack .
His " reforms " were never fundamental , but only expedient measures to preserve the centrality of the Soviet Communist Party and to salvage what was left of the socialist system .
Gorbachev was only willing to " reform " when the world was falling apart around him .
He was in a good position to know better .
He was from a peasant family in South Russia , where he witnessed first hand the malnutrition , hunger , and even starvation that socialism caused .
His grandfather was killed in Stalin 's purges , so he knew the brutality of Communist politics .
Yet he chose to make politics his life 's work .
For Gorbachev , the exercise of power has always been more important than good sense or morality .
It was a Western fantasy that the man named to be general secretary of the Communist Party would not be a devoted Communist .
As in joining a street gang , you must demonstrate that you are absolutely loyal to the club ( and all its associated crimes ) and that your conscience can be overridden .
During Gorbachev 's long political climb , he passed more than one hundred such political and security clearances .
The main difference between Gorbachev and his predecessors was that he was smarter and smoother .
He was also the first one with a university education : a masters in law and a masters in agriculture .
Given Soviet education , that is probably why the first thing he did was ruin the agricultural distribution system .
While he was in agricultural school in Stavropol , Russia , he was chief of the local Communist Party .
His colleagues report that he ordered his professors to come from the university to Gorbachev 's office to tutor and test him .
Gorbachev became secretary of agriculture under the Yuri Andropov regime , and endeared himself to the Party Secretary by promoting a cult of Andropov .
He promoted films about him and mandated that streets be named after him .
Andropov returned the favor by promoting Gorbachev in the Party bureaucracy .
Of course , Andropov is one of the most hardened of all Soviet leaders .
As ambassador to Hungary , he ordered the invasion of that great country in 1956 , and while head of the KGB in 1968 , he persecuted dissidents by the tens of thousands ( including Solzhenitsyn ) , presiding over the darkest period in KGB history .
" A common mistake Western observers made was to think the Soviet Union 's fundamental problem was a lack of democracy . "
Later , Gorbachev became secretary of ideology during the Chernenko regime , and as early as 1984 , he was making overtures to Margaret Thatcher .
What Thatcher did not know , or refused to believe , was that Gorbachev 's goal was to save Soviet communism ( meaning the power of the Party ) and given the dire circumstances he faced , that meant " reform . "
Yet a reformist communist is only marginally better than an orthodox one .
His goals and methods should have been condemned , just as one would condemn a successor to Hitler who claimed to be a " reformist Nazi . "
Gorbachev never learned economics in school .
In all my dealings with him , I never saw even a slight flash of economic insight , or even any desire to learn more about economics .
He preferred to think like a communist : everything can be done by issuing orders , no matter how perverse , contrary to human nature , and brutal they may be .
Beginning with the day he assumed power , he positioned himself as an opponent of freedom and the market .
He singlehandedly destroyed what little market activity existed in the Soviet Union , wrecked the already - miserable lives of the public , presided over appalling violence against innocent people in the Baltic states , and openly supported old - guard communists .
Yet the Western media decided not to be skeptical about his aims .
Gorbachev 's original theory was that the socialist system was in good working order , but the people , the cogs in the communist machine , had taken to laziness , drunkenness , and were accumulating " dishonest income " in violation of socialist ethics .
His first reform was to call for " a restructuring of people 's thinking . "
The anti-alcohol campaign began right away .
Party bosses sternly announced that they did n't want any " drunks " in their country .
Their enforcers began a concerted effort to discover anyone with the smell of alcohol on their breath and haul them into the police station .
When the police stations became overcrowded , it became routine practice to drive thousands of people about fifteen miles out of town and drop them in the cold and dark .
Nearly every night , you could see armies of so - called drunks walking miles back to town in the middle of winter .
Over 90 percent of liquor stores were closed .
The Party bosses did not anticipate what happened next : sugar , flour , aftershave , and window cleaner immediately disappeared from the shelves .
Using these products , the production of moonshine increased by about 300 percent in one year .
The predictable result was a heavy loss of life .
From 13,000 to 25,000 people died from drinking poisonous homemade alcohol .
Many more died standing in lines for five hours to get the little bit of official liquor that was left .
Meanwhile , Gorbachev and loyal Party bureaucrats — who said the dead deserved their fate — would get expensive liquor from the West delivered to their homes and offices .
Many families would spend up to 75 percent of their official income on alcohol .
But with Gorbachev 's campaign , every other household began moonshining .
" Gorbachev was from a peasant family in South Russia , where he witnessed first hand the malnutrition , hunger , and even starvation that socialism caused .
Revenues from alcohol sales ( taxed up to 6,000 percent ) were a major source of funding for the central government , generating enough to fund the entire medical budget .
The campaign ended when the government realized it was costing too much .
The government 's budget began to lose 25 – 30 billion rubles per year .
Moreover , Gorbachev learned what previous regimes had understood : it is easier to govern people who are drunk because they withstand humiliation and abuse better .
When people are sober they begin to care about politics and are not nearly as passive .
So Gorbachev did an about - face and ordered a massive increase in alcohol production .
And he had the government make it available to be sold everywhere , even toyshops and bakeries .
The anti-alcohol campaign did irreparable damage to the economy .
With state revenues having been severely curtailed , an economic chain reaction set in that hurt every sector .
The central bank began to print money , leaving too much money chasing too few goods .
Consumers used to get enough to survive from state stores , but new disposable income saved from not buying alcohol was spent on goods .
The end result was massive shortages .
And to correct for the deficit , services were drastically cut , even while Gorbachev restricted private alternatives .
Then Gorbachev began a campaign against " dishonest income . "
Like Stalin and Khrushchev before him , he declared all sources of income other than official salary to be an evil to be stamped out .
For example , if a person rented a room out in his house , he received " dishonest income " and all parties would be severely punished .
The problem was not a single person in the Soviet Union was untainted by unofficial economic activity .
The official economy did not produce enough of anything desirable , so if a person was untainted , he was probably already dead .
Party bureaucrats bulldozed thousands of gardens in the backyards of peasant 's homes , often filled with fresh fruits and vegetables .
" Illicit " farmers ' markets were closed .
The bureaucrats cracked down on such activity as currency exchanges and unofficial transportation .
Chaos reigned in the housing market , where the penalty for renting out an apartment for profit would be to have your whole home confiscated .
To make sure that all goods sold were licitly produced , bureaucrats enforced a system of applying certificates to all goods .
To get one , a person had to prove that whatever he was selling at the market was approved ahead of time .
But the system was evaded like everything else : the certificates were sold by petty bureaucrats for high bribes .
Even after the Chernobyl nuclear accident , a vendor could pay a bureaucrat a fee to have food declared radiation free .
Price controls in cooperative markets were strictly enforced , so that all prices had to be the same as in state stores .
For example , beef was supposed to be 4 rubles per kilo .
As a working economist in Moscow , my first thought was , " all beef will disappear from the market . "
But when I went to the market to see what was going on , to my surprise beef was available .
It turns out that farmers were shrewdly selling 4 rubles ' worth of beef , but attached would be a huge dinosaur - sized bone that brought the total weight to one kilo .
With a complex system of selling meat plus huge bones , supply and demand met and there were no meat shortages .
" A reformist communist is only marginally better than an orthodox one .
His goals and methods should have been condemned , just as one would condemn a successor to Hitler who claimed to be a ' reformist Nazi ' . "
Things were different in the market for rabbit meat , which was supposed to sell for 3 rubles per kilo .
It was impossible to find a bone heavy enough to add to the total weight that could also have plausibly come from a rabbit .
Rabbit meat disappeared very quickly .
The campaign against dishonest income made the unofficial economy even more unofficial and therefore less efficient .
For customers it meant very high prices , because any operator remaining in the underground added a large risk premium to their products .
The most visible results of the campaign against dishonest income were an increase in bribes and a reshuffling of power in favor of the bureaucrat - led mafia .
Soviet bureaucrats were always pleased when new laws were passed because it gave them a chance to extract even more bribes .
It was especially helpful when the punishments for violating the law were severe ; it provided an opportunity to scare people .
People in higher positions could use information to control underlings , or even to leapfrog to higher positions .
So many of Gorbachev 's people used their information to extract bribes and advance their careers .
Within the first year , 150,000 people went to prison for making dishonest income , 24,000 of whom were top bureaucrats .
Nobody went to jail in the name of enforcing the law or the Constitution .
They were sent because they were unable to evade someone else 's personal vendetta , or they were destroyed by bribes demanded by their black - market competition .
Government officials were reluctant to take cash bribes because it would mean going to prison .
So they worked through intermediaries like the police .
A policeman would come to visit someone in their home or office , and threaten him with severe punishment for some alleged indiscretion .
The accused must come up with enough bribe money to clear his name .
I once knew a man who was head of a huge , multi- hundred - thousand - ruble furniture manufacturing enterprise .
He did his best to stay away from underground activities , and on his salary he could afford to .
But he had an enemy in the Party , and one day he got a visit from a policeman accusing him of dishonesty in record keeping .
( Police work is a highly valued occupation because of the opportunity for receiving bribes . )
Instead of paying the appropriate bribe , the man maintained his innocence .
Then a team of six accountants came into his offices and combed through his records over a period of weeks .
Finally , they found a 34 - ruble mistake , which they said was deliberate dishonesty .
After a hearing , the state attorney threatened the man with eight years in prison .
His own attorney , whom he had to bribe , told him the best solution was to pay 15,000 rubles — divided among the prosecutors , the bureaucrats , and the judge — so the affair could end .
The man finally gave in and paid the bribe .
Still , the judge punished him for his prior intransigence by giving him a one - year suspended sentence .
The law against dishonest income even affected academia , where many professors took bribes for good grades .
After the law took effect , a tremendous reshuffling took place at universities , based on a complex matrix of exchanges of information and bribes .
It is easy to see how the campaign completely discouraged people from any kind of economic activity .
Since the state sector was heavily subsidized , and price controls were enforced at cooperatives , a sizable portion of what market did exist was destroyed .
And this was under Gorbachev 's hand .
The campaign , begun in 1986 , lasted only one year .
" Gorbachev preferred to think like a communist : everything can be done by issuing orders , no matter how perverse , contrary to human nature , and brutal they may be . "
After wreaking havoc on the economy through his first two campaigns , Gorbachev initiated a third : in favor of " labor discipline , " that is , forcing people to show up on time and work harder .
In this , Gorbachev was following a similar campaign by his mentor Andropov ( who had people rounded up in the streets and destroyed their lives for not acting like slaves ) .
Gorbachev initiated harsh measures against " lazy " people , making it easier to find and prosecute anybody the government did not like .
If a person was absent for three hours , they would lose their job .
Instead of giving two weeks ' notice to change jobs , employees had to give two months ' .
Enterprises would hold three - hour meetings , on paid time , to denounce one person for being ten minutes late to work and blame him for all problems .
People out in public in midday were questioned and harassed .
This campaign came to a quick halt because it antagonized many people and did not seem to be helping the economy .
In fact , the problem was not labor discipline .
The problem was Gorbachev 's absurd campaigns in favor of a failed economic system .
Gorbachev 's final effort , before he began speaking about " the market , " was a short - lived campaign for new " quality " standards .
The central plan had always emphasized the quantity of output , but never the quality .
So 150,000 new bureaucrats were hired to oversee the " quality of output . "
Every state enterprise had a special division on quality that would police the factory , providing ever more opportunities for bribes — resulting in more bribes and more failure .
That was the last attempt to resuscitate the communist world through conventional means .
Yet Gorbachev still had not gotten the message .
At a closing speech to the Central Committee in June 1987 , Gorbachev said that he would " rebuff anyone who offers us antisocialist alternatives . "
When all else was exhausted , Gorbachev began to speak about markets — a " planned , regulated , socialist market . "
He had his paid academics find quotes from Marx and Lenin to support his new idea , which is easy to do since together their work makes up 105 volumes .
No one takes Marx and Lenin as gospel , but the head communist always has to justify his deeds with the Holy Writ of communism .
The first effort in the creation of this new market was to enact huge " budget cuts . "
Even government propaganda reinforced the change .
Films showed Party chiefs as beggars on the street , sitting with their derbies in hand , while rich , fat free marketeers generously flipped them kopeks .
Everyone was paralyzed with fear that they would be fired , and so by the second half of 1987 , most people simply stopped working .
The budget cuts appeared to be a reality when Gorbachev sacked 600,000 bureaucrats from central operations of the ministries — which amounts to 30 percent to 50 percent of each department .
Alongside that , however , he also created a set of new mega - enterprises to substitute for the ministries .
A study I did of these new enterprises at the time showed they hired 720,000 people , most of them just - fired bureaucrats , but with a generous 35 percent salary increase .
Gorbachev's " cuts " actually represented a twenty percent increase in the managerial sector of the Soviet state , which was exactly the point of the move .
The old structures of the command economy began to disintegrate with all these changes , reversals , and talk of creating a market .
But since no market was actually set up , everything came to a standstill .
" The head communist always has to justify his deeds with the Holy Writ of communism . "
The Law on Cooperatives — a new regulation allowing pseudoprivate ownership — seemed to be a step in the right direction .
But in fact the newly created cooperatives became an organized mafia themselves , extracting and paying out bribes at an unprecedented rate .
As soon as a person started a business , the fire department would arrive to close everything down and then wait for bribes .
A person could sue the fire department , but he would have to pay a bribe to the judge .
In the Soviet Union , people learned that it is better to pay bribes directly .
Thus Gorbachev 's new " market " was not an authentic one .
It piled new regulations and ministries on top of the old , and never allowed private property and real buying and selling .
A young man from a peasant family I knew had heard that market activity was legal , and decided to raise a pig to sell in the market .
For six months , this hopeful entrepreneur devoted his time and money to caring for it and feeding it , hoping he would earn twice his money back by selling it .
Never was a man so happy as when he took the pig to market one morning .
That night I found him drunk and depressed .
He was not a drinker , so I asked him what happened .
When he arrived at the market , a health inspector immediately chopped off a third of the pig .
The inspector said he was looking for worms .
Then the police came and picked the best part of it , and left without even saying thank you .
He had to pay bribes to the officials in charge of the market to get a space to sell what was left .
And he had to sell the meat at state prices .
By the end of the day , he earned barely enough to buy one bottle of vodka , which he had just finished drinking .
This was Gorbachev 's new market in a nutshell .
Long before the coup that ousted Gorbachev , thwarted by Yeltsin and leading to the end of the Soviet Union , talk of creating a market ceased , and all real reformers had resigned their positions in the government .
Gorbachev used the term " markets " — a term that Western reporters liked — as an excuse for more repression .
To this end , he undertook a totalitarian effort to withdraw all 50 - and 100 - ruble notes from circulation , giving people only three days to turn them in , give a full accounting of where they got their money , and get very little money back .
This was necessary , said Gorbachev , to eliminate " speculation , corruption , smuggling , forgery , unearned income , and normalizing the monetary situation and the consumer market . "
All money unaccounted for was confiscated .
Because there were no goods in the market to buy with rubles , people had stockpiled them .
Gorbachev 's measures wiped out thousands of people 's life savings .
It was nothing more than an explicit attempt to wipe out the " underground economy , " which in fact was the only real market in the Soviet Union and the only source of real production .
The last Soviet dictators to do this were Khrushchev in 1961 , and before him , Stalin in 1947 – 48 .
Both permitted a ten - for - one exchange of old notes for new , and the result was an explosion of political oppression of the government 's enemies .
Gorbachev 's last gasp on behalf of the " market " was a onetime price reform to bring them in line with prices in the West .
But it was no more an improvement than it is when the US Post Office raises the price of stamps .
It was not a step in the right direction ; it only indicated a continued desire to control the economy from above .
It was the first time since 1961 that the prices of basic goods changed .
Yet the prices for basic goods in the Soviet Union were already extremely high .
A person had to work 12 times longer there to buy beef than here , 18 to 20 times longer for poultry , seven times longer for butter , three times longer for milk , 16 times longer for a color television , and 180 times longer for a car .
With the new price hikes , the required work hours multiplied by two or three times .
It is easy to understand why one fifth of the population lived at the poverty line , below which meant serious malnutrition .
The government said 85 percent of the new revenues would go back into raising the wages of workers and peasants , but , in fact , most of it went into government coffers to pay the military and run failed state enterprises .
" Gorbachev used the term ' markets ' as an excuse for more repression . "
The Soviets also cut subsidies to key staple goods , and that is partly why people saw this as a promarket reform .
But under state ownership , in effect , all goods produced are subsidized , that is , not tested by the competitive market .
Instead of directly financing production out of the state budget , they did it by arbitrarily increasing the prices for monopoly goods .
The Gorbachev government implemented the " reform " to raise revenue to pay for its fiscal shortfall .
The Soviets expected revenue of 23.4 billion rubles in the first two months of 1991 , but they only received 7 billion — less than one third the expected amount .
The central government did not receive any of the 48 billion rubles it expected from the republics for a fund to implement the new union treaty .
And the official budget deficit showed it was already higher than the figure predicted for the entire year ( 31.1 billion rubles compared with 26.7 billion ) .
Three key advisers to Gorbachev began to fear the worst : that the Soviets would not be able to pay the army , pay the welfare payments , or run state enterprises unless something was done .
Finance minister Vladimir Orlov , State Bank Chairman Victor Geraschenko , and Budget Chairman Victor Kucherenko were so alarmed that they sent a note to Gorbachev saying that " the economy is on the brink of a catastrophe " — by which they meant the solvency of the central Soviet government .
Why did Gorbachev insist on hailing his price hikes as market reform ?
First , he wanted to impress the Bush administration and the World Bank with his intentions , which could then be turned into hard currency .
Second , he wanted to fool the Soviet people who wanted reform to a free market .
Third , he was anxious to discredit the idea of markets ; when this plan failed , he was preparing to allow the market to take the blame .
Henry Kissinger , the Nobel Prize Committee , and many others have given credit to Gorbachev for the events of 1989 in Eastern Europe , which brought down the communist regimes there .
Gorbachev 's real strategy in those countries , however , was to replace the old - guard Stalinists ( with poor images ) with young men like himself who drank the same brands of brandy .
He hoped he could put smoother , smarter men in power in an effort to save socialism .
The situation fell out of his control , largely because the KGB had misinformed him about how deep the hatred toward socialism was in those countries .
The revolutions of Eastern Europe happened in spite of Gorbachev , not because of him .
What he did in the Baltic States — authorizing the Soviet military to crack the skulls of innocent people in the Baltics — qualified him to be included among history 's litany of murderous rulers , but he was never included .
Even while he was heralded in the West as a great reformer , he was also running labor camps , committing human - rights violations , and sending people to prison for speech crimes .
As the Soviet Union came to an end , the public had been reduced to a collective of hunter - gatherers , barely existing at a subsistence level .
Before the coup that removed him from power , Gorbachev told a reporter ,
I 've been told more than once that it is time to stop swearing allegiance to socialism .
Why should I ? Socialism is my deep conviction , and I will promote it as long as I can talk and work .
Western academics and media pundits found his support for socialism charming , if a little outdated .
But the people who lived under the system felt differently .
They knew socialism had proven itself the most destructive ideology in human history — responsible for untold millions of deaths .
For those populations onto whom socialism was imposed , it impoverished them , wiped out their cultural heritage , and in many cases , resulted in massive bloodshed .
President George Bush played no small part in keeping Gorbachev in power longer than he should have been , sticking by him , and doing everything politically possible to support him .
Bush lent his support to the only major world leader without a democratic mandate , a man despised by his subjects , who imposed a system antithetical to Western values .
Is it an American tradition that the US president should support the head of Soviet communism in time of need ?
Similarly , Herbert Hoover bailed out Lenin , Franklin Roosevelt bailed out Stalin , and George Bush rescued Gorbachev . [ 11 ]
For six and a half years , Gorbachev straddled the fence between reform and the status quo .
As part of his effort to carve out this incoherent third way , he gathered around him a group of hard - line communists .
Eventually , they became his closest advisers and the most powerful people in the country — militarily , economically , and politically .
It was that same old guard that tried to slit Gorbachev 's throat during the failed coup on August 19 , 1991 .
Six of the Gang of Eight who organized the coup against him were directly appointed by him .
Before he elevated them to power , they were little more than lightweight bureaucrats .
Had the coup succeeded , the structure and personnel of the coup government would have been much the same as it was before .
For example , Gennadi Yanayev , president for a day , was appointed by Gorbachev as secretary of trade unions and then promoted to vice president .
Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov was responsible for many of the economic blunders of the previous year that inflamed the public , including the price hikes , the ruble reform , and excessive money creation .
And Anatoly Lukyanov , president of the Supreme Soviet , was a close confidant of Gorbachev's .
Gorbachev appointed and protected these six as part of his compromise strategy to placate the hardliners .
They were utterly lacking in charisma , so Gorbachev assumed they could not be a threat .
But they tried to be .
He should have expected that communists can only be trusted to behave like communists , and for this reason , he bore primary responsibility for the coup .
Had he conducted himself as he ought to have during his six and a half years in power , he could have spared himself and his country this harrowing experience .
" The revolutions of Eastern Europe happened in spite of Gorbachev , not because of him . "
Everyone in the higher reaches of power had known for some time that a coup against Gorbachev would be a snap .
One evening in Moscow , I discussed the possibility with a friend of mine , a general in the Soviet Army .
He told me that an actual coup would be the easy part .
" We could take power in ten minutes , " he said .
" But then what ?
We have no sausages , no bread — nothing to offer the people . "
The Moscow junta hoped its power grab would be bolstered by Gorbachev 's low popularity .
But as much as the people hated their ruler , they hated the coup leaders more .
The coup government achieved only a short moment of glory .
Once in power , it faced a people seething with anger at the crimes of totalitarianism and the poverty of socialism .
The coup leaders also faced a hard winter , a very bad harvest , and the prospect of mass starvation .
They lost their nerve , and Boris Yeltsin thwarted their efforts .
The coup attempt , ironically , illustrated that communist economic ideology had been discredited .
The Stalinist leaders of the Soviet coup never spoke of Marx or Lenin , or of resuscitating the machinery of central planning and nationalization .
They spoke instead of market reforms , however insincere they may have been .
Any alternative rhetoric would have brought them even more unpopularity than they already had .
Note that this was despite the fact that the command system had brought the people more material goods than Gorbachev 's confused system of perestroika .
At his first news conference after the Soviet coup attempt , Gorbachev promised : " I will struggle until the very end for the renewal of this party .
I am a true believer in socialism . "
He could not have delivered a greater insult to the Soviet peoples , who quickly resumed their demands that he resign .
Conventional wisdom has long said the Russians are culturally inclined toward passivity , authoritarianism , and envy .
Hendrick Smith has made a career out of promoting this idea .
The heroic actions of the people during the coup and after told the real truth : the Russians are like people everywhere who want freedom from arbitrary rule .
They have been the victims of a tragic past , but their desire to be free from chains of slavery triumphed .
Once Boris Yeltsin assumed control of the government from Gorbachev , the Soviet Union fell apart completely .
And at the age of 74 , on December 8 , 1991 , the Soviet Union died .
Since that time , the Yeltsin government has proven another point : Gorbachevian socialism was not the only way to ruin an economy 's wealth - creating potential .
During the first wave of Yeltsin 's reforms in Russia , prices soared twentyfold instead of the promised twofold .
Production dropped 15 percent since last year ( compared with a 13 percent drop in 1990 ) .
New foreign and domestic contracts in 1992 amount to only seven percent of the 1991 level .
And 1991 was supposed to be a " bad " year , with only two percent of the new contracts in 1985 .
To top it off , the budget deficit exceeded 35 percent of the GDP .
The outlook for the economy continued to look worse and worse .
This is not because Yeltsin had not applied the advice from Western academics and World Bank bureaucrats .
The problem was he took them at their word when they said flexible prices , not private property , were what the Russian economy needed .
" The coup government faced a people seething with anger at the crimes of totalitarianism and the poverty of socialism . "
Contrary to all the promises and beliefs of Russian Keynesians headed by the Yeltsin economic minister Yegor Gaidar , we watched a simultaneous increase in prices and a fall - off in production .
Because the essence of socialism is public ownership , without dismantling this system , none of Yeltsin's " reforms " will work .
Like Gorbachev before him , Yeltsin 's government is directed at " restructuring the state regulatory mechanism . "
" We cannot link the restructuring of the regulatory mechanism to full - scale privatization , " wrote his chief economist .
" If we did , we simply would n't live long enough to see it . "
Meanwhile , every new announcement of impending reform causes perverse public responses and every new law passed , ostensibly to increase freedom , only increases opportunities for fines and bribes .
Former communists urgently sought a replacement for archaic Marxism - Leninism , and they found it in " gosudarsvennichestvo , " or the " cult of the state . "
Based on Max Weber 's theorizing , it exalts bureaucratic , hierarchical , centralized management .
A series of organizations were founded to support this ideology , including the Russian National Union , the Party of Regeneration , and the Civic Union .
The sad legacy of Marxism is the mindset of certain people , both in the East and West , who believe that the state can cure all economic ills and bring about social justice .
Yet a return to central management under whatever label is not the solution — but neither is the status quo .
What is needed in the former Soviet Union and Soviet client states is a wholesale repudiation of the legacy of Marx .
In the United States , too , Marx 's ideas influenced a generation of reformers during the Progressive Era ( out of which came modern central banking and the progressive income tax ) , the New Deal , and the Great Society — and continues to infect departments of literature and sociology in major universities .
Remarkably , even after the fall of Soviet and East European social regimes , Marxism has not lost all its academic cachet . [ 12 ]
" I think it 's an exciting time to be a Marxist , " Steve Cullenberg of the University of California at Riverside told the Associated Press .
He was among the 2,000 academics who attended the University of Massachusetts at Amherst conference in November 1992 entitled " Marxism in the New World Order : Crises and Possibilities . "
The mass media , moreover , pays tribute to Marx 's honor every time it uses the terms " progressive " and " reactionary , " demonstrating an unwitting acceptance of Marx 's version of the historical inevitability of socialism .
In Requiem for Marx , we attempt to set the record straight on a subject clouded with economic , historical , and philosophical error .
Accordingly , the essays here can be regarded as revisionist .
David Gordon shows exactly how much Marx has been misunderstood in a wholesale reevaluation of Marx 's philosophical basis for socialism .
Hans - Hermann
Hoppe recasts
Marx 's argument about the class struggle in line with an Austrian understanding of the state and economy , and arrives at entirely different conclusions from Marx 's own .
Personal history is never out of bounds at a requiem , and Gary North piles on evidence that Marx 's personal habits — financial and otherwise — strayed far from the socialist ideal .
David Osterfeld demonstrates that much of Marx 's view of the world rests on empirical propositions that turn out to be false and definitions that turn out to be shallow and analytically useless .
The doctrine of the classes , properly understood , is a useful framework , argues Ralph Raico , but it was taken from an older and sounder classical - liberal school of 18th - century France .
And finally , Murray Rothbard argues that Marx 's communist views of history , property , marriage , and much else , were rooted in the bloody millenarianism of the Middle Ages , thereby representing nothing uniquely evil in the history of thought .
Contra Marx , these essays offer another vision of what an economy needs : private property , defined as both autonomous ownership and control of homesteaded resources ; free prices , which provide the means of calculating profits and loss , the measure of economic usefulness and waste ; freedom of contract , which allows free exchange of privately owned resources ; and the rule of law , which establishes institutional structures that protect the previous three conditions from third - party intervention .
Until these are firmly in place , there can be no hope for getting back on the road to economic prosperity .
Taken together , the essays present Marx in an entirely different light than most any literature on the subject .
In short , among scholarly works , this is probably the most anti-Marxist collection ever published .
We are confident that many who have lived under systems constructed in Marx 's name now share this perspective .
After the fall of communism , who can possibly defend Marxism ?
Plenty of people , many of them smart otherwise but uneducated in economics .
This book is the antidote , covering the whole history of this nutty and dangerous system of thought .
After this introduction by the editor Yuri Maltsev come sweeping essays by David Gordon and Hans - Hermann Hoppe that get into the guts of the Marxian system and show where it went wrong from both a philosophical and economic perspective .
Hoppe in particular here shows how Marx took classical liberal doctrine on the state and misapplied it in ways that contradicted all logic and experience .
Gary North provides a devastating look at Marx the man , while Ralph Raico zeros in on the Marxian doctrine of class .
Finally , and as a triumphant finish , Rothbard offers a wholesale revision of the basis of Marxism .
It was not economics , he says .
It was the longing for a universal upheaval to overthrow all things we know about the world and replace it with a crazed fantasy based secular / religious longings .
Rothbard finds all this in the unknown writings of Marx and his postmillennial predecessors in the history of ideas .

One critic has playfully praised Marvell for his ability to make one " think of pumpkins and eternity in one breath , " but vegetable in this case is only indirectly related to edible plants .
Here the word is used figuratively in the sense " having the property of life and growth , as does a plant , " a use based on an ancient religious and philosophical notion of the tripartite soul .
As interpreted by the Scholastics , the vegetative soul was common to plants , animals , and humans ; the sensitive soul was common to animals and humans ; and the rational soul was found only in humans .
" Vegetable love " is thus a love that grows , takes nourishment , and reproduces , although slowly .
Marvell 's use in the 1600s illustrates the original sense of vegetable , first recorded in the 1400s .
In the 1500s , the adjectival meaning of vegetable familiar to us , " having to do with plants , " begins to appear , along with the first instances of vegetable as a noun meaning " a plant . "
It is not until the 1700s , however , that we find the noun and adjective used more restrictively to refer specifically to certain kinds of plants that are eaten .

Maybe It 's Your Civic Duty Not to Vote Experts debate whether uninformed voters should head to the polls .
Oct. 9 , 2008  --
We keep hearing how important it is for everyone to vote and that voting is our civic duty .
Celebrities like Christina Aguilera , Leonardo DiCaprio , Diddy and Dave Matthews urge everyone to get out and vote .
And to help people vote , voter registration groups such as HeadCount deploy volunteers to sign people up .
Watch John Stossel 's " Politically Incorrect Guide to Politics " at 10 p.m. on Friday , Oct. 17 .
HeadCount focuses on registering young people at rock concerts and music festivals around the country .
During the concerts , famous musicians such as Eddie Vedder and Jack Johnson implore their fans to sign up to vote .
Marc Brownstein , the bassist for the band The Disco Biscuits and a co-founder of HeadCount , tells fans to " please participate this year by casting your vote ! "
Brownstein and a friend , Andy Bernstein , co-founded HeadCount in 2004 .
" We do this because we want the kids to be a part of the political process , " Brownstein said .
Bernstein added , " We registered over 100,000 people .
...
It is so imperative that this generation 's voice is heard .
And they are being heard . "
But are these get - out - the - vote drives entirely a good thing ?
" 20/20 " asked some newly registered young people some basic questions about our government .
Some people were knowledgeable .
" There are two senators from each state , making a total of 100 , " one young voter said .
Another knew that " the Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments to the Constitution . "
But many of the young voters did n't seem very informed .
Some did n't know how many states are in the U.S. or how many senators there are .
Few could explain Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court ruling upholding abortion rights .
" Roe v. Wade is segregation maybe ? " one new voter guessed .
Another asked : " Was Roe v. Wade where we declared bankruptcy ? "
And still another wondered , " That was about a black person and a white person ? "
Brownstein said , " There 's a lot of uninformed voters out there . "
So should those uninformed voters just stay home ?
" It 's an argument that really , really smacks against everything we hold dear as Americans , " Bernstein said .
" Democracy is not about taking ... the most educated portion of the society and having them decide , " Brownstein said .
But could these voters ' civic duty be to not vote , because they know very little ?
" We do n't believe it 's their civic duty not to vote .
We 're out there telling them that it is their civic duty to vote , " Brownstein said .
Maybe it 's not fair to pick on kids at a rock concert .
So " 20/20 " moved on to our nation 's capital and spoke to prospective voters on the Washington Mall .
Certainly people there will know more , wo n't they ?
People were shown some pictures of prominent Americans , like John McCain and Barack Obama .
Everyone recognized Obama and McCain .
And maybe half the people knew who Sarah Palin was .
But Joe Biden ?
Most did n't recognize the Democratic vice presidential nominee .
Few recognized Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , yet almost everyone recognized television 's Judge Judy .
" Maybe 75 percent of people can name the vice president .
...
The public 's knowledge of politics is shockingly low , " economist Bryan Caplan said .
In his book " The Myth of the Rational Voter , " Caplan argues that people who know little about our government ought to stay home on Election Day .
But are n't Americans always told it 's their civic duty to vote ?
" This is very much like saying , ' It 's our civic duty to give surgery advice , ' " Caplan said .
" Now , we like to think that political issues are much less complicated than brain surgery , but many of them are pretty hard .
If someone does n't know what he 's talking about , it really is better if they say , ' Look , I 'm just gonna leave this in wiser hands . ' "
But is n't it elitist to say only some people should vote ?
" Is it elitist to say only some people should do brain surgery ? " Caplan said .
" The bottom line is , if you do n't know what you 're doing , you are not doing the country a favor by voting . "
Voting is serious business .
Democracy works best when people educate themselves .
So maybe instead of telling people things like " Rock the Vote , " these groups should say " Rock or Vote . "
Mike Alexander of DataPig Technologies is a Microsoft Excel MVP who has written about using Excel for data analysis .
Mike and I collaborated last month on the Excel Dashboard and Visualization Boot Camp , which went so well that we plan to offer it a few times a year .
Mike has written Excel 2007 Dashboards and Reports For Dummies , which is among the most comprehensive Dummies books I ’ve come across .
The book is geared towards Excel 2007 , but its principles and techniques are valid for any version of Excel .
Mike takes his readers through dashboard principles , data preparation and chart creation , advanced data techniques including pivot tables and dynamic ranges , automation of dashboards using VBA , and designing interactive dashboards .
Like all Dummies books , Excel 2007 Dashboards and Reports For Dummies has a “ Part of Tens ” chapter , including Ten Chart Design Principles , which Mike will write about in this post .
While Mike has written these principles , they are in agreement with principles that other graphing and visualization experts would have presented .
Without further ado , Here ’s Mike :
Ten Chart Design Principles by Mike Alexander
Excel makes charting so simple , it ’s often tempting to accept the charts it creates no matter how bad the default colors or settings are .
But I ’m here to implore you to turn away from the glitzy lure of the default settings .
You can easily avoid charting fiascos by following a few basic design principles :
Avoid Fancy Formatting Skip the Unnecessary Chart Junk Format Large numbers where possible Use Data Tables instead of Data Labels Make Effective Use of Chart Titles Sort your data before Charting Limit the use of Pie charts
Do n’t be afraid to parse data into separate charts Maintain Appropriate Aspect Ratios
Do n’t be afraid to not use a chart !
1. Avoid Fancy Formatting
Do n’t apply background colors to the Chart or Plot Area .
Colors in general should be reserved for key data points in your chart .
Do n’t use 3D charts or 3D effects .
No one is going to give you an Oscar for special effects ./ p>
Avoid applying fancy effects such as gradients , pattern fills , shadows , glow , soft edges , and other formatting .
Focus on the data and not shiny happy graphics .
Do n’t try to enhance your charts with clip art or pictures .
Not only do they do nothing to further data presentation , they often just look tacky .
2. Skip the Unnecessary Chart Junk
Remove Gridlines
Remove Borders
Skip the Trend Lines
Avoid Data Label Overload
Do n’t Show a Legend if you do n’t have to
Remove Axes that Don’t Provide Value
3. Format Large numbers where possible
When plotting very large numbers on a chart , you should consider formatting the values so that they are truncated for easy reading .
For instance , in this chart , I ’ve formatted the values to be displayed as 10 M and 17 M instead of the hard - to - read 10,475,000 and 16,906,714 .
4. Use Data Tables instead of Data Labels
A data table allows you to see the data values for each plotted data point , without overcrowding the chart itself .
Although data tables increase the space your charts take up on your dashboard , they respond well to formatting and can be made to meld nicely into your charts .
Data tables come in particularly handy if your clients are constantly asking to see the detailed information behind your charts .
5. Make Effective Use of Chart Titles
You can use chart titles to add an extra layer of information , presenting analysis derived from the data presented in the chart .
6. Sort Your Data Before Charting
Unless there is an obvious natural order such as age or time , it ’s generally good practice to sort your data when charting .
By sorting , I mean sort the source data that feeds your chart in Ascending or Descending order by data value .
7. Limit the use of Pie charts
Pie Charts typically take up more space than their cousins the line and bar charts .
Pie charts can’t clearly represent more than two or three data categories .
Bar Charts are an ideal alternative to Pie Charts .
8 . Do n’t be afraid to parse data into separate charts
A single chart can lose its effectiveness if you try to plot too much data into it .
Step back and try to boil down what exactly the chart needs to do .
What is the ultimate purpose of the chart ?
9. Maintain Appropriate Aspect Ratios
A skewed aspect ratio can distort your charts , exaggerating the trend in charts that are too tall , and flattening the trend in charts that are too wide .
Generally speaking , the most appropriate aspect ratio for a chart is one where the width of the chart is about twice as long as the height is tall .
10 .
Do n’t be afraid to not use a chart !
You typically use a chart when there is some benefit to visually seeing , trends , relationships , or comparisons .
Ask yourself if there is a benefit to seeing your data in chart form .
If the data is relayed better in a table , then that ’s how it should be presented .
Jon ’s comments on Mike ’s top ten .
You did n’t think I could let this go , did you ?
As I noted in the introduction , I concur with all of Mike ’s points , but there are a couple of things that would make Mike ’s example charts even better .
2 and 3 .
The suggestions are spot -on , but the charts can be further clarified .
Reduce confusion in the chart by maintaining a proportional axis scale ( XY not Line chart ) , so the gaps between 2000 and 2003 and between 2003 and 2004 do n’t look like the five year gaps earlier in the chart .
This makes the upswing in the last few years even more striking .
6 . This is a good practice .
However , you should sort by category if it makes sense .
The example in item 7 should be sorted in order of increasing age .
In this kind of plot , it also is important that the bins ( i.e. , age ranges of each category ) be of equal width .
If this is age of drivers , then the first age range should be something like 16 to 24 , which becomes by far the largest value in the chart .
7. Jorge Camoes showed the best collection of pie charts in The Best Pie Charts Come From Germany .
8 . This is a nice example of the use of what Edward Tufte calls small multiples .
Small multiples is part of the basis of panel charts .
9 . Adjust the aspect ratio of the chart and its X and Y axis scales so the “ average ” slope is around 45° .
This is described by Kelly O’Day in Banking to 45° to Enhance Visualization .
10 .
This was discussed by Tony Rose last week in Best Method for Illustrating a [ Single ] Data Point .
Among Mike ’s other books are Pivot Table Data Crunching for Microsoft Office Excel 2007 ( with Bill Jelen ) , Microsoft Excel and Access Integration : With Microsoft Office 2007 , Microsoft Access 2007 Data Analysis , and Excel 2007 VBA Programmer ’s Reference ( with John Green , Stephen Bullen , and Rob Bovey ) .
Price to Earnings Ratio ( P/E )
The price to earnings ratio ( denoted P/E ) measures the relationship between the share price to its earnings per share .
It is considered one of the most important metric of a company because comparing two similar companies ’
P/E shows us which is a better value .
Sometimes , people will refer to this ratio as the price to earnings multiple , or simply the multiple of a company .
What Price - Earnings Ratio Represents
The P/E ratio lets investors know what the price of a particular stock is related to the earnings it makes .
If a company makes $ 5 and has a share price of $ 50 , then the P/E is simply 10 ( 50 divided by 5 ) .
With this information , an investor can clearly see that the general public is currently willing to pay $ 10 for every $ 1 that the company makes .
This also means that the lower this number , the better value the investment potentially is .
What the Ratio is Telling Us
Investors love growth .
So a high P/E usually represents the general public anticipating high growth in the months ahead .
This could be based on the company ’s track record , anticipation of a new product launch , or macroeconomics such as a good economy .
In some ways , this ratio also tells us the confidence level in the stock .
When investors are willing to pay a higher multiple for a stock versus another , it generally means that they are more confident that the company ’s share price will rise quicker the rest .
A Simple Example
Company A and B having a stock price of $ 20 and $ 30 respectively says nothing about the relative value of the enterprises .
However , if they both earn $ 1 per share , then comparing their P/E ratio of 20 and 30 tells us that investors are currently willing to pay $ 20 for each dollar that company A earns and $ 30 for each dollar company B makes .
With this information , we can see that company A is a relatively better value than company B if all else is equal .
What to Watch Out For
Investors need to take caution when comparing P/E ratios of two companies .
If we look at different industries , we will see vast differences in P/E ratios .
For instance , technology stocks ’ having a P/E of 30 is not uncommon but an oil service company may have a P/E of 10 .
While the oil service company may look like a better value , it does not mean that every oil service company is a better investment than a technology company .
Therefore , P/E ratios should be used to compare companies in the same sector .
Another point to remember is that there are usually valid reasons why the general public is willing to pay a higher multiple for a given company .
Usually , a company with a good track record will command a higher multiple because it is less likely to disappoint the public ( ex. earnings miss , slashing dividend , surprising outlook cut etc ) .
So while it is important to compare the P/E ratio of two companies as one of the metrics to determine value of potential investments , remember to make your judgments according to the big picture .

A " lost " Beatles track once thought to have been only a myth is real , says Paul McCartney .
" Carnival of Light , " a 14 - minute - long unconventional recording of the Beatles improvising on the various instruments and noisemakers in the band 's Abbey Road studios , rejected by other members of the group for inclusion in the The Beatles Anthology , might soon see the light of day soon .
" When we were putting together the Beatles anthology album , we were looking at every little thing we 've ever recorded , " said McCartney .
" In fact , George and I – George Harrison and I – were joking that if we ever did anything else , it'd have to be called Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel , because we were just looking at every piece of rubbish or good stuff .
This [ recording ] came to light , and I said ' You know , it would be great to put this on , because it would show that we were working on some really avant - garde stuff , then .
I think it would be nice – at least a portion of it , or something . '
But it was vetoed .
The guys did n't like the idea – ' oh , it 's rubbish , ' you know .
It was a bit too weird . "
Nonetheless , Beatles fans will soon be able to hear the recording , which McCartney describes as sounding a bit like the experimental recordings of John Cage and Carl Stockhausen .
" I like it .
It 's very simplistic , it 's quite naive , but I like it because it 's the Beatles free .
The Beatles going off piste . "
McCartney agreed to put together the song for an International Timeselectronic music festival .
He convinced the other Beatles to record thetrack in January of 1967 .
" We were set up for one of the albums – it might have been The White Album
– we were set up in the studio and we'd just go in every day andrecord .
And so I said to the guys , ' Look , it 's a bit indulgent , butwould you mind just giving me ten minutes ?
I 've been asked to do thisthing .
All I want you to do is just wander ' round all the stuff – bangit , shout , play it – it does n't need to make any sense .
Hit a drum andthen wander on to the piano , hit a few notes , and just wander around .
So that 's what we did .
And then we put a bit of echo on it .
It 's veryfree . "
McCartney made the remarks as part of a BBC interview
that will be broadcast on Thursday at 7:15 pm GMT .
The recording of thesong itself has only been played once in public – at the ' 67
electronic music festival .
According to the BBC 's sources , it features " distorted guitar , organ sounds , gargling and band members shoutingphrases such as ' Barcelona ! ' and ' Are you all right ? ' "
McCartney says still wants to release the song and that he has amaster tape of the recording .
In order for us to hear it barringleakage , Ringo Starr , Yoko Ono -Lennon and Olivia Harrison would have tobe agree to its release .

This morning the Fed issued a Press Release On Unlimited Borrowing .
In order to provide broad access to liquidity and funding to financial institutions , the Bank of England ( BoE ) , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the Federal Reserve , the Bank of Japan , and the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) are jointly announcing further measures to improve liquidity in short - term U.S. dollar funding markets .
The BoE , ECB , and SNB will conduct tenders of U.S. dollar funding at 7 - day , 28 - day , and 84 - day maturities at fixed interest rates for full allotment .
Funds will be provided at a fixed interest rate , set in advance of each operation .
Counterparties in these operations will be able to borrow any amount they wish against the appropriate collateral in each jurisdiction .
Accordingly , sizes of the reciprocal currency arrangements ( swap lines ) between the Federal Reserve and the BoE , the ECB , and the SNB will be increased to accommodate whatever quantity of U.S. dollar funding is demanded .
The Bank of Japan will be considering the introduction of similar measures .
Central banks will continue to work together and are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to provide sufficient liquidity in short - term funding markets .
Federal Reserve Actions
To assist in the expansion of these operations , the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in the sizes of its temporary swap facilities with the BoE , the ECB , and the SNB , so that these central banks can provide U.S. dollar funding in quantities sufficient to meet demand .
These arrangements have been authorized through April 30 , 2009 .
Information on Related Actions Being Taken by Other Central Banks
Information on the actions that will be taken by the other central banks is available at the following websites :
Bank of England
European Central Bank
Bank of Japan

The bright lights of the big city are getting a little bit duller  with just a hint of green .
Motion sensors ensure that unoccupied offices , storerooms and canteens go dark after workers and cleaning crews leave at night .
Dimmers soften overhead lights that once could burn only bright or not at all .
Timers guarantee that buildings fade to black while the city sleeps .
Gone are the days when cheap electricity , primitive lighting technology and landlords ’ desire to showcase their skyscrapers kept floor after floor of the city ’s highest towers glowing into the night .
Now , rising energy costs , conservationism , stricter building codes and sophisticated lighting systems have conspired to slowly , often imperceptibly , transform Manhattan ’s venerable nightscape into one with a gentler glow .
Instead of tower after tower shining at all hours  the World Trade Center stayed aglow long after its occupants went home  the skyline is becoming a patchwork of sparsely sparkling buildings decorated with ornamentally lighted tops .
“ The tall tower with the illuminated floors on all night long is probably a thing of the past , ” said Randy Sabedra , the owner of RS Lighting Design , who is helping to create a new map of the city ’s most prominently lighted buildings .
“ You ’re not relying on the glowing floors to have the building presence .
It is relying on the crown of light . ”

A green light for trains
A southbound economy is n't the best backdrop when asking voters to spend billions on blueprints for new train service .
There are other hurdles : doubts about budget guarantees , the wait for the rails to start running , and are n't fancy trains French - sounding in a state filled with freeways and pick - ups ?
But to their credit , state and local voters saw the potential of reviving trains on two ballot measures .
The first was a $ 10 billion bond to build a high - speed system running 220 - mph trains between San Francisco 's Transbay Terminal and Union Station in Los Angeles .
It 's a down payment on a $ 40 billion - plus project and a public blessing for a plan that will see electric trains zipping from Sacramento to San Diego .
It 's also a financial tonic that should create jobs and could offer weary drivers and air travelers a comfortable option in a traffic - clogged state .
The plan 's biggest booster , former San Francisco legislator and judge Quentin Kopp , believes digging could begin by the end of 2010 .
On a smaller but comparable scale was the success of Measure Q , approved by Sonoma and Marin county voters .
Modern diesel trains will ride on 70 miles of refurbished rails from Cloverdale to Larkspur .
The commute system will be paid for with a quarter - cent raise in the local sales tax .
It 's a bump that voters apparently feel is preferable to time spent drumming fingers on steering wheels on backed - up Highway 101 .
Harper slams Liberal / NDP “ backroom deal ” , forgets he came to power through “ backroom deal ” himself
The hypocrisy is palpable .
From the National Post :
“ OTTAWA – Prime Minister Stephen Harper , faced with threats from the opposition parties to defeat his government on Monday , says the Liberals are trying to achieve power through a “ backroom deal ” and the House of Commons will have the opportunity to vote on the confidence motion on Dec. 8 . ”
Is the Canadian public and media ’s memory span so short that we forget the very fact that Harper created and then came to lead the newly - created Conservative Party of Canada through a “ backroom deal ” with MacKay ?
Actually it ’s worse than that because Harper made himself what he is today through making “ backroom deals ” with Peter MacKay who had himself made “ backroom deals ” with David Orchard to get himself into power .
Actually , it ’s worse than even that : MacKay and Harper were making “ backroom deals ” ( the PC / Alliance talks ) on top of “ backroom deals ” ( the MacKay / Orchard Pact ) , the latter of which actually forbade the very existence of negotiations or — you guessed it — “ backroom deals ” between the former PCs and Canadian Alliance .
I do n’t seem to remember Harper thinking “ backroom deals ” were so bad when he was the chief beneficiary of them .

Chile 's Senate unanimously approved a 10 % wage increase for public workers on Thursday , ending a strike by 400,000 state employees that had halted garbage collection , and affected health and school services .
After the unanimous 32 - 0 vote in the Senate , union leaders announced the end of the four day - strike .
The Senate vote came hours after Chile 's lower house rejected a 9.5 % wage increase .
Following the lower house loss , the government had increased its wage hike offer to 10 % and senators approved the sweetened deal .
" The workers have gained a victory , " said Arturo Martinez , leader of the Workers Central Union , the country 's largest labor federation , as he announced the end of the strike .
The wage hike proposal now returns to the lower house for a vote , where it is expected to pass .
Strikers were asking for a 14.5 % but had suggested a two - digit figure could end their stoppage .
The four - day strike had limited public health and school services in parts of Chile , as well as halting trash pickup .
Dem sources : Bill Clinton offers concessions to help Hillary get post John Byrne
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Former president Bill Clinton has proposed several concessions on his current and future activities in an effort to smooth the way for his wife to become Secretary of State , according to reports Wednesday .
Clinton has consented to disclosing the names of major donors to his charitable foundation and will allow the Obama administration to review speeches and foundation activities before they occur .
" They also said that Clinton would step away from day - to - day responsibility for his foundation while his wife serves and would alert the State Department to his speaking schedule and any new sources of income .
The Democrats spoke only on grounds of anonymity because of the private nature of the Cabinet - selection process , " AP reported .
Even so , Sen .
Clinton has n't yet decided to take the job .
" Sen . Clinton 's aides say she has n't decided to take the secretary of state job even if the vetting hurdles were cleared , " the Wall Street Journal said .
" She is weighing whether she 'd rather stay in the Senate to pass the universal health - care program that has been a centerpiece of her public career .
After being " excited " about the prospect raised by Mr. Obama , said one adviser , Sen .
Clinton is now grappling with the pros and cons in discussions with her husband , daughter Chelsea and close aides .
As the adviser said , she would have to be subordinate to other personalities , rather than having her own voice as New York 's senator . "
The Clintons have retained a team of lawyers to deal with requests and negotiations from Obama 's transition team .
" Aides familiar with the negotiations said the vetting has gone smoothly and both Clintons had been fully cooperative with the process , " AP said .
" One Clinton adviser noted that former President George H.W. Bush has given paid speeches and participated in international business ventures since his son , George W. Bush , has been president  without stirring public complaints or controversy about a possible conflict of interest . "
" Im certain President Clinton will do whatever it takes , which means whatever President - elect Obama wants , to make the nomination acceptable , if he offers and she accepts , " said Lanny Davis , former special counsel in the Clinton White House and a family friend , to the New York Times on Wednesday .
" I 'll do whatever they want , " President Clinton said at a Wednesday appearance .
He said the same at a Wednesday ceremony renaming New York 's Triborough Bridge after Robert F. Kennedy .
In short , we are living in an on - going state of emergency whose exact limits are unknown , on the basis of a controversial deep event -- 9/11 -- that is still largely a mystery .
- UC Professor Emeritus Peter Dale Scott
Unhindered by a neutered Congress and a compliant Court , President Bush has six months remaining to pursue his agenda of expanding the war in the Middle East and ensuring the continuation of the Global War on Terror ( GWOT ) beyond his tenure in office .
The current administration has taken unto itself unprecedented , nearly hegemonic powers since the events of 9/11 .
On that day , George W. Bush issued his " Declaration of Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks " under the authority of the National Emergencies Act .
This declaration , which can be rescinded by joint resolution of Congress , has instead been extended six times .
In 2007 , the declaration was strengthened with the issuance of National Security Presidential Directive 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) which gave the president the authority to do whatever he deems necessary in a vaguely defined " catastrophic emergency " including everything from canceling elections to suspending the Constitution to launching a nuclear attack .
Despite time constraints , there are clear signs that the president , the vice - president and their neocon collaborators are not finished .
The constant saber - rattling toward Iran , with strong support from Israel , should send a chill down the spine of any peace - loving American .
Military chiefs who oppose the president are " retired , " as observed most recently with the March dismissals of CENTCOM commander Admiral William Fallon and 6th Fleet commander Vice - Admiral John Stufflebeem .
Public opinion counts for nothing .
In a March 24 interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz , vice president Dick Cheney responded to a question about the war weariness of Americans with a languid " So ? "
According to J. Scott Carpenter , former deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs , Cheney pushed hard for airstrikes against Iranian Revolutionary Guard bases last summer .
He was deterred by Pentagon officials who insisted that retaliation might be difficult to contain .
Now , with Cheney ally General David Petraeus poised to take over Fallon 's command , a significant obstacle has been removed .
It seems clear that there is a deadly struggle going on within the US government , a struggle that could well determine not only the election of the next president , but the survival of the republic .
On one side are the neocons , the fanatics who led us into Iraq and who believe they alone possess the strategic acumen to usher in a " new American century . "
On the other is the Republican Party old guard ostensibly led by Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
Gates was brought into the administration at the end of 2006 to replace the disgraced and despised Donald Rumsfeld , and generally to ride herd over the neocons .
The conflict between these factions has broken into the open over the past eight months .
The first public signal came in October of last year , when the sixteen US intelligence agencies issued a consensus National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) that cut the legs out from under the administration 's argument that Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon .
The NIE stated that the Iranians had stopped work on the project in 2003 .

Just before Labor Day last year , a B - 52 Stratofortress bomber carrying six cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads flew an unauthorized mission from Minot AFB in North Dakota to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana .
Due to anonymous , high - level tips to the Military Times , the warheads were recovered .
After several seemingly inconclusive investigations of the incident , Pentagon chief Gates fired Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Moseley and Air Force Secretary Michael
Wynne last week , without revealing the role either man played in the nuke heist .
Given the volume of evidence that this unprecedented transfer of live nuclear weapons was not an accident , the question remains : what individual or individuals within the government have the authority to commandeer nuclear bombs ?
Conservative pundit Patrick J. Buchanan recently suggested that the neocons might be tempted to go to war with Iran in order to improve John McCain 's chances of winning the presidency .
As audacious as that seems , we want to go one step further .
We believe that this administration is so zealous , so determined to hold onto power , that they may well stage a " false flag " attack , creating just the kind of " catastrophic emergency " to which NSPD - 51 refers .
On April 29 of this year , CIA veteran Roland V. Carnaby was shot dead by police officers after a high speed chase through the streets of Houston .
Carnaby , who had been the CIA 's Chief of Station for the Southeast Region headquartered in Houston , was involved in conducting security surveys of the Port of Houston and had discovered that the Department of Homeland Security was tolerating gaping holes in port security .
Carnaby and Houston intelligence and law enforcement personnel were also investigating the presence of " Middle Easterners " who were conducting surveillance of the Port of Houston .
The " Middle Eastern " designator is the term used by the FBI for Israelis ( typically Mossad agents ) in order to avoid " political " problems with superiors .
Former National Security Agency analyst and naval intelligence officer Wayne Madsen has been in Houston investigating the Carnaby case at great personal risk .
Madsen believes Carnaby was involved both in heading off a potential war with Iran ( by leaking Mossad plans to assassinate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah just days before Carnaby himself was killed ) and in trying to forestall a potential terrorist attack on the port .
According to Madsen , " federal agents in Houston fear that ' another 9/11 - type part false flag ' attack is imminent , perhaps as early as July 4 . "
Such an attack along the twenty - five - mile Houston Ship Channel , site of more explosive materials , toxic gases , and deadly petrochemicals than anywhere else in the country , could create an environmental and economic catastrophe that would dwarf 9/11 .
How will the struggle within this administration be brought to an end ?
Will courageous military men like Adm .
Fallon speak out before the next national tragedy befalls us ?
Will Congress act decisively to remove the president 's emergency powers , challenge NSPD - 51 , and defend the Constitution ?
Will Defense Secretary Gates hold the line ?
With just a half year left in what many believe has been the worst presidency in American history the possibilities are many , and some of them are truly frightening .
As citizens of this country , we must do everything in our power to ensure that there is no expansion of war in the Middle East , no " false flag " attack at the Port of Houston or anywhere else , and a peaceful and constitutional succession to a new administration .
The Russian military was clearly superior to that of a small country in its near abroad Georgiabut is a resurgent  Russia a threat to the United States ?
If the United States insists on expanding its informal empire into Russias nearby sphere of influence , it has to expect some pushback from a Russia that is no longer as weak as it once was and is resentful at having been trampled on during the 1990s and early 2000s .
At the end of the Cold War , the United States pledged verbally to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that if the U.S.S.R. allowed Germany to reunite and embed in NATO , the U.S. would not expand the alliance , which the bear perceives as hostile .
The United States , however , violated this promise and repeatedly expanded NATO inducting former Soviet Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern Europe and even former Soviet republics ( the Baltic states ) .
( Incredibly , even after the U.S. and NATO were proved impotent in helping Georgia during its recent war with Russia , the Bush administration is still pressuring its reluctant European allies to admit Georgia and the Ukraine , an even more important former Soviet republic on Russias border ) .
Further showing that the U.S. foreign policy elite never ended the Cold War have been repeated acts by both Democratic and Republican presidents to thumb their nose at a weakened Russia for example , winning U.S. access to military bases in former Soviet Central Asia , rerouting energy pipelines from the oil - rich Caspian Sea around Russian territory , and planning to build missile defense installations in the territories of former Soviet allies Poland and the Czech Republic .
But the bear is now coming out of a long hibernation a bit rejuvenated .
Using increased petroleum revenues from the oil price spike , the Russians will hike defense spending 26 percent next year to about $ 50 billion the highest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Yet as the oil price declines from this historic high , Russia will have fewer revenues to increase defense spending and rebuild its military .
Even the $ 50 billion a year has to be put in perspective .
The United States is spending about $ 700 billion per year on defense and starting from a much higher plain of capability .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , the Russian military fell apart and was equivalent to that of a developing country .
Even the traditionally hawkish U.S. military and defense leaders and analysts are not worried about Russias plans to buy modern arms , improve military living standards to attract better senior enlisted personnel , enhance training , and cut back the size of the bloated forces and officer corps .
For example , Eugene B. Rumer of the U.S. National Defense University was quoted in the Washington Post as saying that Russian actions are not a sign , really , of the Russian military being reborn , but more of a Russia being able to flex what relatively little muscle it has on the global scale , and to show that t actually matters . [ 1 ]
In addition , the Russian military is very corrupt with an estimated 40 percent of the money for some weapons and pay for personnel being stolen or wasted .
This makes the amount of real defense spending far below the nominal $ 50 billion per year .
U.S. analysts say , however , that increased military spending would allow Russia to have more influence over nations in its near abroad and Eastern Europe .
Of course , throughout history , small countries living in the shadow of larger powers have had to make political , diplomatic , and economic adjustments to suit the larger power .
Increased Russian influence in this sphere , however , should not necessarily threaten the security of the faraway United States .
It does only because the United States has defined its security as requiring intrusions into Russias traditional sphere of influence .
By expanding NATO into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union , the United States has guaranteed the security of these allied countries against a nuclear - armed power , in the worst case , by sacrificing its cities in a nuclear war .
Providing this kind of guarantee for these non-strategic countries is not in the U.S. vital interest .
Denying Russia the sphere of influence in nearby areas traditionally enjoyed by great powers ( for example , the U.S. uses the Monroe Doctrine to police the Western Hemisphere ) will only lead to unnecessary U.S. - Russian tension and possibly even cataclysmic war .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
With the election of Barack Obama , President Bush is now a certified lame duck who will quickly disappear in the rear view mirror .
In 2000 , we elected a guy we'd like to have a beer with .
Huge mistake .
Bush soared when the Twin Towers came down .
On September 14 , 2001 , he gave a rousing speech to rescue workers at Ground Zero .
It was arguably his finest hour with 90 percent approval ratings and the entire world ready to step in and help the United States in any way they could .
But Bush blew it .
The next seven years were pretty much a steady downward spiral .
The invasion of Iraq , torture , Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , domestic spying , secrecy , lost White House emails , zero accountability and the economy in ruins .
Watch : Cafferty : Miss most about Bush ?
President Bush will leave office as arguably one of the worst presidents this country ever had .
His approval ratings are at an all - time low .
He is so unpopular he dared not show his face on the campaign trail .
The ultimate irony is without the utter disaster that was the Bush Presidency , an African - American would probably not have been elected president .
Funny how things work out .
George W. Bush , a conservative Republican , did as much to get Barack Obama elected as the primary voters in Iowa did on a cold January night earlier this year .
Historians will render the final verdict , but you can have your say right now .
Here ’s my question to you :
What will you miss most about President Bush ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Nicks from Bklyn , New York writes :
It 's going to be tough but he 's leaving us with so many memories .
With tears in my eyes , I 'll be reminded of our gazillion dollar deficit when I pay my adjustable rate mortgage .
In spirit , I 'll hear his voice on the phone and wonder what was the fuss about wire tappings .
And when it becomes so unbearable that he is gone , I 'll re-read the Patriot Act and remind myself how much he has done and cry for joy some more .
Slatts writes :
Two things we wo n’t miss : the humiliation Americans suffered watching Bush fumble his way around the world stage among foreign leaders speaking the English language better than he did ; and the insult to our democracy and government we suffered at the hands of Bush 's puppet master , Dick Cheney .
Mark writes :
I will miss seeing an " every man " type as leader of the free world .
Though his mistakes were numerous and his missteps well - documented , he was more a victim of those around him and the fact that he trusted them so much .
Albert writes :
Jack , I truly believe President Bush is a good Christian man .
Challenges he faced during his Administration , no one ever faced .
Our country got attacked by Islamic terrorists .
His foreign policy failed .
History will tell the American people about his presidency .
Syrus from Kirkland , Washington writes :
I just now realized the inadequacy of the word " nothing " despite the fact that President Bush has shown me just that over the last 8 years .
Heather from Flagstaff , Arizona writes :
Ask again in a year when we 've had time to gather some perspective .
Right now it 's still too fresh .
It 's like walking away from a bad 8 year marriage .
Kevin from Pennsylvania writes :
That Dick Cheney did n't take him hunting .
5 Sickening Habits of Mainstream Websites
Forbes , BusinessWeek , The New York Times , Mens Health , you name it .
The big guys think that just because they entered in the game early , or because they have some popular print publication backing them up , they can get away with whatever they want .
Screw that !
They better start changing and listening more to the users , else I am sure their traffic will go down hill .
Here are 5 habits from mainstream websites that make me sick .
1. Breaking stories in many different pages to increase the number of impressions
Have you ever seen those “ Top 25 Web Celebrities ” or “ Top 20 Richest People in the World ” lists on Forbes ?
The number of items on the list is the number of pages that they use to display the information … .
Slide shows they call it .
I call it “ trying to get as many page views as possible from each visitor to make more advertising money , because we are some greedy folks ! ”
And this practice is not limited to lists .
If you take a look on Wired or PC World , you will notice that even 500 word stories get broken down into two or more pages !
Come on guys , make it easy for the user and put everything in the same page .
2 . Using splash pages with ads
When I visit a website that greets me with a huge ad instead of the homepage , I always scratch my head and think : “ Did I just type businessweek.com or annoythefuckoutofme.com ? ”
Internet users want things quick , because that is the way they think .
They want to be able to scan the information .
To filter it .
To search for specific bits of data .
If upon coming to your website they will only see a huge ad and a link where they need to click to see the “ real ” website , heck , they will just go somewhere else .
3 . Not linking to the sources or mentioned websites
Until some time ago there was an argument among webmasters stating that if you wanted visitors to stick inside your site , you should never link to external pages .
This has been proved to be a myth .
If visitors like your content , they can always hit the “ Back ” button on their browsers , or pay a visit again in the future .
It is a myth , but I guess we forgot to tell mainstream media websites about that .
In fact , behemoths like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times rarely link out to other sites .
What is worse , sometimes they wo n’t even link to the website they are covering on the article , and the reader must try to guess the URL or search for it on Google .
Crazy ….
4 . Using pop-up ads
It is 2008 , almost 2009 for the matter of fact , and some websites are still shooting devilish pop-ups on our faces ?
Picture this : you just found a link about a cool story , you click and start reading it , it seems interesting , when you are starting to understand it BANG !
A pop-up appears encouraging you to take a survey or buy something .
Most of the times the thing is even moving around and you need to chase it with your mouse in order to close it .
Gosh I hate pop-ups .
5 . Requiring registration to access the content
Lets put this straight , when I browse around the Internet , I want to get information , not the other way around .
Do not force me to register up and leave my email address and other personal details unless it is absolutely necessary ( i.e. unless what you offer is so good that I will bear with the pain of the registration ) .
This thing is so annoying that you even have websites around that are specialized in providing Internet users with valid usernames and passwords for those sites , so that they can skip the registration process .
The most famous one is bugmenot.com .
Senate Democrats were understandably pleased when President - elect Barack Obama announced that former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota will be his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services .
In making the announcement , Obama reinforced that overhauling how health care is delivered is a central tenet of his administration and praised Daschle , while calling him the “ lead architect ” of the new administration 's plan to expand coverage and control health - care costs .
" Tom brings more than just great expertise to this task .
He brings the respect he earned during his years of leadership in Congress , " Obama said in a press conference announcing the nomination .
" He knows how to build consensus across the aisle .
And he has the trust of folks from every angle of this issue : doctors , nurses and patients ; workers and businesses ; hospitals and consumer groups -- all of whom will have a seat at the table as we work on this vital issue . "
Here 's reaction from Daschle 's former Senate colleagues :
Ted Kennedy ( D - MA )
" Exceptional challenges call for exceptional leaders , and Tom is an ideal choice to meet the urgent challenge of health reform .
His integrity , intelligence , experience and commitment to the American people have won him friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle .
All of us in Congress who share the goal of this long overdue reform welcome today 's announcement . "
Ken Salazar ( D - CO )
“ I applaud the selection of Senator Daschle to lead the effort to put President - elect Obama ’s vision of affordable , quality health care for all into action .
He brings to the position a wealth of health policy expertise and legislative experience , as well as a proven ability to build consensus around policies that work for all Americans .
I cannot think of a better person for the job , and look forward to working with him and President - elect Obama to fix our Nation ’s broken health care system . ”
Tim Johnson ( D - SD )
" Tom has been a leader in our state and country throughout his time in Congress .
I am proud that he has been nominated this morning to lead our nation ’s health care efforts and I know he will make an outstanding Secretary of Health and Human Services .
As a South Dakotan , he truly understands the unique challenges of providing quality health care throughout rural America .
He is a dear friend , and I look forward to working with him and the new Administration in the months ahead .
The President - Elect faces many challenges , but I know with Tom working at his side , we have a real chance to finally provide affordable care to all Americans . "
Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI )
" Every American deserves health care he or she can afford .
But Senator Daschle knows we need to do more than that - we need basic , systemic reform that will revolutionize the way health care is delivered in this country .
He has already brought forward ideas , like the creation of a Federal Health Board , that have contributed substantively to the health care reform debate , and that I will hope he will pursue further at HHS .
His nomination , and President - Elect Obama 's creation of a new White House Office of Health Reform , emphasizes his serious commitment to solving this problem . "
Ron Wyden ( D - OR )
“ President - Elect Obama quite simply could not have made a better choice for the job .
Tom Daschle is not just an expert on health policy , he is a skilled legislator and an inspiring leader .
He is also a close friend .
Eighteen years ago , I was honored to have then Senator Daschle join me in leading the effort to reform Medigap and protect seniors from health insurance scams .
Today , I am honored at the prospect of joining Secretary - designate Daschle in the effort that will ultimately reform the nation ’s health care system . ”
Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN )
“ Tom Daschle is a distinguished and uniquely qualified choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services .
He will bring a proven record and Midwestern sensibility to help us tackle one of the largest challenges facing our nation – health care .
I believe Tom Daschle can lead the kind of bold reform that our health care system so desperately needs .
Tom and I have discussed how we can replicate some of Minnesota ’s successes in high - quality , high - efficiency care on a national level .
I look forward to our continued work together in the months and years to come . ”
Patrick Leahy ( D - VT )
" President - elect Obama has made another superb choice in selecting Tom Daschle to head the Department of Health and Human Services as well as a new White House Office of Health Reform …
Health care reform is sorely needed and long overdue .
It will be one of the core projects of the Obama presidency and certainly one of the most complex and difficult issues on the nation 's agenda .
No one is better prepared for this monumental job than Tom Daschle is .
His talents , his experience , his vision and his decency are admired on both sides of the aisle . "
Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV )
“ Tom Daschle is an incredible public servant and someone who shares my passion and commitment to improving and expanding health care coverage and making it more affordable for all Americans – especially the 46 million Americans without any coverage at all .
There is no one better qualified to shepherd through President - elect Obama ’s ambitious plans for health care reform . "

The McCain camp today disputed rumors that presumptive vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was ever registered with the secessionist Alaska Independence Party by releasing years of voter registration history . . . but it looks like that does n't apply to her husband .
This afternoon , the director of Division of Elections in Alaska , Gail Fenumiai , told TPMmuckraker that Todd Palin registered in October 1995 to the Alaska Independence Party , a radical group that advocates for Alaskan secession from the United States .
Besides a short period of a few months in 2000 when he changed his registration to undeclared , Todd Palin remained a registered member of AIP until July 2002 when he registered again as an undeclared voter .
SAN FRANCISCO 
A giant rainbow - colored flag in the gay - friendly Castro neighborhood of San Francisco was flying at half - staff on Wednesday as social and religious conservatives celebrated the passage of measures that ban same - sex marriage in California , Florida and Arizona .
In California , where same - sex marriage had been performed since June , the ban had more than 52 percent of the vote , according to figures by the secretary of state , and was projected to win by several Californian news media outlets .
Opponents of same - sex marriage won by even bigger margins in Arizona and Florida .
Just two years ago , Arizona rejected a similar ban .
The across - the - board sweep , coupled with passage of a measure in Arkansas intended to bar gay men and lesbians from adopting children , was a stunning victory for religious conservatives , who had little else to celebrate on an Election Day that saw Senator John McCain lose and other ballot measures , like efforts to restrict abortion in South Dakota , California and Colorado , rejected .
“ It was a great victory , ” said the Rev. James Garlow , senior pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego County and a leader of the campaign to pass the California measure , Proposition 8 .
“ We saw the people just rise up . ”
As a prospective homebuyer , I have watched enough HGTV to learn a few things : people like open floorplans and they like big kitchens with stainless steel appliances — but they do n't like wallpaper .
Still , that has not deterred designers from trying to make wallpaper appealing again .
One such designer named Camilla Diedrich is attempting to achieve this feat using intricate designs and fiber optics .
Her Nature Ray Charles series comes in several different colors and can be purchased for about $ 231 a roll — although there are no details on how the wallpaper works or how it is applied .

There ’s no doubt that rock stars can be creative entrepreneurs , just like entrepreneurs can be creative rock stars .
But Kurt Cobain ?
It may seem a stretch to call Kurt Cobain and Nirvana entrepreneurs .
After all , Cobain was so disturbed by fame that he ultimately took his own life to escape the pressure .
The success of the album Nevermind was an accident of creative genius by punk rockers who reluctantly hit it big , right ?
Not exactly .
The Deliberate Creative Genius of Nirvana
I did n’t want to be a fringe alternative band …
I ’d rather be a rock star .
~ Kurt Cobain , About a Son
An entrepreneur is successful because his passion for an outcome leads him to organize available resources in new and more valuable ways .
When you look at it that way , Kurt Cobain was definitely a creative entrepreneur , and he and the other members of Nirvana knew the outcome they wanted .
They wanted to be rock stars .
Now , that does n’t mean they wanted to be rock stars like the crop at the time , such as Bon Jovi , Mötley Crüe , or god forbid , Warrant .
Ironically , Nirvana ’s success quickly knocked the hair bands off commercial radio .
The innovative mix of punk , pop hooks and 70’s guitar rock allowed Nirvana to change the face of popular music forever .
And even though it ’s likely they never imagined how big it would get , Cobain candidly reveals it was all according to plan in the 2006 documentary About a Son .
Take a look at the three elements that propelled Nirvana to the top of the charts .
They just might help you succeed in your own entrepreneurial endeavors .
1. Break the Status Quo
It was n’t cool to play pop music as a punk band .
And I wanted to mix the two .
~ Kurt Cobain , About a Son
To innovate in epic ways , the first step is to rebel against the status quo of the industry or community you belong to .
In Nirvana ’s case , the music scenes in Seattle and Olympia , Washington , were notoriously anti-commercial .
Nirvana ’s indie debut Bleach showed promise , but that abrasive , relatively unstructured noise rock was considered “ acceptable ” to the Pacific Northwest music scene .
Cobain wanted to create hybrid songs with pop elements — along the lines of the Pixies — but met resistance from the community and even from Sub Pop , the label he ’d worshiped such a short time ago .
So Nirvana made the heretical move of signing with a major label , releasing Nevermind with Geffen .
Once Smells Like Teen Spirit broke through , the grunge gold rush began , and Pearl Jam , Soundgarden , and Alice in Chains crossed over onto mainstream radio next .
Takeaway :
Be a leader , not a follower .
You ’ll certainly annoy the status quo , but only until you ’re reaping the rewards of the innovative pioneer .
2. Mix Innovation With Fundamentals
I do n’t think we ’re better than the other bands …
We got attention because our songs have hooks , which stick in people ’s minds .
~ Kurt Cobain , About a Son
Most of the songs on Nevermind were written before the band went into the studio .
While the music is no way conventional , the tracks possess catchy hooks that are psychologically pleasing .
In other words , Cobain ’s desire to add pop hooks to punk compositions is a classic way to “ organize available resources in new and more valuable ways . ”
This is creative entrepreneurism at it ’s finest , and Cobain got the rock star outcome he hoped for ( be careful what you wish for , etc . ) .
The band chose producer Butch Vig , whose work with Sonic Youth Cobain admired , and selected Andy Wallace to mix the album .
The group walked a fine line by combining polished production with punk aesthetics , and they nailed it ( even though Cobain complained years later that Nevermind was too polished ) .
Takeaway :
This is the fine line all creative entrepreneurs walk .
Ignore market desire and human psychology , and you fail .
Diminish the innovative elements that set you apart , and you become another unremarkable “ me too ” effort .
3. Bake the Marketing Into the Product
We did n’t do anything .
It was just one of those ‘ Get out of the way and duck ’ records .
~ Geffen President Ed Rosenblatt
When Nirvana signed with Geffen Records , they got a tried - and - true marketing machine .
Radio promotion and retail positioning had been boiled down to a science in the days before digital distribution turned music marketing on its head .
The selection and release of singles was classic record - label strategy .
Smells Like Teen Spirit would go first , which would introduce the band to radio listeners , DJs , and programming directors .
This would pave the way for Come as You Are , which would be the more likely hit .
That ’s where the plan fell apart .
To say Smells Like Teen Spirit did better than expected is a monumental understatement .
A song recorded in three takes with lyrics penned minutes before turned Cobain into the reluctant voice of Generation X .
Geffen hoped that Nevermind would sell at least 250,000 copies , which is what the Vig- produced Sonic Youth album sold .
Nevermind has sold over 10,000,000 copies to date , and is critically - regarded as one of the best rock albums in history , just as Smells Like Teen Spirit is considered one of the greatest rock songs ever recorded .
Takeaway :
These days , creative entrepreneurs of all stripes can use the Internet to spark their own viral success stories by creating remarkable products and services .
Home runs like Nevermind are rare and unexpected , so you still need a smart marketing plan .
Just know when to “ get out of the way and duck ” when the audience decides to market for you .
In Summary ( Plus One More Crucial Tip )
Kurt Cobain can definitely teach us things about starting our own business , whether big or small :
The first key is always a new and better approach , or a fresh and innovative way to do the tried and true .
If the “ do it the way it ’s done ” crowd tells you you ’re wrong , crazy , or stupid , you may be onto something .
You ca n’t ignore the realities of market demand and human psychology , but often the market does n’t realize what it wants and the mind craves something new .
Create things that people naturally want to market for you .
Be careful who you marry .

The Church of Scientology which claims to support human rights is supporting California 's same sex marriage ban Prop 8 .
And Scientology , a religion which denies the existence of Jesus Christ , is attempting to use Yes on 8 to curry favor with conservative Christian groups
The Church of Scientology consistently claims to promote human rights , however those rights do not apply to all .
The San Diego branch of Scientology has recently joined forces with other conservative fundamentalist groups to oppose same - sex marriage in California .
"
It 's a way for Scientology to gain legitimacy in the eyes of other churches , " explains one religious expert who prefers to remain anonymous .
" This is deceptive , in that at the upper levels Scientology denies the existence of Jesus Christ .
These Christian churches are being deceived .
" The Church of Scientology has campaigned publicly to show they support human rights and civil liberties by creating two front groups , Youth for Human Rights ( YHR ) and the International Foundation for Human Rights and Tolerance ( IHFRT ) .
Both loudly promote human rights and purport to support the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights which includes this phrase :
“ All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law .
All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination .
” The creed of the Church of Scientology states in part : " We of the Church believe : That all men of whatever race , color or creed were created with equal rights ;
That all men have inalienable rights to their own religious practices and their performance …
That all men have inalienable rights to their own lives … " " Opposing the rights of a couple , regardless of their genders , to join in a legal union and have the same rights as others actually opposes the very thing Scientology claims to uphold , " continues the expert , who declines to be named out of concerns of retaliation by Scientology .
Even more disturbingly , in a recent video a well know Scientology operative , Tim Armer , was asked on video how he felt about Scientology 's founder L. Ron Hubbard stating that homosexuals should be killed .
" Fine , " replied Armer , " Fine . "
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YSHXJNV0D8
The interviewer was referring to a passage from The Scientology text Science of Survival in which Hubbard wrote that sexual deviants , into which he grouped homosexuals , should be " removed from society quietly and without remorse " if Scientology 's version of reparative therapy , known as auditing , did not work to " cure " the homosexual .
Hubbard wrote , and Scientologists believe , that homosexuals are part of a group that they consider to be " unsaveable .
”
In July masked internet civil rights activists calling themselves Anonymous marched in San Diego 's Pride Parade to alert the public and media about Scientology 's anti-gay agenda .
Says one Anonymous who participated in the parade , " Civil rights are just that , and marriage is a civil function .
That marriage license is a piece of paper mandated by the state , and should not be denied to anyone .
This right and other civil rights which Scientology wishes to deny citizens are why we protest .
And speaking for myself , voting
No on 8 sends a message that no church should legislate a state function , and more importantly who we love . "
Obama CBS 60 Minutes Interview VIDEO
President - electandsat for an interview that appears on 60 Minutes on Sunday evening .
The couple sat for the taped CBS interview earlier in the week with reporter
The topics ranged from the economy , home foreclosures and Obama 's mother - in - law .

From Mind Hacks :
I 've uploaded a fascinating video clip where a TV presenter is intravenously injected with the active ingredients of cannabis as part of the BBC documentary Should I Smoke Dope ?.
It 's part of an experiment to compare the effects of intravenous THC and cannabidiol combined , with intravenous THC on its own .
The mix of both gives the presenter a pleasant giggly high while THC on its own causes her to become desolate and paranoid .
Both are these are known to be key psychoactive ingredients in cannabis but the video is interesting as it is a reflection of the fact that THC has been most linked to an increased risk of developing psychosis while cannabidiol seems to have an antipsychotic effect .

Flock
People conditioned to regard their Web browser as their de facto “ blogware ” will likely warm to Flock fairly quickly .
You might say that ’s because Flock is a browser as well .
Its foundation is the Mozilla platform .
The joy in using Flock and all that it grants easy access to is that it 's built for the social web .
You can network and share photos and cool web pages with little effort .
And , yes , you can blog , all while navigating the web just as you ordinarily would .
MarsEdit
One of the most celebrated of publishing utilities for Mac OS X users , MarsEdit , now in version 2.2.2 , is not a free package .
Its cost is $ 29.95 after a free 30 - day trial .
But a common refrain heard by users is that the more often it is employed the more the price is so clearly justified .
Apart from dead simple uploads and a quickly - learned interface , MarsEdit sports features like compatibility with Blogger , Drupal , LiveJournal , Movable Type , Vox , and more , a Flickr connection , and integration with more hardcore Mac- specific text editors like BBEdit and TextMate .
In short , it ’s a power tool .
ecto
Another multi-service editor of MarsEdit - like design , ecto puts considerable emphasis on getting you from A to B to Z as quickly as possible .
It certainly holds its own by comparison with others on the market .
Its list of supported blog services is extensive , to say the least .
Presently in Version 3 form , ecto has been around for over 5 years , and costs $ 17.95 to own .
Blogo
Launched by Brainjuice , Blogo seems simply drawn and puts your typical blogware to shame .
As with the other editors above , its support list for blogging services is long , allows you to quickly publish media , and can even manage to publish Twitter and Ping .fm messages in association with your blog feed - call it streamlined PR , if you will .
Finally , Blogo gives users the option to produce content distraction - free with an on - board full screen mode .
That ’s a nice little dollop of GTD whipped cream , for sure .
Tumblr Dashboard Widget
Here ’s a super small and super lightweight Dashboard application tossed midstream into the mix .
We think Tumblr Dashboard Widget is worth mentioning simply for the fact that Tumblr itself is a bare boned and ultra-minimalist invention .
A widget of this size is a fine complement .
Enough said .
Mac Journal
An appreciable application both for its adherence to the traditional idea of journaling as well as its implementation of color to make the editing environment that much more colorful , Mac Journal is something that , while quite costly at $ 34.95 for a license , runs with the best in the business .
It may not carry the same fanboy cache as that held by MarsEdit and others , but it 's a strong delivery nonetheless .
Blog.
Mac
Intended to be a generally fool - proof development , Blog .
Mac is more or less the closest thing to something that would come out of Apple ’s own software assembly room .
It ’s not heavy on the details .
It ’s personal blogging made simple .
The current release , Version 1.3 Beta 4 , talks to Apple ’s MobileMe web hosting service and offers better Mac OS X Leopard integration .
It will set users back $ 29.99 .
The creators at Largemouth Software also offer a Blog .
Mac template editor free of charge .
i Web plus MobileMe
You could go with something independently - made like Blog .
Mac , but if you prefer something actually from the halls of Infinite Loop , Apple presents its own website and webpage editor in the form of iWeb .
It ’s a very controlled setup , and comes with all Mac computers sold today ( standalone iLife suite runs $ 79 ) , and to make use of it in ways that takes advantage of the “ Apple experience , ” you ’ll need to pony up $ 99 per year for MobileMe hosting ( formerly " . Mac " ) and photo gallery access and so forth .
RapidWeaver
Some people just want to blog in their own unique way , requiring a departure from many popular web services today .
RapidWeaver lets users wield an editor ’s stick in ways that no other application here is able .
Of course , that can mean a concerted effort to continue a blog for a significant period of time within the environment provided by RapidWeaver and the folks at RealMac Software , but hey , if you want choices , you ’ve got choices with this one .
Nearly limitless options , really .
Fluid
Okay , so you ’ve parsed the choices listed above , and you ’re not quite sold on any of them .
Perhaps you recognize more than ever your liking for the way your blog service of choice operates , but you 'd rather have it resemble an application within your Dock or menu bar .
Fluid lets you do just that .
It behaves as a kind of super powerful webclip creator that allows you to access web applications without having to visit the URL in Firefox or Camino or whathaveyou .
There ’s a bit of a wow factor that goes with this download .

Courtesy of Ben Smith , the McCain / Palin campaign is sending out robo -texts to cell phones with the following message :
Know the facts : Call 641-715-3900 ext. 83682
Then please fwd this 2 your phonebook they need 2 know .
You will Lose your freedoms this November 4th if you do n’t know !!!!
Apparently this is being mass sent out to people in battleground states .
And if they call ?
Well , they ’re reminded about how domestic terrorist and incognito Muslim Barack Hussein is going to destroy your freedoms , probably while bathing in ethanol and Christian blood :
I ’m calling for John McCain and the Republican National Committee because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayer

BT is axing 10,000 workers , or 6 % of its global workforce , with several thousand expected to go in the UK as the company looks to cut costs and reduce its reliance on contractors in the face of the global economic downturn .
The company , which announced an 11 % fall in second quarter profits , said it has already cut 4,000 mostly contractors jobs and a further 6,000 will go by next April .
The majority of those job losses will be among BT 's own staff and the axe is expected to fall particularly heavily in the UK .
BT has 160,000 people working for it worldwide , of whom 110,000 are directly employed .
This latest blow to the British economy came just a day after the number of jobless people in the UK hit its highest level since 1997 .
By the end of September there were 1.825 million people out of work .
The claimaint count also rose to 980,900 , its highest level since the end of 1997 .
News of the job cuts helped to send the company 's shares up 12 % in early trading , 13.5 p higher at 126p .
The job losses are not , the company stressed , related to the poor performance of its BT Global Services unit , which has failed to hit profitability targets and caused the company to warn last month that profits before financial charges will be down this year .
That warning sent shares in the company to their lowest level since it was privatised .
Turning around BT Global Services is expected to lead to thousands more job losses .
BT stressed that thousands of its staff leave every year , so most of the reduction will happen by the company not replacing leavers .
But unions are increasingly concerned about the number of UK companies cutting staff , with Virgin Media saying earlier this week that it is eliminating 2,200 positions and Taylor Wimpey cutting another 1,000 posts .
BT 's chief executive , Ian Livingston , who took over from Ben Verwaayen just four months ago , today admitted : " Three out of our four business units , BT Retail , BT Wholesale and Openreach are delivering on or ahead of target .
But profits in BT Global Services are simply not good enough and we are taking decisive action to put matters right .
What we have to do now is translate revenue growth into better profitability . "
In the three months to the end of September , BT made revenues of £ 5.3bn , up 4 % , but pretax profits slumped 11 % to £ 590 m .
For the six months to the end of September , revenues were up 3 % at just under £ 10.5 bn with profits down 9 % at £ 1.2bn .
Earnings before financial charges for the quarter were down 1 % at £ 1.43 bn .
Two weeks ago BT admitted revenues would be ahead of original forecasts but profits would be slightly below and today 's results were actually slightly better than the City 's revised forecasts .
In the three months to the end of September BT said its retail business added just 69,000 new broadband customers , less than half the 164,000 added in the same period by BSkyB - taking it to 4.6 million customers .
The company admitted that the market is becoming more " mature " .
The company also confirmed that it is looking at ways of easing the pressure on its pension scheme , the largest private sector fund in the UK , by introducing changes such as raising the retirement age .
" We are in a period of comprehensive consultation with our UK employees .
The aim of this review is to provide long term sustainability , flexibility and fairness , " the company said .
Pension changes
Several proposed changes to the company 's defined benefit scheme have been put forward including : an increase in the normal retirement age to 65 ; changing the final salary link to a career average ; an increase in the rate of member contributions ; changes in accrual rates ; and ceasing to contract out of the state second pension .
" We propose implementing these changes with effect from April 2009 and they will only affect future benefit accruals .
Accrued benefits built up before April 2009 are unaffected .
We are also introducing an additional flexibility option for members at retirement , " the company said .
Final decisions regarding the review will be taken once the consultation period with employees has been completed early in 2009 .
BT said the changes will reduce the ongoing cost of its defined pension schemes by about £ 100 m a year .
At the end of September the fund had a surplus of £ 600 m , compared with £ 2bn at March 31 and the market value of BT pension scheme assets was £ 34.4bn , down from £ 37.3 bn .
The value of the scheme 's liabilities was £ 33.4bn , slightly down on £ 34.4bn at March 31 .
The company has been reducing the scheme 's exposure to shares , which stood at 35 % of assets as at September 30 compared with 60 % three years ago .
On Monday evening , Nov. 3 , the moon will snuggle up with Jupiter .
And looking way ahead , on Dec. 1 , the moon , Venus and Jupiter will all gather for a rare convergence that will be so tight , according to NASA , you ’ll be able to blot all three objects out with your thumb held at arm ’s length .
If skies are clear , look to the west just as the sun sets .
You ’ll see Venus , the brightest “ star ” in the sky , hovering just above the slender crescent moon .
Meanwhile , look for another very interesting phenomenon tonight called earthshine .
Here ’s how it works :
The moon is lit by reflected sunlight , and normally the unlit portion just looks dark or invisible .
But the dark portion can sometimes appear dimly lit when sunlight reflects off Earth and hits the Moon , and then is reflected back to Earth .
The effect is strongest when the Moon is a thin crescent near the horizon .
You will not need any instruments to see Venus and the Moon .
If the skies are clear , you will see Venus with the naked eye .
Part 1 – Dynamic Keyword
I was originally going to just update my original post with some performance data regarding the dynamic keyword versus MethodInfo .
Invoke , but I started looking a bit deeper at the performance implications of the dynamic keyword .
In my previous post I posted these performance numbers :
Compile Time Bound : 6 ms – yep , 2 million calls , 6 ms .
Fast .
Dynamically Bound : 2106 ms – so , roughly 351 times slower than the strongly typed calls
But these numbers do n’t really tell the whole picture .
The reality is that in the above test I was factoring in the overhead of initializing the callsites used by the dynamic invoke .
Since I ran the test over and over from the start , this was included every time .
So , I decided to update my testing script to look like this :
private static void Method1 ( ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " compile bound " ) ; var test = new TestClass ( ) ; test.TestMethod1 ( ) ; test.TestMethod2 ( ) ; long totalMilliseconds = 0 ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < 5 ; j++ ) { var sw = new Stopwatch ( ) ; sw. Start ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; i++) { test.
TestMethod1 ( ) ; test.TestMethod2 ( ) ; } sw. Stop ( ) ; Console.WriteLine(sw.ElapsedMilliseconds ) ; totalMilliseconds += sw.ElapsedMilliseconds ; sw.Reset( ) ; } Console .
WriteLine ( " Average : " + totalMilliseconds / 5 ) ; }
What we are doing here is calling the two methods once before we start testing them in order to get the overhead out of the way .
Then we run a loop 5 times and then run our 1000000 loops through calling both methods .
So , we are still doing 2,000,000 calls , but we are now doing them five times in a row .
So , 10,000,000 total calls per method .
I also tested the above code using the “ dynamic ” keyword and MethodInfo .
Invoke .
The numbers that I got were pretty startling .
The first method did n’t change , there is no startup time for compile time binding , so we do n’t really see any difference testing it this way .
The second method ( the dynamic keyword ) is where the real changes started to show up .
The start up time for the dynamic keyword is pretty high right now ( I was recording about 3.5 seconds to make the first two calls ) .
But once the first calls were out of the way , and our CallSites were created , they are assigned as static methods on a compiler generated class and so they are only created once when first called .
The performance here was dramatically better .
The calls to warm it up just looked like this :
dynamic test = new TestClass ( ) ; test.TestMethod1 ( ) ; test.TestMethod2 ( ) ;
Third I tested MethodInfo .
Invoke where we also started them up and invoked the calls once .
The difference here is that each time the method is called , we have significant overhead to make the call , even though we are not retrieving out MethodInfo objects each time .
var test = new TestClass ( ) ; MethodInfo mi1 = typeof ( TestClass ) .
GetMethod ( " TestMethod1 " ) ; MethodInfo mi2 = typeof ( TestClass ) .
GetMethod ( " TestMethod2 " ) ; mi1.
Invoke ( test , null ) ; mi2.
Invoke ( test , null ) ;
So , what could we do in C# 3.0 that would be similar to what is happening with the C# 4.0 dynamic keyword ?
Well , if you have never played around with it , lets look at the DynamicMethod class .
The DynamicMethod class is a helper for creating a method at runtime that we can then invoke .
It is doing something similar to what we have above , only in order to use DynamicMethod we have to emit the IL ourselves .
This is no simple task , but the easiest way to do it is to compile a handwritten method yourself that does something similar , then reflect it and look at the IL .
Then you will at least have a good starting point .
With DynamicMethod we have to write quite a bit of code to get this all wired up , but here it is :
MethodInfo mi1 = typeof ( TestClass ) .GetMethod ( " TestMethod1 " ) ; MethodInfo mi2 = typeof ( TestClass ) .
GetMethod ( " TestMethod2 " ) ; var test = new TestClass ( ) ; DynamicMethod method1 = new DynamicMethod ( " CallMethod1 " , null , new Type [ ] { typeof ( TestClass ) } , typeof ( TestClass ) .
Module ) ; ILGenerator il = method1.GetILGenerator( 128 ) ; il.Emit( OpCodes.Ldarg_0 ) ; il.
Emit( OpCodes .
Callvirt , mi1 ) ; il.Emit( OpCodes .
Ret ) ; DynamicMethod method2 = new DynamicMethod ( " CallMethod2 " , null , new Type [ ] { typeof ( TestClass ) } , typeof ( TestClass ) .
Module ) ; il = method2.GetILGenerator ( 128 ) ; il. Emit( OpCodes.Ldarg_0 ) ; il.
Emit( OpCodes .
Callvirt , mi2 ) ; il.Emit( OpCodes .
Ret ) ; Action method1 Delegate = ( Action ) method1.CreateDelegate( typeof( Action ) , test ) ; Action method2 Delegate = ( Action ) method2.CreateDelegate( typeof( Action ) , test ) ; method1Delegate ( ) ; method2Delegate ( ) ;
Now that we have our delegates that we can all , we can run the same loops against this method .
Again , we call each method once but in this instance all of the work is being done when we emit the IL .
Our four methods are planned out and now we can lay out what you really came here for .
Here are the averages :
Compile Time Bound : 6 ms
Dynamically Bound with dynamic keyword : 45ms
Dynamically Bound with MethodInfo .
Invoke – 10943ms
Dynamically Bound with DynamicMethod – 8ms
Compile time still wins out , but the dynamic keyword is a much much better looking option now .
The overhead of the first call is pretty high , in my tests almost 3 seconds .
I ’m sure that they will work on the speed of this before the final release .
Every successive call is actually really fast though .
The next method is MethodInfo .
Invoke which is quite slow compared to the rest , but in terms of 2 million calls is still pretty fast .
Finally the last method is DynamicMethod , which is practically as fast as the compile bound method because essentially we are just manually compiling it to IL .
There you go , the dynamic keyword has some overhead , but you only have to deal with it once for each dynamic call .
In a long running application this is n’t really a concern .
I hope you enjoyed this post and I hope that I have answered most of the performance questions that you may have for the dynamic keyword .
There are few things worse than when you ’re just having a long week and you ’re praying for the weekend to come even sooner .
Sometimes weeks do fly by and you never even know where it went and the weekend comes plenty soon .
However , if you ’re just in one of those jobs that ’s driving you insane , those weeks are few and far between .
Well now you can have a way to keep track of exactly how long it is till you ’re free , for at least a day or two .
If you do n’t have a conventional weekend , that ’s okay , the clock still works .
You set it for when your weekend begins , day and time .
So even those that get their days off in the middle of the week , can enjoy watching this clock wind down .
Then when it ’s finally done , you ’re free to get out of there .
The clock comes in two different colors , so you can purchase it in either white or black .
Sadly it ’s not even available for pre-order yet on Lazybone .
However , you can contact them and have it set up so that they email you when it is possible to pre-order .
When it does become available it will cost you $ 29.45 or £ 19.99 .

Feingold could become Chairman of Foreign Relations Committee if Kerry nominated John Byrne
Published : Tuesday November 11 , 2008
Print This Email This If Sen. John Kerry becomes President - Elect Barack Obama 's Secretary of State , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship will likely pass to one of the most outspoken critics of the Bush Administration and the only senator to vote against the USA Patriot Act : Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin .
" Speaking of secretary of state , it 's looking increasingly like Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) may get the nod for that post , a possibility that is driving some Senate Democrats to distraction , " Washington Post insider and In The Loop columnist Al Kamen revealed Tuesday .
Kamen said Democrats in Congress are nervous about the appointment because Kerry would be the third member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to depart .
Foreign Relations Chairman Sen. Joe Biden has been elected Vice President ; Sen. Chris Dodd has announced he 's staying on as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee ; Kerry would be third in line of seniority .
Next in line to chair the committee is Sen. Feingold .
In March 2006 , Feingold introduced a resolution to censure President George W. Bush for his illegal wiretapping program , but the resolution was never votes on .
He called for Bush 's censure again in 2007 over the war in Iraq .
Feingold was also one of just 23 senators to vote against the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq .
Writes Kamen , " That means the Obama administration , in addition to getting smacked around from the right on foreign policy matters , could find itself hammered from the left as well . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that Sen. Barack Obama voted against the bill authorizing the use of military force in Iraq .
Obama was not yet in the Senate .

THE MEANING OF MARXISM
" Not a dogma , but a guide to action " By Paul D'Amato | October 20 , 2006 | Page 13 " THE REPORTS of my death , " wrote Mark Twain , " are greatly exaggerated . "
The same could be said of Marxism as a body of ideas .
Marx of course died long ago -- 1883 to be precise .
The economist of the free market , Adam Smith , died almost a century before that , in 1790 ) , yet , curiously , there are no books announcing that " Smithism " is dead .
If Marxism is dead , asks author Markar Melkonian , " then why do non-Marxist economists , sociologists and historians worry about it so much ? "
His answer : " Capitalism itself has a way of putting socialism back on the agenda . "
The continued survival of capitalism may prompt its apologists to declare it the " final " form of human fulfillment -- and for the hundreds of billionaires in the world , capitalism is certainly fulfilling .
But for the majority who suffer low pay , poor health care , racial and sexual discrimination , and unemployment , capitalism is hardly fulfilling .
The very survival of such an exploitive system guarantees that Marxism wo n't die -- though there will be lots claims to that effect .
Discovering what Marxism is , however , is not the easiest thing to untangle .
That 's because there seems to be so many different trends claiming to be Marxist , some of which are polar opposites .
Is Marxism workers ' control or control over workers ?
Is it democratic or dictatorial ?
One way to deal with this problem is to define Marxism as whatever calls itself Marxist .
For pro-capitalist ideologues , this means linking Marxism with the horrors of Stalinism .
For academic Marxists , it means cashing in on the latest intellectual fad , no matter how radically divergent it is from Marx 's ideas .
But if both workers ' power and a state that oppresses workers can be considered " Marxist , " then what we are dealing with is a meaningless label .
Perhaps Marxism is just whatever Marx ( and Engels ) wrote .
But this is a scholastic approach , treating Marxism as a body of sacred texts .
Marxism , wrote Trotsky , " takes as its point of departure " experience , " and always returns to it , " and " Experience is complicated , alive , and in constant flux . "
Society , like an organism , changes , but it changes according to certain identifiable patterns and laws .
Marxism tries to identify those patterns and laws , not as a passive act of observation , but as a means to discover ways to change the world .
Can we call someone who learns about the body and its biological processes , as well as use of the surgeon 's tools , yet never performs an operation , a surgeon ?
That is why the term " academic Marxism " is such an oxymoron .
As Lenin noted , citing Engels .
" Our doctrine ... is not a dogma , but a guide to action .
This classical statement stresses with remarkable force and expressiveness that aspect of Marxism which is very often lost sight of .
And by losing sight of it , we turn Marxism into something one - sided , distorted and lifeless . "
Marx and Engels believed that ideas had to be verified by experience .
But by experience they did n't mean waiting passively on the sidelines and watching history pass by to see if it does what you predicted it would do .
They meant the experience of struggle , the experience of trying to actively change society .
In this sense , their ideas were neither religious nor academic , but revolutionary .
Socialists prior to Marx had visions of a better world , but Marx and Engels put socialism on a scientific footing .
" Communism is for us , " wrote Marx and Engels in The German Ideology , " not a state of affairs which is to be established , an ideal to which reality [ will ] have to adjust itself .
We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things . "
What were their main arguments ?
The abundance created by capitalist methods of production had eliminated the material constraints that in the past had rendered class division necessary for historical advance ; large scale industry had created working class with collective power and collectivist inclinations unlike previous exploited classes ; and the contradictions of capitalism , in particular , periodic crises of " overproduction " would give rise to class struggle , and therefore , the possibility of a revolutionary overturn of the system and the development of a higher form of ( classless ) society in which material abundance was produced and shared in common .
It was a theory that combined a firm grasp of the laws of historical development with a recognition of the role that active , human agency plays in transforming society .

More than a thousand gay - rights activists gathered Thursday afternoon outside the Mormon temple in Westwood to protest the role Mormons played in passing Proposition 8 , which banned same - sex marriage in California .
It was the latest in an escalating campaign directed against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints for its role in marshaling millions of dollars in contributions from its members for the successful campaign to take away same - sex marriage rights .
Members of the Mormon church , who were strongly urged by church leaders to contribute to the Proposition 8 campaign , had an undeniable role in the measure ’s victory .
Opponents of Proposition 8 have accused the church of discriminating against homosexuals , but the backlash against the denomination has also sparked accusations of discrimination .
During the campaign , a website established by Proposition 8 opponents used campaign finance data and other public records to track Mormon political contributions to the Yes - on - 8 campaign .
Opponents estimated that members of the church had given more than $ 20 million , but the amount is difficult to confirm since the state does not track the religious affiliation of donors .
Advertisement
Critics of the website noted that the religious affiliations of other political donors are not generally researched .
A commercial opposing Proposition 8 also drew criticism .
In it , two actors portraying Mormon missionaries forced their way into the well - kept home of a married lesbian couple .
“ Hi , we ’re here from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , ” one says .
“ We ’re here to take away your rights , ” says his partner .

The missionaries then rip the wedding rings from the women ’s fingers and ransack their house until they find the women ’s marriage license , which they destroy .
“ Hey , we have rights , ” one of the women says .
“ Not if we can help it , ” answers the missionary .
The ad was produced by an independent group not affiliated with the official No - on - 8 campaign and was shown on MSNBC and Comedy Central , according to Rick Jacobs of the Courage Campaign , a progressive political group .
Advertisement
Jeff Flint , strategist for Yes on 8 , called the ad “ despicable ” and said it “ crossed every line of decency . ”
“ I am appalled at the level of Mormon - bashing that went on during the Proposition 8 campaign and continues to this day , ” he said .
“ If this activity were directed against any other church , if someone put up a website that targeted Jews or Catholics in a similar fashion for the mere act of participating in a political campaign , it would be widely and rightfully condemned . ”
Members and leaders of the Catholic Church and other Christian churches were also heavily involved in the campaign to pass Proposition 8 .
The Knights of Columbus , which is tied to the Catholic Church , gave $ 1 million , and several evangelical groups gave millions more .
But they have not come under the same kind of attack .
Leaders of the No - on - 8 campaign said they did not believe they were engaged in Mormon - bashing .
“ This is not about religion , ” said Jacobs .
“ This is about a church that put itself in the middle of politics . ”

Kate Kendell , executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , said she had grown up in the Mormon Church and thought it was “ very disappointing what the church has done and the alliances they have made with churches that do n’t even like them and have called the church a cult . ”
Church officials made few public statements during the campaign .
On Thursday , they issued a statement asking for “ a spirit of mutual respect and civility . ”
“ The Church acknowledges that such an emotionally charged issue concerning the most personal and cherished aspects of life -- family and marriage -- stirs fervent and deep feelings , ” church spokeswoman Kim Farah wrote in an e-mail .
“ No one on either side of the question should be vilified , harassed or subject to erroneous information . ”
She did not elaborate .
Outside the Los Angeles temple Thursday , dozens of protesters screamed “ Bigots ” and “ Shame on You ” at half a dozen men in button - down shirts and ties who looked out at the demonstration from behind the temple ’s closed gates .
Advertisement
The men did not respond .
Benjamin Wiser , 27 , came to the protest dressed as a Mormon missionary , complete with black plastic name tag .
It was not a costume , he said .
He was a missionary and a member of the church until age 23 , when he left because he was gay .
Wiser said he did not feel the protesters were unfairly targeting the church .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t think the Mormon church should be involved , ” he said .
Some gay - rights activists said they plan to continue to question the church ’s involvement .
Lorri L. Jean , chief executive of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center , which organized the rally outside the temple , announced the launch of a new website , invalidateprop8.org , which will raise money to fight for same - sex marriage rights in California .
For every $ 5 donated , Jean said , a postcard will be sent to the president of the Mormon church condemning “ the reprehensible role the Church of Latter - day Saints leadership played in denying all Californians equal rights under the law . ”
Advertisement
“ It is a travesty that the Mormon Church bought this election and used a campaign of lies and deception to manipulate voters in the great state of California , ” she said .
David Loder , 40 , a business manager from Corona and a member of the Mormon church , heard about the protest on the radio .
He said he was saddened by the anger directed against the church .
Loder said he had not given money to the Yes - on - 8 campaign because finances are tight raising five daughters , but he did put a sign in his frontyard .
It was vandalized , he said .
“ As a member of the LDS church we have known [ and still do ] the feeling of being ridiculed and mistreated because of our faith , ” he said .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - The U.N. General Assembly split over the issue of gay rights on Thursday after a European - drafted statement calling for decriminalization of homosexuality prompted an Arab - backed one opposing it .

Diplomats said a joint statement initiated by France and the Netherlands gathered 66 signatures in the 192 - nation assembly after it was read out by Argentina at a plenary session .
A rival statement , read out by Syria , gathered some 60 .
The two statements remained open for further signatures , the diplomats said .
No resolution was drafted on the issue and there was no voting , they added .
The division in the General Assembly reflected conflicting laws in the world at large .
According to sponsors of the Franco - Dutch text , homosexuality is illegal in 77 countries , seven of which punish it by death .
The European Union - backed document , noting that the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was marked this month , said those rights applied equally to all people , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity .
It urged states “ to take all the necessary measures , in particular legislative or administrative , to ensure that sexual orientation or gender identity may under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties , in particular executions , arrests or detention . ”
But the opposing document said the statement “ delves into matters which fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states ” and could lead to “ the social normalization , and possibly the legitimization , of many deplorable acts including pedophilia . ”
“ We note with concern the attempts to create ‘ new rights ’ or ‘ new standards , ’ by misinterpreting the Universal Declaration and international treaties to include such notions that were never articulated nor agreed by the general membership , ” it added .
This , it said , could “ seriously jeopardize the entire international human rights framework . ”
Muslim countries have for years opposed international attempts to legalize homosexuality .
U.S. officials said the United States had not signed either document .
They said the broad framing of the language in the statement supporting decriminalization created conflicts with U.S. law , but gave no further details .
But Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen told reporters it was a “ very special day at the U.N . ”
“ For the first time in history a large group of member states speaks out in the General Assembly against discrimination based on sexual orientation , ” he said .
“ With today ’s statement , this is no longer a taboo within the U.N . ”
Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja’afari told reporters sponsors of the statement had “ cornered ” other members by springing the declaration on them .

Many industry insiders and analysts contend that companies backed by private equity will not suffer nearly as much as those in the late 1980s because the firms pushed for better financing conditions that allow them to keep operating even if they cannot make their debt payments .
For example , in an effort to save cash , six of Apollo ’s portfolio companies , including Claire ’s Stores , Harrah ’s and Realogy , have announced this year that they will pay some of their bonds ’ interest by issuing more debt .
Mr. Kaplan said he believed that while “ it is n’t going to be pretty , ” today ’s deals “ are much less fragile and used less leverage . ”
He contended that “ on a relative basis to investment banks and hedge funds , private equity may be in a better place ” because of its long - term focus .
Stephen A. Schwarzman , chairman of Blackstone Group , remains committed to the future of private equity .
“ The people rooting for the collapse of private equity are going to be disappointed , ” he said .
While some companies may find themselves in trouble , he said , many more will be able to ride out a downturn in the economy because of the less restrictive financing conditions that banks agreed to earlier .

He added that he believed that now may be the best time for private equity because of the investment opportunities amid the crisis .
“ Historically , downturns are when the most money gets made , ” he said .
Shares of Blackstone are hovering at around $ 10 , down from the $ 31 they were at when Blackstone went public in June 2007 .
( Fortress Investment Group , another big firm , is trading at $ 4.90 a share , down from its initial price of $ 35 in February 2007 . )
Mr. Lerner , of the Harvard Business School , said that trouble among private equity firms would probably “ precipitate hard questions about the compensation and fee structure ” in the industry .
The firms generally take fees of 2 percent of all money managed and 20 percent of profits .
“ I would not be surprised if they try to head off the criticism by returning capital , ” he said .

I n 1936 , George Orwell published a little essay entitled Bookshop Memories .
In it , he recalled his time as an assistant in a second - hand bookshop , a time that was happy only when viewed through the soft - focus lens of nostalgia .
Irony might be defined as disgust recalled in tranquillity , and Orwell ’s essay is nothing if not full of irony .
He was glad to have had the experience , no doubt , but more glad that it was over .
Not much has changed in the three quarters of a century that have elapsed since Orwell ’s experience as a bookseller .
Second - hand bookshops the world over still tend to be inadequately heated places , Orwell says because the owners fear condensation in the windows , but also because profits are small and heating bills would be large .
There is a peculiar chill , quite unlike any other , to be experienced between the stacks of second - hand bookshops .
Orwell says that the tops of books in such bookshops are the place ‘ where every bluebottle prefers to die , ’ and this preference , being biological in origin , has not changed in the meantime .
The dust of old books , and ‘ the sweet smell of decaying paper ’ , still have a peculiarly choking quality that catch one in the back of the throat .
And second - hand bookshops are still one of the few indoor public places where a person may loiter for hours without being suspected of any serious ulterior motive .
Orwell did not have a high regard for the customers , who struck him as awkward and mainly suffering from psychological problems .
As a long - time habitué of second - hand bookshops , I should say that this is a fairly typical attitude of booksellers to buyers , whom they regard largely with contempt .
This contempt arises not only from the character of book - buyers , but from their tastes .
I knew a bookseller , a communist of the Enver Hoxha faction , who was constantly frustrated and irritated that the elderly black ladies of the area in which he had his shop were always asking for Bibles rather than for revolutionary literature that he thought that they , as the most downtrodden of the downtrodden , ought to have been reading .
Another bookshop owner of my acquaintance so hated his customers that he would sometimes play Schoenberg very loudly to clear the shop of them .
It was a very effective technique .
Not everything has remained the same since Orwell ’s day , however .
He says that anyone ought to be able to make a go of a second - hand bookshop , but this is no longer the case .
Such bookshops are declining fast in number – recently I was in a coastal town in England that a decade ago had ten of them , and now the last of them was about to close in a week ’s time .
Two developments have led to the decline of the second - hand bookshop .
The first , of course , is the internet .
The internet is both wonderful and terrible .
For instance , it enables patients to learn a lot about their own diseases , and if they are discriminating , sometimes even to save their own lives .
But medical information , or opinion , on the internet has probably already killed far more people than it has saved : the fact that Thabo Mbeki , the recently deposed President of South Africa , found a site on the internet while browsing that convinced him that AIDS was not caused by a virus , and that therefore treatment of HIV with drugs was harmful , resulted in untold premature loss of life that it will take many years for the internet to balance by lives it has saved .
With regard to books , the internet is a wonderful instrument for finding a book that you particularly need or want : if , for example ( and for some obscure reason ) , you are searching for the 1490 edition of Pietro D’Abano ’s Tractatus de Venenis , then you can find it on a site that claims to list 110,000,000 books .
Suffice it to say that you could spend several lifetimes scouring the bookshops of the world in the old - fashioned way without finding it .
But the pleasure of second - hand bookshops is not only in finding what you want : it is in leafing through many volumes and alighting upon something that you never knew existed , that fascinates you and therefore widens your horizons in a completely unanticipated way , helping you to make the most unexpected connections .
According to the owner of a bookshop that I have now been patronising for forty years ( and who seemed to me to be of the older generation when I first met him , but now seems , mysteriously , to be precisely the same age as I ) , browsing in the fashion and for the purpose that I have just described is a thing of the past .
Young people do not do it any more , as they still did when he started his life in the trade .
Instead , they have a purely instrumental or utilitarian attitude to bookshops : they come in , ask whether he has such and such a title , and if he does not they leave at once , usually with visible disgruntlement : for what is the point of a bookshop that does not have the very title that they want here and now ?
There are other pleasures of the imagination that those who do not browse forgo .
When first I bought books from second - hand bookshops I eschewed those with inscriptions , and to this day there are buyers who regard any mark on a book as a defect .
( Orwell tells us that working in a bookshop taught him how few really bookish people there were , and how ‘ first edition snobs ’ are much more common than lovers of literature .
I suppose that first edition snobs are to literature what hi- fi addicts are to music . )
But I have changed my mind over the years , and now even prefer books to be inscribed in some way .
I like copies of books inscribed by the author , particularly when dedicated with a message , and association copies : that is to say , copies that are inscribed by a known personage who has some intellectual or other connection with the book ’s contents .
My rationalist friends find this taste of mine odd and surprising : after all , the value of a book , they tell me , is overwhelmingly in its content , and secondarily ( perhaps ) in its aesthetic appeal as a physical artefact .
There is no rational reason why a book should be more valuable , interesting or beautiful merely because it has the name of a well - known , or at any rate traceable , person inscribed in it , any more than there is rational reason to suppose that by eating the flesh of a slain enemy you absorb some of his power .
This may be so in some abstract philosophical sense , but generations of bibliophiles have not believed it .
To take one minor example from my own small and insignificant collection : a third edition of De Quincey ’s Confessions of an English Opium Eater ( when it was still published anonymously in 1823 ) that was once owned by Edgell Rickword .
Rickword ( 1898 – 1982 ) was a littérateur who wrote books about Rimbaud and Gillray , and was an influential critic in his time who turned communist in the 1930s .
He served in the First World War , during which he lost an eye , was highly decorated and became a war - poet of the second rank .
Some of his lines were memorable and moving :
I knew a man , he was my chum ,
but he grew blacker every day ,
and would not brush the flies away ,
nor blanch however fierce the hum
of passing shells ; I used to read ,
to rouse him , random things from Donne –
Or :
In sodden trenches I have heard men speak ,
Though numb and wretched , wise and witty things ;
And loved them for the stubbornness that clings
Longest to laughter when Death ’s pulleys creak …
I am not at all in sympathy with Rickword ’s later political beliefs , to put it mildly ; but a man who had suffered as he had suffered , and yet had gone on to a long and varied literary career , and who wrote the lines I have quoted , could hardly be contemptible .
Therefore to treasure the treasured possessions of such a man is to do honour to the human spirit .
Books , even without association with anyone known , have an almost sacred quality in any case : it is necessary only to imagine someone ripping the pages out of a cheap and trashy airport novel one by one to prove to oneself that this is so .
If we saw someone doing it , we should be shudder , and think him a barbarian , no matter the nature of the book .
The horror aroused by book burnings is independent of the quality of the books actually burnt .
One of my treasured books is a little classic of which I should never even have heard had I not browsed in so many bookshops .
It is William Blades ’ The Enemies of Books , first published in 1880 .
The frontispiece is an engraving of John Bagford , described as ‘ shoemaker and biblioclast , ’ and another of the delightful pictures is of a furtive charwoman feeding pages of a Caxton Bible to feed a fire .
The enemies of books are ranged in chapters in a great chain of being : first come inanimate forces such as fire and water , rising to the lower animals such as bookworms and other vermin , and finally rising to the pinnacle of biblioclasm , that is to say the conscious book - destroyers , the bookbinders and book collectors .
( John Bagford tore out the first pages of hundreds of rare volumes and bound them into a single folio volume , which is now in the British Library . )
Now William Blades was a civilised man who loved books and knew that one never really owned books : one was their trustee .
He was a printer who waxed eloquent on the subject :
Looked at rightly , the possession of any old book is a sacred trust ,
which a conscientious owner or guardian would as soon think of
ignoring as a parent would of neglecting his child .
An old book ,
whatever its subject or internal merits , is truly a portion of the
national history …
One might add , ‘ And not of the national history alone , but of all mankind ’s history . ’
As Blades puts it , ‘ I do not envy any man that absence of sentiment which makes some people careless of the memorials of their ancestors … ’
Inscriptions in books , even by the unknown , have the effect of reminding us that we are necessarily part of something bigger , and altogether grander , than ourselves .
Inscriptions are , of course , intimations of mortality , for they are mostly by people who are dead but who wrote them with all the same disregard of death with which we pursue of own present moments .
But they also give rise to other thoughts and feelings .
In my copy of The Condemned Playground by the critic , Cyril Connolly , published in 1945 , is a short inscription .
It is in the cultivated hand that one very rarely sees nowadays : a comparison of inscriptions shows how coarse handwriting has become in the last half - century or so .
My guess is that the inscription was written by a young woman , no more than thirty years old when she wrote it .
Her words were few and to me of a great poignancy :
To my beloved husband , Christmas 1945 .
Why should these words have struck me as so poignant ?
Because I think that , though they are simple and could hardly be more direct , no one would use them to inscribe a book now .
At any rate , I have not found so vulnerably tender an inscription in any book since .
It is not so much that our use of language has changed , as that our feelings have changed .
For all our resort to psychobabble and endless talk about ourselves , we are less inclined to lay ourselves open to others , even those closest to us .
Power is more important to us than love .
I recently found another poignant inscription in a novel by Rex Warner , entitled Why Was I Killed ?
Warner was a classicist and novelist most famous for his dystopian fantasy , The Aerodrome .
My copy of Why Was I Killed , printed in 1946 , three years after the first edition , contains the following inscription , also in a cultivated hand :
Bought at Portmadoc and read while on holiday at Portmerion
10.x.1947
Below it is another inscription , in a completely unchanged hand , dated thirty years and nine days later :
The last book read by Barbara during the illness which ended in
her death .
She liked the book enormously .
19.x.1977
I read the book in October 2007 , thirty years later still .
For the last twelve months or so , I have taken to inscribing all the books I read , in a bid no doubt to outlast my own death .

GERSON FEARS FAIRNESS DOCTRINE ….
We talked the other day about far - right bloggers ’ irrational fear of the re-emergence of the Fairness Doctrine .
Apparently , the same paranoia has reached Washington Post columnists .
Here ’s Michael Gerson , warning the President - elect about moves he might make that would “ trigger explosive controversy . ”
The second tripwire concerns the Fairness Doctrine — a federal regulation ( overturned by the Reagan administration in 1987 ) requiring broadcast outlets to give equal time to opposing political viewpoints .
Under this doctrine , three hours of Rush Limbaugh on a radio station would have to be balanced by three hours of his liberal equivalent .
This may sound fair and balanced .
But it is a classic case where the “ unintended consequences ” are so obvious that those consequences must be intended .
It would destroy the profitability of conservative talk radio and lead other outlets to avoid political issues entirely — actually reducing the public discussion of controversial issues .
This kind of heavy - handed approach is a remnant of a time when public sources of information — mainly the three networks and large radio stations — were so limited that government felt compelled to guarantee balance .
Given today ’s proliferation of media outlets , such regulation of speech is both unnecessary and Orwellian .
During the campaign , Obama signaled that he did not support the reimposition of the Fairness Doctrine .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders are big fans of this regulation .
And talk radio is already preparing for a showdown .
If Obama were to endorse this doctrine , even reluctantly , the resulting fireworks would obscure every other topic .
Gerson ’s work is a constant source of disappointment , but this is quite odd .
He ’s warning Obama not to embrace a policy that he already opposes , and which Democrats have no apparent interest in pursuing .
Indeed , the timing of Gerson ’s column makes it look especially foolish — today , the LA Times ran a detailed piece explaining that no one is seriously pushing the Fairness Doctrine , it has no realistic chance of passing , and “ right - wing radio ” is sounding a “ false alarm . ”
Why would a Washington Post columnist take his cues from far - right blogs and radio shock - jocks ?
Why lead readers to think the Fairness Doctrine is a legitimate concern when there ’s no real push for the policy in the first place ?
Al Franken is receiving some high - profile support from Hillary Clinton in his race against Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . )
After stumping with the comedian - turned Senate candidate earlier this week , Clinton is now featured in his latest campaign ad .
“ We do n’t have a lot of time to turn our economy around , and it ’s going to take a new president and 60 senators willing to stand up for change .
Now any single Republican can block the progress we need , ” Clinton says in the ad .
“ Al Franken could very well be that 60th vote . ”

You know , it would be a totally awesome Veteran 's Day segment , says the bleary news producer , if we recreated that famous photo of the nurse kissing the sailor in Times Square .
We think our ideas sound great when we 're drunk , too .
But soon , the painful truth sets in .
This morning Fox & Friends decided to trot the actual nurse from the photo , Edith Shain , 90 , in front of the cameras to kiss one of their interns wearing a paper sailor 's cap .
Witness the awkward Fox & Friends - intern - on - nanogenarian embrace after the jump .
Shain 's been through this before , however .
Here she is with some actor - sailors from Broadway 's South Pacific , recreating the kiss just a bit less awkwardly :

U.S. taxpayers have suddenly noticed where much of the first tranche of the Wall Street bailout is going .
Bloomberg 's Christine Harper asks people how they feel about that :
``I may not understand everything , but I do understand common sense , and when you lend money to someone , you do n't want to see them at a new - car dealer the next day , '' said Ken Karlson , a 61 - year - old Vietnam veteran and freelance marketer in Wheaton , Illinois ...
`` Even really sober people are saying this is the worst financial crisis since the Depression , and they 're saying bonuses are just going to be reduced ? '' said Patrick Amo , a 53 - year - old retired merchant marine in Seattle .
`` Oh my God , you read that and your jaw drops .''...
`` This is the real economy these vultures have wrecked once again , '' said Leo Gerard , president of the Pittsburgh - based United Steelworkers , which represents 1.2 million active and retired members .
``Workers are taking it on the chin through no fault of their own .''...
`` The executives in companies that get bailout money should have their base salaries reduced by 10 percent for 2009 and they should pay back a substantial portion of their 2007 bonuses to the government for the financial devastation they oversaw , fostered and , in some cases , directly caused , '' said S. Woods Bennett , a 57 - year - old lawyer in Baltimore .
`` Their sense of entitlement is appalling .''...
`` The argument of saying we 're not using the bailout money is just crap because money 's fungible , money 's money , '' said [ compensation consultant ]
Crystal , who writes the newsletter graefcrystal.com ...
``Please explain how miserable performance of biblical proportions warrants any bonuses , particularly using money from me the customer and taxpayer , '' said Glenn Brown , 67 , who recently retired after 21 years as a researcher in the department of surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston and as an adjunct assistant professor at Harvard Medical School .
`` I do n't understand how they can even conceive of doing that .''...
`` If these guys were so talented how did this problem happen anyway ? '' said Mark Whitling , 63 , who works as the chief financial officer of a steel service company that employs 125 people in Eastern Ohio .
`` We do n't feel sorry for them .''...
`` It 's crazy , it 's all one company , it 's the same thing , '' said Scott Floyd , a 37 - year - old marketing executive in Manhattan Beach , California .
``For people to say the guys in the brokerage should get bonuses because they did well , but it was just the mortgage lending division that did terribly , that 's a bunch of BS .''...
Karlson , the Vietnam vet , said he thinks Wall Street executives are ``thumbing their noses at the common people '' if they pay themselves bonuses while people in the country are losing their homes .
`` The rationale that they depend on their bonuses , come on , how are we supposed to relate to that ?'' he said .
`` You do n't get a bonus from your company if it does n't do a good job . " ...

How do you feel that your firm is taking taxpayer money and handing it out as bonuses .
Is this fair ?
Will you storm across the street if you get stiffed ?

The skeleton of a 12,000 year - old Natufian Shaman has been discovered in northern Israel by archaeologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
The burial is described as being accompanied by “ exceptional ” grave offerings – including 50 complete tortoise shells , the pelvis of a leopard and a human foot .
The shaman burial is thought to be one of the earliest known from the archaeological record and the only shaman grave in the whole region .
Dr. Leore Grosman of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University , who is heading the excavation at the Natufian site of Hilazon Tachtit in the western Galilee , says that the elaborate and invested interment rituals and method used to construct and seal the grave suggest that this woman had a very high standing within the community .
Details of the discovery were published in the PNAS journal on November 3 , 2008 .
What was found in the shaman ’s grave ?
The grave contained body parts of several animals that rarely occur in Natufian assemblages .
These include fifty tortoises , the near - compete pelvis of a leopard , the wing tip of a golden eagle , tail of a cow , two marten skulls and the forearm of a wild boar which was directly aligned with the woman ’s left humerus .
A human foot belonging to an adult individual who was substantially larger than the interred woman was also found in the grave .
Dr. Grosman believes this burial is consistent with expectations for a shaman ’s grave .
Burials of shamans often reflect their role in life ( i.e. , remains of particular animals and contents of healing kits ) .
It seems that the woman was perceived as being in close relationship with these animal spirits .
Method of burial
The body was buried in an unusual position .
It was laid on its side with the spinal column , pelvis and right femur resting against the curved southern wall of the oval - shaped grave .
The legs were spread apart and folded inward at the knees .
According to Dr. Grosman , ten large stones were placed directly on the head , pelvis and arms of the buried individual at the time of burial .
Following decomposition of the body , the weight of the stones caused disarticulation of some parts of the skeleton , including the separation of the pelvis from the vertebral column .
Speculating why the body was held in place in such a way and covered with rocks , Dr. Grosman suggests it could have been to protect the body from being eaten by wild animals or because the community was trying to keep the shaman and her spirit inside the grave .
Analysis of the bones show that the shaman was 45 years old , petite and had an unnatural , asymmetrical appearance due to a spinal disability that would have affected the woman ’s gait , causing her to limp or drag her foot .
Fifty tortoises
Most remarkably , the woman was buried with 50 complete tortoise shells .
The inside of the tortoises were likely eaten as part of a feast surrounding the interment of the deceased .
High representation of limb bones indicates that most tortoise remains were thrown into the grave along with the shells after consumption .
The recovery of the limb bones also indicates that entire tortoises , not only their shells , were transported to the cave for the burial .
The collection of 50 living tortoises at the time of burial would have required a significant investment , as these are solitary animals .
Alternatively , these animals could have been collected and confined by humans for a period preceding the event .
Shaman graves in archaeology
According to Dr. Grosman , the burial of the woman is unlike any burial found in the Natufian or the preceding Paleolithic periods .
“ Clearly a great amount of time and energy was invested in the preparation , arrangement , and sealing of the grave . ”
This was coupled with the special treatment of the buried body .
Shamans are universally recorded cross-culturally in hunter - gatherer groups and small - scale agricultural societies .
Nevertheless , they have rarely been documented in the archaeological record and none have been reported from the Paleolithic of Southwest Asia .
The Natufians existed in the Mediterranean region of the Levant 15,000 to 11,500 years ago .
Dr. Grosman suggests this grave could point to ideological shifts that took place due to the transition to agriculture in the region at that time .
Natufian grave site
Hilazon Tachtit is a small cave site next to Carmiel that functioned first and foremost as a Natufian burial ground for at least 28 individuals representing an array of ages .
The collective graves found at the site likely served as primary burial areas that were later re-opened to remove skulls and long bones for secondary burial – a practice common to the Natufian and the following Neolithic cultures .
Only three partially complete primary burials were recovered at Hilazon Tachtit .
One was a skeleton of a young adult ( sex unknown ) reposed in a flexed position on its right side with both hands under his face .
The scattered bones of a newborn were found in the area of the missing pelvis and it appears that the newborn and the young adult , possibly the mother , were buried together .

The Bigot Belt
By Eric Oliver
A Guest Post
Like many people , I was fascinated by a map recently published by The New York Times illustrating the shifting vote margins between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections .
Of particular note was the broad swath of counties running from Oklahoma and East Texas through Arkansas to Kentucky and West Virginia where the Republican vote margins actually increased from 2004 .
How , in an election year so dominated by Democrats , did these counties go from merely “ red ” to “ scarlet ” ?
The immediate answer to this question seems to be race .
“ The Deep South still resonates with negative feelings about the race of President - elect Barack Obama , ” wrote Adam Nossiter in The Times , quoting various locals of Vernon , Ala. , who expressed fear of having a black man “ over ” them .
The implication is that in any place where the Republican vote margin increased , whites are more racially intolerant .
Such a conclusion is premature .
Drawing inferences about individual behavior from aggregate data is a classic example of what statisticians call an “ ecological fallacy . ”
In other words , looking at county election returns , it is simply impossible to tell whether McCain voters in Independence County , Ark. ( where the Republican margin increased by 23 percentage points ) , are any more or less racist than McCain supporters in Door County , Wis. ( where the margin swung 20 points toward the Democrats ) .
Nor can county election returns explain why whites in the South are more threatened by a black president than whites in the North .
Perhaps race was n’t a factor at all .
Many “ scarlet ” counties are in regions heavily dependent on the oil and coal industries , and the voting shifts might have been triggered by the Republican mantra of “ drill , baby , drill . ”
To differentiate between these explanations , we need to identify what is distinctive about “ scarlet ” counties .
This may not tell us about the motivations of any individual resident , but it can give us some hints about why the “ scarlet ” counties zigged while the rest of the country zagged .
Based on census data , “ scarlet ” counties were poorer , less educated , more rural , and had higher unemployment than the national average .
For example , in “ scarlet ” counties only 13 percent of adults hold a college degree , on average , compared to 17 percent for the “ azure ” counties ( where Democratic margins increased ) .
Seventy - three percent of the “ scarlet ” counties are rural , compared to 59 percent of “ azure ” counties .
If we think that poverty , low education , and rural residence underlie white racial animosity , then the race hypothesis might have some support ( although “ scarlet ” counties also have a higher percentage working in the mining industry ) .
Interestingly though , the “ scarlet ” counties are not older or more white ; their populations average about 85 percent white and 15 percent over age 65 — rates nearly identical to the national county averages .
If race is so important for explaining these voting trends , then how do we make sense of these last findings ?
The answer comes in looking at both the county and the state together .
One of the biggest demographic differences between “ scarlet ” and “ azure ” counties is the racial composition of the state population : 72 percent of the “ scarlet ” counties are in states that are over 10 percent black compared to only 49 percent of the “ azure ” counties .
In a multivariate regression analysis using all the variables listed above , the best predictor of a county ’s Republican vote margin is its white racial percentage relative to its state ’s black population size .
In other words , the counties where Republican margins grew the largest tended to be predominantly white places in otherwise racially mixed states .
These patterns are consistent with research on individual racial attitudes .
Historically , the greatest levels of racial violence occurred within white enclaves near larger black populations , particularly when these enclaves are poor and uneducated .
Even today , whites who live in poor , racially segregated neighborhoods within more diverse metropolitan areas tend to be more racially hostile than whites who live in either integrated neighborhoods or within largely white regions .
In more diverse settings , locally segregated whites have less contact with nearby minorities yet also feel greater competition for jobs and public goods .
The combination of both increased racial competition and racial isolation seems to be a recipe for generating racial animosity .
The same thing may be happening in the “ scarlet ” counties .
Racially isolated whites in Arkansas or Alabama may have been more afraid of voting for Obama not because they are more racist than white voters in Minnesota or Montana , but because they perceive greater racial competition with nearby black populations .
Of course , this pattern does not account for all the vote shifts .
There were plenty of counties in Oklahoma , Kentucky , and West Virginia that went “ scarlet ” even though the black populations of these states are relatively small ( here , lower education levels and higher white poverty may be at work ) .
Nevertheless , these results should dispel the idea that with the election of Obama , America has somehow “ transcended ” race .
Undoubtedly , racism is still pervasive in the United States , but where it appears depends a lot on social context .
US military leaders and Pentagon officials have made it clear through public statements and deliberately leaked stories in recent weeks that they plan to violate a central provision of the US - Iraq withdrawal agreement requiring the complete withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraqi cities by mid-2009 by reclassifying combat troops as support troops .
The scheme to engage in chicanery in labeling US troops represents both open defiance of an agreement which the US military has never accepted and a way of blocking President - elect Barack Obama ’s proposed plan for withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of his taking office .
By redesignating tens of thousands of combat troops as support troops , those officials apparently hope to make it difficult , if not impossible , for Obama to insist on getting all combat troops out of the country by mid-2010 .
Gen . David Petraeus , now commander of CENTCOM , and Gen. Ray Odierno , the top US commander in Iraq , who opposed Obama ’s 16 - month withdrawal plan during the election campaign , have drawn up their own alternative withdrawal plan rejecting that timeline , as the New York Times reported Thursday .
That plan was communicated to Obama in general terms by Secretary of Defense Robert M.Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen when he met with his national security team in Chicago on Dec. 15 , according to the Times .
The determination of the military leadership to ignore the US - Iraq agreement and to pressure Obama on his withdrawal policy was clear from remarks made by Mullen in a news conference on Nov. 17  after US Ambassador Ryan Crocker had signed the agreement in Baghdad .
Mullen declared that he considered it " important " that withdrawal of US forces from Iraq " be conditions - based " .
That position directly contradicted the terms of the agreement , and Mullen was asked whether the agreement required all US troops to leave Iraq by the end of 2011 , regardless of the security conditions .
He answered " Yes , " but then added , " Three years is a long time .
Conditions could change in that period of time … "
Mullen said US officials would " continue to have discussions with them over time , as conditions continue to evolve " , and said that reversing the outcome of the negotiations was " theoretically possible " .
Obama ’s decision to keep Gates , who was known to be opposed to Obama ’s withdrawal timetable , as defense secretary confirmed the belief of the Pentagon leadership that Obama would not resist the military effort to push back against his Iraq withdrawal plan .
A source close to the Obama transition team has told IPS that Obama had made the decision for a frankly political reason .
Obama and his advisers believed the administration would be politically vulnerable on national security and viewed the Gates nomination as a way of blunting political criticism of its policies .
The Gates decision was followed immediately by the leak of a major element in the military plan to push back against a 16 - month withdrawal plan  a scheme to keep US combat troops in Iraqi cities after mid-2009 , in defiance of the terms of the withdrawal agreement .
The New York Times first revealed that " Pentagon planners " were proposing the " relabeling " of US combat units as " training and support " units in a Dec. 4 story .
The Times story also revealed that Pentagon planners were projecting that as many as 70,000 US troops would be maintained in Iraq " for a substantial time even beyond 2011 " , despite the agreement ’s explicit requirement that all US troops would have to be withdrawn by then .
Odierno provided a further hint Dec. 13 that the US military intends to ignore the provision of the agreement requiring withdrawal of all US combat troops from cities and towns by the end of May 2009 .
Odierno told reporters flatly that US troops would not move from numerous security posts in cities beyond next summer ’s deadline for their removal , saying " We believe that ’s part of our transition teams . "
His spokesman , Lt. Col. James Hutton , explained that these " transition teams " would consist of " enablers " rather than " combat forces " , and that this would be consistent with the withdrawal agreement .
But both Odierno ’s and Hutton ’s remarks were clearly based on the Pentagon plan for the " relabeling " of US combat forces as support forces in order to evade a key constraint in the pact that the Times had reported earlier .
In an article in The New Republic dated Dec. 24 , Eli Lake writes that three military sources told him that the US " Military Transition Teams " , which who have been fighting alongside Iraqi units , as well as force - protection units and " quick - reaction forces " , are all being redesignated as " support units " , despite their obvious combat functions , " in order to skirt the language of the SOFA [ status of forces agreement ] " .
US commanders have not bothered to claim that this is anything but a semantic trick , since the redesignated units would continue to participate in combat patrols , as confirmed by New York Times reporters Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker Thursday .
The question of whether Iraqis would permit such " relabeled " combat forces to remain after next June was discussed with Obama on Monday , according to the Times report .
One participant reportedly said Gates and Mullen " did not rule out the idea that Iraqis might permit such troops … "
Despite Odierno ’s assertion of the US military ’s prerogative to unilaterally determine what US troops may remain Iraqi cities , the Iraqi government has already made it clear that the US military has no such right .
Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mohammed al Askari , responded to Odierno ’s and Hutton ’s statements by saying that US commanders would have to get permission from the Iraqi government to station any non-combat troops in cities beyond the deadline .
The signals from Odierno of US military defiance of the withdrawal agreement suggest that the Pentagon and military leadership still do not take seriously the views of the Iraqi public as having any role in determining the matter of foreign troops in their country .
Nevertheless , the withdrawal agreement is still subject to a popular referendum next July , and Iraqi politicians have already warned that evidence of US refusal to abide by its terms will affect the outcome of that vote .
Washington
Post reporters quoted Sunni legislator Shata al - Obusi as saying that Iraqis " will see this procrastination and they will vote no against the agreement , and after that the government should cancel it according to its provision " .
Beyond the aim of getting Obama to abandon his 16 - month plan , the military and Pentagon group still hopes to pressure Obama to agree to a long - term US military presence in Iraq .
Further evidence emerged last week that Gates is a central figure in that effort .
In a Washington Post column Dec. 11 , George Will quoted Gates as saying that there is bipartisan congressional support for " a long - term residual presence " of as many as 40,000 US troops in Iraq , and such a presence for " decades " has been the standard practice following " major US military operations " since the beginning of the Cold War .
Those statements evidently represent part of the case Gates , Mullen and the military commanders are already making behind the scenes to get Obama to acquiesce in the subversion of the intent of the US - Iraq agreement .

Previous experiments based on eyewitness accounts of the sinking and using scale models of the Mary Rose revealed that the ship would have capsized if a sudden wind had sprung up at the moment it attempted to carry out a sharp turn to outmanoeuvre the French .
I can explain this easily as a guy .
While we often enjoy watching porn , even if its not seen as an act , guys would often react as your boyfriend is ... but why ?
Let 's look at the specifics of things .
A guy viewing porn is inserting himself into the situation observed .
The person involved in the porn itself is not necessarily the focus of the fantasy internally .
This is a one way street however .
While your man viewing a porn is n't necessarily equating the woman in the porn to an actual person , but rather a sexual icon that is unrelated to the actress as a person ; he cannot seperate the idea that others viewing you on tape would view you as the person and not as he actually does with the woman in porn he watches .
The problem is now , in his mind , anyone watching your video would now be a " threat " to your relationship , because they have an attraction to his girlfriend ( albeit this is a ridiculous notion , often times emotions and jealousy have ridiculous roots ) .
Think of it in other terms .
If you and your boyfriend were out in public , a club , a restaurant , wherever .
And some random man walked up and commented on how sexy you looked .
Do you think your boyfriend would take this as a compliment to his resources in having acquired some a beautiful girlfriend as to have random strangers comment on it ?
The man who would not mind making a porno for mass distribution with his girlfriend , is the same man who would appreciate such comments from others about their girlfriend .
It all falls into his self - confidence in relationships as well as threat perception from other possible suitors to you ( whether te risk exists or otherwise )
So to answer you question , is it a double standard ?
No , not exactly , because his viewing of pornography does not touch on any sort of emotional playing field and is purely a substitute for fantasy , unlike women who typically can use their mind as the origination of fantasy material , guys need the stimuli .
As for another man being the partner ; I guarantee that would be the downward spiral of your relationship were that to happen .
And were he to play the male role , as I stated in the former paragraph , its a proxy jealousy of another man having any interest in his girlfriend .

When high - level workers at the McCain - Palin campaign are n’t busy sending out their résumés to the private sector , they ’re calling up reporters to talk on background about who is to blame for the decline of their candidate ’s prospects .
“ The cake is baked , ” a former McCain strategist told Politico .
“ We ’re entering the finger - pointing and positioning - for - history part of the campaign .
It ’s every man for himself now . ”
Staffers in the Virginia headquarters have started referring to the campaign in the past tense , and communication with the RNC has awkwardly ground to a halt .
It ’s as though the hotheaded schizophrenia of the campaign has somehow seeped back into the hearts of its own creators .
Meanwhile , The New Republic today teaches us that Obama ’s now legendary coolheadedness in the campaign is n’t just a product of his own inherent level temperament .
It ’s also a carefully researched and rehearsed tactic that mastermind David Axelrod developed over years of selling black candidates to white voters .
Obama , who knew Axelrod ’s skill in this specific department , courted him as an adviser for years .
The two stories are informative peeks into the insides of the campaigns at the moment , but they ’re also indicative of a new trend :
The guts of both campaigns are still being inspected piece by piece by the media — but only one of them is really being treated like a corpse .

LATE BREAKING :
Dan Lyons , the writer / journalist formerly know as The Real Dan Lyons formerly know as The Fake Steve Jobs is quitting blogging after having a post yanked this week by his employer Newsweek .
Jordan Golson from the Industry Standard reports that Dan told him “ that he is hanging up his personal blog as RealDanLyons.com after his Newsweek bosses made him yank his post where Lyons ( rightly ) called Yahoo ’s PR staff ‘ lying sacks of shit ’
Lyons slammed the company after Yahoo flacks told him just weeks ago that the Google / Yahoo search deal was a “ sure thing ” and that Jerry Yang was n’t going anywhere .
“ Then that deal fell apart .
And now Jerry Yang is out on his ass .
The take - away : Do not believe a word that Yahoo says .
Ever . ”
We are n’t sure exactly how things went down , but the Yahoo PR post and several others are gone too .
You can read my early post today that has the complete transcript of the post he was ordered to pull .
Also while Dan was out slamming people today he also had a few choice words for AllThingsD writer Kara Swisher
Lyons slammed All Things Digital ’s Kara Swisher for touting an “ exclusive ” that Yang was stepping down — an exclusive that was posted five minutes before Yahoo ’s official press release — and then emailing other reporters who failed to note that she “ broke ” the story .
Those highly amusing posts are gone from his site too .
This folks is the ugly side of blogging when you are doing it for a paycheck .
Luckily enough I have a great enough boss here at The Inquisitr that this type of thing is n’t something I have to worry about .
In the meantime – give ’em hell Dan .

Rebelling against Microsoft and its wizards , an engineer rediscovers the joys of difficult computing .
By Ellen Ullman
Last month I committed an act of technical rebellion : I bought one operating system instead of another .
On the surface , this may not seem like much , since an operating system is something that can seem inevitable .
It 's there when you get your machine , some software from Microsoft , an ur-condition that can be upgraded but not undone .
Yet the world is filled with operating systems , it turns out .
And since I 've always felt that a computer system is a significant statement about our relationship to the world -- how we organize our understanding of it , how we want to interact with what we know , how we wish to project the whole notion of intelligence -- I suddenly did not feel like giving in to the inevitable .
My intention had been to buy an upgrade to Windows NT Server , which was a completely sensible thing for me to be doing .
A nice , clean , up - to - date system for an extra machine was the idea , somewhere to install my clients ' software ; a reasonable , professional choice in a world where Microsoft platforms are everywhere .
But somehow I left the store carrying a box of Linux from a company called Slackware .
Linux : home - brewed , hobbyist , group - hacked .
UNIX - like operating system created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds then passed around from hand to hand like so much anti-Soviet samizdat .
Noncommercial , sold on the cheap mainly for the cost of the documentation , impracticable except perhaps for the thrill of actually looking at the source code and utterly useless to my life as a software engineering consultant .
But buying Linux was no mistake .
For the mere act of installing the system -- stripping down the machine to its components , then rebuilding its capabilities one by one -- led me to think about what has happened to the profession of programming , and to consider how the notion of technical expertise has changed .
I began to wonder about the wages , both personal and social , of spending so much time with a machine that has slowly absorbed into itself as many complications as possible , so as to present us with a façade that says everything can and should be " easy . "
I began by ridding my system of Microsoft .
I came of technical age with UNIX , where I learned with power - greedy pleasure that you could kill a system right out from under yourself with a single command .
It 's almost the first thing anyone teaches you : Run as the root user from the root directory , type in rm -r f * , and , at the stroke of the ENTER key , gone are all the files and directories .
Recursively , each directory deleting itself once its files have been deleted , right down to the very directory from which you entered the command : the snake swallowing its tail .
Just the knowledge that one might do such great destruction is heady .
It is the technical equivalent of suicide , yet UNIX lets you do it anyhow .
UNIX always presumes you know what you 're doing .
You 're the human being , after all , and it is a mere operating system .
Maybe you want to kill off your system .
But Microsoft was determined to protect me from myself .
Consumer - oriented , idiot - proofed , covered by its pretty skin of icons and dialog boxes , Windows refused to let me harm it .
I had long ago lost my original start - up disk , the system was too fritzed to make a new one and now it turned away my subterfuges of DOS installation diskette , boot disks from other machines , later versions of utilities .
Ca n't reformat active drive .
Wrong version detected .
Setup designed for systems without an operating system ; operating system detected ; upgrade version required .
A cascade of error messages , warnings , beeps ; a sort of sound and light show -- the Wizard of Oz lighting spectacular fireworks to keep me from flinging back the curtain to see the short fat bald man .
For Microsoft 's self - protective skin is really only a show , a lure to the determined engineer , a challenge to see if you 're clever enough to rip the covers off .
The more it resisted me , the more I knew I would enjoy the pleasure of deleting it .
Two hours later , I was stripping down the system .
Layer by layer it fell away .
Off came Windows NT 3.51 ; off came a wayward co-installation of Windows 95 where it overlaid DOS .
I said goodbye to video and sound ; goodbye wallpaper ; goodbye fonts and colors and styles ; goodbye windows and icons and menus and buttons and dialogs .
All the lovely graphical skins turned to so much bitwise detritus .
It had the feel of Keir Dullea turning off the keys to HAL 's memory core in the film " 2001 , " each keyturn removing a " higher " function , HAL 's voice all the while descending into mawkish , babyish pleading .
Except that I had the sense that I was performing an exactly opposite process : I was making my system not dumber but smarter .
For now everything on the system would be something put there by me , and in the end the system itself would be cleaner , clearer , more knowable -- everything I associate with the idea of " intelligent . "
What I had now was a bare machine , just the hardware and its built - in logic .
No more Microsoft muddle of operating systems .
It was like hosing down your car after washing it : the same feeling of virtuous exertion , the pleasure of the sparkling clean machine you 've just rubbed all over .
Yours .
Known down to the crevices .
Then , just to see what would happen , I turned on the computer .
It powered up as usual , gave two long beeps , then put up a message in large letters on the screen : NO ROM BASIC What ?
Had I somehow killed off my read - only memory ?
It does n't matter that you tell yourself you 're an engineer and game for whatever happens .
There is still a moment of panic when things seem to go horribly wrong .
I stared at the message for a while , then calmed down :
It had to be related to not having an operating system .
What else did I think could happen but something weird ?
But what something weird was this exactly ?
I searched the Net , found hundreds of HOW - TO FAQs about installing Linux , thousands about uninstalling operating systems -- endless pages of obscure factoids , strange procedures , good and bad advice .
I followed trails of links that led to interesting bits of information , currently useless to me .
Long trails that ended in dead ends , missing pages , junk .
Then , sometime about 1 in the morning , in a FAQ about Enhanced IDE , was the answer : 8.1 .
Why do I get NO ROM BASIC , SYSTEM HALTED ?
This should get a prize for the PC compatible 's most obscure error message .
It usually means you have n't made the primary partition bootable ...
The earliest true - blue PCs had a BASIC interpreter built in , just like many other home computers those days .
Even today , the Master Boot Record ( MBR ) code on your hard disk jumps to the BASIC ROM if it does n't find any active partitions .
Needless to say , there 's no such thing as a BASIC ROM in today 's compatibles ....
I had not seen a PC with built - in BASIC in some 16 years , yet here it still was , vestigial trace of the interpreter , something still remembering a time when the machine could be used to interpret and execute my entries as lines in a BASIC program .
The least and smallest thing the machine could do in the absence of all else , its one last imperative :
No operating system !
Look for BASIC !
It was like happening upon some primitive survival response , a low - level bit of hard wiring , like the mysterious built - in knowledge that lets a blind little mouseling , newborn and helpless , find its way to the teat .
This discovery of the trace of BASIC was somehow thrilling -- an ancient pot shard found by mistake in the rubble of an excavation .
Now I returned to the FAQs , lost myself in digging , passed another hour in a delirium of trivia .
Hex loading addresses for devices .
Mysteries of the BIOS old and new .
Motherboards certified by the company that had written my BIOS and motherboards that were not .
I learned that my motherboard was an orphan .
It was made by a Taiwanese company no longer in business ; its BIOS had been left to languish , supported by no one .
And one moment after midnight on Dec. 31 , 1999 , it would reset my system clock to ... 1980 ?
What ?
Why 1980 and not zero ?
Then I remembered : 1980 was the year of the first IBM PC .
1980 was Year One in desktop time .
The computer was suddenly revealed as palimpsest .
The machine that is everywhere hailed as the very incarnation of the new had revealed itself to be not so new after all , but a series of skins , layer on layer , winding around the messy , evolving idea of the computing machine .
Under Windows was DOS ; under DOS , BASIC ; and under them both the date of its origins recorded like a birth memory .
Here was the very opposite of the authoritative , all - knowing system with its pretty screenful of icons .
Here was the antidote to Microsoft 's many protections .
The mere impulse toward Linux had led me into an act of desktop archaeology .
And down under all those piles of stuff , the secret was written :
We build our computers the way we build our cities -- over time , without a plan , on top of ruins .
My Computer .
This is the face offered to the world by the other machines in the office .
My Computer .
I 've always hated this icon -- its insulting , infantilizing tone .
Even if you change the name , the damage is done :
It 's how you 've been encouraged to think of the system .
My Computer .
My Documents .
Baby names .
My world , mine , mine , mine .
Network Neighborhood , just like Mister Rogers ' .
On one side of me was the Linux machine , which I 'd managed to get booted from a floppy .
It sat there at a login prompt , plain characters on a black - and - white screen .
On the other side was a Windows NT system , colored little icons on a soothing green background , a screenful of programming tools : Microsoft Visual C++ , Symantec Visual Cafe , Symantec Visual Page , Totally Hip WebPaint , Sybase PowerBuilder , Microsoft Access , Microsoft Visual Basic -- tools for everything from ad hoc Web - page design to corporate development to system engineering .
NT is my development platform , the place where I 'm supposed to write serious code .
But sitting between my two machines -- baby - faced NT and no-nonsense Linux -- I could n't help thinking about all the layers I had just peeled off the Linux box , and I began to wonder what the user - friendly NT system was protecting me from .

-- Ad for Visual Internet Toolkit from the Distinct Corp. in the Components Paradise catalog
My programming tools were full of wizards .
Little dialog boxes waiting for me to click " Next " and " Next " and " Finish . "
Click and drag and shazzam ! -- thousands of lines of working code .
No need to get into the " hassle " of remembering the language .
No need to even learn it .
It is a powerful siren - song lure :
You can make your program do all these wonderful and complicated things , and you do n't really need to understand .
In six clicks of a wizard , the Microsoft C++ AppWizard steps me through the creation of an application skeleton .
The application will have a multidocument interface , database support from SQL Server , OLE compound document support as both server and container , docking toolbars , a status line , printer and print - preview dialogs , 3 - D controls , messaging API and Windows sockets support ; and , when my clicks are complete , it will immediately compile , build and execute .
Up pops a parent and child window , already furnished with window controls , default menus , icons and dialogs for printing , finding , cutting and pasting , saving and so forth .
The process takes three minutes .
Of course , I could look at the code that the Wizard has generated .
Of course , I could read carefully through the 36 generated C++ class definitions .
Ideally , I would not only read the code but also understand all the calls on the operating system and all the references to the library of standard Windows objects called the Microsoft Foundation Classes .
Most of all , I would study them until I knew in great detail the complexities of servers and containers , OLE objects , interaction with relational databases , connections to a remote data source and the intricacies of messaging -- all the functionality AppWizard has just slurped into my program , none of it trivial .
But everything in the environment urges me not to .
What the tool encourages me to do now is find the TODO comments in the generated code , then do a little filling in -- constructors and initializations .
Then I am to start clicking and dragging controls onto the generated windows -- all the prefabricated text boxes and list boxes and combo boxes and whatnot .
Then I will write a little code that hangs off each control .
In this programming world , the writing of my code has moved away from being the central task to become a set of appendages to the entire Microsoft system structure .
I'm a scrivener here , a filler - in of forms , a setter of properties .
Why study all that other stuff , since it already works anyway ?
Since my deadline is pressing .
Since the marketplace is not interested in programs that do not work well in the entire Microsoft structure , which AppWizard has so conveniently prebuilt for me .
This not - knowing is a seduction .
I feel myself drifting up , away from the core of what I 've known programming to be : text that talks to the system and its other software , talk that depends on knowing the system as deeply as possible .
These icons and wizards , these prebuilt components that look like little pictures , are obscuring the view that what lies under all these cascading windows is only text talking to machine , and underneath it all is something still looking for a BASIC interpreter .
But the view the wizards offer is pleasant and easy .
The temptation never to know what underlies that ease is overwhelming .
It is like the relaxing passivity of television , the calming blankness when a theater goes dark :
It is the sweet allure of using .
My programming tools have become like My Computer .
The same impulse that went into the Windows 95 user interface -- the desire to encapsulate complexity behind a simplified set of visual representations , the desire to make me resist opening that capsule -- is now in the tools I use to write programs for the system .
What started out as the annoying , cloying face of a consumer - oriented system for a naive user has somehow found its way into C++.
Dumbing - down is trickling down .
Not content with infantilizing the end user , the purveyors of point - and - click seem determined to infantilize the programmer as well .
But what if you 're an experienced engineer ?
What if you 've already learned the technology contained in the tool , and you 're ready to stop worrying about it ?
Maybe letting the wizard do the work is n't a loss of knowledge but simply a form of storage : the tool as convenient information repository .
I used to pass by a large computer system with the feeling that it represented the summed - up knowledge of human beings .
It reassured me to think of all those programs as a kind of library in which our understanding of the world was recorded in intricate and exquisite detail .
I managed to hold onto this comforting belief even in the face of 20 years in the programming business , where I learned from the beginning what a hard time we programmers have in maintaining our own code , let alone understanding programs written and modified over years by untold numbers of other programmers .
Programmers come and go ; the core group that once understood the issues has written its code and moved on ; new programmers have come , left their bit of understanding in the code and moved on in turn .
Eventually , no one individual or group knows the full range of the problem behind the program , the solutions we chose , the ones we rejected and why .
Over time , the only representation of the original knowledge becomes the code itself , which by now is something we can run but not exactly understand .
It has become a process , something we can operate but no longer rethink deeply .
Even if you have the source code in front of you , there are limits to what a human reader can absorb from thousands of lines of text designed primarily to function , not to convey meaning .
When knowledge passes into code , it changes state ; like water turned to ice , it becomes a new thing , with new properties .
We use it ; but in a human sense we no longer know it .
The Year 2000 problem is an example on a vast scale of knowledge disappearing into code .
And the soon - to - fail national air - traffic control system is but one stark instance of how computerized expertise can be lost .
In March , the New York Times reported that IBM had told the Federal Aviation Administration that , come the millennium , the existing system would stop functioning reliably .
IBM 's advice was to completely replace the system because , they said , there was " no one left who understands the inner workings of the host computer . "
No one left who understands .
Air - traffic control systems , bookkeeping , drafting , circuit design , spelling , differential equations , assembly lines , ordering systems , network object communications , rocket launchers , atom - bomb silos , electric generators , operating systems , fuel injectors , CAT scans , air conditioners -- an exploding list of subjects , objects and processes rushing into code , which eventually will be left running without anyone left who understands them .
A world full of things like mainframe computers , which we can use or throw away , with little choice in between .
A world floating atop a sea of programs we 've come to rely on but no longer truly understand or control .
Code and forget ; code and forget : programming as a collective exercise in incremental forgetting .
Every visual programming tool , every wizard , says to the programmer :
No need for you to know this .
What reassures the programmer -- what lulls an otherwise intelligent , knowledge - seeking individual into giving up the desire to know -- is the suggestion that the wizard is only taking care of things that are repetitive or boring .
These are only tedious and mundane tasks , says the wizard , from which I will free you for better things .
Why reinvent the wheel ?
Why should anyone ever again write code to put up a window or a menu ?
Use me and you will be more productive .
Productivity has always been the justification for the prepackaging of programming knowledge .
But it is worth asking about the sort of productivity gains that come from the simplifications of click - and - drag .
I once worked on a project in which a software product originally written for UNIX was being redesigned and implemented on Windows NT .
Most of the programming team consisted of programmers who had great facility with Windows , Microsoft Visual C++ and the Foundation Classes .
In no time at all , it seemed , they had generated many screenfuls of windows and toolbars and dialogs , all with connections to networks and data sources , thousands and thousands of lines of code .
But when the inevitable difficulties of debugging came , they seemed at sea .
In the face of the usual weird and unexplainable outcomes , they stood a bit agog .
It was left to the UNIX - trained programmers to fix things .
The UNIX team members were accustomed to having to know .
Their view of programming as language - as - text gave them the patience to look slowly through the code .
In the end , the overall " productivity " of the system , the fact that it came into being at all , was the handiwork not of tools that sought to make programming seem easy , but the work of engineers who had no fear of " hard . "
And as prebuilt components accomplish larger and larger tasks , it is no longer only a question of putting up a window or a text box , but of an entire technical viewpoint encapsulated in a tool or component .
No matter if , like Microsoft 's definition of a software object , that viewpoint is haphazardly designed , verbose , buggy .
The tool makes it look clean ; the wizard hides bad engineering as well as complexity .
In the pretty , visual programming world , both the vendor and programmer can get lazy .
The vendor does n't have to work as hard at producing and committing itself to well - designed programming interfaces .
And the programmer can stop thinking about the fundamentals of the system .
We programmers can lay back and inherit the vendor 's assumptions .
We accept the structure of the universe implicit in the tool .
We become dependent on the vendor .
We let knowledge about difficulty and complexity come to reside not in us , but in the program we use to write programs .
No wizard can possibly banish all the difficulties , of course .
Programming is still a tinkery art .
The technical environment has become very complex -- we expect bits of programs running anywhere to communicate with bits of programs running anywhere else -- and it is impossible for any one individual to have deep and detailed knowledge about every niche .
So a certain degree of specialization has always been needed .
A certain amount of complexity - hiding is useful and inevitable .
Yet , when we allow complexity to be hidden and handled for us , we should at least notice what we 're giving up .
We risk becoming users of components , handlers of black boxes that do n't open or do n't seem worth opening .
We risk becoming like auto mechanics : people who can't really fix things , who can only swap components .
It 's possible to let technology absorb what we know and then re-express it in intricate mechanisms -- parts and circuit boards and software objects -- mechanisms we can use but do not understand in crucial ways .
This not - knowing is fine while everything works as we expected .
But when something breaks or goes wrong or needs fundamental change , what will we do but stand a bit helpless in the face of our own creations ?
Linux wo n't recognize my CD - ROM drive .
I 'm using what should be the right boot kernel , it 's supposed to handle CD - ROMs like mine , but no :
The operating system does n't see anything at all on / dev/hdc .
I try various arcane commands to the boot loader : still nothing .
Finally I 'm driven back to the HOW - TO FAQs and realize I should have started there .
In just a few minutes , I find a FAQ that describes my problem in thorough and knowledgeable detail .
Do n't let anyone ever say that Linux is an unsupported operating system .
Out there is a global militia of fearless engineers posting helpful information on the Internet : Linux is the best supported operating system in the world .
The problem is the way the CD - ROM is wired , and as I reach for the screwdriver and take the cover off the machine , I realize that this is exactly what I came for : to take off the covers .
And this , I think , is what is driving so many engineers to Linux : to get their hands on the system again .
Now that I know that the CD - ROM drive should be attached as a master device on the secondary IDE connector of my orphaned motherboard -- now that I know this machine to the metal -- it occurs to me that Linux is a reaction to Microsoft 's consumerization of the computer , to its cutesying and dumbing - down and bulletproofing behind dialog boxes .
That Linux represents a desire to get back to UNIX before it was Hewlett - Packard 's HP - UX or Sun 's Solaris or IBM 's AIX -- knowledge now owned by a corporation , released in unreadable binary form , so easy to install , so hard to uninstall .
That this sudden movement to freeware and open source is our desire to revisit the idea that a professional engineer can and should be able to do the one thing that is most basic to our work : examine the source code , the actual program , the real and unvarnished representation of the system .
I exaggerate only a little if I say that it is a reassertion of our dignity as humans working with mere machine ; a return , quite literally , to the source .
In an ideal world , I would not have to choose between the extreme polarities of dialog box and source code .
My dream system interface would allow me to start hesitantly , unschooled .
Then , as I used the facility that distinguishes me from the machine -- the still - mysterious capacity to learn , the ability to do something the second time in a way quite different from the first -- I could descend a level to a smarter , quicker kind of " talk . "
I would want the interface to scale with me , to follow me as my interest deepened or waned .
Down , I would say , and it would let me get my way , however stupid or incomprehensible this seemed to it , a mere program .
Up , I could say , so I could try something new or forgotten or lost just now in a moment of my being human , nonlinear , unpredictable .
Once my installation of Linux was working , I felt myself qualified , as a bona fide Linux user , to attend a meeting of the Silicon Valley Linux User 's Group .
Linus Torvalds , author of the Linux kernel and local godhead , was scheduled to speak .
The meeting was to be in a building in the sprawling campus of Cisco Systems .
I was early ; I took a seat in a nearly empty room that held exactly 200 chairs .
By the time Torvalds arrived half an hour later , more than twice that many people had crowded in .
Torvalds is a witty and engaging speaker , but it was not his clever jokes that held the audience ; he did not cheerlead or sell or sloganize .
What he did was a sort of engineering design review .
Immediately he made it clear that he wanted to talk about the problem he was just then working on : a symmetrical multiprocessing kernel for Linux .
For an hour and a half , the audience was rapt as he outlined the trade - offs that go into writing an operating system that runs on multiple processors : better isolation between processes vs. performance ; how many locks would be a good number , not too many to degrade response , not so few to risk one program stepping on the memory area of another ; what speed of processor should you test on , since faster processors would tend to minimize lock contention ; and so on through the many countervailing and contradictory demands on the operating system , all valid , no one solution addressing all .
An immense calm settled over the room .
We were reminded that software engineering was not about right and wrong but only better and worse , solutions that solved some problems while ignoring or exacerbating others .
That the machine that all the world seems to want to see as possessing some supreme power and intelligence was indeed intelligent , but only as we humans are : full of hedge and error , brilliance and backtrack and compromise .
That we , each of us , could participate in this collaborative endeavor of creating the machine , to the extent we could , and to the extent we wished .
The next month , the speaker at the Silicon Valley Linux User 's Group is Marc Andreessen , founder of Netscape .
The day before , the source code for Netscape 's browser had been released on the Internet , and Andreessen is here as part of the general celebration .
The mood tonight is not cerebral .
Andreessen is expansive , talks about the release of the source code as " a return to our roots on a personal level . "
Tom Paquin , manager of Mozilla , the organization created to manage the Netscape source code , is unabashed in his belief that free and open source can compete with the juggernaut Microsoft , with the giants Oracle and Sun .
He almost seems to believe that Netscape 's release of the source is n't an act of desperation against the onslaught of the Microsoft browser .
" Technologists drive this industry , " he says , whistling in the dark .
" The conventional wisdom is it 's all marketing , but it 's not . "
Outside , a bus is waiting to take the attendees up to San Francisco , where a big party is being held in a South of Market disco joint called the Sound Factory .
There is a long line outside , backed up almost to the roadway of the Bay Bridge .
Andreessen enters , and he is followed around by lights and cameras like a rock star .
In all this celebration , for just this one night , it 's almost possible to believe that technologists do indeed matter to technology , that marketing is not all , and all we have to do is get the code to the people who might understand it and we can reclaim our technical souls .
Meanwhile , Andreessen disappears into a crush of people , lights flash , a band plays loudly and engineers , mostly men , stand around holding beer bottles .
Above us , projected onto a screen that is mostly ignored , is what looks like the Netscape browser source code .
The red - blue - green guns on the color projector are not well focused .
The code is too blurry , scrolling by too quickly , to be read .

Just as you can read “ between the lines ” in the newspaper on any given day and discover clues issued by the Powers That Be to what is actually going on , such notice can also be found in the movies .
Such a movie was The Wizard of Oz , an allegory for the new state of affairs in America in the 1930s following the stock market crash and factual bankruptcy of the US Government immediately thereafter .
The setting was Kansas : Heartland America , and geographical center of the USA .
In comes the twister , the tornado , i.e. whirling confusion — the stock market crash , theft of America ’s gold , US bankruptcy , the Great Depression — and whisks Dorothy and Toto up into a new , artificial dimension somewhere above the solid ground of Kansas .
When they finally land in Oz , Dorothy comments to her little companion :
“ Toto , I have a feeling we ’re not in Kansas anymore . ”
That ’s right .
After the bankruptcy , Kansas was no longer just plain old “ Kansas ” — it was now “ KS , ” artificial corporate venue of the bankrupt United States , newly established “ federal territory , ” part of the “ Federal Zone , ” and Dorothy and Toto were “ in this state ” ( “ de facto legislative created corporate state ” ) .
In the 1930s , the ALL - CAPITAL letters - written straw man ( artificial corporate person / commercial entity in all - caps ) , newly created artificial aspect of the former American sovereigns , had no brain — and Americans were too confused and distracted by all the commotion to figure out that they even had a straw man .
The Scarecrow identified his straw - man persona for Dorothy :
“ Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking .
Of course , I ’m not bright about doing things . ”
And in his classic song , “ If I Only Had a Brain , ” the Scarecrow / Straw Man succinctly argued :
“ I ’d unravel every riddle ,
For every ‘ individdle , ’ ( Individual )
In trouble or in pain . ”
Translation :
Once one discovers that his straw man exists , all political and legal mysteries , complexities , and confusions are resolved .
And once one takes legal title to his straw man , he can protect himself from legal trouble or legal damage .
The Tin Man , or “ T.I.N. ” — Taxpayer Identification Number Man , was a hollow man of metal , a “ vessel , ” or “ vehicle , ” newly created commercial code words for the straw man .
Just like the Scarecrow / Straw Man had no brain , this Tin Man vessel had no heart .
Both were “ artificial persons ” ( see legal definition for “ person ” ) .
One of the definitions of “ tin ” in Webster ’s is “ counterfeit . ”
The Tin Man also represented the mechanical and heartless aspect of commerce and commercial law .
Just like they say in the Mafia : “ Nothing personal — it ’s just business . ”
The heartless Tin Man also carried an ax , traditional symbol for God — i.e. modern commercial law — in most earlier , dominant civilizations , including fascist states , in the words of the Tin Man , expressing relief after Dorothy had oiled his arm :
“ I ’ve held that ax up for ages . ”
The word “ ace ” is etymologically related to the word “ ax , ” and in a deck of cards the only one above the King is the Ace , i.e .
God .
One of the “ Axis ” Powers of World War II , Italy , was a fascist state .
[ The root word of “ fascist ” is fas , defined in Black ’s 6th as : “ Lat , Right ; justice ; the divine law .
In primitive times it was the will of the gods , embodied in rules regulating not only ceremonials but the conduct of all men . ” ]
The symbol for fascism is the “ fasces , ” a bundle of rods with an ax bound up in the middle and its blade projecting .
The fasces may be found on the reverse of the American Mercury - head Dime ( the Roman deity Mercury was the God of Commerce ) , and on the wall behind , and on each side of , the speaker ’s podium in the US Senate ( each gilded fasces is approximately six feet in height ) .
At the base of the seal of the US Senate are two crossed fasces .
The Lion , or “ king of beasts ” ( see Gentile ; some members of society regard you and your family and friends as nothing more than animals , “ cattle , ” to be bred and birthed , herded and harvested , and sold and slaughtered according to the whims of those who run the global plantation ) — a denigration in itself — representing the once - fearless American people , had lost his courage .
After your first round with the UCC - constituted IRS “ defending ” your TlN - man dummy - corporation vessel / vehicle , individual - employee public corporation , all - capital - letters - written juristic name , artificial - person straw man , you probably lost some of your courage too .
You did n’t know it , but the IRS has been dealing with you strictly under the laws of Commerce — and just like the Tin Man , Commerce is heartless .
To find the Wizard you had to “ follow the yellow brick road , ” i.e. follow the trail of America ’s stolen gold and you will find the thief who stole it .
In the beginning of the movie the Wizard was represented by the traveling mystic , “ Professor Marvel , ” whom Dorothy encountered when she ran away with Toto .
His macabre shingle touted that he was “ Acclaimed By The Crowned Heads of Europe , Past , Present , and Future . ”
Boy , that Professor Marvel must have been a regular wizard to be acclaimed by the future crowned heads of Europe — before they were even crowned !
Before the bankers stole America , they had long since disempowered the Christian monarchies of Europe and looted their kingdoms .
Maybe this “ Professor Marvel ” fellow knew something about the future that other folks did n’t .
With a human skull peering down from its painted perch above the door inside his wagon , the good professor lectured Dorothy of the priests of Isis and Osiris and the days of the pharaohs of Egypt .
When Dorothy Gale and her new friends emerged from the forest they were elated to see Emerald City before them , only a short jaunt away .
The Wicked Witch of the West , desperate for the ruby slippers that Dorothy was wearing , would have to make her move before our heroes were inside the walls .
A significant point here is that in the original book , The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , published in 1900 ( 39 years earlier ) , the slippers were not ruby , or red , but silver .
At the time the book was written America still had all its gold and silver , and the value of one ounce of gold was set at 15 ounces of silver , silver being the more plentiful of the two metals .
Just as the silver slippers carried Dorothy , America ’s stockpile of silver , and gold , backing the currency carried the country to a position of preeminence throughout the world at that time .
But , as mentioned , when the movie came out in 1939 the slippers were not silver , but red .
Between 1916 and 1933 , most of America ’s gold was rounded up by the private Federal Reserve Bank and shipped off to Fed owners in England and Germany .
The reason for this was that Federal Reserve Notes could be redeemed in gold and the use of Federal Reserve Notes carried an interest penalty that could only be paid in gold .
We traded gold for ( worthless ) paper with green ink on it , and our previous currency , United States Notes , carried no such interest requirement — but such was the bargain that came with the Federal Reserve Notes .
When bankruptcy was declared in 1933 , Americans were required to turn in all gold coin , gold bullion , and gold certificates by May 1st — May Day ( the birthday of Communism in Bavaria in 1776 , the birthday of the IRS , and celebrated worldwide as the “ International Workers Holiday ” — a holy day to the Wizard and his tribe ) .
Talking to people who were alive at that time , you may find out that the general sentiment toward such thievery bordered on a second revolution .
Maybe it was just too much of a clue , or too much salt in the wound for Dorothy to be skipping down the “ Yellow Brick Road ” in a pair of “ silver slippers ” so , for whatever reason , a color less likely to annoy or provoke was selected .
With regard to the choice of “ ruby , ” or red-colored , slippers : Red ’s primary significance , at least on documents and the like , is that it is the color of blood , as in flesh - and - blood , and symbolizes a living , breathing man or woman , i.e. non-corporate / artificial .
It also signifies “ private , ” as opposed to “ public . ”
Your new Social Security Card has a red serial number on the reverse , thus signifying the private - side account attached to your public - side Social Security Account Number prior to Redemption .
For postal employees , red- sticker Registered Mail means “ personal accountability ” ( private ) — all other mail carries “ limited liability ” ( public ) .
It is likely that the ruby slippers symbolized the American people with blood in their veins — as opposed to “ citizen of the United States ” - straw men with the counterfeit “ corporate blood ” of blue / black ink on a birth certificate .
No matter their color in the movie , the Wicked Witch of the West wanted those slippers at any cost and had to move fast before Dorothy and crew could make it to Emerald City .
Her tactic was to cover the countryside with poppy flowers , or “ poppies , ” the source of heroin , opium , and morphine , symbolically drugging them into unconsciousness , and then just waltz in and snatch the slippers .
In other words , the best way to subjugate the American people and boost the goods was to dull their senses by getting them hooked on drugs .
[ Note : LSD was created the same year , 1939 , by Dr. Albert Hoffman . ]
The poppies / drugs worked on Dorothy , the Lion and Toto , our flesh - and - blood friends , but had no effect on the Scarecrow or the Tin Man , the artificial entities .
The two of them cried out for help and Glenda , the Good Witch of the North , answered their prayers with a blanket of snow — i.e. cocaine , a stimulant — nullifying the narcotic effect of the poppies / opium on Dorothy , the Lion and Toto .
Aside from marijuana , for many years the two most available drugs on the streets of America have been heroin and cocain .
As they all scampered toward Emerald City , the city of green ( Federal Reserve Notes , the new fiat “ money , ” or “ money by decree ” ) , we heard the Munchkins singing on the glory of the Wizard ’s creation :
“ You ’re out of the woods ,
You ’re out of the dark ,
You ’re out of the night ,
Step into the sun , step into the light ,
Keep straight ahead for ,
The most glorious place on the face of the Earth or the stars ! ”
The foregoing jingle abounds with illuminist - Luciferian symbols and metaphors re : darkness and light .
The Wicked Witch of the West made her home in a round , medieval watchtower , ancient symbol of the Knights Templar of Freemasonry , who are given to practice witchcraft and also credited as the originators of modem banking , circa 1099 AD .
The Wicked Witch of the West was also dressed in black , the color symbolizing the planet Saturn , sacred icon of the Knights Templar , and the color of choice of judges and priests for their robes .
Who was the Wicked Witch of the West ?
Remember , in the first part of the film , her counterpart was “ Almira Gulch , ” who , according to Aunt Em , “ owned half the county . ”
Miss Gulch alleged that Dorothy ’s dog , Toto , had bitten her .
She came to the farm with an “ Order from the Sheriff ” demanding that they surrender Toto to her custody .
Aunt Em was not immediately cooperative , and answered Miss Gulch ’s allegations that Toto had bitten her :
“ He ’s really gentle .
With gentle people , that is . ”
Could “ gentle ” really mean “ Gentile ” ?
( see Gentile ) When Miss Gulch defied them to withhold Toto and “ go against the law , ” dear old Aunt Em was relegated to “ pushing the Party line ” for Big Brother .
She dutifully succumbed to the pressure and counseled Dorothy reluctantly :
“ We ca n’t go against the law , Dorothy .
I ’m afraid poor Toto will have to go . ”
When Dorothy refused to surrender Toto , Miss Gulch lashed out :
“ If you do n’t hand over that dog I ’ll bring a damned suit that ’ll take your whole farm ! ”
Today , 70 % of all attorneys in the world reside in the West — America , to be exact — and 95 % of all lawsuits in the world are filed under US jurisdiction .
The Wicked Witch of the West and Miss Gulch , my dear friends , represent judges and attorneys ; i.e. the American legal system ( including the attorney - run US Congress ) , executioner and primary henchman for transferring all wealth in America — everything — from the people over to the banks and the government .
The Wicked Witch of the West wanted the silver slippers — the precious metals — and her counterpart , Miss Gulch , wanted to take Toto .
What does the word “ toto ” mean in “ attorney language , ” i.e. Latin ?
“ Everything ! ”
Dorothy and the gang fell for the Wizard ’s illusion in the beginning , but soon wised up and discovered the Wizard for what he was : a confidence man .
When asked about helping the Scarecrow / Straw Man , among other babblings about “ getting a brain ” and “ universities ” the Wizard also cited “ the land of ‘ E Pluribus Unum , ' ” which is Latin for “ one out of many . ”
I.e. converting the many into one = New World Order , or Novus Ordo Seclorum , a Latin phrase placed on the American One Dollar Bill shortly after the bankruptcy .
He also proudly revealed / confessed that he was :
“ Born and bred in the heart of the Western wilderness , an old Kansas man myself ! ”
The bankers did pretty well in Europe , but as the Wizard pointed out , they made a killing in the “ Western wilderness , ” i.e. America , with the theft of American gold , labor , and property from the — quoting John D. Rockefeller — “ grateful and responsive rural folk ” who populated the country at that time .
When Dorothy asked Glenda , the Good Witch of the North ( Santa Claus , Christianity ) , for help in getting back to Kansas , Glenda replied :
“ You do n’t need to be helped .
You ’ve always had the power to go back to Kansas . ”
Translation : you ’ve always had the right and power to reclaim your sovereignty , you just forgot .
The actual act of reclaiming your sovereignty — remedy ( Administrative remedy ) — is a UCC Secured Party Process filing to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury , can be completed from scratch in a matter of hours .
America and Americans have intimate , firsthand knowledge of the heartless mechanics of the laws of commerce , religiously applied by the unregistered foreign agents at the Internal Revenue Service .
The IRS , accountancy firm and collection agency for the private Federal Reserve Bank , was constituted under the UCC at its inception in 1954 and has been operating strictly in that realm ever since .
You may have wondered what is the meaning behind the words in the title “ The Wizard of Oz . ”
Look them up in a dictionary .
Like almost everything else , it ’s right out there in the open for you to see if you will just look closely enough .
One definition of “ wizard ” is : “ a very clever or skillful person . ” “ O - z ” is an abbreviation of “ onza ” , the Italian word for “ ounce , ” or “ ounces , ” the unit of measurement of gold , silver , and other precious metals .
No matter how large the quantity of gold or silver being discussed , the amount is always expressed in ounces .
E.g. rather than “ hundreds of tons ” of gold , it ’s “ so many million ounces ” of gold .
As attested by the factual history of this country : the “ Wizard of Oz ” was the Wizard of Ounces .
Everything worked out for Dorothy , i.e. the American people , in the end and she “ made it home . ”
Meaning : there is “ remedy in law . ”
It ’s there — it was just encoded and disguised and camouflaged .
Fortunately , the code has been cracked , and there is a way home , just like in the movie .
Like Dorothy said , “ There ’s no place like home ” — and there is n’t !
There ’s nothing like sovereignty for a sovereign !
Will you continue to be conned by the confidence men and worship the Wizard ’s Light Show , or will you wise up like Dorothy did and “ look behind the scenes ” ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal judge ordered the release of five Guantanamo Bay detainees Thursday , saying the government failed to show that they were " enemy combatants . "
A guard keeps watch from a tower at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Judge Richard Leon issued the order in the case of six detainees who were challenging their detention .
The ruling by a Bush administration - appointed judge represented another legal setback for the government on detainee policy .
The Justice Department said it " disagrees with the Court 's decision " but did not announce whether it would appeal the order .
The six men listened by phone from Guantanamo to Leon 's ruling as an interpreter in Washington interpreted it phrase - by - phrase in Arabic .
Their end was on " mute , " and their reaction was not heard .
In June , the Supreme Court court ruled that all detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to challenge their continued detention .
On Thursday , Leon ruled that five of the six should be released because the government failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that any of them , other than one man identified as bin Saeed , had planned to travel to Afghanistan to take up arms against the United States and its allies , as the government claimed .
Claims by a single source against five of the men brought up questions of credibility , reliability and corroboration , the judge said .
He ruled , however , that the government had provided ample evidence against the sixth man to prove that he was " an al Qaeda facilitator . "
That detainee is identified in government documents both as Bensayah Belkacem or Belkacem Bensayah .
Leon referred to him as " Mr. Bensayah . "
All six men are Algerians who were arrested in Bosnia in 2002 .
Initially , the U.S. government claimed that they were suspects in a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo .
They were flown to Guantanamo Bay , and five years later , the U.S. government dropped the embassy bombing allegations .
But U.S. officials said the men were planning to go to Afghanistan to fight against the U.S. and coalition troops there .
Leon , whom President Bush nominated to the federal bench a day before the September 11 terrorist attacks , said he recognized that the government could appeal but issued an unusual caution .
" I , too , have a right to appeal to the Justice Department , the FBI , the CIA and the Department of Defense , " Leon said .
" My appeal to you is to strongly urge that you take a hard look at the evidence , both presented and lacking , as to these five detainees " before pursuing an appeal .
Justice Department chief spokesman Peter Carr said the government was pleased with the Bensayah ruling .
" We are promptly reviewing the decision with respect to the other five petitioners , " Carr said .
" We are of course disappointed by and disagree with the Court 's decision that we did not carry our burden of proof with respect to the other detainees . "
As many as 200 other Guantanamo detainees are challenging their detentions in cases pending in federal courts .
About 250 detainees remain at Guantanamo , down from a peak of roughly 750 men from 40 countries .

Important Ruling Places Onus On Elections Officials to Prove Voter Ineligibility ...

Guest blogged by DES
Late last week , a federal court spanked Colorado 's Republican Secretary of State , Mike Coffman , ordering him to restore tens of thousands of registered voters to the state 's voting rolls and allow them to vote , requiring that officials count those ballots , and --- perhaps most importantly --- placing the onus on elections officials to justify the removal of voters from the rolls , rather than forcing the voters to prove they are who they say they are ...
Ian Urbina of The New York Times spells it out :
DENVER -
Tens of thousands of Coloradans who had been removed from the state 's voter rolls will be allowed to vote in next week 's election and given extra protections so their ballots are counted , under an agreement reached late Wednesday in federal court here .
The voters ' names had been removed by Mike Coffman , the Colorado secretary of state , who said he did so because the voters had moved out of state or were listed more than once on the rolls .
But Mr. Coffman was sued by a coalition of voting rights and other groups who said such purges were generally prohibited by federal law within 90 days of an election .
Under the agreement , voters removed from the rolls will be permitted to cast provisional ballots , and those ballots will be counted unless election officials can prove the voters were not eligible .
To strike such ballots , county election officials must conduct an extensive records review on each one , a decision that must then be reviewed by Mr. Coffman 's office .
" This is unprecedented , " said Elizabeth Westfall , a lawyer for the Advancement Project , a civil rights group that helped file the lawsuit .
" We are really thrilled that there will be this degree of unprecedented scrutiny and protection for these purged voters when they cast their provisional ballots . "
...
Edward B. Foley , a law professor at Ohio State University and an authority on voting litigation nationwide , said the settlement was noteworthy because many states had put the onus on voters to prove that their provisional ballots were legitimate before they could be counted .
The settlement shifts this responsibility to the state , Mr. Foley said , and is more in keeping with the spirit of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 , which calls for election officials to count a provisional ballot if they can determine the voter 's eligibility .
[ emphasis added ]
But now it appears that Coffman --- who , as chief elections officer in the state is simultaneously presiding over his own race for the U.S.
House seat vacated by the retiring Tom Tancredo --- in defiance of the court 's order is apparently still purging voters from the rolls .
According to the Rocky Mountain News , Federal judge John Kane issued a cease - and - desist order in an emergency court hearing today ( h/t TPM Muckraker ) :
Federal judge John Kane demanded Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman stop canceling voters from the state registration rolls amid an emergency court hearing this afternoon .
" There has been a violation of federal law , and that must cease and stop immediately , " Kane said from the bench .
" That is the order . "
...
Coffman had told the newspaper that a court - approved agreement worked out this week still allowed him to remove voters from the state rolls when he found duplicate names , people who moved or deceased voters .
" The process is continuing , " he told the Rocky on Thursday .
The plaintiffs , he said " did not prevail ... in stopping us from moving forward with additional cancellation through this election . "
...
" If the defendant [ SoS Coffman ] does n't listen to his counsel , he 's going to be listening to me personally , " Kane said .
" I do n't issue threats idly , and I 'm not issuing one now . … I expect to be obeyed . "
In a statement issued after the ruling , Coffman maintained his office was " in full compliance " with the original order .
But he said he would comply with today 's ruling .
In an earlier story , The New York Times estimated 37,000 people were purged from Colorado 's voter rolls in the three weeks after July 21 of this year .
Chechnya's ' black widow ' bombers
LONDON , England --
A recent surge in suicide bombers from the breakaway Republic of Chechnya has caused security to be beefed up across Russia .
But the war once fought by men and now waged by women -- willing to kill themselves and others -- has caused shock and fear in the Russian capital .
Last week three female bombers linked to Chechen rebels were involved in two separate incidents in Moscow which killed 15 people .
The suicide bombers -- who have become known as " black widows " -- are dressed head - to - toe in black and wear the so - called " Martyr 's belt " filled with explosives .
They were first seen in the Russian capital at last October 's hostage - taking in a Moscow theater .
Kremlin officials say international terrorism is the reason for the increase in women bombers .
" The techniques , the financing , the outside control definitely comes from abroad , " said Kremlin official , Alexander Mochevsky .
But many believe these women are being exploited by the terrorists .
" This is absolutely not characteristic of Chechens , " said Aslanbek Aslakhanov , a member of the Russian parliament .
" Men never send their women to fight in wars .
There is no religious aspect to this -- its psychological ... terrorists exploiting the misfortune of these women , " Aslakhanov said .
Some believe Chechen women who have lost husbands and brothers in the war are desperate to seek revenge .
" There is a line of ( young women ) hoping to be chosen as candidates for being suicide bombers ...
They say they want to force Russians to feel the same pain they have felt , " journalist Anna Politkovskaya told CNN .
On Wednesday , a Chechen woman -- believed to be in her 20s -- tried to smuggle a bag containing a bomb into a busy restaurant in the heart of the capital .
A bomb disposal expert from Russia 's Federal Security Service was killed when the bomb -- with an explosive force of 400 grams of TNT went off .
( Full story )
Last Saturday , two female suicide bombers killed 14 people at a rock concert in Russia where more than 20,000 people were attending an annual music festival .
Both bombers tried to enter to the concert at Tushino air field , north of Moscow -- but were not allowed inside -- and detonated the explosives at entrances to the venue .
( Full story )
It was the latest in a series of suicide attacks that have taken place in Russia and its breakaway Republic of Chechnya .
Last month , a woman killed at least 17 people after throwing herself under a bus carrying members of Russia 's military near Chechnya and detonating explosives .

ALBANY 
In just a few days , Caroline Kennedy ’s bid to replace Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has acquired nearly all the trappings of a traditional New York statewide campaign : a bevy of consultants , a tour of upstate cities and television cameras tracking her every move .
Now Ms. Kennedy has added something else to the list : a platform  of sorts .
Ms. Kennedy has not yet given a substantial interview to any publication and at recent appearances has declined to answer more than a few questions from reporters .
But on Saturday , Ms. Kennedy ’s spokesman provided written answers to 15 questions posed by The New York Times .
Most of the answers were brief , and some did not fully address the questions .
Taken together , they cover only a small slice of the broad array of issues , from the parochial to the profound , that any New York senator is expected to confront .
But as Ms. Kennedy seeks to convince Gov. David A. Paterson that she deserves the seat being vacated by Mrs. Clinton , the answers  drafted by Ms. Kennedy and her staff  provide a glimpse of her political ideology .
In most respects , Ms. Kennedy ’s answers described views similar to those of other New York Democrats , including New York ’s senior senator , Charles E. Schumer , and Mrs. Clinton .
But she appears to support same - sex marriage , a significant difference between herself and Mrs. Clinton as well as president - elect Barack Obama , whose endorsement by Ms. Kennedy was a watershed event in the presidential race .
Just Be Glad This Is n’t YOUR Job… .
Think your job is bad ?
Tired of arbitrary deadlines , endless meetings , and pointless performance reviews ?
Well , before you consider quitting your job , you may want to consider other undesirable occupations .
You might discover that your job is n’t so bad after all .
Check - out the jobs listed below and vote for the real “ worst job ever . ”
Roadkill Collector .
Pretty self - explanatory .
Roadkill collectors not only have the job of peeling the remains of dead creatures in various states of decay off the road , they also get to do it while braving oncoming traffic .
Manure Inspector .
Animal manure is an important natural fertilizer , but first it has to be checked for contaminants like E.coli and salmonella .
That ’s where manure inspectors come in : not only do they get to search for bacteria that causes bloody diarrhea if ingested , they also get to wade through animal waste .
Quite a 1 - 2 punch .
Portable Toilet Cleaner .
You had to know this one was coming .
First of all , I have serious reservations about using portable toilets , much less cleaning one .
Portable toilet cleaners pick up leftover toilet paper , spray on a de-greasing solution , hose the entire unit down with scalding water , scrub , squeegee , dry , and then finish it off with a deodorizing spray .
And yet , even after all of this , I would rather take my chances in the woods ….
Crime - Scene Cleaner .
If not the dirtiest , this is definitely the most mentally disturbing job .
Crime - scene cleaners wear hazmat suits , respirators , and chemical - spill boots ; still , they must have strong stomachs as they brave blood , decomposition , and the loose remains of human bodies once the police have left the scene .
Pest Control Worker .
Pest control workers use their knowledge of pests ’ biology and habits along with an arsenal of pest management techniques — applying chemicals , setting traps , operating equipment , and even modifying structures — to alleviate pest problems .
In short , pest control workers have to think like pests and go where pests go — usually to places that are dark , damp , and dirty .
Plus , they get deal with chemicals .
Ape Urine Collector .
This job sounds unreal but , sadly , it is not .
Ape urine collectors are employed by scientists who need ape urine to study factors that affect their reproduction .
The work involves tracking down apes and laying down large plastic sheets or attaching plastic bags to poles in hopes of catching adequate samples to analyze .
De-construction Worker .
While this may seem like a variation of a regular construction job , the difference is that you ’re not building something — you ’re tearing it down .
By the end of the day , deconstruction workers are literally covered dust , chipped paint , and dangerous debris such as glass .
Still , while dirty and somewhat dangerous , deconstruction might also be strangely satisfying .…
Zoo Cleaner .
You ’d think working at a zoo would be fun , and it probably is , if you ’re the zookeeper .
Zoo cleaners , on the other hand , are in charge of the behind - the - scenes work , which means cleaning the zoo as well as the animals , including the lost and forgotten places on their bodies .
And remember — not all animals are as fastidious as house cats .
Hot -Zone Superintendent .
Hot - zone superintendents perform maintenance work for bio-safety labs that study lethal airborne pathogens for which there is no known cure .
These pathogens include disease - causing organisms such as anthrax .
Given that it is a sterilized lab , the work is not dirty per se .
But what it lacks in dirt , it makes up for in worry .
Dentist .
Probably not the job most people would expect , but it definitely fits the bill .
Dentists spend their days wading around one of the dirtiest cavities in the world — the human mouth — which combines some of the more repugnant features of all of the aforementioned jobs — blood , dirt , bugs , and disease .
What ’s more , unlike other bad jobs , which require little , if any , formal training , dentists are forced to endure years of schooling and pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to even practice their dirty job .
Is it any wonder that dentistry boasts the highest rate of suicide of any profession ?

( CNN ) --
The fourth and final suspect in the fatal shooting of two Arkansas university students turned himself in Monday , University of Central Arkansas police said .
The first suspect was apprehended while driving about three minutes after the Sunday night shooting .
The others were detained later , said Lt. Preston Grumbles .
The suspects were identified as Kawin Brockton , 19 ; Kelsey Perry , 19 ; Mario Toney , 20 and Brandon Wade , 20 .
Police released little details on the suspects other than the fact that they were not university students .
" It does not seem at this time that it was a random act , " he said , but police are " unsure of the precise motive . "
He said there was " no indication " the shooting was gang - related .
University police released the names of the victims Monday .
Ryan Henderson , 18 , of Little Rock , Arkansas , and Chavares Block , 19 , of Dermott , Arkansas , were killed .
Block was a sophomore pre-engineering major .
Henderson was a freshman who had not yet declared a major .
The university 's student government will hold a candlelight vigil in memory of the students at 5 p.m. ( 6 p.m. ET ) Monday .
Religious organizations on campus will host a prayer vigil Tuesday .
A third victim , Martrevis Norman , was treated at a hospital and released .
He is not a student at the university , said Lt. Rhonda Swindle of UCA campus police .
A hospital representative earlier told CNN that the survivor was shot in the leg .
" This is something you pray never happens , " interim university president Tom Courtway said , visibly upset .
" But it happened . "
The shooting , which happened outside a dorm , prompted a campus lockdown and the cancellation of Monday classes .
Courtway said classes will resume Tuesday .
Watch police describe the shooting »
The shots were fired near Arkansas Hall and the Snow Fine Arts Center at 9:22 p.m. , Swindle said .
Freshman Sam Hausen , who was about 50 feet ( 15 meters ) away from the shooters when the gunfire began , said , " I heard about five or 10 shots and , at first , I thought it was just firecrackers , because everybody always clowns around out there , but I just realized that it was n't firecrackers . "
As he began running away , he saw one of the wounded students hit the ground and another stumble into the dorm , he said .
" I saw a couple cars speed off , " Hausen said .
" I do n't know if they were the shooters or not . "
Student Lauren Knight , who was walking to the library when the shooting started , said students scurried for safety .
When the campus lockdown was ordered , Knight was stuck with other students for several hours inside the library , she said .
The university serves about 12,500 full - time students in Conway .

New studies conducted by April Benasich , professor of neuroscience at Rutgers University in Newark , and her colleagues reveal that gamma wave activity in the brains of children provide a window into their cognitive development , and could open the way for more effective intervention for those likely to experience language problems .
“ Research into the adult brain has shown that gamma activity is the ‘ glue ’ that binds together perceptions , thoughts and memories , ” notes Benasich .
“ Little research , however , has been conducted into the development of gamma activity in the infant brain and its possible connection to cognitive and language skills . ”
Benasich and her research team are the first to look at “ resting ” gamma power in the frontal cortex , the “ thinking ” part of the brain , in children 16 , 24 and 36 months old .
In an article published online and in an upcoming issue of Behavioral Brain Research , Benasich offers significant new insight into the likely role gamma activity plays in supporting emerging cognitive and language abilities during the first 36 months of life .
Gamma waves are fast , high - frequency , rhythmic brain responses that have been shown to spike when higher cognitive processes are engaged .
Research in adults and animals suggests that lower levels of gamma power might hinder the brain ’s ability to efficiently package information into coherent images , thoughts and memories .
However , until now little has been known about the developmental course of gamma power in children .
Analyzing the children ’s EEGs ( electroencephalograms ) , Benasich and her research team found that those with higher language and cognitive abilities had correspondingly higher gamma power than those with poorer language and cognitive scores .
Similarly , children with better attention and inhibitory control , the ability to moderate or refrain from behavior when instructed , also had higher gamma power .
There were no differences in gamma power based on gender or socio-economic status .
The measurements were obtained by placing a soft bonnet with 62 sensors on the heads of the children as they sat on a parent ’s lap and quietly played .
In separate tests , children were evaluated for their emerging language and cognitive skills .
The researchers looked both at children from families with normal language development and those at higher risk for problems because they were born into families with a history of language disorders .
As suspected , the group of children with a family history of language impairments showed lower levels of gamma activity .
“ We believe that maturation of the brain mechanisms that support gamma activity and those critical for mounting normal language and cognitive development may be occurring simultaneously , ” says Benasich .
“ We seem to have identified a window , during a period of sustained and dramatic linguistic and cognitive growth , that can help us to better determine where a child is developmentally . ”
Such an understanding could provide for earlier and more effective intervention .
For example , if a child is found to have lower than average resting gamma , intervention and learning methods could be instituted as a preventative measure .
Such early intervention possibly also could result in increasing gamma power in the frontal cortex .
In her other related research , Benasich has discovered that how well infants distinguish differences in successive rapidly occurring tone sequences is a good predictor of future language problems and that it can be determined as early as three months whether a baby will struggle with language development .
These latest findings appear to show that the emergence of strong gamma activity is critical for linguistic and cognitive development and that children at risk for language impairments may lag in this process .
“ Having strong bursts of gamma appears to assist the brain in making the neural connections needed for effective language development , ” says Benasich .
“ By measuring gamma activity in the frontal cortex , which is the last brain area to mature and is used to make decisions and solve problems , we may be able to tell how well the brain is developing in general . ”
Being able to determine a child ’s level of development could allow for more effective treatment at a critical point in time when the brain is laying the foundations for cognition and language and establishing efficient connections for future learning .
From 16 to 36 months , there is a dramatic explosion of linguistic and cognitive growth ; children rush headlong into language , rapidly developing their skills , increasing from a vocabulary of 100 words to 1,000 words , learning that words stand for objects , and that words not only are associated with a specific object but categories , such as “ dog ” representing not just a single animal but all dogs .
“ During this intense learning period , they are little scientists in their environment putting things together and figuring things out , ” says Benasich .
“ Lower levels of gamma power in the resting brain may provide a ‘ red flag ’ indicating that a child will experience language or attentional problems .
Knowing that may allow us to provide effective intervention during this critical learning period . ”

Five common PHP design patterns
Editor 's note :
See the follow - up article " Five more PHP design patterns " to learn about five additional design patterns that you might find useful .
Design patterns were introduced to the software community in Design Patterns , by Erich Gamma , Richard Helm , Ralph Johnson , and John Vlissides ( colloquially known as the " gang of four " ) .
The core concept behind design patterns , presented in the introduction , was simple .
Over their years of developing software , Gamma et al found certain patterns of solid design emerging , just as architects designing houses and buildings can develop templates for where a bathroom should be located or how a kitchen should be configured .
Having those templates , or design patterns , means they can design better buildings more quickly .
The same applies to software .
Design patterns not only present useful ways for developing robust software faster but also provide a way of encapsulating large ideas in friendly terms .
For example , you can say you 're writing a messaging system to provide for loose coupling , or you can say you 're writing an observer , which is the name of that pattern .
It 's difficult to demonstrate the value of patterns using small examples .
They often look like overkill because they really come into play in large code bases .
This article can't show huge applications , so you need to think about ways to apply the principles of the example -- and not necessarily this exact code -- in your larger applications .
That 's not to say that you should n't use patterns in small applications .
Most good applications start small and become big , so there is no reason not to start with solid coding practices like these .
Now that you have a sense of what design patterns are and why they 're useful , it 's time to jump into five common patterns for PHP V5 .
The factory pattern
Many of the design patterns in the original Design Patterns book encourage loose coupling .
To understand this concept , it 's easiest to talk about a struggle that many developers go through in large systems .
The problem occurs when you change one piece of code and watch as a cascade of breakage happens in other parts of the system -- parts you thought were completely unrelated .
The problem is tight coupling .
Functions and classes in one part of the system rely too heavily on behaviors and structures in other functions and classes in other parts of the system .
You need a set of patterns that lets these classes talk with each other , but you do n't want to tie them together so heavily that they become interlocked .
In large systems , lots of code relies on a few key classes .
Difficulties can arise when you need to change those classes .
For example , suppose you have a User class that reads from a file .
You want to change it to a different class that reads from the database , but all the code references the original class that reads from a file .
This is where the factory pattern comes in handy .
The factory pattern is a class that has some methods that create objects for you .
Instead of using new directly , you use the factory class to create objects .
That way , if you want to change the types of objects created , you can change just the factory .
All the code that uses the factory changes automatically .
Listing 1 shows an example of a factory class .
The server side of the equation comes in two pieces : the database , and a set of PHP pages that let you add feeds , request the list of feeds , and get the article associated with a particular feed .
Listing 1 . Factory1.php
<? php interface IUser { function getName ( ) ; } class User implements IUser { public function __construct ( $ id ) { } public function getName ( ) { return " Jack " ; } } class UserFactory { public static function Create ( $ id ) { return new User ( $ id ) ; } } $ uo = UserFactory : : Create ( 1 ) ; echo( $ uo ->getName ( ) . "
" ) ; ?>
An interface called IUser defines what a user object should do .
The implementation of IUser is called User , and a factory class called UserFactory creates IUser objects .
This relationship is shown as UML in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 .
The factory class and its related IUser interface and user class
If you run this code on the command line using the php interpreter , you get this result :
% php factory 1.php Jack %
The test code asks the factory for a User object and prints the result of the getName method .
A variation of the factory pattern uses factory methods .
These public static methods in the class construct objects of that type .
This approach is useful when creating an object of this type is nontrivial .
For example , suppose you need to first create the object and then set many attributes .
This version of the factory pattern encapsulates that process in a single location so that the complex initialization code is n't copied and pasted all over the code base .
Listing 2 shows an example of using factory methods .
Listing 2 . Factory2.php
<? php interface IUser { function getName ( ) ; } class User implements IUser { public static function Load ( $ id ) { return new User ( $ id ) ; } public static function Create ( ) { return new User ( null ) ; } public function __construct ( $ id ) { } public function getName ( ) { return " Jack " ; } } $ uo = User : : Load ( 1 ) ; echo( $ uo ->getName ( ) . "
" ) ; ?>
This code is much simpler .
It has only one interface , IUser , and one class called User that implements the interface .
The User class has two static methods that create the object .
This relationship is shown in UML in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . The IUser interface and the user class with factory methods
Running the script on the command line yields the same result as the code in Listing 1 , as shown here :
% php factory 2.php Jack %
As stated , sometimes such patterns can seem like overkill in small situations .
Nevertheless , it 's still good to learn solid coding forms like these for use in any size of project .
The singleton pattern
Some application resources are exclusive in that there is one and only one of this type of resource .
For example , the connection to a database through the database handle is exclusive .
You want to share the database handle in an application because it's an overhead to keep opening and closing connections , particularly during a single page fetch .
The singleton pattern covers this need .
An object is a singleton if the application can include one and only one of that object at a time .
The code in Listing 3 shows a database connection singleton in PHP V5 .
Listing 3 . Singleton.php
<?php require_once ( " DB.php " ) ; class DatabaseConnection { public static function get ( ) { static $ db = null ; if ( $ db == null ) $ db = new DatabaseConnection ( ) ; return $ db ; } private $ _handle = null ; private function __construct ( ) { $ dsn = ' mysql://root:password@localhost/photos ' ; $ this -> _handle =& DB :: Connect ( $ dsn , array ( ) ) ; } public function handle ( ) { return $ this -> _handle ; } } print ( " Handle = " .DatabaseConnection : : get ( ) -> handle ( ) . "
" ) ; print ( " Handle = " .DatabaseConnection : : get ( ) -> handle ( ) . "
" ) ; ?>
This code shows a single class called DatabaseConnection .
You can't create your own DatabaseConnection because the constructor is private .
But you can get the one and only one DatabaseConnection object using the static get method .
The UML for this code is shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 . The database connection singleton
The proof in the pudding is that the database handle returned by the handle method is the same between two calls .
You can see this by running the code on the command line .
% php singleton.
php Handle = Object id # 3 Handle = Object id # 3 %
The two handles returned are the same object .
If you use the database connection singleton across the application , you reuse the same handle everywhere .
You could use a global variable to store the database handle , but that approach only works for small applications .
In larger applications , avoid globals , and go with objects and methods to get access to resources .
The observer pattern
The observer pattern gives you another way to avoid tight coupling between components .
This pattern is simple :
One object makes itself observable by adding a method that allows another object , the observer , to register itself .
When the observable object changes , it sends a message to the registered observers .
What those observers do with that information is n't relevant or important to the observable object .
The result is a way for objects to talk with each other without necessarily understanding why .
A simple example is a list of users in a system .
The code in Listing 4 shows a user list that sends out a message when users are added .
This list is watched by a logging observer that puts out a message when a user is added .
Listing 4 . Observer.php
<? php interface IObserver { function onChanged ( $ sender , $ args ) ; } interface IObservable { function addObserver ( $ observer ) ; } class UserList implements IObservable { private $ _observers = array ( ) ; public function addCustomer ( $ name ) { foreach ( $ this -> _observers as $ obs ) $ obs -> onChanged ( $ this , $ name ) ; } public function addObserver ( $ observer ) { $ this -> _observers [ ] = $ observer ; } } class UserListLogger implements IObserver { public function onChanged ( $ sender , $ args ) { echo ( " ' $ args ' added to user list
" ) ; } } $ul = new UserList ( ) ; $ul->addObserver ( new UserListLogger ( ) ) ; $ul->addCustomer ( " Jack " ) ; ?>
This code defines four elements : two interfaces and two classes .
The IObservable interface defines an object that can be observed , and the UserList implements that interface to register itself as observable .
The IObserver list defines what it takes to be an observer , and the UserListLogger implements that IObserver interface .
This is shown in the UML in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 .
The observable user list and the user list event logger
If you run this on the command line , you see this output :
% php observer . php ' Jack ' added to user list %
The test code creates a UserList and adds the UserListLogger observer to it .
Then the code adds a customer , and the UserListLogger is notified of that change .
It 's critical to realize that the UserList does n't know what the logger is going to do .
There could be one or more listeners that do other things .
For example , you may have an observer that sends a message to the new user , welcoming him to the system .
The value of this approach is that the UserList is ignorant of all the objects depending on it ; it focuses on its job of maintaining the user list and sending out messages when the list changes .
This pattern is n't limited to objects in memory .
It 's the underpinning of the database - driven message queuing systems used in larger applications .
The chain - of - command pattern
Building on the loose - coupling theme , the chain - of - command pattern routes a message , command , request , or whatever you like through a set of handlers .
Each handler decides for itself whether it can handle the request .
If it can , the request is handled , and the process stops .
You can add or remove handlers from the system without influencing other handlers .
Listing 5 shows an example of this pattern .
Listing 5 . Chain.php
<? php interface ICommand { function onCommand ( $ name , $ args ) ; } class CommandChain { private $ _commands = array ( ) ; public function addCommand ( $ cmd ) { $ this -> _commands [ ]= $ cmd ; } public function runCommand ( $ name , $ args ) { foreach ( $ this -> _commands as $ cmd ) { if ( $ cmd->onCommand ( $ name , $ args ) ) return ; } } } class UserCommand implements ICommand { public function onCommand ( $ name , $ args ) { if ( $ name != ' addUser ' ) return false ; echo ( " UserCommand handling ' addUser '
" ) ; return true ; } } class MailCommand implements ICommand { public function onCommand ( $ name , $ args ) { if ( $ name != ' mail ' ) return false ; echo ( " MailCommand handling ' mail '
" ) ; return true ; } } $ cc = new CommandChain ( ) ; $ cc->addCommand ( new UserCommand ( ) ) ; $ cc->addCommand ( new MailCommand ( ) ) ; $ cc->runCommand ( ' addUser ' , null ) ; $ cc->runCommand ( ' mail ' , null ) ; ?>
This code defines a CommandChain class that maintains a list of ICommand objects .
Two classes implement the ICommand interface -- one that responds to requests for mail and another that responds to adding users .
The UML is shows in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 . The command chain and its related commands
If you run the script , which contains some test code , you see the following output :
% php chain .
php UserCommand handling ' addUser ' MailCommand handling ' mail ' %
The code first creates a CommandChain object and adds instances of the two command objects to it .
It then runs two commands to see who responds to those commands .
If the name of the command matches either UserCommand or MailCommand , the code falls through and nothing happens .
The chain - of - command pattern can be valuable in creating an extensible architecture for processing requests , which can be applied to many problems .
The strategy pattern
The last design pattern we will cover is the strategy pattern .
In this pattern , algorithms are extracted from complex classes so they can be replaced easily .
For example , the strategy pattern is an option if you want to change the way pages are ranked in a search engine .
Think about a search engine in several parts -- one that iterates through the pages , one that ranks each page , and another that orders the results based on the rank .
In a complex example , all those parts would be in the same class .
Using the strategy pattern , you take the ranking portion and put it into another class so you can change how pages are ranked without interfering with the rest of the search engine code .
As a simpler example , Listing 6 shows a user list class that provides a method for finding a set of users based on a plug - and - play set of strategies .
Listing 6 . Strategy.php
<? php interface IStrategy { function filter ( $ record ) ; } class FindAfterStrategy implements IStrategy { private $ _name ; public function __construct ( $ name ) { $ this -> _name = $ name ; } public function filter ( $ record ) { return strcmp ( $ this -> _name , $ record ) <= 0 ; } } class RandomStrategy implements IStrategy { public function filter ( $ record ) { return rand ( 0 , 1 ) >= 0.5 ; } } class UserList { private $ _list = array ( ) ; public function __construct ( $ names ) { if ( $ names != null ) { foreach ( $ names as $ name ) { $ this -> _list [ ] = $ name ; } } } public function add ( $ name ) { $ this -> _list [ ] = $ name ; } public function find ( $ filter ) { $ recs = array ( ) ; foreach ( $ this -> _list as $ user ) { if ( $ filter - > filter ( $ user ) ) $ recs [ ] = $user ; } return $ recs ; } } $ul = new UserList ( array ( " Andy " , " Jack " , " Lori " , " Megan " ) ) ; $ f1 = $ ul - > find ( new FindAfterStrategy ( " J " ) ) ; print_r ( $ f1 ) ; $ f2 = $ ul - > find ( new RandomStrategy ( ) ) ; print_r ( $ f2 ) ; ?>
The UML for this code is shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 .
The user list and the strategies for selecting users
The UserList class is a wrapper around an array of names .
It implements a find method that takes one of several strategies for selecting a subset of those names .
Those strategies are defined by the IStrategy interface , which has two implementations :
One chooses users randomly and the other chooses all the names after a specified name .
When you run the test code , you get the following output :
% php strategy .php Array ( [ 0 ] => Jack [ 1 ] => Lori [ 2 ] =>
Megan ) Array ( [ 0 ] => Andy [ 1 ] => Megan ) %
The test code runs the same user lists against two strategies and shows the results .
In the first case , the strategy looks for any name that sorts after J , so you get Jack , Lori , and Megan .
The second strategy picks names randomly and yields different results every time .
In this case , the results are Andy and Megan .
The strategy pattern is great for complex data - management systems or data - processing systems that need a lot of flexibility in how data is filtered , searched , or processed .
Conclusions
These are just a few of the most common design patterns used in PHP applications .
Many more are demonstrated in the Design Patterns book .
Do n't be put off by the mystique of architecture .
Patterns are great ideas you can use in any programming language and at any skill level .

Quantum physics is both mysterious and difficult to grasp .
Barry Sanders , director of the U of C’s Institute for Quantum Information Science , is hoping to change that .
Sanders , who is also the iCORE Chair of Quantum Information Science , has produced a four - minute animated movie with a team of animators and scientists .
The film is intended for funding agencies , the public , and interdisciplinary teams building quantum computers , so they can see how a quantum computer would work and its underlying science .
For the first time , a detailed description on the making of Sanders ’ animation — Solid State Quantum Computer in Silicon — was published this month in the New Journal of Physics .
This issue is devoted to the leading uses of visualization in astrophysics , biophysics , geophysics , medical physics and quantum physics and Sanders is one the guest editors for this issue .
“ The goal of our animated movie about the quantum computer is to convey to a non-expert audience the nature of quantum computation : its power , how it would work , what it would look like , ” says Sanders , who also has an article published in the December issue of Physics World on the making of his four - minute animation .
“ The animation incorporates state - of - the - art techniques to show the science and the technology in the most accurate and exciting way possible while being true to the underlying principles of quantum computing , ” says Sanders .
The animated movie was completed last year but the clips have not been publicly distributed before now .
Quantum computers harness the power of atoms and molecules and have the potential to calculate significantly faster than any existing computer could .
Some hard computational problems that can't be solved ever by foreseeable computers become easily solved on quantum computers , which could make today ’s secure communication obsolete .
Basic quantum computers that can perform certain calculations exist ; but a practical quantum computer is still years away .
“ There is a history of simple visualization over the last century to convey quantum concepts , ” says Sanders .
He notes that Erwin Schrödinger introduced his eponymous cat , which is left in a tragic state of being in a superposition of life and death , an illustration of the strangeness of quantum theory .
And the uncertainty principle associated with Werner Heisenberg and his fictional gamma ray microscope , has found its way into common English parlance .
“ The imagery of the early days of quantum mechanics played a crucial role in understanding and accepting quantum theory .
Our work takes this imagery a quantum leap forward by using the state - of - the - art animation techniques to explain clearly and quickly the nature of quantum computing which is , by its very nature , counterintuitive . ”
Sanders ’s film will not be released to the public in its entirety , but segments can be viewed freely viewed in the December 2008 issue of the New Journal of Physics .

Global crop yields have not suffered even though key insect populations have shrunk .
Crops may not need quite so many bees for pollination after all .
Punchstock
Bees and many other insects may be in decline almost everywhere — but agriculture that depends on pollinators has been surprisingly unaffected at the global scale .
That 's the conclusion of a study by Alexandra Klein at the University of California , Berkeley , and her colleagues .
Using a data set of global crop production — maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations ( FAO ) — which spanned 1961 to 2006 , they compared the yields of crops that require pollinators with those that do n't .
They found that crop yields for both crop types have gone up consistently , seeing average annual growth rates of about 1.5 % .
There was also no difference when the researchers split the data into crops from developing countries and crops from developed countries .
And when the researchers compared crops that are cultivated almost exclusively in tropical regions , they found no difference between the success of insect - pollinated crops — such as oil palm , cocoa and the Brazil nut — and those crops that need only the breeze to spread their pollen .
Underplayed , overplayed
The results , published in Current Biology1 , are surprising because several previous studies have found very large impacts at local scales .
Taylor Ricketts , head of conservation group WWF 's conservation science programme , and his colleagues , reported in 2004 that pollinators increased coffee yields by 20 % on plants growing a kilometre or less from forests in Costa Rica2 .
In 2005 , a team led by Jacobus Biesmeijer of the University of Leeds , UK , found evidence of a drop - off in bee diversity in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands3 .
This coincided with a decline in outcrossing plant species relative to other sorts of plants .
And worries about a pollination crisis have found their way into international politics , most prominently with the establishment of the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Pollinators ( IPI ) at a United Nations meeting in 2000 .
But some scientists think that the pollinator crisis is overplayed .
Jaboury Ghazoul , a plant ecologist at ETH Zurich , Switzerland , has argued that it is driven mainly by reported declines of crop- pollinating honeybees in North America and bumblebees and butterflies in Europe4 .
Other data show that native pollinator communities elsewhere exhibit mixed responses to environmental change , and Ghazoul says that few staple food crops depend on insect pollinators .
" When the IPI was established , there was some disagreement about how much pollinators are declining , " says Linda Collette , a senior officer on crop associated biodiversity at the FAO , which oversees the IPI programme .
Hidden threat
Klein says her findings do not necessarily negate that idea that the world is in the throes of a pollination crisis .
The data might hide how farmers have adapted to the problem , she suggests .
For example , in almond pollination , many growers move honeybees into their orchards and use pheromones to stimulate foraging activity , she says .
Some even place compatible pollen in the bees ' hives so that they transport it to the desired variety of almond .
And many passion - fruit growers in Brazil now pollinate crops by hand .
For the FAO , the increasing reliance on farmworkers rather than insects may not represent a crisis .
" At the end of the day , what 's important to the FAO is crop production , " says Collette .
" There may be labour costs involved in pollinating crops but there could also be market benefits — if the fruits are better from that , for instance . "
However , Klein points out that a sudden drop in crop yields could be just around the corner .
" There could be a more widespread threshold effect coming , " she says , " especially if the honeybee problems get worse in places like California . "
This may be more likely as farmers all over the planet start to fill ever more hectares with pollinator - dependent crops , which contributed 8.4 % of total agricultural production in the developed world in 1961 but 14.7 % in 2006 .
" We assume that the trend will continue as many biofuels crops , such as canola , oil palm and jatropha , are pollinator - dependent plants , " says Klein .

“ As an investor and board member , it ’s comforting for me to see a team using lean development .
It gives me transparency on product development and engineering .
I even see it reflected in the way the company manages its business objectives and goals . ”
– Scott Raney , Redpoint Ventures
Summary : “ Lean ” is the most capital - efficient way to run a business .
Lean is the never - ending process of eliminating waste : finding every activity that does not create value for the customer and eliminating it .
The two greatest wastes are overproduction ( making things the customer does n’t want ) and inventory ( making things that are n’t used immediately ) .
Every entrepreneur must learn how to run a lean startup ( some people say agile instead of lean — same thing ) .
It ’s the most capital - efficient way to run a business .
It ’s how you get to product / market fit .
It ’s how you do more with less money .
If you ’re not lean , getting lean is probably the most effective thing you can do for your business .
Smart investors and boards will soon be demanding lean .
And smart startups will get lean while the other ones will get left behind .
Q. What ’s a lean startup ?
Lean startups eliminate waste : they eliminate every activity that is not necessary for creating customer value .
If you eliminate enough waste , you can be fast , cheap , high quality , and effective — because more and more of your activities will be creating value for the customer .
In Toyota Production System , Taiichi Ohno ( the father of lean ) says ,
“ All we are doing is looking at the timeline … from the moment the customer gives us an order to the point that we collect the cash .
And we are reducing that time line by removing the non-value - added wastes …
“ True efficiency improvement comes when we produce zero waste and bring the percentage of work to 100 percent : “ Present capacity = work + waste . ”
Toyota created lean and used it to grow from a small company to the world ’s largest automaker .
They simply find every activity that does n’t create value for the customer and eliminate it .
Q. What ’s waste ?
The two greatest wastes are :
Overproduction :
Things the customer does n’t want .
Cars the customer wo n’t buy .
Features the customer does n’t want .
Software the customer wo n’t purchase .
Inventory : Parts that are n’t used immediately .
Mufflers that are n’t in cars .
Features that ca n’t ship because they ’re buggy .
Code that is n’t in customer hands .
Architectures that are n’t coded .
Requirements that are n’t coded , shipped , and useful .
Most to - do lists .
In Extreme Programming Explained , Kent Beck ( the father of Extreme Programming ) says :
“ Taiichi Ohno , the spiritual leader of [ Toyota Production System ] , says the greatest waste is the waste of overproduction .
If you make something and ca n’t sell it , the effort that went into making it is lost .
If you make something internally in the line and do n’t use it immediately , its information value evaporates .
There are also storage costs : you have to haul it to a warehouse ; track it while it is there ; polish the rust off it when you take it back out again ; and risk that you ’ll never use it at all , in which case you have to pay to haul it away .
“ Software development is full of the waste of overproduction : fat requirements documents that rapidly grow obsolete ; elaborate architectures that are never used ; code that goes months without being integrated , tested , and executed in a production environment ; and documentation no one reads until it is irrelevant or misleading .
While all of these activities are important to software development , we need to use their output immediately in order to get the feedback we need to eliminate waste .
“ While individual machines may work more smoothly with lots of … inventory , the factory … as a whole does n’t work as well .
If you use a part immediately you get the value of the part itself as well as information about whether the upstream machine is working correctly …
Parts are n’t just parts but also information …
“ Requirements gathering , for instance , will not improve by having ever more elaborate requirements - gathering processes but by shortening the path between the production of requirements … and the deployment of the software specified …
Requirements gathering is n’t a phase that produces a static document ; but an activity producing detail , just before it is needed , throughout development . ”
Q. How do you get lean ?
Lean probably seems pretty abstract so far .
Next up are a few posts describing specific ways to be lean and eliminate waste .

Ms Aubry appeals to traditionalists within the Socialist Party French ex-presidential candidate Segolene Royal is contesting the results of a vote to choose the leader of the French Socialist opposition .
Martine Aubry , a former minister and current mayor of Lille , won the vote by a razor - thin margin of 42 votes .
Ms Aubry is best known as the architect of the 35 - hour work week .
Supporters of Ms Royal said there had been irregularities and demanded a re-run of the vote next week , raising the prospect of more party in - fighting .
The party has been divided over whether to move toward the political centre or hold to traditional leftist beliefs .
The Socialist Party cut in two
Le Figaro
Press review : French Socialist vote Profile : Segolene Royal Profile : Martine Aubry Ms Aubry , 58 , won 50.02 % in a second ballot of party members .
Ms Royal scored 49.98 % .
Ms Royal 's lawyer , Jean Pierre Mignard , said the result was " contested and questionable " .
" I am not going to take this , " Ms Royal told AFP news agency .
But Ms Aubry rejected her proposal to hold a new vote .
She will be the first female to head the French Socialists .
She takes over from Francois Hollande , Ms Royal 's estranged partner and the father of her four children , who has led the Socialist Party for the past 11 years .
Party infighting
The election went to a second round after a first ballot on Thursday failed to produce a winner with more than 50 % of votes .
Ms Royal gained 42.5 % of the vote , Ms Aubry 34.7 % and Leftist MEP Benoit Hamon 22.8 % .
Mr Hamon dropped out and urged those who had backed him to vote for Ms Aubry in the second round .
Ms Aubry has said she wants to reform the party while also upholding its " leftist values " .
Ms Royal , defeated by centre - right President Nicolas Sarkozy in last year 's election , had said she wanted to renew the party and put it in a position to beat the conservative candidate in 2012 .
There has not been a Socialist president since Francois Mitterrand won a second term in 1988 .
Ms Royal has been accused of seeking to transform the party into her own personal electoral machine , says the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby in Paris .
Supporters had hoped she could reform the party and bring it towards the centre , but critics , especially among the party 's old guard , have accused her of being politically inconsistent .
The voting took place after last weekend 's annual party congress - that was meant to back a single candidate - ended in disarray , with top party members failing to reach consensus on a new leader .
France 's media have said the Socialists showed themselves at the Reims convention to be " ungovernable " .

Among the numerous gems of eloquence with which Barack Obama strewed his path to the White House , one that has already gained a footing in collections of quotations is this :
" We have been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope .
But in the unlikely story that is America , there has never been anything false about hope . "
Because the resonant ideas of hope and its necessary correlative , change , inspired so many Americans to vote who had never voted before , especially among the young and hitherto disaffected , an immediate reaction among observers is to ask : given the inevitability that not all , or perhaps even many , of the hopes that Obama has raised can be realised , surely he has taken a great risk in loading his presidency with such expectation ?
Why is it that people fail to realise how unlikely it is that all the hopes generated by his campaign will come to fruition ?
These are good questions because they are prompted by one of history 's clearest lessons : that almost all political endeavours end in failure and disappointment , whether or not they start in a joyous riot of welcome and relief .
A minor forerunner of Obama 's capture of the White House is Tony Blair 's election victory in 1997 , which reminds us of a painful truth : the higher the starting point , the steeper the eventual fall .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Obama inherits a disastrous legacy of wars , financial crisis and poisoned alliances , an America still divided despite the signal achievement of his victory as a black man , and surrounded by an unstable and uncertain world .
Failure in some or most of the tasks that face him is a near - certainty .
Yet he is launched on those tasks on a tsunami of expectation .
What place can the euphoria of hope have in this , other than to blight him eventually ?
The answer lies not in whether the hopes will materialise in future , but in the catharsis of having hope in the present .
Along with something to do and someone to love , having hope is one of life 's essentials .
It is an obvious but important fact that genuine hopelessness is a destructive , suicidal , terminal state of mind for an individual , and equally corrosive for a society .
Even unrealistic hope is enough to get people out of bed in the morning , and to try again after failure or rejection .
Hope is a psychological necessity , and perhaps it is a distinctive mark of humanity too ; for alone among animals , human beings have foresight which , informed by memory , would seem to give a truly rational individual good grounds for steeling himself against hope as much as possible – and yet most of us do exactly the opposite most of the time .
In describing a second marriage as the " triumph of hope over experience " the inimitable Dr Johnson exploited the central fact about hope : that it is an emotion , and moreover one of those emotions , such as fear , greed , desire and love , that trump rationality every time .
Dr Johnson 's contemporary , the philosopher David Hume , argued that reason cannot move people to act , only emotion can ; unless we felt strongly enough to exert ourselves in one direction rather than another , we would do nothing , but would suffer the fate of Buridan 's Ass , which starved to death between two bales of hay because , having no reason to eat from one bale rather than the other , it could start on neither .
Hope , however , is one of the strongest of motivating emotions .
As a non-rational sentiment it has no interest in weighing the likelihood of success ; it just adds more hope , that things will work out as hoped ; that " this time things will be different " ; that the very strength of hope will itself surmount obstacles and alter realities .
In the not infrequently self - fulfilling way of emotions , hope is thus its own best hope , because in sufficient quantity it can indeed be powerful .
If proof were required , one has only to note that the hopes generated by Barack Obama 's candidacy carried it to success .
The hard realities of office over Obama 's coming four years are of course a different matter .
Even if hope continues to run at fever pitch , which it will not , it can not by itself be enough .
Others have hopes too : Obama 's opponents , among them those who positively hate him and hate the fact that he has been elected , hope that he will fail , and some doubtless even hope that he will be assassinated .
Like the intoxicating hopes raised by a liberal , eloquent , new force in American life , these perverse hopes also help some to get out of bed in the morning .
Hope is no respecter of principle or morality .
The main point , though , is that although hope by its nature is a forward - looking emotion , its real effect lies in the present : it is what motivates and encourages now , it is what makes a difference to how the world seems to us even in the middle of difficulties .
Those cheering multitudes in Chicago 's Grant Park and the streets of other American cities , who had both hope and a vote , to say nothing of delighted people around the world who had no vote but only hope , were reaping hope 's benefits in the moment .
The future was then only relevant as the site of dreams .
One hopes that the fact that they hoped will sustain them as euphoria fades .

Writing custom management commands
The other night in the #django - dev IRC channel , Russ , Eric and I were talking about custom management commands for certain types of common but tedious tasks ;
Eric was discussing the possibility of a command for automatically generating a tests module in a Django application , since he ’s our resident unit - testing freak , and I started toying with the idea of one to generate basic admin declarations for the models in an application .
So I sat down and spent a few minutes writing the code .
I have n’t decided yet whether I want to clean it up into a proper patch against Django ( which would require documentation and some other work ) , or just stuff it away somewhere to break out when I need it , but I thought the process would make an interesting write - up ; although Brian and Michael have both written some tips for doing this , one can never have too many examples ( and someday I plan to expand Django ’s own documentation with more information , so think of this as a first draft ) .
First things first
Before writing any code , first it ’s necessary to decide what , exactly , the command should do .
In this case , I want a few things to happen :
The command should take one or more application names as its input .
If any of the named applications already have an admin.py file , or do n’t define any models the admin could be enabled for , do n’t do anything to those applications .
For an application which does have models and does n’t have an admin.py file , create the admin.py file and populate it with bare - bones admin declarations for all the models in the app .
Leave a couple of useful comments in the generated admin.py file pointing people to the full admin documentation for customization .
Now I can put together the basic files needed for the command ; since I may end up submitting it for inclusion in Django , I ’ll stick it in the logical place : my local copy of django.contrib.admin .
This involves creating a couple of directories and files inside django / contrib / admin :
A directory named management .
Inside it , an empty __init__.py ( to turn the directory into a Python module ) and a directory named commands .
Inside commands , files named __init__.py and createadmin.py ( the name of the command will be taken from the name of the file it lives in , so in this case it will end up being manage . py createadmin ) .
Inside createadmin.py , create a class named Command which subclasses one of the base classes for management commands .
Anatomy of a management command
All Django management commands are classes descended from django.core.management.base .BaseCommand , which defines the basic infrastructure needed for a management command .
But while you can directly subclass BaseCommand if you really need to , it ’s often better to inherit from one of the other classes in django.core.management.base , since there are several useful subclasses of BaseCommand which make common patterns easier to handle :
AppCommand provides a simplified interface for writing a management command which takes a list of Django application names as arguments and does something with each of them .
Built - in commands like sqlall make use of this .
provides a simplified interface for writing a management command which takes a list of Django application names as arguments and does something with each of them .
Built - in commands like sqlall make use of this .
LabelCommand does the same , but allows the arguments to be any strings you like , rather than only application names .
This is used by , for example , startproject , which wants a name to give to the project ( and , in fact , can create multiple projects in one go ; startapp can similarly create multiple applications for you ) .

This is used by , for example , startproject , which wants a name to give to the project ( and , in fact , can create multiple projects in one go ; can similarly create multiple applications for you ) .
NoArgsCommand , which handles the much simpler case of a command which receives no arguments ( aside from the standard django - admin.py and manage .
py arguments like — verbosity and — help ) .
The syncdb utility is a good example of this type of command .
Each of these subclasses of BaseCommand pares down the code you have to write yourself , to the point where writing a new command is a two - step process :
Create a class which inherits from the appropriate subclass of BaseCommand .
Override one method ( the exact name varies according to the class you ’re inheriting from ) , and have that method supply whatever custom logic you need , and a couple of attributes to provide information about the command .
In this case , I want to take a list of application names and do something with each of them , so AppCommand is the way to go ; an AppCommand subclass simply has to define a method with the signature :
def handle_app ( self , app , ** options )
and AppCommand itself will handle the rest .
This method will be called once for each application name passed on the command line ; the argument app will be the models module of an application , and options will be a dictionary of any standard command - line arguments ( e.g. , — verbosity , which becomes the key verbosity in options ) passed in .
Given this , I can already stub out the basics in createadmin.py :
from django.core.management.base import AppCommand class Command ( AppCommand ) : def handle_app ( self , app , ** options ) : pass
So far it does n’t do anything , but that ’ll change in a moment .
Before moving on , there are two attributes which should be set to provide useful information to users :
from django.core.management .base import AppCommand class Command ( AppCommand ) : help = " Creates a basic admin.py file for the given app name (s ) . " args = " [ appname ... ] " def handle_app ( self , app , ** options ) : pass
The help attribute is , appropriately enough , the command ’s brief description , which will be displayed when someone runs manage .
py — help , and args is a description of the command - line arguments it expects ( in this case , a list of application names ) .
Beginnings of the command ’s logic
Let ’s consider a simple example that pops up all over in Django tutorials and documentation : a weblog application , which we ’ll think of as being named weblog , containing two models named Entry and Link .
A minimal but customizable admin.py file for it would look like this :
from django.contrib import admin from weblog.models import Entry , Link class EntryAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : pass class LinkAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : pass admin .
site .
register ( Entry , EntryAdmin ) admin .
site .
register ( Link , LinkAdmin )
If there ’s not going to be any customization , it could be simplified a bit , but I ’d rather have a starting point that I can edit immediately than something I ’ll have to change before I can work with it .
So that output is going to be the goal .
Now , this means I need to generate some Python code programmatically ; there are a few ways I could do this , but since Django has a bundled template system that can generate plain - text files of any type you like , I ’ll just use a Django template to do this .
Normally a Django application uses template loaders to find template files and compile them into Django Template objects , but there ’s no requirement that you do so ; you can create a Template object from any Python string .
So I ’ll just add a string containing Django template markup , and have my command compile it and use it to produce the output .
And now the createadmin.py file looks like this :
from django.core.management.base import AppCommand ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE
= " " " from django .
contrib import admin from {{ app }} import {{ models | join : " , " }} { % f or model in models %} class {{ model }}Admin( admin.ModelAdmin ) : pass { % e ndfor %} { % f or model in models % }admin.site.register ( {{ model }} , {{ model }}Admin ) { % e ndfor %} " " " class Command ( AppCommand ) : help = " Creates a basic admin.py file for the given app name (s ) . " args = " [ appname ... ] " def handle_app ( self , app , ** options ) : pass
Notice that it ’s a triple - quoted string , which allows it to span across multiple lines .
And it ’s going to expect two variables : app , which will be the Python import path of the application ’s models module ( we ’ll see in a moment how to get this from the app argument passed to the command ) , and models , which will be a list of the names of the model classes .
And now I can start filling in the command ’s logic :
def handle_app ( self , app , ** options ) : from django import template from django.db. models import get_models models = get_models ( app )
First of all , I ’ll need the Django template module , so that ’s imported .
In order to find out which model classes are defined in the application , I ’ll also need to use one of Django ’s model - loading functions : get_models ( ) , which takes an application ’s models module as an argument and returns the model classes defined in it .
Next I can compile a Template object from the string I ’ve provided :
t = template .
Template ( ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE )
And now I ’ll need a Context to render it with , containing the two variables the template expects .
The variable app should be the Python import path of the models module for the application ( e.g. , weblog. models ) , and luckily the argument app passed in to handle_app ( ) is that module , so I can just use the __name__ attribute on it to get the necessary path ( __name__ is the name of the module , in dotted import - path notation ) .
And the variable models needs to be a list of the names of the model classes .
For ease of access to this information , Django stores a usable name as part of the model ’s options ; given a Django model class in a variable named , say , m , then m._meta.object_name will be the class name .
So here ’s the context :
c = template .
Context ( { ' app ' : app .
__name__ , ' models ' : [ m . _meta .
object_name for m in models ] } )
Now all that ’s left for a first draft is to render the template with this context , and dump the output into a file named admin.py inside the application .
This means I need to figure out the actual location , on disk , of the application ; fortunately this is easy .
The app argument to handle_app( ) , since it ’s a Python module object , has an attribute named __file__ containing the path , on disk , to the file where that module is defined ( so it ’ll be something like “ / Users/jbennett/dev/python/weblog/models.py ” ) , and functions from Python ’s standard os .
path module will let me split that up to get the directory portion of that path ( “ / Users/jbennett/dev/python/weblog / ” ) and then tack a new filename onto the end of it :
admin_filename = os .
path .
join ( os .
path .
dirname ( app . __file__ ) , ' admin.py ' )
Here ’s how it works :
os.path .dirname takes a file path and returns only the path to the directory where that file lives .
takes a file path and returns only the path to the directory where that file lives .
os. path .
join takes two or more bits of a file path and joins them together ( following the operating system ’s rules for this ) to produce a single final path .
So if we ’re looking at a weblog application whose models module is “ / Users/jbennett/dev/python/weblog/models.py ” , the code above will split off the directory portion , then join admin.py onto the end , to produce the path “ / Users/jbennett/dev/ python/weblog/admin.py ” , which is precisely where the admin declarations need to go .
Then it ’s just a matter of rendering the template and writing the output to the file :
admin_file = open ( admin_filename , ' w ' ) admin_file .
write ( t . render ( c ) ) admin_file . close ()
And here ’s the full code up to this point :
from django.core.management.base import AppCommand ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE
= " " " from django .
contrib import admin from {{ app }} import {{ models | join : " , " }} { % f or model in models %} class {{ model }}Admin( admin.ModelAdmin ) : pass { % e ndfor %} { % f or model in models % }admin.site.register ( {{ model }} , {{ model }}Admin ) { % e ndfor %} " " " class Command ( AppCommand ) : help = " Creates a basic admin.py file for the given app name (s ) . " args = " [ appname ... ] " def handle_app ( self , app , ** options ) : import os . path from django import template from django.db. models import get_models models = get_models ( app ) t = template .
Template ( ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE ) c = template .
Context ( { ' app ' : app .
__name__ , ' models ' : [ m . _meta .
object_name for m in models ] } ) admin_filename = os .
path .
join ( os .
path .
dirname ( app . __file__ ) , ' admin.py ' ) admin_file = open ( admin_filename , ' w ' ) admin_file .
write ( t . render ( c ) ) admin_file . close ()
Improving the command
Of course , this is still missing a few things :
It tries to write an admin.py file regardless of whether there are any models in the application .
It will overwrite any existing admin.py file already defined in the application .
It does n’t let you know what it ’s doing .
It does n’t provide any pointers on how to expand the admin definitions .
Dealing with the first problem is easy ; we can simply look at the list of models returned by get_models ( ) , and if it ’s empty not bother doing anything :
if not models : return
The second problem is a simple matter of looking to see whether there ’s already an admin.py file in the application , and another function in os . path can handle this : os.path.exists ( ) will tell you whether the path you give it actually exists on disk .
So all that ’s needed is moving the admin.py generation into an if block :
if not os .
path .
exists ( admin_filename ) : t = template .
Template ( ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE ) c = template .
Context ( { ' app ' : app .
__name__ , ' models ' : [ m . _meta .
object_name for m in models ] } ) admin_file = open ( admin_filename , ' w ' ) admin_file .
write ( t . render ( c ) ) admin_file . close ()
When os.path.exists returns
True , this block of code wo n’t do anything , and the existing admin.py wo n’t be overwritten .
Providing feedback on what ’s happening is similarly easy ; all management commands allow the argument — verbosity to be passed in , specifying how much output should be printed during the command ’s execution .
As a general rule :
If verbosity is 0 , print nothing .
is 0 , print nothing .
If verbosity is 1 or greater , print basic information .
is 1 or greater , print basic information .
If verbosity is 2 or greater , print as much information as possible ( typically for debugging ) .
The verbosity argument will end up inside the options argument if it ’s specified , and it ’s easy enough to read it out of there and supply a default ( a value of 1 is usually good for this ) in case it was n’t specified :
verbosity = options .
get ( ' verbosity ' , 1 )
Since the application ’s name will be needed for printing messages about what ’s going on , it can be pulled out of the app argument ; this will , again , be the Python module where the application ’s models are defined , and its __name__ attribute is the full dotted Python path of the module ( e.g. , weblog.models ) .
So splitting it on the dots and pulling out the next - to - last item gets the application name :
app_name = app .
__name__ . split ( '.' ) [ - 2 ]
Then some basic information about what ’s going on :
if verbosity > 0 : print " Handling app ' %s ' " % app_name
Then a few other helpful messages can be sprinkled in ; for example , when there are no models define in the application , some debugging output is useful :
if not models : if verbosity > 1 : print " Skipping app ' %s ' : no models defined in this app " % app_name return
And similar messages can be added for the cases where an existing admin.py file is found .
Finally , some helpful comments can be added inside the template , to direct people to the documentation and explain how to use the file :
ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE = " " " from django .
contrib import admin from {{ app }} import {{ models | join : " , " }} # The following classes define the admin interface for your models .
# See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/ for # a full list of the options you can use in these classes .
{ % f or model in models %} class {{ model }}Admin( admin.ModelAdmin ) : pass { % e ndfor %} # Each of these lines registers the admin interface for one model .
If # you do n't want the admin interface for a particular model , remove # the line which registers it .
{ % f or model in models % }admin.site.register ( {{ model }} , {{ model }}Admin ) { % e ndfor %} " " "
And that ’s that .
The final , full command looks like this :
from django.core.management.base import AppCommand ADMIN_FILE_TEMPLATE
= " " " from django .
contrib import admin from {{ app }} import {{ models | join : " , " }} # The following classes define the admin interface for your models .
# See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/ for # a full list of the options you can use in these classes .

The bloody legacy of the Baader Meinhof Gang which caused mayhem across West Germany with its politically - motivated assassinations , bombings and kidnappings is to be portrayed on cinema screens this week in a new film which claims to debunk the myth of 1970s terrorist chic .
Just how raw the darkest chapter in Germany 's postwar history remains has been demonstrated by the angry reaction that the Baader Meinhof Komplex has prompted from victims ' families , the children of gang members and historians .
Some have accused the film - which boasts a cast of top German actors - of being too violent , or of reinforcing the image of gang members as Bonnie and Clyde - style heroes .
Bettina Roehl , the journalist daughter of the gang 's co-leader , Ulrike Meinhof , wrote in a blog : " The Baader Meinhof Komplex is the worst - case scenario - it would not be possible to top its hero worship . "
The Berliner Zeitung critic said the film had given Andreas Baader , the other gang leader and son of a history professor , the stuntman status he had always craved .
" Finally [ he ] has got what he always wanted .
Posthumously he has become the hero of a real action film , " the critic said .
It was Baader 's escape from prison for the fire bombing of two Frankfurt department stores that marked the birth of the Baader Meinhof Gang , otherwise known as the Red Army Faction ( RAF ) .
Its members ' campaigning zeal was triggered by their anger at their parents ' perceived failure to confront Germany 's Nazi past .
The Porsche - driving Baader modelled himself on the Hollywood actor Marlon Brando , and he and Meinhof , a successful journalist , epitomised the glamour that gave the gang its appeal - a status it enjoys in popular culture even today .
The film , due for release in Britain and France in November , has been nominated as Germany 's entry for the Oscar race .
It is the latest attempt to re-examine a period of the country 's 20th century history on the screen , following on from recent hits such as Good Bye Lenin , an account of communist East Germany , The Lives of Others and the 2004 film about Hitler 's last days , Downfall , produced by Bernd Eichinger , who is also behind the Baader Meinhof Komplex .
Based on a book by the former editor of Spiegel magazine Stefan Aust , who got to know many of the terrorists , the filmmakers say they have tried to make it as " authentic as possible " , from the dialogue between gang members - which is partly based on correspondence between them - to the number of bullets fired in each attack .
To counter criticism that the film lionises the charismatic gang members while ignoring their victims , the director , Udi Edel , said he positioned the cameras so they would tell the story from the eye level of the victims .
" I deliberately put the cameras next to the victims , so that we can see what they see ... to destroy the myth that has grown up around the RAF . "
But Michael Buback , the son of Germany 's chief federal prosecutor Siegfried who was gunned down by the RAF in 1977 , complained that victims ' families were not told what events were to be depicted in the film .
Buback had to go to see the film to find out that one of the scenes involved the murder of his father .
It shows a terrorist posing as a nanny pulling a machine gun from a pram on a Cologne street before shooting the prosecutor and his bodyguards .
" It is cruel that little consideration has been shown towards the family members .
We feel we 're playing the victim all over again , " Buback 's son said .
Eichinger was also criticised for failing to reveal new information he claimed to have been given about which of the terrorists was responsible for killing Buback .
Jorg Schleyer , the son of the murdered industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer , said it was " painful " to watch the re-enactment of his assassination , but praised the film 's frankness in portraying the RAF as a " wantonly brutal band of murderers ... without damaging the memory of the victims " .
Frank Schirrmacher , editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper , said the film was " heartbreaking " in its authenticity .
" [ It ] has the potential to make people see the RAF in an entirely new light . "
But one critic , Jan Schulz - Ojala of Der Tagesspiegel , accused the film 's Munich - based production firm of playing the role of a " history waste management machine " .
" They 're taking the radiation waste of the nation and burying it in the dumping ground of moving pictures , " he wrote .
In a similar vein , the company 's next film , Anonymous , tells of the mass rape of German women by Russian soldiers after the capture of Berlin in 1945 .
Backstory
The Red Army Faction ( RAF ) also known as the Baader Meinhof Gang after its two leaders , was originally inspired by the 1960s student protests against the Vietnam war and other anti-US demonstrations .
When the protesters became radicalised they sought to make their point with bomb attacks , assassinations and kidnappings across West Germany .
Their 34 victims included the leading industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer , the Dresdner Bank head Jurgen Ponto and the federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback .
Twenty six members of the RAF died during the campaign .
Many were sentenced to long jail sentences .
Baader and Meinhof were among those who committed suicide in Stuttgart 's Stammheim prison in 1976 .
A second RAF generation then took up the fight .
The group finally disbanded in 1998 .
In recent years the RAF has been celebrated by a wave of " terrorist chic " , spawning books , films and paraphernalia including " Prada Meinhof " T - shirts and bags with the group 's Heckler and Koch machine gun logo .
Summary of Findings
Many more Americans are turning to the internet for campaign news this year as the web becomes a key source of election news .
Television remains the dominant source , but the percent who say they get most of their campaign news from the internet has tripled since October 2004 ( from 10 % then to 33 % now ) .
While use of the web has seen considerable growth , the percentage of Americans relying on TV and newspapers for campaign news has remained relatively flat since 2004 .
The internet now rivals newspapers as a main source for campaign news .
And with so much interest in the election next week , the public ’s use of the internet as a campaign news source is up even since the primaries earlier this year .
In March , 26 % cited the internet as a main source for election news , while the percentages citing television and newspapers remain largely unchanged .
Not surprisingly , the internet is a considerably more popular source for campaign news among younger Americans than older ones .
Nearly three times as many people ages 18 to 29 mention the internet than mention newspapers as a main source of election news ( 49 % vs. 17 % ) .
Nearly the opposite is true among those over age 50 : some 22 % rely on the internet for election news while 39 % look to newspapers .
Compared with 2004 , use of the internet for election news has increased across all age groups .
Among the youngest cohort ( age 18 - 29 ) , TV has lost significant ground to the internet .
On television , the cable news outlets clearly dominate the big three networks as main sources of campaign news .
Nearly half of the public ( 46 % ) turns to the cable news channels , with 25 % naming CNN as a main source of campaign news , 21 % naming Fox News Channel and 10 % naming MSNBC .
Only 24 % rely on the network news outlets ABC , CBS and NBC .
Another 13 % look to local TV news .
This reflects broader changes in news consumption patterns .
In recent years , cable news outlets have overtaken the networks as the general news sources that the public watches most regularly .
[ See “ Key News Audiences Now Blend Online and Traditional Sources ” ; released August 17 , 2008 ]
Cable News Audiences Highly Partisan
The audiences for the major cable news networks are highly partisan , while the audiences for network TV and the internet are more in line with the general public .
Among those who name the Fox News Channel as their main source for campaign news , 52 % are Republicans and only 17 % are Democrats .
By contrast , among those who rely on MSNBC for their campaign news , 50 % are Democrats and only 11 % are Republicans .
Similarly , CNN ’s campaign news audience is largely Democratic – 45 % are Democrats and 13 % are Republicans .
Notably , there are substantial differences in awareness of recent campaign events among the different cable news audiences .
Majorities in each audience said they heard a lot about reports that the Republican National Committee spent about $ 150,000 on clothing for Sarah Palin and her family .
But far more of those who get most campaign news from MSNBC than those who rely on Fox News heard a lot about the controversy ( 71 % vs. 51 % , respectively heard a lot about this story ) .
Among those who turn to CNN for election news , 62 % reported hearing a lot about Palin ’s wardrobe .
Colin Powell ’s endorsement of Barack Obama registered more widely among the MSNBC news audience than among those who rely on Fox News for presidential campaign coverage .
Seven - in - ten MSNBC viewers heard a lot about the Powell endorsement , compared with 54 % of the Fox News audience .
Close to six - in - ten ( 59 % ) of those who turn to CNN heard a lot about the endorsement .
About two - thirds of those who rely mainly on Fox News for campaign coverage ( 66 % ) said they had heard a lot about links between Obama and ACORN , the community organizing group that has been accused of voter registration fraud .
A comparable proportion ( 62 % ) of those who rely mainly on MSNBC heard a lot about this story .
A majority of those who get most of their campaign news from CNN ( 52 % ) heard a lot about the ACORN allegations .
About the Survey
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Sunday through Friday ) PEJ will compile this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey will collect data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
The results for this press release are based on landline telephone interviews conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) based on the combined data from two nationwide samples of adults , 18 years of age or older .
For results based on the combined sample of 2,011 respondents , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points .
For results based on the separate survey samples conducted October 17 - 20 , 2008 ( N=1,003 ) and October 24 - 27 , 2008 ( N=1,008 ) , the sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .
As an avid horror fan , I found the prospect of last week 's five - night TV zombie spectacular rather exciting .
Admittedly , the trailer for E4's Dead Set made me somewhat uneasy .
The sight of newsreader Krishnan Guru - Murthy warning the populace of an impending zombie apocalypse induced a sickening sense of indignation .
Only five years previously , Edgar Wright and I had hired Krishnan to do the very same thing in our own zombie opus , Shaun of the Dead .
It was a bit like seeing an ex-lover walking down the street pushing a pram .
Of course , this was a knee - jerk reaction .
It 's not as if Edgar and I had n't already pushed someone else 's baby up the cultural high street - but that , to some extent , was the point .
In Shaun of the Dead , we lifted the mythology established by George A Romero in his 1968 film Night of the Living Dead and offset it against the conventions of a romantic comedy .
Still , I had to acknowledge Dead Set 's impressive credentials .
The concept was clever in its simplicity : a full - scale zombie outbreak coincides with a Big Brother eviction night , leaving the Big Brother house as the last refuge for the survivors .
Scripted by Charlie Brooker , a writer whose scalpel - sharp incisiveness I have long been a fan of , and featuring talented actors such as Jaime Winstone and the outstanding Kevin Eldon , the show heralded the arrival of genuine homegrown horror , scratching at the fringes of network television .
My expectations were high , and I sat down to watch a show that proved smart , inventive and enjoyable , but for one key detail : ZOMBIES DON'T RUN !
I know it is absurd to debate the rules of a reality that does not exist , but this genuinely irks me .
You cannot kill a vampire with an MDF stake ; werewolves can't fly ; zombies do not run .
It 's a misconception , a bastardisation that diminishes a classic movie monster .
The best phantasmagoria uses reality to render the inconceivable conceivable .
The speedy zombie seems implausible to me , even within the fantastic realm it inhabits .
A biological agent , I 'll buy .
Some sort of super - virus ?
Sure , why not .
But death ?
Death is a disability , not a superpower .
It 's hard to run with a cold , let alone the most debilitating malady of them all .
More significantly , the fast zombie is bereft of poetic subtlety .
As monsters from the id , zombies win out over vampires and werewolves when it comes to the title of Most Potent Metaphorical Monster .
Where their pointy - toothed cousins are all about sex and bestial savagery , the zombie trumps all by personifying our deepest fear : death .
Zombies are our destiny writ large .
Slow and steady in their approach , weak , clumsy , often absurd , the zombie relentlessly closes in , unstoppable , intractable .
However ( and herein lies the sublime artfulness of the slow zombie ) , their ineptitude actually makes them avoidable , at least for a while .
If you 're careful , if you keep your wits about you , you can stave them off , even outstrip them - much as we strive to outstrip death .
Drink less , cut out red meat , exercise , practice safe sex ; these are our shotguns , our cricket bats , our farmhouses , our shopping malls .
However , none of these things fully insulates us from the creeping dread that something so witless , so elemental may yet catch us unawares - the drunk driver , the cancer sleeping in the double helix , the legless ghoul dragging itself through the darkness towards our ankles .
Another thing : speed simplifies the zombie , clarifying the threat and reducing any response to an emotional reflex .
It 's the difference between someone shouting " Boo ! " and hearing the sound of the floorboards creaking in an upstairs room : a quick thrill at the expense of a more profound sense of dread .
The absence of rage or aggression in slow zombies makes them oddly sympathetic , a detail that enabled Romero to project depth on to their blankness , to create tragic anti-heroes ; his were figures to be pitied , empathised with , even rooted for .
The moment they appear angry or petulant , the second they emit furious velociraptor screeches ( as opposed to the correct mournful moans of longing ) , they cease to possess any ambiguity .
They are simply mean .
So how did this break with convention come about ?
The process has unfolded with all the infuriating dramatic irony of an episode of Fawlty Towers .
To begin at the beginning , Haitian folklore tells of voodoo shamans , or bokors , who would use digitalis , derived from the foxglove plant , to induce somnambulant trances in individuals who would subsequently appear dead .
Weeks later , relatives of the supposedly deceased would witness their lost loved ones in a soporific malaise , working in the fields of wealthy landowners , and assume them to be nzambi ( a west African word for " spirit of the dead " ) .
From the combination of nzambi and somnambulist ( " sleepwalker " ) we get the word zombie .
The legend was appropriated by the film industry , and for 20 or 30 years a steady flow of voodoo - based cinema emerged from the Hollywood horror factory .
Then a young filmmaker from Pittsburgh by the name of George A Romero changed everything .
Romero 's fascination with Richard Matheson 's novel I Am Legend , the story of a lone survivor struggling in a world overrun by vampires , led him to fixate on an aspect of the story leapfrogged by the author : namely , the process by which humanity is subjugated by the aggressive new species .
Romero adopted the Haitian zombie and combined it with notions of cannibalism , as well as the viral communicability characterised by the vampire and werewolf myths , and so created the modern zombie .
After three films spanning three decades , and much imitation from film - makers such as Lucio Fulci and Dan O'Bannon , the credibility of the zombie was dealt a cruel blow by the king of pop .
Michael Jackson 's
Thriller video , directed by John Landis , was entertaining but made it rather difficult for us to take zombies seriously , having witnessed them body - popping .
The blushing dead went quiet for a while , until the Japanese video game company Capcom developed the game Resident Evil , which brilliantly captured the spirit of Romero 's shambling antagonists ( Romero even directed a trailer for the second installment ) .
Slow and steady , the zombie commenced its stumble back into our collective subconscious .
Inspired by the game and a shared love of Romero , Edgar Wright and I decided to create our own black comedy .
Meanwhile , Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were developing their own end - of - the - world fable , 28 Days Later , an excellent film misconstrued by the media as a zombie flick .
Boyle and Garland never set out to make a zombie film per se .
They drew instead on John Wyndham 's Day of the Triffids , as well as Matheson and Romero 's work , to fashion a new strain of survival horror , featuring a London beset by rabid propagators of a virus known as " rage " .
The success of the movie , particularly in the US , was undoubtedly a factor in the loose remake of Romero 's Dawn of the Dead in 2004 .
Zack Snyder 's effective but pointless reboot parlayed Boyle 's " infected " into the upgraded zombie 2.0 , likely at the behest of some cigar - chomping , focus - group - happy movie exec desperate to satisfy the MTV generation 's demand for quicker everything - quicker food , quicker downloads , quicker dead people .
The zombie was ushered on to the mainstream stage , on the proviso that it sprinted up to the mic .
The genre was diminished , and I think it 's a shame .
Despite my purist griping , I liked Dead Set a lot .
It had solid performances , imaginative direction , good gore and the kind of inventive writing and verbal playfulness we 've come to expect from the always brilliant Brooker .
As a satire , it took pleasing chunks out of media bumptiousness and , more significantly , the aggressive collectivism demonstrated by the lost souls who waste their Friday nights standing outside the Big Brother house , baying for the blood of those inside .
Like Romero , Brooker simply nudges the metaphor to its literal conclusion , and spatters his point across our screens in blood and brains and bits of skull .
If he had only eschewed the zeitgeist and embraced the docile , creeping weirdness that has served to embed the zombie so deeply in our grey matter , Dead Set might have been my favourite piece of television ever .
As it was , I had to settle for it merely being bloody good .
PATRIOT games
star - spangled yards filled with
red , white , and blue
colorful porches
yellow ribbons

" We are the real Americans "
implying that you are not .
We took it back .
Lapel pins become a patriot act
the banner appropriated
symbols replace ideas
do not question

it is un-American

oh say , ca n't you see ?
you 're either for us , or against U.S .
either way
you are not a part of Us .
We took it back .
One proud November evening
a people speak as one
a spirit rises , a spirit older than Old Glory
born in Boston 's harbor
in Lexington and Concord
in Philadelphia
in schools and churches
in living rooms from coast to coast
and again we saw
the governed revoke their consent
a destructive government abolished
cheering as the stars and stripes wave in the street
on a morning when the dreams of a nation are realized
We took it back .
It is ours , once again .

Suppose you were a skilled hypnotist , and so charismatic that you knew you could change the opinion of an average person simply by your choice of words .
Would it be ethical to be that persuasive ?
To make it interesting , let ’s say you believe in the rightness of your own views , and you are talking to someone who firmly believes the opposite .
You both have the same information at your disposal , so it is simply a case of different opinions .
If you knew you could sway that person with your words , without adding any new information to the mix , would it be ethical to do so ?
I encountered this dilemma after learning hypnosis .
You can extend the methods of hypnosis into normal conversation , the way a trial lawyer , politician , or top salesperson would .
You ca n’t turn anyone into a zombie slave , but obviously a skilled salesperson can close more deals than an unskilled one .
Your choice of words has a huge impact on how other people form their so - called opinions .
Where do you draw the line between a normal exchange of views and an outright manipulation of another person ’s brain ?
Long time readers of this blog know that I view humans as moist robots who have no free will , and therefore morality is an irrational concept .
But most of you disagree with that view , so for you this is a fair question .
Allow me to put it into concrete terms .
Suppose I knew that I could use my powers of hypnotic persuasion , in the form of common words in this blog , to cause some portion of you to change your vote in the upcoming election .
And suppose I believed I was helping the country by doing so .
Would it be ethical to change people ’s opinions without adding any data to the process ?
Arizona ’s ambitious statewide speed camera program faces increasing resistance both from the public and from state and local officials .
At least half a dozen speed cameras have been temporarily taken out of service by ordinary citizens using nothing more Post - It Notes and silly string .
A video released yesterday documented a speed camera having its lens covered with silly string .
Vigilantes then labeled with signs variously reading , “ scamera , ” “ scamera : ka- ching ! ” and scamera : smile . ”
Over the past month other cameras have had their lenses covered with multiple yellow notes with the phrase “ honest mistake ” written on them .
This is a subtle dig at camera operator Redflex which had argued that the importation , marketing and use of certain radar equipment in violation of federal law was an honest oversight .
The Post - It Notes refer to a July incident where Redflex angered the office of Secretary of State Jan Brewer ( R ) which had been investigating a citizen ’s complaint against the company .
According to Brewer ’s office , a Redflex employee “ wrote a short response to the complaint on a post it note , ” making light of an official inquiry into the company ’s falsification of legal documents .
Angering Brewer may turn out to be a serious mistake for the Australian ticketing company .
Current Governor Janet Napolitano ( D ) was responsible for pushing the freeway speed camera program through the legislature to help deal with a mounting budget deficit .
Early next year , Napolitano is expected to resign and head the US Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration .
Brewer would then assume the role of governor for the remaining two years of Napolitano ’s term .
Napolitano ’s lobbying effort was the only thing stopping state Senate lawmakers from putting the question of photo radar before voters as a ballot initiative .
Lawmakers have also noticed that voters sent a strong message against the speed camera program by electing Paul Babeu as Pinal County Sheriff .
Babeau ’s campaign signs bore the message “ End Photo Radar . ” Arizona Republican Party Chairman Randy Pullen on Wednesday called for the removal of cameras .
As more motorists are hit by the photo tickets , the number of angry phone calls to local politicians has increased .
Much of the grassroots political opposition has been organized by the group camerafraud.com which holds regular protests to encourage fellow citizens to get involved and call not just lawmakers to express their opinion , but to call Redflex spokesman Shoba Vaitheeswaran , 33 , as well .

Static analysis tools allow to keep code quality up and warn of potential bugs .
Compilers in statically compiled languages often run static analysis checks and report potential problems as warnings .
Popular stand - alone tools are C's lint or Smalltalk Lint , many modern IDEs also perform static analysis on code , often incrementally as code is edited .
Static analysis tools for Ruby for a long time suffered from the lack of a standard way of accessing the Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) of Ruby source .
One solution was the ParseTree gem , which uses a native extension to access the parse tree of parsed Ruby code .
One problem of ParseTree include the dependency on native code to run .
ParseTree is also only available on Ruby 1.8 , but is unlikely to be supported on 1.9 ( Ruby 1.9 comes with Ripper , a library that allows to parse source files but not access the parse trees at runtime ) .
The ParseTree support across new Ruby implementations is inconsistent at the moment .
The introduction of ruby_parser , a Ruby parser written in Ruby promises to fix these problems .
The project was recently released in 2.0 version , which improved performance and , importantly , added line numbers as metadata to the ASTs .
The latter information is crucial for static analysis tools as they need to report the location of a discovered problem .
An important point , considering that all current Ruby IDEs written either in Java ( Eclipse based IDEs such as Aptana or 3rdRail , Netbeans ' Ruby support , JetBrains ' RubyMine ) or .NET ( Ruby In Steel , based on VS ) .
All of these IDEs also feature static analysis code of Ruby code , but none of it is written in Ruby .
Static analysis code based on a Java or .NET based Ruby parser and AST obviously does n't run on MRI or other Ruby implementations .
UnifiedRuby is a cleaned up version of ParseTree 's output , and in combination with ruby_parser , it 's now possible to parse Ruby source code and analyze in pure Ruby .
A growing list of static analysis tools has become available in the past few months .
Flay , written by Ryan Davis , checks codebases for duplicates .
By using an AST , instead of the source code , it 's possible to compare the code structurally .
Copy / pasted code can so be detected even if , say , literal values were modified .
Ryan has previously released another static analysis tool flog , which calculates a score for a codebase which depends on various patterns considered bad , eg. large numbers of dependencies .
Both flay and flog can be used from the command line to check code bases .
Flay uses ruby_parser to parse Ruby code .
Reek by Kevin Rutherford is a " a code smells detector for ruby " .
It comes with a list of checks which detect long method bodies , large classes , bad names , etc .
The checks are written as SexpProcessor subclasses , which works as a visitor over the AST .
Reek 's code is hosted at Github .
Roodi is similar to reek in that it allows to run a list of checks over a codebase .
Roodi comes with checks that ensure methods or modules comply with a naming convention , max parameter count , etc .
Other checks include advice such as avoiding for loops , etc .
The shipped checks can also be easily configured with a YAML file .
New checks can be easily written as well .
A checker class registers the types of AST nodes it 's interested in and can then handle the matched subtrees .
Rufus by John Mettraux allows to check Ruby for unwanted or unsafe code .
The Rufus library allows to check some Ruby source code before loading it .
Eg. loading a Ruby file that consists of a single line like exit is probably a bad idea .
The library can be configured with custom patterns of code to be excluded .
Do you plan to add one or more of these tools to your continuous integration setup ?
What checks would you like to see or write ?
Early Morning Frenzy Shoppers turned out for another Black Friday , but early anecdotes indicate they appear to be a choosier bunch this year , more likely to pick off targeted items than to fill up shopping carts while browsing . (
For those who like skateboarding , but prefer the rush of motorcycles , these motorized boards should do the trick .

Scarpar
Combining the best of motorcross and surfing is the Scarpar .
This motorized board sports an 80 cc engine that generates 6hp , which is plenty for a device this size .
Its rugged constructions lets riders go off - road with ease .
Currently , the Scarpar is still in prototype phase , but the official release is looming .
Wheelman
Wheelman is a skateboard meets motorcycle - inspired concept that travels along on spokeless wheels , powered by a 43 cc 2 - stroke engine .
With a top speed of 16 - 19 mph , riders can cruise upright and accelerate by squeezing a pneumatic ball held in their hand — steering is controlled with body and foot movements .
No Programmer Left Behind ?
1. Tests
I ’ve always been pretty good at taking tests ; I guess you could say I have a gift for “ quizmanship . ”
But on a 1 – 10 scale , I would probably rate myself a 6 or 7 on the geek - o- meter .
I ’m not up there with some of the kids I once went to school with , who , when the teacher lapsed into a personal recollection , would immediately stick up their hand and ask whether this would be on the mid-term .
The nice thing about taking tests is that you ’re dealing with a fixed environment in which there are hard and fast rules .
You know the subject area to be covered by the test , and you have a general feel for the types of questions that will be asked .
Reality is different : there are no rules , and you ’re just as likely to need some skill that you ’ve long ago forgotten as you are to be asked to take advantage of some recently acquired knowledge
Tests do n’t measure reality – they measure a miniature subset of reality projected into a multiple - choice , short - answer , true - or - false environment .
In our quest to be objective about the measurement of learning , we ’ve zeroed in on the closest approximation to objectivity that our teachers can find .
But it ’s a poor reflection of the reality that we all have to live with after we graduate .
2. Creativity
A couple of decades ago I taught a class to help people be more creative and to help teams work better together on creative solutions .
The class included some exercises , and two of those exercises are applicable to my topic today .
In one exercise we asked each person in the class to write down his or her best recollection of which letters are associated with each number on a phone keypad .
This was in the days when phones were for making calls – not sending text or email messages – and so the exercise was difficult for most people .
After each person had recorded his or her own remembrance , we broke the group down into small teams , and each team was given the goal of developing a single “ best answer . ”
Not surprisingly , when we compared the individual answers to the team answers , the teams generally were more likely to be correct than the average individual score .
The team discussion helped people fill in the gaps in their knowledge .
One person might remember one part of the keypad but be foggy on the rest , but the team was able to pull individual memories together into a perfect list of letters and numbers .
The second exercise was a little more complex .
The exercise described a scenario in which you are part of small team of survivors from a plane that crashes in the desert 100 miles from the nearest civilization .
The plane burns shortly after the crash , and you were all lucky to escape with just a few potentially useful items , including a compass , overcoats for each survivor , a cosmetic mirror , a gun , and a map of the area .
Your task in the exercise is to rank the items in order of their usefulness to your situation .
Again , we asked the participants to first individually rank the items , and then to get together into teams and agree on a team rank for the items .
The second exercise had a different result than the first exercise .
In the first exercise , the best team score equaled the best individual score – this was to be expected since the problem was easier and a perfect score was more likely .
But in the second exercise the team scores were generally better than the worst individual score but not as good as the best individual score .
In other words , the teams gave an adequate performance but never as good as the most outstanding individual on the team .
Why , you might ask , would this happen ?
In the second exercise the best ranking of items depended on survival skills that are somewhat unconventional .
For example , of the items I mentioned , the correct highest ranking item in terms of usefulness is the cosmetic mirror , and the second highest ranked item is the overcoat !
( for a similar exercise and some explanation , click here ) .
But these results seem so outrageous that it ’s difficult for an expert to convince the other members of the team , and so invariably the team achieves a compromise result that is n’t as good as the expert ranking .
3 . Putting these two observations together
In a recent issue of ComputerWorld , Judy Estrin , author of Closing the Innovation Gap , made a comment with which I strongly agree .
She said ,
“ It ’s much easier to stifle innovation than it is to allow it to grow , and a natural inclination in the country and in the business world is to put in rigid processes , policies and metrics — things like Six Sigma or No Child Left Behind .
Some of those things actually discourage the behaviors you need for innovation . ”
I ’ve written in the past about how bureaucracy cripples our ability to react to change .
Here ’s an excerpt from my October , 2004 newsletter :
When the word “ bureaucracy ” was first invented , it was supposed to be a good thing .
Corporations were trying to cope with growth in situations where it was no longer possible to do enough hands - on management to ensure that the company implemented processes consistently across the enterprise .
Bureaucracy was a standard set of processes and procedures which created that consistency even when implemented with different people , in different locations , and in different cultures .
But the strength of bureaucracy — consistency — is also its biggest weakness ; a bureaucratic environment can’t cope with changing conditions or with situations for which the rules were n’t designed .
Take another look at Estrin ’s comment .
Do you think of Six Sigma as bureaucracy ?
Many people do n’t , and yet it fits the definition perfectly : Six Sigma accomplishes its goal of consistent high quality by using standard processes that minimize the deviation in the way things are built .
The word bureaucracy has a negative connotation and the phrase Six Sigma generally has a positive connotation , but both have the same result : a rigid process .
What about No Child Left Behind ?
No Child Left Behind is a US government mandate to “ improve ” education by subjecting each child to a series of standardized tests .
But the result of the law has been a change in the US education system to motivate teachers to “ teach to the test ” – to emphasize quizmanship rather than actual learning .
In my opinion , Estrin is absolutely correct in her criticism of both Six Sigma and No Child Left Behind .
Both programs make overly simplistic assumptions about the real world .
Six Sigma assumes that the right thing to do is to fine - tune your existing process or product to the point where there ’s no deviation at all ( sometimes valid , but less so in a constantly changing world ) .
And No Child Left Behind assumes that a child who can do well on tests is best prepared for the real world .
Conclusion : The Cost of Oversimplification
How has the oversimplication philosophy of Six Sigma and No Child Left Behind affected your own IT processes ?
Are you measuring your software developers using crazy metrics like lines of code per week or – worse – by using “ standardized tests ” and certifications ?
Are you forcing your developers to use standardized processes that are long on documentation but short on creativity ?
Think about that desert plane crash survival exercise .
When you make heavy use of standardized processes and unrealistic measurement , you ’ll get a result that is better than the worst individual but not nearly as good as the best that any one individual could offer .
But what ’s even more upsetting is that when your truly creative people are faced with overly rigid processes , they will get impatient and leave .
You ’ll end up with a bunch of mediocre and sub -par developers who somehow manage to collectively turn in an average performance .
You ’ll end up with the IT equivalent of No Child Left Behind : everyone will be able to pass the test , but you ’ll kill creativity , and you ’ll have – at best – an average performing IT group .
No programmer will be “ left behind , ” but neither will you have the outstanding developers who differentiate your business from the competition .
Is that what you want ?
Is that what ’s important to the business ?
I do n’t think so .

BOSTON ( AP ) 
Choochy the poodle is a " runway runaway . "
Boston 's Logan International Airport officials say Choochy escaped from her kennel as she was being unloaded after a flight from Detroit on Saturday night and scampered across runways and taxiways .
Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella says the poodle evaded airport personnel for more than 17 hours and delayed at least eight flights .
About 15 state police , firefighters , operations personnel and even electricians chased Choochy late into the night , delaying flights for up 30 minutes .
Orlandella says the poodle was frightened , tired and hungry when she was finally lured to safety with food early Sunday afternoon .
The dog was treated for minor injuries at an animal hospital and returned to her family .

Advertisement David Cameron and Gordon Brown have clashed angrily over the inquiry into a baby who died after months of abuse .
The Commons Speaker was forced to step in to tell MPs to " stop shouting across the chamber " and remember the issue was " a little child who has gone " .
The row was prompted by the PM accusing the Tory leader of " making a party political issue " of it .
Mr Cameron called that " frankly cheap " .
Minister Ed Balls has ordered a review into Haringey 's childrens ' services .
Baby P , a 17 - month - old boy , died in August 2007 after months of abuse .
On Tuesday two men were found guilty of causing his death in Haringey , north London - the same borough in which eight - year - old Victoria Climbie was murdered in 2000 by her great aunt and the woman 's boyfriend .
Baby P's mother had already admitted causing his death .
' No resignations '
In the Commons earlier Mr Cameron had urged the government to intervene saying it was " completely unacceptable " that an internal review into Baby P's death had been undertaken by the council 's own children 's services director .
He said " nobody is taking responsibility , nobody has resigned " and added of the woman in charge of the review : " She can not possibly investigate the failure of her own department . "
The prime minister said people had been " horrified and angered " by the story of Baby P's death , but the government would decide what action to take having just received the full report from Haringey on Wednesday morning .
THE FULL STORY
Watch the entire Commons session and read BBC political correspondent Iain Watson 's verdict on " the most ill - tempered " PMQs clash he 's seen
The Full Story : PM's Questions Baby death sparks Haringey review
An independent review would be undertaken by Lord Laming , who chaired the inquiry into Victoria Climbie 's death , to see what progress had been made around the country , he said .
But the exchange became more heated after the prime minister told Mr Cameron : " I do regret making a party political issue of this . "
Mr Cameron said that was a " frankly cheap " response to " perfectly reasonable questions " and demanded he withdraw the comment .
He also said it was " shameful " that Labour MPs were trying to shout him down and urged Mr Brown to consider taking over Haringey social services " and put someone in charge who can run it properly " .
' Terrible news '
Mr Brown did not withdraw the comment , telling MPs : " There is common ground on both sides of the House and we should maximise our agreement on these issues about this very sad and tragic case . "
Speaker Michael Martin had to intervene several times , amid rowdy scenes in the Commons he warned MPs about shouting after " this terrible news " .
But later he had to tell them again : " It is not a good thing at this time when we heard this news about a little child who has gone before us that we should be shouting across the chamber . "
Baby P , had been on an at - risk register and had been seen about 60 times by social workers , doctors and welfare groups .
Baby P's clothes .
He died after months of abuse .
On Tuesday two men were found guilty of causing his death in Haringey , north London - the same borough in which eight - year - old Victoria Climbie was murdered in 2000 by her great aunt and the woman 's boyfriend .
Baby P's mother had already admitted causing her son's death .
An internal inquiry by Haringey 's Local Safeguarding Children Board blamed legal advice taken a week before the baby 's death for the decision not to take him into care .
The board 's chair , Sharon Shoesmith , is also head of child services at Haringey social services .
The government argued the review was carried out by " independent people " and Ms Shoesmith commissioned , but did not author it - which they say is in line with guidance from the Victoria Climbie inquiry .
The Lib Dem MP Lynne Featherstone , who was leader of the opposition in Haringey during the Victoria Climbie case , said the measures outlined by the prime minister were welcome but did not go far enough for Haringey .
She urged him to call an independent public inquiry .
Later Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , announced that Ofsted , the Healthcare Commission and the Chief Inspector of Constabulary would carry out an " urgent " review of services involved in child welfare in Haringey .
He said the review indicated there were " a number of failings of practice and management by the agencies involved " in Baby P's case and said he needed to ensure that " such a tragedy does n't happen again , that lessons are learned and that children in Haringey are safe " .
The Conservatives said the announcement of an independent review was a " vindication of what we have been saying all day - that Haringey Council should not be judge and jury in any inquiry into what led to the death of Baby P " .
Shadow children 's secretary Michael Gove said it was " crucial " lessons were learnt from the " tragedy " and said he hoped the review would " draw a line " under the political row .
The Lib Dems also welcomed the move .
Labour backbencher Jon Cruddas told BBC Two's Daily Politics the case of Baby P was " beyond politics " .
He said Labour backbenchers had been expecting questions on the economy and as a result " the response was not helpful , it did not shine a positive light on my own party - that is part of the culture within the House of Commons chamber " .

RAW police dash cam : Trapped inside a car traveling at more than 75 mph through a Denville neighborhood , officer Richard Byrne gave the driver one final order to stop .
The driver accelerated and Byrne , believing he was about to die , did what he felt he had to do :
He pulled out his gun and fired five shots into Ruben Martinez 's torso .
" I can't feel my legs , " Martinez shouted as his 2001 Ford Mustang GT Bullitt , at that point accelerating to 89 mph , veered off Franklin Road , went airborne , crashed through a concrete retaining wall and into an above - ground swimming pool .
Martinez died a short time later .
A special Morris County grand jury found Byrne 's use of deadly force against the 21 - year - old Martinez on June 26 was justified , and issued no criminal charges against the 14 - year veteran , Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said Thursday .
Byrne had the right to use deadly force to prevent severe injury or death to himself or others , and " I think that 's exactly what officer Byrne did , " Bianchi said .
During a news conference in Morristown , Bianchi outlined the findings of his office 's investigation and showed chilling video that preceded the shooting and was recorded by a camera inside Byrne 's patrol car and another in officer Daniel Fernandez 's vehicle .
Audio was also recorded from wireless microphones the officers were wearing .
The video starts with Martinez speeding off onto eastbound Route 46 at about 2:14 a.m. after Byrne tried to stop him for going 57 mph on Franklin Road , where the speed limit is 25 mph .
Martinez 's car can be seen whipping around short blocks , ending up back on Franklin Road , where it spins almost 180 degrees and stalls , partially on the sidewalk .
" Out of the car !
Out of the car !
Out of the car !
Get your hands up ! "
Byrne , his gun drawn , shouts as he approaches and opens the passenger side of the Mustang .
Bianchi noted Martinez 's finger was not on the trigger and that when Martinez ignored his commands and tried to speed away , Byrne re-holstered his gun and leaned into the car to grab the keys .
The video shows the Mustang lunging forward as Martinez revs the engine .
Byrne is seen kneeling on the passenger seat , struggling with Martinez .
Toxicology tests later showed Martinez 's blood - alcohol level was 0.16 percent , twice the legal limit and that he had marijuana in his system , the prosecutor said .
On the video , Fernandez , who was also involved in the chase , comes up on the driver 's side of the Mustang and bangs Martinez 's head against the door frame several times .
Martinez takes his hands off the steering wheel .
Bianchi said Byrne , believing Martinez was going to comply with orders , told Fernandez to let go of him .
But Martinez shifts the car into gear and it lunges forward .
Byrne struggles to take it out of gear and grabs the keys , but Martinez speeds away , the video shows .
The passenger door slams shut with Byrne inside .
" He 's leaving with Richie in the car ! " a frantic Fernandez can be heard telling headquarters .
Martinez drives faster and faster , ignoring Byrne 's orders to stop , Bianchi said .
According to Bianchi , Byrne thought , " I 'm going to die .
I 'm going to die tonight . "
In the two seconds it took Byrne to fire five shots - all of which hit Martinez - the speed of the vehicle increased from 75 mph to 89 mph , the prosecutor said .
Just beyond Fernwood Trail , the car veers off the road and crashes into the swimming pool .
On the video , Byrne can be seen emerging , breathing heavily and bending over with his hands on his thighs , sloshing through the spilled pool water .
" Did you shoot him ? "
Fernandez asks , Byrne said yes , eliciting an expletive from Fernandez .
One of the bullets pierced Martinez 's heart , Bianchi said .
Martinez 's family viewed the video two weeks after the shooting .
Their attorney , Scott Leonard , contends Byrne did not need to shoot Martinez , who was unarmed .
" There were other reasonable means available to officer Byrne to prevent the shooting , " Leonard said .
Byrne violated policies and procedures for a vehicle stop and pursuit , Leonard said , adding the Martinez 's family has filed a notice of intent to sue the Denville Police Department for excessive force , negligence and civil - rights violations .
Martinez 's mother , Maureen Miles of Rockaway Township , could not be reached for comment Thursday .
Martinez , a 2005 graduate of Morris Knolls High School , was working as a mechanic in Texas but had returned to New Jersey for his brother 's high school graduation .
Denville Police Chief Christopher Wagner said Byrne , 36 , was relieved to be exonerated , " but he will always feel this sadness for the rest of his life . " " Regrettably , lives have been changed forever , " Wagner said , noting the shooting has taken a toll on his officers as well as the Martinez family .
" I want to send my condolences to the Martinez family on behalf of the Denville Police Department , " Wagner said .
Byrne has not returned to work because of a shoulder injury he sustained in the incident that will require surgery , Wagner said .
Byrne did not want to speak to the press , but his attorney , Anthony Pope , said he was doing " okay . "
" No officer , when he goes out on patrol , is hoping for this type of situation , " Pope said .
" He encountered a situation in which he had to act .
He showed incredible restraint until the point in which he no longer had a choice and he used deadly force .
" Bianchi said he stuck to his word and his office conducted a thorough investigation , uninfluenced by sympathy or prejudice , to uncover the truth .
" I realize that in a case of this nature , there are no winners or persons who can claim victory .
The fact is that a tragic loss of life has occurred and for that there is no turning back or replays allowed , " he said .
Adrianne Pecotic , executive director of the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) , said the action followed a five - month investigation by the industry .
" We identified thousands of infringements of copyright by iiNet 's customers and we provided iiNet with about 18 separate notices of those infringements and , unfortunately , iiNet did not do anything to address that copyright infringement , " she said .
Pecotic said she would not rule out further action against other internet providers .
But she was not interested in targeting individual downloaders at this stage .
The companies are seeking a ruling that iiNet infringed copyright by failing to stop users from engaging in illegal file sharing over BitTorrent networks .
They want an order forcing iiNet to prevent its customers from engaging in copyright infringement over its network .
" I would expect , yes , we would go on to claim damages , " Pecotic said .
White said it was up to law enforcement and the courts to decide whether people were guilty of illegal downloading .
" If these people have done something wrong then the authorities can act on it but really it 's inappropriate for us to act on an allegation , " he said .
Chris Chard , managing director of Roadshow Entertainment , said that , as broadband speeds and internet penetration increased , more and more people were turning to piracy .
" Village employs over 5000 Australians .
We 're active in the cinema business , in film distribution , in DVD distribution and we invest in film production , and piracy has the potential to significantly erode all of those businesses , " he said .
The action follows months of wrangling between the movie and music industries and ISPs over the lengths to which internet providers need to go to prevent illegal file sharing on their networks .
The industry wants ISPs to agree to cut off services for those who repeatedly infringe copyright .
However , internet providers have argued that the courts already provide adequate remedies for copyright holders and they should not be forced to police their users .
" This is a very important test case for the internet industry in Australia , " said Peter Coroneos , chief executive of the Internet Industry Association .
" It will test the effect of the safe harbour provisions that were introduced with the US free trade agreement , which provides immunity for ISPs in certain circumstances such as transmission , hosting , caching and referencing activities . "
Coroneos said the IIA board will shortly convene to develop a response on the legal action against iiNet .
But while the movie industry has now stepped up its aggression , the music industry has yet to take legal action against any internet providers over the issue .
" The Australian music industry has consistently maintained that it would prefer to negotiate a code of conduct with ISPs on this issue , " said Sabiene Heindl , general manager of the recording industry 's anti-piracy arm , Music Industry Piracy Investigations ( MIPI ) .
Michael Speck , who between 2004 and 2006 ran the music industry 's landmark case against KaZaA as the head of MIPI , said he believed legal precedents already established and the emergence of filtering technologies meant iiNet would lose the case .
After leading the music industry to victory against KaZaA , Speck joined forces with one of the file sharing program 's key proponents , Kevin Bermeister , to invent filtering technology designed to stamp out illegal file sharing .
" Once it becomes apparent to everyone that the ISP 's most significant traffic is illicit or that particular customers are significant infringing hubs then there can be no doubt that the ISP has an obligation to act , " said Speck .
The case will be back before the court on December 17 .
Ever the agent of controversy , PETA is at it again .
The notorious animal rights activism group has requested that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont raise their health insurance rates for meat eaters ( and drop rates for vegetarians ) .
They base their request on studies showing that vegetarians have lower rates of many illnesses such as diabetes , cancer and heart disease .
PETA claims that this rate shift would save the insurance company money in the long term .
A representative for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont stated that basing rates upon dietary habits is not allowed by state law .
As a vegetarian myself , I ’d welcome a rate drop , but I know meat eaters and the meat industries would n’t let it happen without a fight .
Besides , vegetarianism , though healthier for many people , is certainly not for everyone .
I think PETA should spend less time on radical tactics that discriminate against certain groups and focus on encouraging people to reduce meat consumption and eat only meat which is ethically raised .
But what ’s your opinion ?

A spokesman for Bromsgrove District Council responded : " With regard to the barbed wire , when this is identified on site , we are obliged to request its removal or remove it on health and safety grounds to the general public , as this is a liability issue .
This is a requirement enforced by our health and safety department . "
Some of the worst violence has been in Udalguri district
At least 25 people have been killed in several days of violence in north - east India 's Assam state , officials say .
Police opened fire to disperse rioting groups and killed 14 people , a state government spokesman said .
The clashes broke out on Friday between Bodo tribespeople and Muslim settlers from Bangladesh in Udalguri district , and have spread to nearby areas .
The groups have been fighting with bows and arrows , machetes and guns and several villages have been set on fire .
Long - running tension
Police have imposed a curfew and have orders to shoot rioters on sight .
On Sunday four people were killed when police shot into a group setting houses on fire in Dhola village in Darrang district said Assam state government spokesman , Dinesh Deka .
Police also opened fire at several groups on Friday , killing another 10 people .
There have been long - running tensions in Assam state between indigenous peoples and settlers .
Thousands of people have fled their homes in the latest wave of violence , seeking shelter in camps set up by the police .
" The picture is hazy and compilation of casualty figures has become difficult because of the continuing arson , " said another state government spokesman , Himanta Biswa Sarma .
" We are mobilising all resources to control the situation . "
Over the last two months , members of indigenous communities such as the Bodos have been targeting immigrant Muslims of Bengali descent , describing them as " illegal infiltrators " from Bangladesh , says the BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta .
The Muslim leaders say most of their people came to Assam before Bangladesh came into existence in 1971 and obtained Indian citizenship legally , adds our correspondent .
RENO , Nev.  Gov. Sarah Palin , 44 , is in excellent health and has had no major medical problems , according to a two - page , seven - paragraph letter by her doctor released late Monday night .
The letter is the first information the Palin campaign has provided about her medical history .
The release of medical records is common practice for presidential and vice - presidential candidates , but earlier this month , Ms. Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , declined to provide any health information or be interviewed about her medical history .
She retreated from that position on Oct. 22 in an interview with Brian Williams of NBC News .
“ If that will allow some curiosity seekers , perhaps , to have one more thing that they can either check the box off , that they can find something to criticize , perhaps , or to rest them assured over , fine , ” Ms. Palin said .
Forty years ago , on November 22 , 1957 , following the launch of a P - 5 cruise missile from a submarine , the OKB - 52 Experimental Design Bureau , today the Machine - Building Research and Production Association ( MBR&PA ) , entered a new stage in its history .
For the first time the missile was fired directly from its container outfitted with short guides .
After liftoff , the missile 's wings automatically deployed in flight .
The new launch method made it possible to eliminate weapon system assembly operations , typical of the P - 10 domestically produced missile system and Regulus , its foreign counterpart operational at that time , on board the submarine .
By virtue of this engineering innovation , the number of missiles carried by submarines was considerably increased , their maintenance became much simpler and combat readiness of the entire " submarine - weapon " system became higher .
It is basically these features that allowed the missile to win a competition between various designs .
The system entered service with a group of submarines and became one of the first and powerful weapons capable of performing strategic missions in ocean theaters of operations .
Later , the engineering solutions incorporated in the missile system were recognized by domestic and foreign rocket builders as classical , without which one cannot even imagine further development and wide use of cruise missiles by armed forces worldwide .
On the basis of the advanced engineering solutions and other fundamentally new approaches incorporated in the P - 5 missile , the MBR&PA developed several generations of cruise missiles which actually made a revolution in Russia 's Navy and its armament .
All of them featured such unique qualities as supersonic speed and powerful " smart " warheads adequately protected both in flight and on board their platforms .
The missiles developed in Moscow suburb of Reutovo were equipping all domestic submarines - antiship missile system carriers - and most of surface fleet combatants , including nuclear - powered cruiser Pyotr Veliky and heavy aircraft - carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov , Russian Navy 's flagship .
Major advances in the development of previous - generation weapon systems , combined with the latest scientific and technological achievements made in Russia 's defense industry , have enabled the MBR&PA headed by Gerbert Yefremov , General Designer , to start developing the fourth - generation antiship missiles .
The Yakhont - type antiship missile is designed to combat naval surface - ship groupings and single ships under heavy fire and electronic counteraction .
The missile is noted for :
- over - the - horizon range ;
- true " fire - and - forget " performance ;
- flexible flight path ( " low " , " high - low " ) ;
- supersonic speed at all flight phases ;
- multi-platform capability permitting their use by surface ships of all major classes , submarines and ground - based launchers .
Capabilities of the Yakhont antiship missile 1 .
Preliminary targeting
2. Launch phase
3. Acceleration and ascent
4. High - altitude cruise phase
5. Diving phase
6 . Seeker head activation and acquisition of target
7. Descent and low - altitude flight
8. Seeker head repeated activation
and missile homing
The parameters and performance characteristics given in Table 1 have become technically feasible due to the application of an array of unique design solutions and technology - intensive components and , above all , a supersonic ramjet sustainer motor , capable of operating in a broad range of speeds and altitudes , a noise - adaptive radar homing head , and a powerful onboard computer .
In the development of the missile , designers made use of a system approach , where different components , producing different output parameters , were integrated into a complex , well - tuned system capable of accomplishing its dedicated purpose with maximum efficiency .
For the missile 's capabilities , refer to the Figure .
Due to the Yakhont 's short flying time ( its speed is 2.5 times greater than the speed of sound ) and the long effective range of its seeker head , the targeting of the missile need not be very accurate .
The ability to observe the entire target area from a high altitude , augmented by the enhanced capabilities of the antiship missile control system , make it possible to cue missiles to hostile ships in a group and discriminate false targets .
After launch , Yakhont 's early descent to a low altitude , combined with its supersonic speed and seaskimming flight mode in the homing phase , make it possible to avoid detection and tracking of the missile by even the target 's most sophisticated air defense systems .
The missiles 's compactness and maintainability on board its platform are not the least important factors determining its appearance .
First of all it can be explained by the missiles 's unique construction unrivaled in terms of the degree of integration of components .
Basically , the entire missile - from the nose air intake to the nozzle exit section - is a propulsion plant arranged in an airframe .
Except for the intake bullet , where the control system and warhead are arranged , all of the missile 's internal spaces , including the ramjet motor air duct , are filled with sustainer motor propellant and accommodate the built - in solid - propellant booster stage .
The missile is enclosed in a sealed launch - container .
The fact that there is almost no clearance between the missile 's fuselage and internal surfaces of the launch - container indicates that the degree of integration of components is very high .
The missile size provides for a two - or three - fold increase in the number of the missiles carried on board a platform .
The launch - container is an integral part of the missile system .
The missile is dispatched from the manufacturing plant , shipped , stored and delivered to the user in its launch - container ready for use at all times .
The missile 's systems check - out is made without removing the weapon from its launch - container .
The launch - container , with the missile in it , is very simple to operate and maintain .
It requires neither any liquid or gas for maintenance nor specific microclimate for storage and on board its carrier .
All this simplifies operation and maintenance procedures and enhances the weapon 's reliability .
As the missile 's basic features encompass the use of a launch - container , a wide range of launch angles and an advanced firing method which does not require flame deflectors , the missile can easily be blended into the architecture of various platforms .
It should be noted here that launchers of different designs can be used : very simple rack launchers intended for installation on low - tonnage vessels of the " guided - missile boat - corvette " class or vertical - launch modular systems designed for installation on large - displacement surface ships , i.e. frigates , destroyers and cruisers .
In addition to the well - known inclined and vertical installation methods applied to submarine - and ground - based antiship missiles , some innovative basing and launching methods have emerged for which Yakhont is quite suitable .
We can say with confidence that no one antiship missile system currently in service elsewhere in the world possesses such an array of unique technical and operational characteristics as Yakhont .
Taking into account current trends in the development of the navies in the world , this fact is of paramount importance .
Due to economic reasons , since the early 1990s , most countries have been giving preference in their naval development plans to the procurement and construction of limited - displacement ships .
As a consequence , the requirements for combat effectiveness of their weapons systems have become more exacting and the process of replacing old - generation antiship missiles with new ones , where the first - generation subsonic missiles will be replaced with supersonic systems featuring a longer firing range and higher effectiveness , is associated with this trend and , according to forecasts , is likely to commence at the beginning of the 21st century .
We can affirm that , owing to the unique characteristics of the Yakhont missile , even light warships armed with it will be able to perform missions that before could only be handled by large combatants .
Thus , we have good undertakings for the future and all reason to believe that the Yakhont antiship missile system will appear on the foreign market .
Operators can rely on this system as it will ensure high operational effectiveness of their warships and security of sea borders .

Back from the dead ?
Municipal WiFi died in mid-2007 due to overinflated expectations , impossible city requirements , and the sheer limits of WiFi 's capabilities .
Or did it ?
Meraki , a startup born out of a mesh - networking project at MIT , thinks that $ 10,000 and two months ' trial may change some cities ' minds as they grow a network organically in San Francisco .
While it may seem that municipal networking was a flame - out if you read the coverage or lived in a city with service during the last round of muni WiFi hype , from the ashes grow new plants — as with most technology that eventually takes hold .
New outdoor WiFi networks tend to be more modest in scope and more precise in purpose , while relying on later generations of hardware that cost less and work better .
Meraki has been holding on to the tail of this trend as municipal networking whipsawed about .
The firm , partly funded by Google , believes it 's riding a continued interest in deployments , all of them starting small and growing larger .
A survey of projects across the US seems to confirm this .
Big networks for public access are out .
Small networks , built cheaply , that grow organically in bits and pieces , are popping up all over .
In parallel , some large public - safety networks , some of which abjure WiFi altogether , have sprung up across hundreds of square miles with no fanfare whatsoever .
Peer backwards at the origins of muni WiFi
Muni WiFi became a term of art after the mayors of Philadelphia and San Francisco independently declared their plans in late 2004 to have city - wide networks that would be largely or entirely free to residents , to try to overcome the so - called digital divide that separates those with computers and Internet access from those that do n't .
These networks were of particular interest in cities with incumbent telecom and cable operators that had n't yet invested in bringing broadband to a large swath of the town , focusing on suburbs or other cities instead .
Both mayors had to backtrack : free was n't entirely practical given their budgets , and a quick backlash arose about taxpayer dollars being devoted to a purpose that might benefit those who could already afford to buy broadband .
Stir in anxiety over competitive behavior by government entities that also may act as regulators ( especially in the case of local cable franchise boards and cable Internet service ) , and you got a maelstrom .
( Much has also been written — a fair amount by this reporter — about contemporaneous reports that antiregulation , industry - supported think tanks issued on the topic of competition , taxpayer funds , and allegedly similar projects that had allegedly failed . )
EarthLink and other firms stepped into the breach starting in 2005 , offering to bear all risks and costs associated with building citywide networks , in return for charging fees or collecting advertising receipts .
Cities still wrote contracts , however , and required build - outs that often said a winning bidder had to provide a usable signal to 95 percent of first - floor front rooms , not just outdoor seamless coverage .
EarthLink 's Feather network was supposed to provide
WiFi in dozens of cities across America in 2007
After two years of build - outs , no large cities had completed networks , while complaints were plenty in most of the smaller towns in which service was rolled out in , part or whole .
So - called winning bidders might have won the booby prize , winning the right to spend $ 5 million to $ 50 million per network .
It turns out — as many had predicted — WiFi is n't a good way to get the Internet into a home from the outside , although it seems to work reasonably well at covering outdoor areas for outdoor users .
At the time , expensive WiFi bridges were needed to pull signals into a house or apartment .
These bridges from PepWave and Ruckus Wireless cost $ 150 to $ 200 at the time for the cheapest model .
They could pick up a signal from outside and rebroadcast it ( acting like a WiFi client and access point at the same time ) , or pass it along inside over Ethernet or a second radio .
A $ 20 - per-month WiFi subscription that requires a $ 200 adapter ( or a monthly lease fee ) suddenly seems more expensive .
A free , ad - supported account , likewise , is no longer precisely free .
Ruckus Wireless 's dual - radio
MetroFlex bridge
The early estimates of the amount of gear required to offer good signal coverage per contracts appears to have been far below what was needed .
In 2005 , many firms were talking about putting 20 to 25 high - powered nodes per square mile .
By 2007 , the number was 40 to 50 in most areas .
Muni networks were also being built just a bit too long before the explosion in handhelds with WiFi .
The iPhone was introduced in mid-2007 , just as networks collapsed left and right , for instance , and WiFi-equipped BlackBerrys only started to ship in large quantities by late in the year .
In cases where there was an overlap , such as the Nintendo DS , the WiFi devices did n't include browsers to allow authentication and payment !
Also at the same time , incumbent cable operators and telecoms accelerated their efforts to roll out service in more areas at faster speeds .
These new buildouts or facility upgrades were often coupled with marketing programs that offered six - month , one - year , or even " lifetime " ( two - year minimum contract ) discounted rates .
In Lompoc , Calif. , for instance , the city struggled through three years of effort to build a working WiFi network while previously hard - to - obtain cable and DSL service became cheap and ubiquitous .
( Lompoc overcame many difficulties and has a functioning and reportedly growing network that charges half the price it used to . )
EarthLink , MetroFi , and Kite Networks had the largest number of city contracts , and each exited the muni WiFi business between mid-2007 and mid-2008 .
EarthLink , which recently had its first quarter of recovery after dissolving its municipal WiFi division in 2007 , laid off more than half its total staff in 2007 , and spent nearly a year winding down its WiFi networks and writing off its losses .
It paid $ 5 million to Houston to exit a $ 50 million commitment there .
MetroFi shut down its nine - city network entirely in mid-2008 , after partially unwiring Portland , Ore. Kite Networks — which at one point operated the largest contiguous US WiFi network in Tempe and Chandler , Ariz . — more or less vanished in early 2008 after being sold by its parent company to another firm the previous year .
DHARAMSALA : The Dalai Lama opened his much anticipated meeting with the international media here on Sunday with a terse " I have nothing to say " , but went on to indicate that he was ready to pass on his political role to Tibetans in exile and choose his successor , probably a young girl , in his lifetime .
In his 90 - minute interaction with the media , the Nobel laureate made many remarks that are sure to irk China and cause some anxiety in New Delhi .
He said Tibet 's cause was linked up with the question of democracy in China and that India 's approach to the Tibetan issue was " too cautious " .
Though on the question about the relevance of his " middle path " and the " future of talks with China " , the Dalai Lama just said " wait " or " no comments " , the Tibetan leader spoke eloquently on the Tibetan crisis , widening its scope .
The 73 - year - old monk not only warned India about the Chinese military presence in Tibet , he also made common cause with China 's pro-democracy activists and talked about the rights of China 's other minorities , Uighurs and Mongolians , and slammed China for " serving a death sentence on the Tibetan nation " .
But the most dramatic and symbolic moment came when the monk invited Chin Jin , a pro-democracy Chinese activist who fled China before the Tiananmen demonstrations , and hugged him in front of cameras .
But it 's just not the images of Chin with Dalai that will irk Beijing , the Dalai Lama 's constant appeal to the people of China and support for democratic movements there will definitely anger China 's communist bosses .
" As my faith in the Chinese officials is getting thinner and thinner , my faith in the Chinese people remains strong , " the Dalai Lama said , squarely blaming China for the failure of the bilateral talks .
On the crucial issue of his retirement plans , the Dalai Lama scotched speculation that he was about to retire , saying he would not " quit till Tibetans returned home " .
But , on the issue of his successor , his answer clearly hinted that he was ready to pass on the political role to the leader of the government in exile .
" I am in the semi-retired state since 2001 , and the future of the Dalai Lama institution will be decided by the people .
If they do n't want it , it should cease to exist , " said the Tibetan leader , throwing light on the growing democratic aspirations taking roots among the Tibetan exiles .
Responding to a series of questions on his successor , the 14th Dalai Lama again sent a message to the Chinese by saying that he may select his successor before he passes away .
" I may even choose a young girl to be the next Dalai Lama in my life time , " the monk said , indicating that he wants to block all possibilities of the Chinese picking up the 15th Dalai Lama .
Talking about China , he linked the freedom of the minorities there with the advent of democracy in the country .
" The Tibetan and other issues can be solved only with democracy in China , " he opined , agreeing with a remark by a Chinese activist that " China can have one country and many political systems " .
Earlier , responding to a question on India 's role in the Tibetan issue , the Dalai Lama said New Delhi was " too cautious " in its approach , a remark he made during the March uprising in Tibet as well .
Though he thanked the Indian government for its support to Tibetans in exile , the monk made an indirect appeal to New Delhi to take initiative on the issue , saying that China and India cannot forge a friendship based on trust until " they solve the Tibetan problem because of which China maintains a huge army on the plateau " .
Summing up his thoughts on the issue , the leader said , " Hindi - Chini bhai - bhai is not possible without the resolution of the Tibetan issue . "
The leader 's comments on democracy in China and within the exile community are interesting in the wake of the conclave that ended on Saturday .
The joint statement at the end of the meeting of 600 Tibetan leaders from 15 countries shows that the exiles are seriously ready to consider independence as an option .

I ’m not sending Paul Krugman Champagne .
He won the Nobel prize in economics this week , and while I ’m sure that ’s delightful for him , it has raised the bar to an impossible height for his fellow columnists at The Times .
We used to strive for Pulitzers , or simply regional awards , or even just try to top each other on the paper ’s most e-mailed list .
Now we ’re supposed to compete for Nobels ?
It ’s a total disaster .
Any minute , Krugman might swagger into the office wearing that big old 24 - karat - gold - plated medal around his neck like a World Wrestling championship belt , talking about how beautiful Sweden is .
So I must aim higher .
Much higher .
A Nobel in economics is out .
I did n’t take economics in college because all the classes started at 8 a.m.
Physics , chemistry and medicine are out .
Literature ?
They ’ve given up giving it to Americans .
So it ’s going to have to be the Nobel Peace Prize .
I tried to think of a horrible war going on that needed my mediation skills .
And then it hit me :
The conservative donnybrook over Sarah Palin , the peppery debate raging about whether she is an embarrassment who should fade away or an impudent but promising wine picked before its time .
Hundreds of Palestinians marched through the streets of Jerusalem yesterday to protest against plans to build a museum on part of a centuries - old Muslim cemetery .
The Museum of Tolerance is intended to promote understanding in a city divided by ethnic and religious rivalries , but protesters say building it over gravesites does anything but .
Several Muslim groups opposed the project but the Israeli Supreme Court overturned theirappeal last week , saying that there had been a busy parking lot on the site since 1960 , and no objections had been filed .
The protesters , many wearing traditional black and white check keffiyeh headdresses , marched peacefully from East Jerusalem to the proposed site , just west of the walled Old City but voiced heated sentiments .
" To go and to kill the people another time after their death is criminal , " said Dr Ahmed Kanam , one of the protesters .

The court did give contractors 60 days to agree with the Israel Antiquities Authority on a way to either remove the deceased for reburial or install a barrier between the graves and a future building foundation to avoid disturbing the remains .
The cemetery is 300 to 400 years old , but fell out of use after the founding of Israel in 1948 .
Crumbling gravestones are still visible .
One of them is daubed with graffiti reading " Death to Arabs " .
The Muslim protesters are supported by ultra-Orthodox Jews active in preserving graves and often interfering with construction projects .
The museum is being built by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , a Los Angeles - based Jewish organisation .
The Weisenthal Centre says the purpose of the museum is to promote understanding in a city holy to Jews , Christians and Muslims alike .
It is to have a conference centre , theatre and museums for both adults and children .

With just two full days of campaigning left before the United States chooses a new president , the two candidates are undertaking a final push for votes .
Democrat Barack Obama still holds a lead in polls , but one survey suggests Republican John McCain is moving up .
Mr Obama will attend rallies in the key swing state of Ohio later on Sunday .
Mr McCain is focusing campaign efforts in neighbouring Pennsylvania , having appeared on the TV comedy show Saturday Night Live .
He played on his reputation as a maverick and the reality of being outspent on the campaign trail by Mr Obama .
" I 'm a true Republican maverick : a Republican without money , " Mr McCain joked , pretending to introduce a sale of campaign - related products on shopping channel QVC - chosen , he told viewers , because the McCain - Palin campaign could not afford nationwide network TV coverage like Mr Obama .
Campaigning in Virginia earlier , the Arizona senator told voters : " We can and will win " .
For his part , Mr Obama told voters in Nevada they had " three days to turn the page " .
Crucial states
Both campaigns have thousands of volunteers working flat - out manning phone banks , handing out brochures and knocking on doors .

Mr Obama , who also made appearances in Colorado and Missouri on Saturday , has warned against complacency and urged Democratic supporters to vote .
" Do n't believe for a second this election is over , " the Illinois senator told a 15,000 - strong crowd in Henderson , Nevada .
" But I know this , Nevada , the time for change has come .
We have a righteous wind at our back . "
The candidates have been focusing on states seen as crucial to their chances of winning Tuesday 's election .
Speaking to supporters in Newport News , Virginia , Mr McCain questioned Mr Obama 's readiness to lead in the face of such " grave threats " as al - Qaeda and the prospect of a nuclear - armed Iran .

He also attacked the Illinois senator 's tax plans .
" He 's running for redistributor - in - chief , I 'm running for commander - in - chief , " said Mr McCain .
After a lunchtime rally in Springfield , Virginia , Mr McCain headed to Perkasie , Pennsylvania , in the afternoon .
Analysts say the 72 - year - old Republican needs to win in Pennsylvania - where he is behind in state polls - to have a chance .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
First - time filings for unemployment benefits shot up to their highest level since July 1992 last week , rising 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 and punctuating the struggling state of the U.S. labor market , government data showed Thursday .
Meanwhile , the number of people receiving benefits rose to 4.01 million in the week ending Nov. 8 , the highest level in 26 years .
" This is a horribly weak report , " wrote John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics .
Recent trends in initial claims are consistent with a staggering loss of 400,000 nonfarm payrolls , they said .
The four - week average of claims -- which smoothes out events like weather or strikes -- also climbed in the latest week , rising by 15,750 to 506,500 , the government said .
That was the highest since January 1983 .
The insured unemployment rate increased to 3.0 % from 2.9 % .
The claims numbers are the latest gloomy indicator for the U.S. economy .
They come as Senate Democrats are seeking to extend unemployment insurance for workers whose benefits have expired .
The House has passed the legislation , and a Senate vote could come as early as Thursday .
The Senate bill would take 60 votes to pass .
President Bush has threatened to veto the bill , saying it 's fiscally irresponsible .
Federal Reserve policy makers are expecting the economy to contract for as long as a year .
There is a risk that the slowdown could persist even longer , according to edited minutes of a closed - door meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Oct. 28 - 29 .
See full story .
The FOMC now projects the unemployment rate will average between 6.3 % and 6.5 % at the end of this year and will average between 7.1 % and 7.5 % next year .
Three months earlier , the FOMC had expected unemployment to remain below 6 % throughout the period .
The jobless rate hit 6.5 % in October .
Patrick Jones had expected to launch his poetry collection in the store A poet has been forced to launch his new collection in the street after a bookstore cancelled the event because of a campaign by Christian activists .
Patrick Jones was due to sign copies at Waterstone 's in Cardiff but the shop cancelled the event at the last moment .
Christian Voice said the book was " obscene and blasphemous " and called on the chain to remove copies from stores .
The company said it was not a censor but felt it was " prudent " to cancel the event because of its duty to customers .
Darkness is Where the Stars Are is a collection of 30 to 40 poems from the Welsh publishers , Cinnamon Press .

Mr Jones , the brother of Nicky Wire of the Manic Street Preachers , had been expecting to launch the book at the Cardiff Hayes branch of Waterstone 's on Wednesday night .
But a few hours before , the poet from Blackwood in Caerphilly county , was contacted by the company to tell him the event had been cancelled " to avoid potential disruption to our store " .
Mr Jones said he was not going to be " beaten down " by religious activists , and signed copies for a small group of people in the street .
" I 'm really proud of this book and I 'm really sickened .
" There should n't be censorship of this sort - it does n't set out to be offensive . "
We 're supposed to have freedom of speech in this country
Cheryl Llewellyn , poetry fan
He said he had not singled out Christianity in his poems , but was questioning beliefs in society .
The national director of Christian Voice , Stephen Green , said the decision was a triumph " for the Lord , not for us " .
" The Lord had not even showed me what we should do at Waterstone 's , only that it should be Christlike .
" Just the knowledge that we were on our way has put the fear of God into the opposition . "
Mr Green also called for Waterstone 's to stop selling the book .
Will Garland , 28 , from Newport , one of the people who went to the out - of - store book signing , said he had been a fan of Mr Jones for a long time .
" I do n't know what they 're protesting about .
" Give the guy a chance , " he said .
Cheryl Llewellyn , of St Mellons in Cardiff , did not know the launch had been cancelled until she arrived at the store .
Although the launch was cancelled , the shop said it will still sell the book " If they want to protest they 're quite entitled to protest outside and let his reading go ahead inside . "
Siân Preece , a writer from Cardiff said Waterstone 's had failed to support freedom of expression .
" You hear of countries like Turkey or China oppressing writers and you feel sorry for them .
" And then you 're surprised to find it happening here , " she said .
A spokesman for Waterstone 's confirmed the event had been cancelled .
" The book remains available through Waterstone 's and we are very happy for that to be the case .
" However we have a duty to our customers and booksellers regarding events that we organise , and we felt it prudent in this case .
" We do n't act as a censor , we stock books in the tens of thousands and would only remove them from sale on the advice of the publisher . "

Woman 's rights advocate : McCain sides with ' sympathizers and enablers of domestic terrorism '
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This After John McCain 's campaign began smearing Barack Obama over his previous associations with a former 60s radical , a spokeswoman for the Republican candidate issued a bold declaration :
If McCain had consorted with abortion clinic bombers , it would be a legitimate story .
The Arizona Senator may not have directly consorted with any clinic bombers , but his legislative record was certainly favorable to them , and critics are hammering his association with sympathizers of domestic
terrorists who target abortion providers .
People For the American Way encouraged McCain to " look in the mirror " after a RAW STORY report revealed McCain 's connection with Marylin Shannon , a Republican official in Oregon who was a McCain delegate at this year 's GOP convention .
The two appeared together at a 1993 fundraiser for an ultra-conservative organization where Shannon praised a woman who was later convicted of attempted murder in the shooting of an abortion clinic doctor .
 When anti-choice extremists were terrorizing American women and their doctors , John McCain had multiple opportunities to make what should have been an easy choice ,  PFAW president Kathryn Kolbert said Tuesday .
 But he chose political expediency over law and order .
" He didnt say a word when Marylin Shannon sympathized with an attempted killer .
He voted against the clinic access bill even as everyday Americans were being assaulted and besieged by domestic terrorists , " continued Kolbert , a longtime womens rights advocate who successfully argued a crucial abortion rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 .
" As someone who faced repeated threats for work on behalf of reproductive rights , I am deeply disturbed by John McCains willingness to stand with and side with sympathizers and enablers of domestic terrorism . 
McCain and Shannon appeared together at a fundraiser for the Oregon Citizens Alliance in 1993 , a gathring of Christian right extremists that even fellow Republicans advised McCain not to attend because the group was so far outside the mainstream .
Speaking before McCain , Shannon offered some kind words for Shelley Shannon , who was accused and later convicted of shooting an abortion doctor : " I 'm not related to Shelly Shannon , but I think she 's a fine lady , " the vice chairwoman of the state Republican Party said .
McCain apparently said nothing to contradict that judgement , and less than three months later he voted against a bill that would make abortion clinic bombings a federal crime .
Author and journalist Frederick Clarkson has written extensively about the Army of God , the radical Christian organization that trained Shelley Shannon and others like her to bomb abortion clinics and attack abortion providers .
He provides some more details on Shannon .
She was eventually convicted of the attempted murder of a Wichita , Kan. , doctor and of committing a spree of abortion clinic arsons across the west .
Shelly Shannon also considered herself a soldier in the underground terror organization , Army of God , which views Shannon as a " hero of the faith " and a " Warrior Soldier in the Army of God . "
The group devotes a section of its web site to celebrating her exploits and her martyrdom .
...
The so called Army of God manual was passed around and added to over the years and desccribes how to wage a terror campaign against clinics .
The first copy to fall into the hands of federal law enforcement was dug up in Shelly Shannon 's back yard .
...
Thus it is worth considering the disingenuous euphemisms of Marilyn Shannon ( no relation to Shelly ) who was not only public apologist for a notorious domestic terrorist , but served as vice chair of the Oregon GOP and as a McCain delegate to the Republican National Convention this year .
After days of attacking Obama for his previous association with former Weather Underground member William Ayers , McCain 's campaign seems to be backing off .
Ayers 's name was not mentioned at all during Tuesday night 's debate , despite high expectations that McCain would keep up the attacks .
His campaign advisers seem to be recognizing that the attacks are ineffective , and the candidate is now pivoting back to talking about the economy .

The Recording Industry Association of America said Friday that it will cut back on lawsuits to combat illegal online music sharing because it has enlisted leading Internet service providers to discipline individuals it accuses of pirating copyrighted works .
The trade association said certain Internet carriers , which it did not name , have agreed in principle to impose escalating penalties on customers who ignore repeated warnings that they are breaking the law by distributing free songs .
The association is negotiating for sanctions that could include the suspension or permanent termination of Internet service .
Digital rights groups rejoiced over the recording association 's announcement that it will limit its long - running campaign of legal action against individuals such as college students , who often were pressured to pay thousands of dollars to settle the lawsuits .
But the consumer groups said Internet service providers should not be cast in the role of " copyright cops " who can cut off online access based only on industry accusations that are never put to the test in court .

" In the 21st century , the idea that we 're going to ban people from the Internet based on unproven allegations is troubling , " said Fred von Lohmann , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Such measures could hamstring a person 's participation in school , on the job and as a citizen , he said .
" Even if you 're guilty , is a ban from the Internet really an appropriate punishment ? "
Jonathan Lamy , a spokesman for the recording association , said a process will be developed for users who feel they 've been wrongly accused .
As to penalties such as suspended access , he said , Internet providers already forbid their customers to use the service for illegal purposes .
" We 're only asking them to enforce their own terms of service , " Lamy said .
Record companies and their representatives have been battling free song sharing since their 1999 lawsuit against Napster , a San Mateo company whose software made it possible to trade MP3 files between individual computers .
Napster shut down its service , but new online sites such as LimeWire and Gnutella eventually took its place .
The industry claims that an explosion of illicit online file sharing has undermined its profits by hurting CD sales .
In 2007 , U.S. album sales fell 9.5 percent from the previous year , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
The music trade association said New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is helping the industry develop an alternative to its mass courtroom campaign by promoting its talks with Internet providers .
Those companies have often found themselves in the middle of the music - sharing wars because they have been forced by subpoena to disclose the names of customers whose computers were used to swap songs online .
While the recording industry group said it will now file fewer lawsuits , it reserves the right to sue Internet users who ignore repeated warnings sent by their service providers .
The group has no plans to drop lawsuits already filed .
Record companies also will vigorously enforce copyright laws against Web - based sites that foster illegal music sharing , the association said .
But von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said online music swapping will simply flow into other channels , such as social networking sites .
He favors new systems that make it legal to download songs , such as the iTunes service .
One solution that the recording industry has shown some willingness to consider , he said , is a blanket licensing fee of a few dollars a month .
Music fans would then be free to get their songs anywhere they liked , and the license proceeds would be distributed to musicians or their record labels .
Let ’s face it .
Lipstick on a pig is a classic American phrase .
And there ’s just no better way to describe the McCain - Palin ticket .
The ‘ Reformer ’ whose whole campaign and senate office is run by a crew of high - rolling DC lobbyists ?
The earmark slayer whose state this year got ten times more earmarks than any other state in the country ?
Whose city when she was mayor got twenty times as many ?
The whole operation is just one big bamboozling lie .
And lipstick on a pig is just using good American English to explain it .
If McCain and Palin do n’t like it they should have thought of that before they decided to run as frauds .
Late Shameless Merchandizing Update :
This was n’t the idea .
But we ’re getting inundated with requests for lipstick pig t- shirts , bumper stickers , mugs , buttons , etc .
So we ’re looking into putting those together and we ’ll have a link for you to order soon .
And here we go …

Mr. Pawlenty said that after wearily returning from the campaign trail , he looked at himself in the mirror and complained about what he saw to his wife , Mary .
“ I said , ‘ Mary , look at me , ’ “ he said .
“ ‘ I mean , my hairline ’s receding , these crow ’s feet and wrinkles are multiplying on my face by the day , I ’ve been on the road eating junk food , I ’m getting flabby , these love handles are flopping over the side of my belt . ’
“ I said , ‘ Is there anything you can tell me that would give me some hope , some optimism , some encouragement ? ’ “ he said .
“ And she looked at me and she said , ‘ Well , there ’s nothing wrong with your eyesight . ’ “
As his fellow governors laughed , he came to the moral of the story : “ If we are going to successfully travel the road to improvement , as Republicans , we need to see clearly , and we need to speak to each other candidly about the state of our party . ”
The long , sometimes painful post - mortem of the election  where Republicans were widely repudiated , losing the White House and more seats in Congress  began in earnest here among Republican governors , a group that has traditionally served as a wellspring of new ideas and talent for the party .
It was , at times , a bit glum .
Frank Luntz , the communications strategist , gave the Republicans a slideshow describing how Republicans have just endured their worst back - to - back elections since 1930 and 1932 .
And Mr. Luntz said that the prospect of sharing his polling research with a group of Republicans gave him pause .
“ I understand how Dr. Kevorkian feels at an AARP convention , ” he said .
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , another rising star in the party who is considered potential presidential fodder , said that the party needed to recapture the high ground on the ethics and good government , and that it could draw lessons from the high - tech campaign that Barack Obama waged .
“ We should learn from that , ” Mr. Jindal said .
Mr. Pawlenty kicked off the conference with a somewhat gloomy appraisal of where things stand for the Republican Party .
This week , we talked about the new ratings summaries that will be available for games on the ESRB 's website .
We thought the system was sound , with much more detailed information about why the games were rated the way they were .
Others agree , as Hillary Clinton , Joe Lieberman , and PTA President Jan Harp Domene have offered their support for the new summaries .
Gamers should be careful about looking up their favorites games , however .
Here there be spoilers .
" Consumers using the content descriptors to make decisions about games they will play themselves should be wary , however .
The ESRB write - ups can also include details of plot twists and other spoilers , " GameSpot reported .
" One line from the Resistance 2 write - up omitted in the quote above reveals a significant plot detail from a climactic moment of the game .
Fallout 3 is another title with a key revelation included in the summary . "
I did n't look up the offending sections to see how bad the spoilers are , and I hope you 'll forgive me .
I 'm still playing both games , and what am I going to do ... print the spoilers ?
The fact that they 're out there at all is depressing , as no information pertaining to ratings should contain any kind of plot information that could even potentially hurt the game playing experience .
While I doubt many gamers will be using this service — it seems much more likely parents will constitute the majority of the readers — we can only hope the ESRB is a little more careful next time .
We contacted the ESRB for comment , but as of this writing we have not heard anything back .
Update : the ESRB has just responded , and had the following to say : " The primary goal of our new rating summaries is to give further aid to parents in making informed game choices for their children .
The summaries highlight content that factored into to the rating assignment , and the intent is always to have them do so without needlessly revealing spoilers . "

This week at the Microsoft PDC I showed gsharp , our GUI repl for the C# 3.0 language , a tool that I had previously talked about .
Before the PDC we copied an idea from Owen 's great reinteract shell where we provide our REPL with a mechanism to turn objects into Gtk .
Widgets which we then insert .
Out of the box we support System .
Drawing .
Bitmap images , we turn those into Gtk Widgets that then we render :
I also added a toy Plot command that can take a number of lambdas that return floats to do some cute plots .
The plots are just rendered into a System .
Drawing .
Bitmap so they get painted on the screen automatically :
But you can add your own handlers for any data types you want , all you have to do is call Register TransformHandler with a function that can return a Gtk .
Widget based on an input object , or null if it does not know how to render it .
The implementation to render images is very simple , this is the implementation :
using System ; public class MyRenderHelpers { public static object RenderBitmaps ( object o ) { System .
Drawing .
Bitmap bitmap = o as System .
Drawing .
Bitmap ; if ( bitmap == null ) return null ; return new BitmapWidget ( bitmap ) ; } }
You can put your own library of helper methods in a compiled assembly in ~/.config / gsharp , and then register all of your types from a file ending with the extension .cs in ~/.config / gsharp :
RegisterTransformHandler ( MyRenderHelpers.RenderBitmaps ) ;
And you are done .
The above could be used for example to create all kinds of information visualizers for the GUI REPL .
I would love to see a LINQ query navigator , similar to the one in LinqPad .

Well done that man !

[ darcs-users ] camp update
Hi all , I have n't written about camp in some time , and a lot has happened , so I figure I should send an e-mail .
So , here 's the first edition of the " Camp Irregular News " , if you will :-) =====
Mailing list Camp now has a mailing list .
I 'll probably continue to send things of more general interest to the darcs list , but camp - specific stuff will generally go to the camp list .
For details , please see http://projects.haskell.org/camp/contact =====
Bug tracker
But the main reason that camp has acquired a mailing list is that camp also now has a bug tracker : http://trac.haskell.org/camp/ and I wanted somewhere for the ticket change messages to go .
Fow now , this is really just a TODO list , with the major missing pieces listed .
===== Development
And some real work , too .
At and around the sprint , I : * Implemented " chunky " hunks , which mean that we do n't need to break a file up into lines and then join it back together again when applying hunk patches * Implemented primitive interactive patch selection .
It 's nothing fancy , but it makes it easier to work with than the all - or - nothing record that camp had before * General improvement , e.g. there is now a repository type , rather than just misusing FilePath * Worked out how to pkg- config , libcurl and Cabal to play nicely on Windows / MSYS / mingw * Made a darcs2 camp tool * Implemented the " get " command ===== darcs2 camp darcs2 camp is currently fiddly to build , as it needs to be linked against some of darcs 's sources .
In the near future it will either use libdarcs , or I 'll fork a copy of darcs and wibble it until it just builds darcs2 camp .
Due to working on each primitive patch separately , darcs2 camp is n't the fastest beast in the world ; on the 19766 megapatch ( 359470 primitive patches ) GHC repo it takes me 1 hour 47 mins to convert from darcs to camp format .
Then again , the original git conversion took 3 days , so it could be worse !
And it shows a patches - converted count to keep you entertained .
The disk usage for darcs 's patches directory is * disk usage : 115M * actual number of bytes : 49 M * actual number of bytes when uncompressed : 204M Meanwhile , camp 's patch file weighs in at 214M ( which is both the actual number of bytes and the disk usage , as it's all in one file ) .
There are a number of things going on here : * camp currently does n't store any meta - data , so it should be a little more than 214M .
* currently , if we store the primitive patch " name - 3 " inside the patch " name " then we store the string " name - 3 " even though we do n't have to .
*
We could easily compress individual patches .
Presumably if we did this with gzip then we'd get down to about 50 M .
* With a little work we could compress clumps of patches .
However , gzipping the whole file only gets us down to 46 M , so there is little to be gained there .
bzip2ing the whole file gets us down to 38 M .
===== " get " ing repos
And that means we can do timings etc for large repos easily .
Some timings for get and the ghc repo : * With darcs 1.0.9rc1 , get takes around 5.5 seconds .
However , I believe it 's copying the pristine directory rather than actually applying the patches , which is n't safe if you can't lock the repo .
However , " darcs check " takes 1 minute 45 seconds , and that does essentially the same work that " get " is supposed to * with darcs 2.1.0 , get takes 1 minute 29 seconds ( and looks like it 's behaving safely ) * with camp , get takes 1 minute 37 seconds I have n't looked at optimising get with camp yet , but one thing that should definitely make a big difference is batching up multiple changes to a single file .
It is common to get a megapatch which contains a sequence of n patches which change a hunk the same file .
When applying such a megapatch , camp currently reads and writes the whole file n times , which obviously is n't optimal !
IIRC that made a significant difference when we added it to darcs , and I expect it will for camp too .
camp is also cheating slightly , as it does n't do a syntactic - validity check of the patches it is given before applying them .
This means that it'll fail less prettily than it ought to .
However , I 'm not sure if darcs also cheats , and I do n't expect that it will make much difference to the time taken anyway .
Camp 's space usage while " get" ing is currently higher than it should be because of http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/2762
so I can't get good figures for that at the moment .
=====
What next ?
The above is mostly development stuff , mainly due to being at the sprint .
I plan to focus more on theory stuff next .
As you may have seen on the darcs list , I 've started thinking about conflict marking , and I also have some patch theory proofs in my head that I need to get written down in the paper .
Thanks Ian
The Two Classes of Airport Contraband
Airport security found a jar of pasta sauce in my luggage last month .
It was a 6 - ounce jar , above the limit ; the official confiscated it , because allowing it on the airplane with me would have been too dangerous .
And to demonstrate how dangerous he really thought that jar was , he blithely tossed it in a nearby bin of similar liquid bottles and sent me on my way .
There are two classes of contraband at airport security checkpoints : the class that will get you in trouble if you try to bring it on an airplane , and the class that will cheerily be taken away from you if you try to bring it on an airplane .
This difference is important : Making security screeners confiscate anything from that second class is a waste of time .
All it does is harm innocents ; it does n’t stop terrorists at all .
Let me explain .
If you ’re caught at airport security with a bomb or a gun , the screeners are n’t just going to take it away from you .
They ’re going to call the police , and you ’re going to be stuck for a few hours answering a lot of awkward questions .
You may be arrested , and you ’ll almost certainly miss your flight .
At best , you ’re going to have a very unpleasant day .
This is why articles about how screeners do n’t catch every — or even a majority — of guns and bombs that go through the checkpoints do n’t bother me .
The screeners do n’t have to be perfect ; they just have to be good enough .
No terrorist is going to base his plot on getting a gun through airport security if there ’s a decent chance of getting caught , because the consequences of getting caught are too great .
Contrast that with a terrorist plot that requires a 12 - ounce bottle of liquid .
There ’s no evidence that the London liquid bombers actually had a workable plot , but assume for the moment they did .
If some copycat terrorists try to bring their liquid bomb through airport security and the screeners catch them — like they caught me with my bottle of pasta sauce — the terrorists can simply try again .
They can try again and again .
They can keep trying until they succeed .
Because there are no consequences to trying and failing , the screeners have to be 100 percent effective .
Even if they slip up one in a hundred times , the plot can succeed .
The same is true for knitting needles , pocketknives , scissors , corkscrews , cigarette lighters and whatever else the airport screeners are confiscating this week .
If there ’s no consequence to getting caught with it , then confiscating it only hurts innocent people .
At best , it mildly annoys the terrorists .
To fix this , airport security has to make a choice .
If something is dangerous , treat it as dangerous and treat anyone who tries to bring it on as potentially dangerous .
If it ’s not dangerous , then stop trying to keep it off airplanes .
Trying to have it both ways just distracts the screeners from actually making us safer .

Political races are about candidates and issues .
But election results , in the end , are about numbers .
So now that the dust is settling on the 2008 presidential race , what do the numbers tell us ?
First , the predicted huge turnout surge did n't happen .
The final tally is likely to show that fewer than 128.5 million people voted .
That 's up marginally from 122 million in 2004 .
But 17 million more people voted in 2004 than in 2000 ( three times the change from 2004 to 2008 ) .

As Americans Struggle Congress Gives Themselves a Raise
Today marks day eight of no electricity since last week ’s ice storm .
I now have a generator powering my furnace , well , and some lights .
Today we got cable back and so I now have internet access .
Try to figure that out , I have cable but no power .
How the hell can the cable company get back on - line before the electric company ?
Anyway , now that we have the internet back , ( for how long ? )
I was able to check up on some news and I stumble upon this story .
The Democrat controlled congress is giving themselves a pay raise .
Is n’t that nice ?
Americans are struggling in this economy , people are losing their jobs , and congress has the balls to give themselves a raise .
A raise that these same struggling Americans are going to be forced to pay for .
As the article linked above states , these same congressional leaders are trying to cap how much executives can make and are also trying to talk auto executives into working for free .
They are now poised to receive a $ 4,700 pay raise .
I expect nothing less from these self - indulgent bastards but it still aggravates the hell out of me that while these people claim that they are here to help the little guy , and they proclaim that they will bring down the greedy capitalist business owners in the name of “ social justice ” and “ economic equality ” and they use class envy to divide the country and win elections , they conveniently forget that they are part of the class of people that they claim they will bring down .
This congress had a chance to stop the pay raise , Democrat Harry Mitchell proposed a bill to do just that .
The bill never made it out of committee for a vote .
I think we can see where their true loyalty lies .

News : Briefing
The invention of an ultrafast oscilloscope could yield advances in fields from telecoms to nuclear fusion .
The ultrafast optical oscilloscope can pick up detail within pulses of light only a trillionith of a second long Punchstock
The oscilloscope has had an upgrade since its heyday as an extra in 1960s sci- fi movies .
A version of this instrument — originally developed to show changes in voltage with time — can now measure the fine detail contained within extremely rapid light pulses , just 220 femtoseconds long .
That 's less than one trillionth of a second .
The ultrafast optical oscilloscope was constructed by Alexander Gaeta at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , and his colleagues .
It 's based on a clever piece of kit they developed previously , called a four - wave mixing chip , which acts as a time lens .
Just as a conventional diverging lens can make light waves spread out , a time lens can spread out waves over time .
In the device , the short , fast light signal being measured travels along a fibre - optic cable , together with an input laser signal , to the chip .
When they get there , the two signals are combined .
The time - lens chip spreads out the combined signal and turns it into a spectrum using a mathematical trick known as a Fourier transform .
This modified signal then passes along another length of fibre - optic cable to a spectrometer where it can be read out .
The ' scope can measure changes as short as 220 femtoseconds within a signal that 's more than 100 picoseconds long .
This is " at least a factor of five better " than previous machines , says Gaeta , and it allows a signal containing a lot of fine detail to be measured .
The work is published in Nature1 .
So what are the potential uses for an ultrafast optical oscilloscope ?
Watching worlds collide
Nuclear fusion can be triggered with a laser beam , and several big projects are under way to develop laser fusion as a future energy source .
One example is the recently launched HiPER ( High Power laser Energy Research facility ) project in Europe and its predecessor , PETAL ( PETawatt Aquitaine Laser ) near Bordeaux in France .
The laser fusion reaction happens very quickly and the new oscilloscope is the one instrument able to measure the light that is given off as the nuclei collide , says Gaeta .
These events only happen once in a while , and there 's just one chance to measure them .
One of the key benefits of the ' scope is that it can measure a single event , in what 's known as a ' single - shot ' technique .
Clearing the phone lines
If futuristic energy sources are n't your thing , how about better phone communication ?
Telecommunications work by sending packets of information - carrying light signals along fibre - optic cables , which are then decoded at the other end .
To push more data down the cable , and so get more people connected at the same time , these packets of light need to be squeezed so that the pulses that make the signals are shorter .
But when a problem occurs in the line , the pulses are so short , and coming so fast , that it 's impossible to find the glitch .
This comes back to single shots .
Modern oscilloscopes often work by taking an average of very short pulses to give the reading .
" They take an average of repeated signals .
We can see a single pulse and tell exactly what it looks like , " says co-author Michal Lipson , also from Cornell University .
In theory , this could be exploited to code the telecoms signal in the first place , suggests Brian Kolner from the University of California , Davis .
" Making coded sequences on a really short time frame is hard , " says Kolner , but if the ' scope is run backwards , it could squash longer signals into really short ones that whizz through a fibre - optic cable in droves .
Super - sizing your lab instrument
Gaeta also claims that his device could be used as a simple add - on to a normal laboratory machine .
This is because it 's made from standard electrical kit — a silicon chip forms the basis of the oscilloscope , and at the moment conventional optical fibre is used to transfer the signals , although the plan is to further develop the system so that the fibre is n't needed in future .
" We 're giving a system that 's extremely elegant and simple , " says Gaeta .
Watching biology and chemistry in action
Many atomic and molecular processes can occur in less than a picosecond .
" Biological and chemical reactions happen on time scales that are just out of reach , " says Kolner .
He sees the ' scope being used by researchers who want to peer into these biological reactions .
Gaeta agrees ; his instrument will be useful for researchers in chemistry who need to capture any short , exact , weak signals — for example , chemical fluorescence from a very fast chemical reaction , he says .
Extreme physics
The oscilloscope will also help scientists trying to recreate the extreme processes that happen inside stars , says Corey Bennett , from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories ( LLNL ) in California .
" The National Ignition Facility at LLNL is a facility where single - shot extreme physics experiments will soon be a regular occurrence , " Bennett says .
" The facility will generate the pressures , densities and temperatures , in a controlled laboratory environment , that normally only exist inside a star , at the centre of planets or in a nuclear burn . "
If an experiment cannot be repeated quickly , or can't be assumed to repeat identically , then traditional measurements are n't going to pick out the signal they 're looking for , Bennett adds , but he suggests that an ultrafast , single - shot optical oscilloscope could do exactly that .
( CNN ) -- David Beckham revealed that he has missed playing football " at the highest level " after being presented as an AC Milan player ahead of his three - month loan deal from the Los Angeles Galaxy .
David Beckham parades his new AC Milan kit after completing his three - month loan to the Italian club .
Beckham , 33 , has negotiated a move to the Serie A giants in a bid to remain match fit and stay in the thoughts of England manager Fabio Capello .
His move to LA Galaxy from Real Madrid last year was perceived at the time as a step backwards to a league that has still to establish itself on the world stage , and the former England captain admitted that a move to Milan represented a move back into the mainstream .
" Moving to America was a big step for me because there was a lot of people who were criticizing the move , but I still believe it was a move where I wanted to challenge myself and I was able to challenge myself in different ways , " Beckham told a packed press conference in Milan .
" But I have always said that I would always miss playing at the highest level .
I 'm not saying that in America they wo n't get to the highest level -- it will take time and it will happen .
But with five months off during the season I personally can't do that .
" I needed to be able to be playing top - flight football to keep myself fit , to keep myself in contention for other things that are going on . "
Football Fanzone Football fans , the chance to have YOUR say on CNN is here !
Join in the debates now »
Beckham , who began the press conference by addressing the assembled media with a few words in Italian , will be in the stands to watch his new team take on Udinese on Sunday .
He will then join them at a training camp in Dubai and could make his debut when the Serie A season resumes with a trip to Roma on January 11 .
The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder added : " I 'm really happy to be here , it is a great honor .
I hope to add to the team , I hope to give everything that I 've always given in my career .
" To be able to have the chance to play for another one of the biggest clubs in the world , I 've played for the biggest club in England , the biggest club in Spain and now I 'm going to be playing for the biggest club in Italy , is amazing .
" I 've been very lucky in my career to have done that , and I 'm just going to enjoy it because I think to be given this opportunity is incredible . " added Beckham .
Stateology is an implementation of the State Pattern using the Mixology C extension .
Stateology follows closely the LSL State Pattern implementation and can support a similar syntax .
The following features are supported :
Dynamic switching between states ( mixing and unmixing modules )
Optional state_entry ( ) and state_exit ( ) hooks for each state ( automatically called upon state entry and exit )
Support for nested states
States are cleanly inherited by subclasses
NO MAGIC !
Stateology does not use any behind - the - scenes method aliasing nor does it make use of any hooks .
Use as in the following :
class Sample include Stateology state ( : Happy ) { def state_entry puts " entering Happy state " end def do_something puts " Pets a puppy " end def state_exit puts " exiting Happy state " end } state ( : Angry ) { def state_entry puts " entering Angry state " end def do_something puts " Kicks a puppy " end def state_exit puts " exiting Angry state " end } end s = Sample .
new # switch to Happy state s.state : Happy # ( automatic call to state_entry ) => " entering Happy state " s.do_something #=> " Pets a puppy " # now switch to Angry state s.state : Angry # ( automatic call to state_exit ) => " exiting Happy state " # ( automatic call to state_entry ) => " entering Angry state " s.do_something #=> " Kicks a puppy " # now switch back to no state s.state nil # ( automatic call to state_exit ) => " exiting Angry state "

25 / January / 2010 - U.S Government Shows Support For BioRefinery
Coskata The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) has provided a $ 250 million loan guarantee to a planned US biofuel facility that will use the same rubbish - to - fuel technology as a plant proposed for Australia .
Coskata Inc. , the company responsible for the unique technology that can turn household rubbish into fuel - grade ethanol , has been supported by GM since 2008 .
GM's Director of Federal Environmental and Energy Regulatory Affairs Mary Beth Stanek said : “ One of the challenges in making cellulosic ethanol available to the public is a lack of financial backing .
" This loan will help to further commercialise this unique technology and environmentally friendly fuel .
It ’s great news for Coskata and an important first step for the construction of a full - scale facility , " Ms Stanek said .
Holden Energy and Environment Director Richard Marshall said the loan guarantee was also an important milestone in the establishment of an Australian second - generation ethanol plant .
It follows an announcement late last year of the formation of a new company , Flex Ethanol Australia , to take the project to the next stage of commercialisation .
" The USDA guarantee is the largest ever awarded for a biofuel plant , and will allow this project to move forward with financing the construction of a US facility that can produce 200 million litres of ethanol per year - the same output as is proposed for the Australian plant , " Mr Marshall said .
He said the ethanol produced by the Australian plant would be used in a range of ethanol - blend fuels , including E85 , which contains a mixture of up to 85 per cent ethanol and 15 per cent regular petrol .
The fuel is sold at Caltex service stations as Bio E - Flex and can be used to power vehicles flex - fuel vehicles in Holden ’s VE Series II Commodore range .
It can achieve CO2 reductions of up to 40 per cent , compared to petrol .

Ruling : Humanitarian aid to Palestine a front for Hamas support RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Court : Millions spent aiding children allowed Palestine gov't. to ' divert funds ' toward violence
DALLAS , Texas ( AFP ) 
The leaders of what was once the largest Muslim charity in the United States were found guilty Monday of acting as a front for Palestinian militants in the largest terrorism financing prosecution in American history .
It was a major victory in the White House 's legal " war on terror " and comes after a mistrial was declared last year in the case involving the now defunct Texas - based Holy Land Foundation , charged with funneling 12 million dollars to Hamas .
Family members could be heard sobbing in the Dallas courtroom as guilty verdicts were read on all 108 charges of providing material support to terrorists , money laundering and tax fraud .

Holy Land was one of several Muslim organizations the Bush administration closed in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks for allegedly raising money for overseas Islamic extremists .
Muslim charities that remain open have reported significant drops in contributions because of fears of prosecution even as juries rendered acquittals or convictions of lesser charges in two other high - profile terror financing cases in Florida and Chicago .
The US Justice Department vowed in October 2007 to retry the five former charity organizers in the Holy Land case after jurors could not agree on verdicts on nearly 200 charges and a new jury was seated in mid-September .
Over the past two months , the government has presented largely the same evidence , hoping to prove that Holy Land was created in the late 1980s to gather donations from deep - pocketed American Muslims to support the then - newly formed Hamas movement resisting the Israeli occupation .
Hamas -- a multi-faceted Islamist political , social and armed movement which now controls the Gaza Strip -- was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in 1995 and the trial centered over whether Holy Land continued to support the group after this point .
Prosecutors did not accuse the charity of directly financing or being involved in terrorist activity .
Instead , they said humanitarian aid was used to promote Hamas and allow it to divert existing funds to militant activities .
" The government showed in a streamlined case that where special assistance to the families of terrorists is concerned , cash is the moral equivalent of a car bomb , " Peter Margulies , a Roger Williams University law professor who studies terrorism financing cases .
" Going forward , however , the government must be more pro-active about furnishing guidance to Muslim - Americans who merely wish to fulfill their religious obligations . "
Defense attorneys said the charity was a non-political organization which operated legally to get much - needed aid to Palestinians living in squalor under the Israeli occupation , and argued that the chief reasons their clients were on trial are family ties .
Khaled Meshaal , Hamas ' political leader in Syria , is the brother of defendant Mufid Abdulqader , a top Holy Land fundraiser whose Palestinian band played at the charity 's events and now faces up to 55 years in jail .
Meshaal 's deputy , Mousa Abu Marzook , is a cousin of defendant Mohammad el - Mezain , a foundation co-founder , and is married to the cousin of defendant Ghassan Elashi , former Holy Land board chairman .
Mezain faces up to 15 years in prison while Elashi , who is already serving six and a half years for export law violations , faces up to life in prison .
The brother of defendant Shukri Abu Baker , Holy Land 's former chief executive officer , is Jamal Issa , former Hamas leader in Sudan and its current head in Yemen .
Baker , the former chief executive officer of Holy Land , faces up to life in prison .
A fifth defendant is Abdulrahman Odeh , Holy Land 's New Jersey representative , who faces up to 55 years in jail .

Anyone in the cyber field that has been involved in a network investigation to determine the source and scope of a compromise knows that the process is time intensive .
Traditionally , such investigations require logfiles from various sources : routers , firewalls , intrusion detection systems , and maybe packet captures from a sniffer if you have one .
Reconstructing the sessions require matching up the timestamps , whiteboarding the data flows , and storing the logs for evidence in case law enforcement is involved .
Only the truly skilled can determine exactly what was stolen from the network .
But along comes the former US Cyber Czar , Amit Yoran , with his company ’s flagship product - Netwitness Investigator .
This tool can reconstruct a network compromise on the fly , and it does so without the need to understand Hexidecimal code or have a protocol analyzer handy .
All sessions are reconstructed so the analyst can see exactly what the attackers did -
Web surfing sessions are rebuilt , emails and their attachments are reconstructed , VOIP is reassembled in an easy - to - listen player , and you can even map out the complete attack using Google Earth !
If you have ever watched 24 and scoffed at the abilities of the CTU cyber team to instantly analyze the sources of internet attacks or communications , scoff no more .
Netwitness ’ Investigator would make those tasks possible .
The software , developed as a project for the CIA , is already in use in many government and national law enforcement agencies .
And the tool is now completely free .
You can download it here .
Rich Steinnon of Network World and Threat Chaos said of Investigator here :
This is the first software I have ever installed that comes with links to a YouTube channel for easy to follow training on how to use the product .
There is a registration process but it goes quickly .
Amit assured me that this is not in any way a watered down version of their product .
The free version has all of the functionality of the commercial Investigator .
It does have limits set on the size of a session that can be recorded of 1 gig .
That should be more than enough for most investigations .
This tool represents a giant leap forward for cyber professionals .
It consolidates many tools that have been around for a decade into an easy - to - use package for network forensics .
And it should be an invaluable weapon in the fight against black hat hackers , ID thieves , and phishers too .

Hello Margaret .
I tried calling you last night but you did n’t answer .
I swear every time a squirrel goes looking for a nut up there in Maine you lose your phone service .
I just do n’t understand how your Howard can listen to that Rush Limbaugh each day .
I tuned into him yesterday and could n’t believe it .
I mean , I know he is a Republican mouthpiece , I just did n’t realize we were dealing with Hoof and Mouth Disease .
Ask Howard to follow the logic of his argument today if you can .
He said Republicans lost because they did n’t stick to their core values .
They tried to be nice and tell people that they are n’t racists , bigots and homophobes .
Once the Republicans got soft and started trying to be compassionate they began to lose .
That is the problem with Republicans right now according to Rush .
As proof he pontificated that conservative initiatives passed on the ballots .
So let me see if I understand .
If Republicans would just admit that they are racists , bigots and homophobes and stop trying to be nice , they would win more elections .
And the conservative movement which stands for less government was somehow validated because California , Florida , Arizona and Arkansas just forced government even farther into people ’s bedrooms ?
And yet all of the conservative pro-life measures ( the bread and butter issue for most of that group ) failed to pass .
So basically the conservative movement has been reduced to Anita Bryant ’s diary .
My , my but how they love their aging beauty queens … and we all know that beauty queens are the brightest bulbs on the chandelier .
Wow .
I guess all the drugs Limbaugh takes have finally eaten away most of the gray matter that was stored in that fat head of his .
Oh and then there was that other guy – ca n’t remember his name – who actually went on and on about how steep the hill was for McCain and it was amazing how well he did .
Steep hill ?
The other guy was a black man named Barack Hussein Obama .
But McCain had the steep hill .
I am at a loss on that one .
You know , they ca n’t win with grace and they can’t lose with grace .
Remind me again what we like about Howard ?
Oh that ’s right .
He cooks .
At least there ’s that .
And he tolerates me so I guess he ca n’t be all bad .
Harold must have heard me screaming bullshit and asshole at the radio because he surprised me with two tickets to see Dame Edna at our favorite theater in Austin for this Saturday .
He said I needed a little break and remembered that you and Howard loved Dame Edna when you saw her in New York a few years ago .
Is n’t that the show you told us about ?
I hope so .
I hope you will plan a visit soon .
We really do need to visit and laugh about all this blog stuff .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Russia welcomes a decision by the U.S. government to back away from granting fast - track NATO membership to ex-Soviet republics Georgia and Ukraine at the alliance ’s summit later this month , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday .
“ I am satisfied common sense prevailed , ” he told reporters during a visit to Havana .
“ Whatever the reasons , European pressure or whatever else , the main thing is that they ( Washington ) no longer push ahead with their previous ferociousness and senselessness . ”
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday pulled back from offering Georgia and Ukraine a formal roadmap to join NATO and said Britain had proposed finding other ways to bring them into the alliance .
Russia strongly opposes giving NATO membership to the two states although Washington led a push for the alliance to allow them in through a so - called Membership Action Plan , or MAP .
Moscow ’s opposition stiffened following its brief war with Georgia earlier this year .

Back when Doomeru brought home his first 360 I swore the second it became my hand - me - down I 'd play Saints Row end - to - end with our personalized BD Wong character ... Right after I finished playing Condemned ...
Oh hello there !
Perhaps you 'd like to join our multicultural drug- running judeo - christian street gang ?
But what started as a joke has led to my confession : Chewing through this GTA - knockoff was actually as satisfying as movie - buttered popcorn , and I left it behind like an explosive evacuation of last night 's comfort food washed down with liquid therapy ; feeling lighter , with a spring in my step .
Sure , the radio stations suck and the city is only marginally more interesting than a deserted South American island , but the controls are so smooth !
And in the unlikely event that you die mid-mission , or in the more likely event that the victory conditions of your mission do n't , you know , load , then you can continue from the beginning without having to drive back to it .
You do n't even have to kill yourself to cue the restart !
If I 've gone easy on this game it 's surely a testament to lowered expectations .
Not encountering the bugs documented so elegantly by others , I could only shrug at the conceit used to stretch out Saints Row 's hours :
You can only take plot - related missions after earning enough respect , which is gained by repeatedly performing menial tasks such as babysitting drug dealers , chauffeuring hookers , and aimless killing sprees .
Earned respect is then expended on accepting a real job , and upon it 's successful completion , said respect is lost .

The crowd gathered around the booth at the Chocolate Show at Pier 94 this morning was a bit incredulous : “ Chocolate - covered what ? ”
Debbie Perina of Bellerose , Queens , popped a sample of the “ pig candy ” into her mouth without looking closely .
Her eyes bulged .
“ Oh , yes ! ” she cried ( almost in ecstasy , we must observe ) .
And she insisted to her companion , “ Taste it ! ”
“ I love bacon , and I love chocolate , ” she gushed .
“ This is such a great combo .
I love it . ”
Yes , that ’s right : chocolate - covered bacon .
O.K. , it may never top peanut butter and chocolate as a gustatory combo , but it has its fans .
At some level , the study in contrasts worked : salty and sweet , crunchy and silky , flesh and not - flesh .
Well , maybe not that last one .
The creation was offered by Rhonda Kave , a chocolatier who started her shop , Roni -Sue , a year ago in Essex Street Market .
She started selling it two months ago as part of her salty - and - sweet line , inspired by the chocolate and bacon bits bar offered by Vosges .
That product , she said , did not have the right bacon - to - chocolate ratio for some people ’s tastes .
So they decided to dip the whole bacon strips — as other vendors have done elsewhere .
Ms. Kave , known for her inventive combinations , seems to be popping up everywhere .
We first bumped into her when she was selling chocolate - covered rose petals at a wedding trade show , and again at the pickle festival , where she was selling chocolate - covered pickles .
She said she was doing an event with her Lower East Side neighbor , Babeland , which , we informed her , made the news for its vibrator giveaways during the election .
“ Nice ! ” she said .
“ Rock the vote indeed . ”
Ms. Kave first started making candy for holiday gifts after taking a class 25 years ago .
In October 2007 , after eight years of working in a coalition to prevent domestic violence , she decided to open up a shop in her own name , part of a generation of eponymous shopkeepers .
But so far , the chocolate - covered bacon , which sells at $ 38 a pound , has been among her biggest hits .
One man comes in every week to buy half a pound for his daughter .
This year the Chocolate Show expanded beyond its modest digs in Chelsea to Pier 94 at 12th Avenue and 55th ( there are lots of cabs ) .
It runs from today through Sunday , with tickets at $ 28 apiece ( covering the food offered inside ) .
The cavernous space , filled with guilt - inducing treats , is at the opposite end of the chocolate supply chain from the cacao bean farmers in Latin America .
And New Yorkers , relieved after a drawn - out election and suffering economic heartburn , seemed content to indulge their anxieties with chocolate .
And indulge they did — in interesting flavors and shapes .
There was the ginger chocolate at Green and Black ’s , the peppercorn chocolate from Eclat and the chocolate figs from John and Kiras .
Then , there were chocolates shaped like sushi , stiletto shoes and fat happy buddhas .
But still , it was chocolate - covered bacon that was the talk of the festival .
Ms. Perina refused Ms. Kave ’s offer of a second helping of chocolate - covered bacon .
She ’d had enough .
But before she left , she told Ms. Kave , “ Thanks for taking the chance . ”
Gates to stay as Pentagon chief : reports Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has agreed to stay in his job when president - elect Barack Obama takes office in January , with an announcement expected next week , reports said late Tuesday .
Politico.com , ABC News and CNN said the highly regarded Gates would stay at the Pentagon at least for president Obama 's first year and execute the Democrat 's signature policy of withdrawal from Iraq .
" It is a done deal , " ABC cited a source close to the process as saying , and said the formal announcement would be made by Obama 's transition team after Thursday 's Thanksgiving holiday .
Aides to Obama told AFP they could not immediately confirm the reports .
Politico said Gates would be part of a raft of national security positions announced next week , including former NATO commander General James Jones as national security adviser .
Quoting unidentified officials , it said Susan Rice , a senior foreign policy adviser to Obama , would be nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations and retired Admiral Dennis Blair would become director of national intelligence .
Politico added that former deputy national security adviser James Steinberg would be named deputy to Hillary Clinton as secretary of state , with both diplomatic jobs also to be announced next week .
The selection of Gates , who has won bipartisan praise as a member of President George W. Bush 's cabinet , would allow Obama to make good on his pledge of staffing his own cabinet with at least one Republican .
" The appointment has substantial advantages for Obama , who now can keep his pledge of drawing down troops in Iraq with the aid of an architect of the Bush administration 's successful troop ' surge ' strategy , " Politico said .

Over the past couple of months , I 've been curating a list of social media marketing examples .
The list started with 100 examples ( including 35 + from Mashable ) and has since tripled in size with the participation of over a hundred contributors with examples from companies around the world .
We could probably come up with 3,000 examples instead of 300 - but the current set already gives us a pretty good sample to think about .
One takeaway : for now , those neurotic about missing " what 's next " can relax a bit .
Consumers still use a broader set of social tools than corporations , but new categories of tools are n't emerging rapidly today , giving brands a chance to catch up .
It 's time to master the last big thing while you have a chance to catch a breath .
As corporate adoption emerges , there 's nothing wrong with learning lessons from others and making them your own .
Start by making sure you have all of your bases covered with the major tools .
In other words , copy and paste the items below , then fill in the blanks with your own company - driven effort .
Here 's a framework of 22 tools to consider with notable brand examples :
And use this username check tool to see if your brands / preferred handles are still available .
I have n't found a single company doing all of these today .
Forget divining a big , meaningful business objective before getting started - you 'll end up in analysis paralysis .
Just make sure you 're making an existing business function better and get started .

ORLANDO , Florida ( CNN ) --
The meter reader who led authorities last week to remains believed to be those of Caylee Anthony called police four months ago , directing them three times to same site , authorities said Thursday .
Caylee Anthony , 2 , has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention .
At a news conference , Capt .
Angelo Nieves , an Orange County Sheriff 's Department commander , said investigators are looking into whether the tips , called in August 11 , 12 and 13 , were properly followed up .
In one of those phone calls , the meter reader reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road , Nieves said .
On August 13 , a deputy responded to the site and did a " cursory search " but found nothing , Nieves said .
Casey Anthony , 22 , faces charges including first - degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter , Caylee , who was 2 at the time .
Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half - mile from Casey Anthony 's parents ' home , in the area where the meter reader first directed police .
Nieves said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips .
He said the department was investigating the " thoroughness " of the deputy 's response but would not identify the deputy .
The meter reader " is not a suspect , " Nieves said .
" He is a credible witness . "
Nieves ' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's .
The meter reader is not the only one , or the first , to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains .
KioMarie Cruz , Casey Anthony 's childhood friend , also told police to investigate the same wooded area near Hidden Oaks Elementary School a month before the meter reader , according to CNN affiliate WFTV .
In an interview with detectives , according to WFTV , Cruz said that she and Anthony " pretty much used to hang out there most of our time , " would " snack on food for hours " and went there to " get away from our parents . "
The sheriff 's office followed up on that tip , but the wooded area was covered in floodwaters , preventing a search .
Nieves said the water may have been present at the time of the meter reader 's tips as well .
Nieves also said Thursday that searchers combing the site after the skull 's discovery had found " significant skeletal remains " consistent with those of a small child on the outer perimeter of the search area .
The area will be enlarged , and processing and searching of the site will continue , probably into the weekend , he said .
Some of the remains have been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico , Virginia , in an effort to identify them .
Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee 's , but an identification is pending .
Sheriff 's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee 's for three reasons :
No other children have been reported missing in the area ; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee 's age ; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents , where the 2 - year - old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared .
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday that he did not know when tests would be complete , but an attorney for Anthony 's parents said the FBI is likely to have results " within the next week . "
Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted .
Prosecutors said this month that they would not seek the death penalty .

The latest BS I ’m hearing is that the failed economy was originally created by Bill Clinton .
That ’s not what happened .
Clinton wanted to be sure that the middle - class and newbies entering the housing market would get a fair shake .
But at the tail - end of his term in office the Republican Congress managed to slip some veto - proof “ extras ” into a bill , and the result perverted Clinton ’s goals and helped spark the series of events that created the mess in which we now find ourselves .
I got tired of hearing this rhetoric blaming Clinton ’s administration .
I ’ve been asked by several people I know to explain what happened , so I decided to prepare a real response .
Read on …
Two long standing pieces of legislation were “ improved ” by various pieces of legislation .
There were revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) during the 1990 ’s ( even more in 2005 ) , The Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 which undid much of the Glass - Steagall Act , then the real pièce de résistance was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 .
When you look at all of this , you ca n’t help but see a common denominator .
In this case , the CD is Phil Gramm .
Check out this article to see how all of the above contributed to where we are today .
For a bit of irony here is what Gramm said on the day of the signing of the GLBA , aka , the Financial Services Modernization Act :
Sen . Phil Gramm , chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , made the following statement today in a ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , where President Clinton signed the Gramm - Leach - Bliley
Act into law : “ The world changes , and Congress and the laws have to change with it .
“ Abraham Lincoln used to like to use the analogy that old and outmoded laws need to be changed because it made about as much sense to continue to impose them on people as it did to ask a man to wear the same clothes he did when he was a child .
“ In the 1930s , at the trough of the Depression , when Glass - Steagall became law , it was believed that government was the answer .
It was believed that stability and growth came from government overriding the functioning of free markets .
“ We are here today to repeal Glass - Steagall because we have learned that government is not the answer .
We have learned that freedom and competition are the answers .
We have learned that we promote economic growth and we promote stability by having competition and freedom .
“ I am proud to be here because this is an important bill ; it is a deregulatory bill .
I believe that that is the wave of the future , and I am awfully proud to have been a part of making it a reality . ”
The Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 was the piece that blew all of this a part because it allowed for the type of commodity speculation ( gambling ) that brought everything crashing down .
As Congress and the White House were hurriedly hammering out a $ 384 - billion omnibus spending bill , Gramm slipped in the 262 - page measure .
Written with the help of financial industry lobbyists and co-sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar ( R - Ind ) , the chairman of the Agriculture Committee , the measure had been considered dead – even by Gramm .
Few lawmakers had either the opportunity or inclination to read the version of the bill Gramm inserted .
There was a vote and the bill passed right before Christmas .
How many time do we have to learn that we have to regulate to keep us all honest ?
The darkest parts of human nature make the temptation to financially benefit at whatever cost too irresistible .
All too often , this becomes a politicized discussion .
The Republicans like to blame Clinton for the CRA revisions ( “ let ’s blame the poor people for buying houses they ca n’t afford ” ) but conveniently forget to mention that Congress was in the control of their party ( January 1995 - January 2007 ) at the time and paved the way for all of this to come to pass .
Truth is , both parties can find accountability .
Now , we have to fix things .
November 27 , 2008 GM ’s HydroGen4 fuel - cell vehicles will hit the road in Berlin as part of the company 's extensive global zero-emission test program .
Having already completed over 400,000 miles of testing in the U.S. ( where its known as the Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell ) , the tests in Germany will be the first European outing for the hydrogen EV which is capable of 0 - 62 mph in around 12 seconds , has a top speed of 100 mph and a range of around 200 miles .
Nine Berlin companies are to participate in the real - world road test under the umbrella of the Clean Energy Partnership ( CEP ) , a German Federal Department for Transport , Building and Urban Development funded project focused on proving the day - to - day suitability of hydrogen as a fuel for road transport .
The test vehicles are equipped with a wireless data transfer system to upload vehicle performance data to a company server for analysis by GM engineers .
The HydroGen4 system consists of a 440 cell fuel stack with three 700 - bar high - pressure tanks made from carbon - fiber composite material which can hold 4.2 kg of hydrogen .
This delivers an impressive operating range of up to 200 miles - a factor which is put forward by proponents as one of the key advantages of hydrogen fuel - cells over battery - electric systems .
The fuel cell stack coverts oxygen from the air and the stored hydrogen into electric energy to power the vehicle 's 73 kW/100 hp synchronous electric motor whilst emitting only water vapor .
There 's also a 1.8 kWh buffer battery to store energy from the vehicle ’s regenerative braking system and cover peak electrical loads .
GM deploys more than 100 vehicles of this type in its Project Driveway testing programme in the U.S. , Japan , Korea , China , and Germany .
It was also announced earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) today will join the program by testing a Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell vehicle to transport top leadership and Congressional Relations Staff on official business .
For more on GM ’s HydroGen4 system see our previous report .
Even as Congress moves to bail out Wall Street , congressional Democrats called Thursday for billions more in taxpayer dollars to be spent on private shipyards , a new Department of Homeland Security headquarters and hybrid car batteries - all to get the economy going .
As part of their massive new spending plan , Senate Democrats also proposed continuing a ban on U.S. oil shale , a resource Republicans said leaves hundreds of millions of barrels of oil off limits , just a day after the House agreed to lift a ban on oil shale exploration .
Those are all part of a $ 56.2 billion economic stimulus package Democrats in the Senate have crafted and are considering attaching to a must - pass stopgap measure to keep the government running past Sept. 30 , when the fiscal year ends .
As of Thursday evening , they had not made a final decision .
“ We must not forget Main Street as we work to address the crisis on Wall Street , ” said Harry Reid ” href= ” / themes /?
Theme=Harry + Reid ” > Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat .
“ Democrats believe that we must urgently pass another economic recovery package that will create hundreds of thousands of good - paying American jobs and prevent cuts in critical services for millions of Americans . ”
Republicans , though , said by extending the oil shale moratorium , Democrats are leaving some good jobs on the table .
“ Senator Reid ’s move to reinstate the ban on oil shale energy production is an insult to the American people and yet another example of Democrats acting to make energy more expensive for working families and small businesses , ” said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .
The stimulus spending package is on top of a $ 630 billion stop - gap measure the House passed Wednesday and which is now pending in the Senate .
That bill must be passed before Oct. 1 to keep the government running into the next fiscal year .
But the stimulus package goes well beyond the basics to take care of many needs Democrats have been seeking to address , including :
cIncreasing food stamp benefits by 10 percent , paying for 18 million additional meals for a senior citizens program and designating $ 450 million for the Women , Infants and Children Benefits program .
cSpending $ 5.1 billion for the Low - Income Home Energy Assistance program .
cSetting aside $ 925 million for a new Coast Guard polar ice - cap icebreaker .
cPaying hundreds of millions for a Homeland Security headquarters that will consolidate many of the former agencies now scattered across Washington .
Democrats and DHS officials say the move will help the department do its job .
cDesignating $ 10.8 billion for a whole range of infrastructure , including bridges , mass transit , Amtrak and airports .
The proposal includes $ 44 million for grants to assist small shipyards , which Democrats said is needed to make the U.S. shipbuilding industry competitive .
The draft amendment would also head off a Bush administration effort to reduce set - asides for women - owned businesses .
The bill includes a ban preventing the new Bush rules from taking effect .
But the fight over oil shale could prove devastating to the amendment ’s prospects .
Earlier this week the House agreed to let lapse both the oil shale ban and a ban on some offshore oil drilling , opening the way for a dramatic expansion of oil exploration .
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt , Missouri Republican , said there are more than 800 million barrels of oil from shale in states such as Colorado and Utah .
“ The fact that Senator Reid would try to sneak a sweeping , previously discarded , anti-energy provision into an unrelated , temporary spending bill is just the latest indication of how out of touch congressional Democrats are with millions of struggling energy consumers , ” Mr. Blunt said .
Mr. Reid ’s office , though , said oil shale has proved not to be needed .
“ Although Senate Democrats support measures to increase this nation ’s energy supply , oil shale extraction has not been proven to be economically viable , will produce more greenhouse gases , and will significantly decrease the West ’s water supply , ” Reid spokesman Rodell Mollineau said .

来 年４月開幕予定の 「関西独立リーグ」のドラフト会議が１６日、大阪市内で行われ、神奈川・川崎北高２年の吉田えり投手（１６）が神戸９クルーズから７順目指名を受けた。入団する意向で、男子と同じチームでプレーする初の女性プロ野球選手が誕生することになった。漫画「野球狂の詩」で女性の水原勇気投手が、プロ野球を舞台に左下手投げから魔球「ドリームボール」で活躍したが、吉田も右下手投げからのナックルボールでプロの世界に挑む。
両ほおにえくぼをつくった少女の夢がかなった。神戸から７位で指名された吉田は「えと…頭真っ白です。自分から友達に『指名されちゃった』ってメール送りました」とニッコリ笑った。
大好きな兄（１９）のまねをして小学２年から男子と一緒に野球を始めた。中学では軟式野球部に所属し、男子にまじって正一塁手。川崎北高進学後は、クラブチームで硬球を握ってきた。投手に転向したのは中学３年の夏。父の勇さん（４５＝自営業）が「男子に勝つためには投手しかない」と勧め、米大リーグ・レッドソックスのウェークフィールド投手のナックルボールをビデオで見せた。吉田は「こりゃあそんな体力いらないんじゃないか」と、自宅地下にトスバッティング用に設けられた網に向かい、毎日６０球の投げ込みを行い、大きく揺れ落ちるナックルを独力で習得した。
今月４日の関西独立リーグの合同トライアウトの最終選考では、紅白戦で男子相手に１回無失点に抑え三振も奪った。指名した神戸の中田良弘監督（４９）は「下手からナックルとは頭使って生きる道見つけたなあ」と感心し、あくまでも実力重視での指名を強調した。今後は下半身を鍛え、体力強化に励ませつつ、短いイニングでの実戦登板もさせながら、将来は先発投手へと育てる方針だ。
入団にあたっては関西の高校への転校、住居、食事などの整備が必要になるが父勇さんは「安心できるようになれば送りだしてあげたい」と言う。高校１年から進学先に「プロ野球選手」と書いてきた女子高生が、日本初の女性プロ選手として野球の歴史を塗り替える。【村上久美子】
Yesterday , while flipping through an issue of Departures as I enjoyed a pumpkin cupcake , I ran across the magazine 's " Necessary Luxuries " column , in which various celebrated people confess what they could n't live without .
Most of them listed very high - minded stuff like family heirlooms , but it got me thinkin ' : in these straitened times of conspicuous asceticism , what are the non-essentials that are essential to our happiness ?
I mean , I 'm ready to cut out restaurant meals , movies , nice tissues , cheap tissues , cable , or pro haircuts , but do n't touch my expensive tampons .
Obviously , this is an oxymoron ; a " luxury " is nonessential .
But the concept does raise ideas about what special things make the difference between treating yourself and being sensible .
It 's a fine line , too : even someone who has n't denied himself much can probably find that he does without 90 % of those pleasures he considered " essential " before .
But it 's pretty well - documented that overdoing it — like crash dieting — can be a false economy .
As we all look at what we need , and do n't , it 's interesting to see what we decide makes us happy — and putting a price tag on it .
Anna , for her part , budgets for daily lattes and one nice dinner a month .
Megan will skimp on everything but highlighting her hair , pasta with a low glycemic index , and good wine .
Jessica hangs onto her car ( a luxury in New York ) .
Dodai 's glamorous luxuries are the three C's : cashmere , cocktails and cabs .
As to me , besides Pearl tampons , I 've found I 'm willing to cut out a lot to hold onto the expensive curly - haired non-shampoo that keeps my hair manageable , whole - milk yogurt , and name - brand meds .
One person 's luxury is not another's .
This can of course get touchy when your " essential luxuries " do n't mesh with those of someone with whom you share a budget — not , I guess , as much of an issue for the celebs in the magazine — but in general , one small up - side to any financial trouble is re-learning to appreciate .
When times were leaner growing up , I remember that my mom made a point of always getting fresh juice oranges .
My grandmother tells me that during the depression , she and her siblings would save to buy their mother some of her favorite candy , to keep up morale and a sense of normalcy .
Even thinking about " essential luxuries " is of course one of the greatest luxury of all — and maybe one of the essentials ?

This uniquely beautiful patchwork image , with its myriad of brightly coloured galaxies , shows the Chandra Deep Field South ( CDF - S ) , arguably the most observed and best studied region in the entire sky .
The CDF -S is one of the two regions selected as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey ( GOODS ) , an effort of the worldwide astronomical community that unites the deepest observations from ground - and space - based facilities at all wavelengths from X - ray to radio .
Its primary purpose is to provide astronomers with the most sensitive census of the distant Universe to assist in their study of the formation and evolution of galaxies .
The new image released by ESO combines data obtained with the VIMOS instrument in the U - and R - bands , as well as data obtained in the B - band with the Wide - Field Imager ( WFI ) attached to the 2.2 m MPG / ESO telescope at La Silla , in the framework of the GABODS survey .
The newly released U - band image – the result of 40 hours of staring at the same region of the sky and just made ready by the GOODS team – is the deepest image ever taken from the ground in this wavelength domain .
At these depths , the sky is almost completely covered by galaxies , each one , like our own galaxy , the Milky Way , home of hundreds of billions of stars .
Galaxies were detected that are a billion times fainter than the unaided eye can see and over a range of colours not directly observable by the eye .
This deep image has been essential to the discovery of a large number of new galaxies that are so far away that they are seen as they were when the Universe was only 2 billion years old .
In this sea of galaxies – or island universes as they are sometimes called – only a very few stars belonging to the Milky Way are seen .
One of them is so close that it moves very fast on the sky .
This " high proper motion star " is visible to the left of the second brightest star in the image .
It appears as a funny elongated rainbow because the star moved while the data were being taken in the different filters over several years .
Controversial " Diplomatic Assurances " Revealed For The First Time In Records Obtained By ACLU And Columbia Law School 's Human Rights Clinic
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union and Columbia Law School 's Human Rights Clinic released documents today revealing for the first time details of the U.S. government 's process for transferring individuals to countries where they face a significant risk of being tortured .
The documents , which were uncovered as the result of a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request by the two organizations , shed new light on the fundamentally flawed practice of " diplomatic assurances " or secret promises obtained from foreign governments that they will not torture the returned individuals .
" The United States ' practice of relying on deeply flawed diplomatic assurances makes a mockery of our obligations under the Convention Against Torture , " said Judy Rabinovitz , Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project .
" Now that President - elect Obama has pledged to end torture , it is a perfect time to put a stop to policies that permit the transfer of individuals facing torture in foreign countries .
Our government should stop trusting such inherently unreliable assurances and immediately disclose all remaining records relating to this practice . "
The documents released today include copies of actual diplomatic assurances – the first ever to be made public .
The U.S. government has repeatedly insisted that the assurances must remain secret .
Also included among the documents are memos between high - level State Department officials and Indian diplomats pertaining to the extradition of Kulbir Singh Barapind , a Sikh separatist who was alleged to have committed crimes prior to his arrival in the U.S. in 1993 .
These memos shed light on the inherent unreliability of such unenforceable promises .
For example , one memo written by Deputy Secretary of State John Bellinger states , " There is no doubt that torture generally remains a problem for Indian law enforcement . "
Yet the U.S. government extradited Barapind in 2006 based on diplomatic assurances from the Indian government that he would not be tortured upon his return .
According to another memo , the U.S. government conceded that it is " keenly aware of the culture of torture and extrajudicial punishment in Indian jails " and admitted that it was " unable authoritatively to confirm " whether another extradited couple was tortured .
In fact , the couple signed affidavits claiming they were indeed tortured .
The State Department also turned over documents relating to the extradition of Mexican national Ramiro Cornejo - Barreto and Romanian national Petru Mironescu .
" These documents provide the first meaningful glimpse into the diplomatic assurances process – and what they reveal is not a pretty picture , " said Peter Rosenblum , Director of Columbia 's Human Rights Clinic .
" The American public deserves to know the full truth about this troubling practice .
Unfortunately , since so much information is still being withheld , a complete accounting of the diplomatic assurances process remains elusive . "
The Convention Against Torture , ratified by the U.S. in 1994 , prohibits the U.S. from transferring a person " to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture . "
That prohibition has also been implemented in domestic law .
But the U.S. has sought to avoid its treaty obligations by transferring individuals to countries – including those known to employ torture – that provide assurances that they will not torture such individuals .
The United States has obtained such assurances from other countries known to employ torture , including Syria and Egypt .
While the full extent of reliance on assurances is unknown , the U.S. has acknowledged that it relies on these promises for all transfers from Guantánamo .
Earlier this year , in the first decision of its kind , a federal court sided with the ACLU and ordered the government to stop the deportation of Sameh Khouzam based on secret and unreliable promises from the Egyptian government that he would not be tortured upon extradition .
The judge in the case noted that deporting Khouzam based on diplomatic assurances without court review would render the procedures established for seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture " a farce . "
He added , " Not even the President of the United States has the authority to sacrifice … the right to be free from torture . "
The FOIA request that produced today 's documents seeks records related to the transfer of individuals in a number of different contexts , including immigration removal , extradition , transfer from Guantánamo Bay , and all other transfers from United States custody .
The request was filed with the CIA and the Departments of State , Defense , Justice and Homeland Security .

Federal regulators have subpoenaed recent trading records from several Nymex traders as part of a widening investigation into the sharp rise in oil prices on Monday .
The subpoenas are part of an examination announced by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday , soon after the price for an expiring futures contract on the Nymex surged in the last hour of trading , according to people briefed on the continuing investigation .
In that announcement , Walter Lukken , the agency ’s acting chairman , said investigators were closely monitoring the price move , which came as the financial markets were struggling to recover from the upheaval of the previous week .
Later on Monday , Mr. Lukken was briefed on the episode by Craig Donohue , the chief executive of the CME Group , which owns the Nymex , according to people who were involved in those arrangements .
Biden , Cheney meet at Vice President 's manor RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Vice President Dick Cheney welcomed his successor , vice president - elect Joseph Biden , to his official residence Thursday , shrugging off his visitor 's stinging campaign trail attacks .
Biden arrived at the vice president 's official Naval Observatory residence in northwest Washington with his wife Jill , and posed for photographs with Cheney and his wife Lynne .
During the 50 - minute visit , the couples held a private meeting and the Cheneys gave their guests a tour of the ornate residence , said the vice president 's spokeswoman , Megan Mitchell .
" It was a good visit .
The Cheneys enjoyed giving the Bidens a tour of the residence and wished them well as they make it their home in January , " she said in a statement .
The Bidens in turn thanked their hosts " for welcoming them into their home and for their gracious hospitality , " said Elizabeth Alexander , a spokeswoman for the vice president - elect .
Biden was a fierce critic of Cheney , possibly the most powerful vice president ever , during the presidential campaign which ended with Democrat Barack Obama 's historic victory last week .
In the vice presidential debate against Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin last month , Biden branded Cheney " the most dangerous vice president we 've had . "
During his speech at the Democratic National Convention in August , Biden took another withering swipe at Cheney .
" For every American who is trying to do the right thing , for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution , no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be : ' The vice president 's office is on the phone ' , " he said .
The Biden - Cheney meeting follows Obama 's private one - on - one talks with President George W. Bush at the White House on Monday .

Django Aggregator v2 now has tagging , and you should too . ¶
I have been doing some more work on my Django Community Aggregator / Django People v2 project .
A big feature that I want to incorporate is tagging .
I want people to be able to sort data by tag , among other things .
I think that this is a pretty killer feature .
This allows someone to say “ I want to get all of the data about testing or debugging that the Django community is doing ” .
However , if nobody is tagging their posts , then only services that provide tags will be available in those views .
A lot of people are using django - tagging on the backend of their blogs , but they just are n’t exposing that data in feeds .
Note :
Yes I know the data ca n’t be edited yet ( on the aggregator ) .
That is because it is a project that is just living on my site for the moment .
Once it gets moved off and the Uber community of Django gets more off the ground , all of those issues will be solved .
Luckily , it is really easy to expose your tagging data in your Django feeds .
This assumes you are using Django Tagging , however , it ’s really easy with anything else .
Say we have our feed class that looks like this .
class BlogPostsFeed ( Feed ) : title =
' My awesome blog ' description = ' My awesome blog " def link ( self ) : return " http://mysite.com " def items ( self ) : return Post .
objects .
published ( ) [ : 10 ] def item_pubdate ( self , obj ) : return obj .
publish
That is a pretty basic feed , but much akin to what most people have .
Now lets add some tagging in there !
Assuming that you have the Tag model imported from tagging , you can simply do this :
def item_categories ( self , obj ) : return [ tag .
name for tag in Tag .
objects .
get_for_object ( obj ) ]
You can test to make sure that your feeds are working by using feedparser
In [ 1 ] : import feedparser
In [ 3 ] : p = feedparser .
parse ( ' http://ericholscher.com/feeds/posts/' )
In [ 4 ] : p . entries [ 0 ] . tags Out [ 4 ] : [ { ' label ' : None , ' scheme ' : None , ' term ' : u ' lawrence ' } , { ' label ' : None , ' scheme ' : None , ' term ' : u ' mediaphormedia ' } , { ' label ' : None , ' scheme ' : None , ' term ' : u ' philosophy ' } , { ' label ' : None , ' scheme ' : None , ' term ' : u ' post - a- day ' } , { ' label ' : None , ' scheme ' : None , ' term ' : u ' ramblings ' } ]
That ’s it !
Now everyone go do that to their feeds , so that I can harvest your tags and make them useful :)
Digi International has introduced a Linux - based server packaged within a somewhat elongated RJ45 connector .
The ME 9210 comes with an embedded OS based on a Linux 2.6.26 kernel .
Digi claims the ME 9210 to be “ the smallest embedded device server available with Linux . ”
Although the company is targeting the module primarily at data acquisition and control applications — such as PLCs ( programmable logic controllers ) , PDUs ( power distribution units ) , and environmental control equipment — it ’s completely general - purpose in function , and should prove popular in numerous other embedded devices .
Digi ’s tiny Linux server fits within an elongated RJ45 connector
The ME 9210 is based on Digi ’s recently - introduced NS9210 system - on - chip , based on a 32 - bit ARM926EJ - S core ( with MMU ) and clocked at 75 MHz .
The module also integrates 8 MB of RAM and up to 4MB of flash memory .
Built - in interfaces include 10/100 Ethernet , a high - speed serial port , SPI and I2C serial interfaces , 10 GPIO lines , and a CAN fieldbus .
The ME 9210 module also provides advanced power management capabilities , and its support for power - over - Ethernet ( PoE ) enables it to be powered directly through its RJ45 Ethernet connector .
It requires 3.3V DC at around 1.1W active and 0.6W standby , and it ’s rated for - 40 to +85 degrees C operation .
The ME 9210 is expected to begin shipping in December , priced at $ 48 in quantity ( 1,000 ) .
This includes the embedded Linux OS .
A $ 399 quick start kit will also be available in December ; it includes the ME 9210 module , a development board , documentation , a DVD containing the Linux OS and Eclipse - based tools , and a power supply .
Further details are on the company ’s website .

Beneath the South Pole of Saturn
Credit : Cassini VIMS
Team , JPL , ESA , NASA
Explanation : What clouds lurk beneath Saturn 's unusual South Pole ?
To help find out , the robotic Cassini spacecraft currently orbiting Saturn imaged the nether region of the gigantic ringed orb in infrared light .
There thick clouds appear dark as they mask much of the infrared light emitted from warmer regions below , while relatively thin clouds appear much lighter .
Bands of clouds circle Saturn at several latitudes , while dark ovals indicate many dark swirling storm systems .
Surprisingly , a haze of upper level clouds visible towards Saturn 's equator disappears near the pole , including over Saturn 's strange polar vortex .
Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in 2004 , and recorded the above image last year .
" Ferraris , we can make .
Designer clothes , we can produce .
Sun , pizza and love , we can provide a lot of , " said minister of public functions Renato Brunetta .
" It 's the public administration that is below par . "
Mr Brunetta has become a folk hero in Italy for his vow to modernise government offices and expel idlers among the 3.6 million public workers .
Low productivity , he acknowledges , is not exclusively a problem of the public sector , and the minister is counting on his efforts to nudge private companies into action , too .
" The public has woken up , " he said , " it has had an epiphany . "
But numbers point to some persistent dozing among Italy 's workforce .
Productivity in Italy lags far behind other industrialised nations , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Figures show labour productivity in Italy grew less than 0.5 % between 2001 - 06 , while in the United States , for example , the rate was over 2 % in the same period , and in fellow EU country France it was about 1.5 % .
Italians take about six weeks holiday a year , compared to a little over three weeks for workers in the United States and two for those in Japan .
Mr Brunetta insisted that laziness was a mere bad habit , not a fixed national trait .
He said : " I do n't believe Italians are anthropologically slackers .
Italy is a country of small - and mid-sized companies , of self - employment .
It is the country of people who take bold risks every day . "
Give Mice A Break And Use More People In Clinical Studies - Stanford Researcher
65 million years of evolution divergence and being rodents is too much difference , says Stanford immunologist Mark Davis , PhD , so we need to do more research on humans and less on mice .
Apparently , the fabled laboratory mouse — from which we have learned so much about how the immune system works — can teach us only so much about how we humans get sick .
Davis , director of the Stanford Institute for Immunity , Transplantation and Infection , proposes that the current mouse - centered , small - laboratory approach be supplemented by a broad , industrial - scale " systems biology " approach akin to the one that unraveled the human genome .
" We seem to be in a state of denial , where there is so much invested in the mouse model that it seems almost unthinkable to look elsewhere , " Davis , the Burton and Marion Avery Family Professor and professor of microbiology and immunology , writes in the essay .
Over the past several decades , the little mouse has proven immensely helpful in generating a fundamental understanding of how the mammalian immune system works , Davis said in an interview .
" The mouse has been incredibly valuable , " he added .
" That 's part of the problem . "
Experimental manipulations that are commonplace with lab mice , such as genetically engineering them to express a foreign protein or to be deficient in the expression of one of their own , would be unthinkable in a human .
Because experimental mice can be used to get quick answers , Davis argues , researchers look to the mouse to tell them everything .
" In humans it often takes years to find out anything .
There are a lot more regulatory , financial and ethical hurdles , " he said .
But when it comes to adapting therapeutic interventions that seem to cure all kinds of infectious disease , cancers and autoimmune conditions in mice for use in human beings , the record is not so good .
The vast majority of clinical trials designed to test these interventions in people end in failure .
" Mice are lousy models for clinical studies , " Davis asserts in his essay to be published Dec. 19 in Immunity .
While it takes about 20 years for a person to reach sexual maturity , a mouse gets there in three months .
The roughly 100 years during which the furry , diminutive animals have been domesticated and bred in labs are , therefore , the mouse equivalent of 8,000 human years , during which they have been inbred and kept relatively disease - free .
They would never survive in the wild , said Davis .
Meanwhile , the past 8,000 years have seen humans crowded into cities , he said .
" We 've been selected by urbanization , with plagues such as the bubonic plague and smallpox that routinely killed huge numbers of people , and modern scourges like HIV and malaria that still infect and kill millions each year .
Most humans are infected with six different herpes viruses , and who knows what else .
And while we 're suffering away , getting colds and flu , the mice are living in the lap of luxury in miniature condominiums , with special filters on the cage tops to keep bad things out . "
They 're in such pristine shape , Davis notes drily , that researchers have to induce facsimiles of human disease in them .
These conditions may or may not accurately mirror ours .
" We can't depend on the mouse for all the answers , because in some cases it 's not giving us the right answers , " Davis said .
" But think about what we can do with people .
People come to hospitals , get vaccinations , give blood and tissue samples for routine lab tests and clinical trials .
We 're not learning nearly as much as we could from these samples .
As with the recent history of human genetics , we could be much bolder . "
The Human Genome Project , which has radically accelerated the pace of human genetics , was conducted as a large industrial operation carried out mainly in a small number of large centers , including one at Stanford .
In a spirited debate attending that project 's initial conception , many academics objected strenuously on the basis that doing the same thing over and over is n't a good way to train students and researchers , said Davis .
But , he added , " The Human Genome Project did n't destroy the small lab .
It complemented it . "
In his Immunity essay , Davis writes : " Although the small academic labs as we know and love them are great for innovation and out - of - the - box thinking , some problems in biology , particularly those that involve a great deal of repetitive assays and data collection , are much better suited to a larger - scale organization and execution .
The data are both more uniform and considerably cheaper . "
Davis sees the need for a national or even international infrastructure to capture information from blood and tissue samples .
A local template is Stanford 's Human Immune Monitoring Core , run by Davis ' colleague David Hirschberg .
Affiliated investigators send human samples to this facility , where copious assays of cell types and immune secretions in blood and tissues extract data about experimental subjects ' immune status , in a relatively short time .
" This information goes back to the principal investigators , but it also gets captured in a database we 're developing , " Davis said .
The creation of high - throughput assays that could quickly and cheaply measure vast numbers of immunologic variables ( many of them first elucidated in the mouse ) in a standardized fashion among very large groups of people — some in excellent health , others suffering from one or another disease — would greatly advance immunological discovery , said Davis .
" What if we could define the normal range for all these parameters , and then see how they 're changed by any of the over 100 infectious diseases , or 90 - odd autoimmune disorders , or more than 120 inherited immune deficiencies that afflict us — or , for that matter , by aging or even vaccination ?
Maybe we could see something coming early on and start applying remedies to restore the normal balance and prevent the disease 's progression . "
Davis envisions routine clinical tests that , analogous to the serum lipid tests we take to learn our predisposition to cardiovascular disease , tell us what shape our immune system is in or what disease we 're starting to get .
" The game here is that we do n't know quite what we 're looking for yet , " he said .
" But some of this information is going to be useful . "
There ’s not much I like more than a good info graphic .
I ’m of the school that thinks design should primarily be used to convey information in a way that ’s fast and pleases the eye .
With words like “ billions ” & “ trillions ” crowding the headlines lately , I thought it was time to whip one up .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Gunfire and explosions rocked a luxury Mumbai hotel early on Saturday , the last battleground after three days of attacks by Islamist militants in India ’s financial capital that have killed at least 144 people .
Two or three gunmen remained holed up in the vast , 105 - year - old Taj Mahal hotel , but all the others had been killed or taken into custody , officials said .
India blamed the strike on “ elements ” from Pakistan , raising tensions between the nuclear - armed rivals .
Pakistan said the two countries faced a common enemy and it would send its spy chief to share intelligence .
On Thursday , elite Indian troops stormed a Jewish center and another luxury hotel , the Trident - Oberoi .
They killed two gunmen at the Jewish center after sliding down ropes from helicopters onto its roof , but failed to save the lives of five hostages , including a New York - based rabbi and his wife .
The commandos freed 143 hostages at the Trident - Oberoi , including foreign tourists and businessmen who emerged with harrowing stories of the bloodshed inside .
Two gunmen were killed .
As onlookers cheered and chanted “ Victory to mother India , ” many of the troops moved to the Taj , where militants have been fighting for over 48 hours .
“ In view of the firing and the positions they have occupied , I would say there are at least two or three of them , ” said Jyoti Krishna Dutt , head of the paramilitary National Security Guards .
The gunmen may be holding hostages , other officials said .
Police said 24 bodies had been found inside , but that number could rise .
ENGINE ROOM
The militants ’ action has struck at the heart of the city of 18 million people , engine room of an economic boom that has made India a favorite emerging market .
It is also home to the “ Bollywood ” film industry , the epitome of glamour in a country still blighted with poverty .
An Indian state minister said one of the militants arrested was a Pakistani national and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned of “ a cost ” if India ’s neighbors did not take action to stop their territory being used to launch attacks .
But Pakistan ’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi struck a conciliatory note and promised full cooperation .

“ Whoever has done this is neither your friend nor our friend , ” he told reporters in New Delhi .
“ We are not responsible for this , nor is it in our interest to get involved in something like this . ”
The attacks were carried out by a small army of young men armed with rifles and grenades , some of whom arrived by sea , who fanned out across Mumbai on Wednesday night to attack sites popular with tourists and business executives .
Police said 16 foreigners were among the 144 killed .
At least 283 were wounded .

Three Germans , three Americans , one Australian , a Briton , one Canadian , two French , an Israeli , an Italian , a Japanese , a Singaporean and a Thai , were among the dead , according to various governments .
At the Trident - Oberoi , foreigners and Indians , some dragging their suitcases , trickled out of the five - star hotel after their ordeal ended .
One hotel staff member held a baby in his arms .
Fear was palpable throughout the city , although it has been targeted by militants previously .
“ When you have a terrorist shooting down people in stations and on roads , how can anyone feel safe any more ? ” said shopkeeper Pankaj Angre .
Mumbai was hit by serial bomb blasts in 1993 that killed at least 260 people at the stock exchange and other landmarks .
Two years ago , more than 180 people died when Islamist militants bombed commuter trains .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted sanctions placed on the Navy over its underwater sonar testing , a setback for environmental groups that claimed the warfare technology was harming whales and other marine mammals .
An endangered blue whale surfaces off the coast of Southern California in July .
At issue in the 5 - 4 ruling was whether the Navy 's need to conduct exercises to protect the country from enemy submarines outweighed concerns raised by environmental groups .
The case focused on whether the president had the power to issue executive waivers allowing such tests and whether federal judges can issue preliminary injunctions blocking them .
The high court ultimately sided with claims of national security over environmental concerns .
Those environmental interests , said Chief Justice John Roberts for the majority , " are plainly outweighed by the Navy 's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines . "
Roberts said a lower federal court " abused its discretion " by imposing a 2,200 - yard perimeter for testing and ordering a shutdown of sonar use during surfacing exercises .
But in dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned that the ecological damage was significant .
" This likely harm can not be lightly dismissed , " she said , " even in the face of an alleged risk to the effectiveness of the Navy 's 14 training exercises . "
Justices David Souter , Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens also questioned the Navy 's arguments .
The exercises have continued while the case was under appeal .
Environmentalists had sued the Pentagon over the practice , and a federal judge ordered major changes to the Navy 's annual offshore training exercises in March .
President Bush had issued an emergency waiver to allow the exercises to go on without the filing of an environmental impact study , but the lower court ruling blocked the use of sonar .
That federal judge , in ruling against the government last March , said it was " constitutionally suspect " for Bush to issue the national security exemption to allow skipping the impact study .
Military officials argued that the restrictions could hamper readiness in time of war , because new sonar technology is needed to detect increasingly sophisticated enemy submarines .
" This case was vital to our Navy and nation 's security , and we are pleased with the Supreme Court 's decision in this matter , " Navy Secretary Donald Winter said .
" We can now continue to train our sailors effectively , under realistic combat conditions . "
One of the environmental organizations that sued the Defense Department told the justices that the exercises had been planned in advance and that the Navy was required under law to conduct more extensive environmental tests than it had .
The waters of southern California are home to dozens of species of whales , dolphins , seals and sea lions , nine of them federally listed as endangered or threatened .
Federal courts have cited scientific studies and the Navy 's own conclusions that high levels of sonar can cause hearing loss and disorientation in the animals .
In February , the U.S. Navy demonstrated for CNN its onboard procedures for turning down mid-frequency sonar when whales come within 1,000 meters and shutting it off completely when they approach 200 meters .
The sonar sounds like a " ping , ping " noise , and it can be reduced as necessary , officers said .
But environmentalists say that the sonar can hurt whales much farther than 1,000 meters away and that the noise created by the sonar " was like having a jet engine in the Supreme Court multiplied 2,000 times , compensating for water , " attorney Richard Kendall told the justices .
Reacting to the ruling , Kendall said , " It is gratifying that the court did not accept the Navy 's expansive claims of executive power and that two - thirds of the injunction remain in place . "
In 2000 , 16 whales beached themselves in the Bahamas , and the Navy concluded that too many sonar ships had been operating in a narrow underwater channel .
The service says it is funding $ 16 million in independent research to minimize sonar 's effect on marine mammals .

Virgin Galactic space flights ' to help tackle climate change '
Virgin Galactic 's space tourism flights will also give scientists a better understanding of climate change , founder Sir Richard Branson said today .
He announced that his spaceships , due to start launching tourists in 2011 , will carry monitoring instruments to measure the atmosphere at high altitudes .
They will gather data on levels of greenhouse gases such as CO2 in relatively understudied regions of the Earth 's atmosphere , such as the upper stratosphere , mesosphere and lower thermosphere .
The Virgin Galactic will be launched from mothership the ' White Knight ' to take tourists into space .
It will support the rocket called SpaceShipTwo , which will separate at 52,000ft taking passengers into suborbit
The company would collaborate with The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , which produces environmental data , including weather forecasts and climate information .
The NOAA makes most of its measurements at a maximum altitude of 5 miles or around 25,000 ft .
But the first phase of Virgin Galactic will see Space Ship
Two carry six passengers and two pilots up to 68 miles for sub-orbital flights .
Sir Richard announced the initiative during a video message to thousands of space industry delegates at the 59th International Astronautical Congress being held in Glasgow this week .
He said : ' To my mind there is no greater or more immediate challenge than that posed by climate change .
' It 's therefore more than fitting that the very first science to be conducted on board our new vehicles may be specifically directed at increasing our understanding and knowledge of the atmosphere and from there , to better inform our decisions as to the most effective ways of dealing with climate change . '
Sir Richard Branson believes his Virgin Galactic space flights can help tackle the ' immediate challenge ' of climate change
Brent Smith , a director with NOAA , told the congress : ' We need data and observations to understand how our climate changes and this affords us a new and unique opportunity to gather samples and measurements at much higher altitudes than we could usually achieve . '
Virgin Galactic is aiming to become the world 's first spaceline .
The craft is due to be completed next year and the company estimates there will be 12 - 18 months of test flights before commercial trips begin .
Tickets cost £ 110,000 and have been on sale since 2005 .
Initial flights will be launched from a spaceport in the Mojave Desert in California but RAF Lossiemouth is being considered as a potential base for future trips .
The New York Times reports that Craigslist has reached an agreement with 40 state attorneys general to tame its notoriously unruly " erotic services " listings .
Clever diplomacy : according to the article , Craigslist " said that it will charge erotic services vendors a small fee for each ad — about $ 10 , Mr. Buckmaster said — and require that they use a credit card for the payment .
It will donate the money to charities that combat child exploitation and human trafficking .
This , theoretically , will let the company confirm not just a phone number but also an identity . "
I hope they work on cleaning the weird spammers from the ordinary personal ads , too .
Bacteria that can cause serious heart disease in humans are being spread by rat fleas , sparking concern that the infections could become a bigger problem in humans .
Research published in the December issue of the Journal of Medical Microbiology suggests that brown rats , the biggest and most common rats in Europe , may now be carrying the bacteria .
Since the early 1990s , more than 20 species of Bartonella bacteria have been discovered .
They are considered to be emerging zoonotic pathogens , because they can cause serious illness in humans worldwide from heart disease to infection of the spleen and nervous system .
" A new species called Bartonella rochalimae was recently discovered in a patient with an enlarged spleen who had travelled to South America , " said Professor Chao - Chin Chang from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan .
" This event raised concern that it could be a newly emerged zoonotic pathogen .
Therefore , we decided to investigate further to understand if rodents living close to human environment could carry this bacteria . "
Scientists have found that rodents carry several pathogenic species of Bartonella , such as B. elizabethae , which can cause endocarditis and B. grahamii , which was found to cause neuroretinitis in humans .
Although scientists are unsure about the main route of transmission , these infections are most likely to be spread by fleas .
Ctenophthalmus nobilis , a flea that lives on bank voles , was shown to transmit different species of Bartonella bacteria .
These pathogens have also been found in fleas that live on gerbils , cotton rats and brown rats .
" We analysed bacteria found in Rattus norvegicus in Taiwan .
The brown rat is also the most common rat in Europe , " said Professor Chang .
" By analysing the DNA of the bacteria , we discovered a strain that is most closely related to B. rochalimae , which has been isolated recently from a human infection in the United States " .
The researchers took samples from 58 rodents , including 53 brown rats , 2 mice ( Mus musculus ) and 3 black rats ( Rattus rattus ) .
6 of the rodents were found to be carrying Bartonella bacteria ; 5 of these were brown rats .
Four of the rodents were carrying B. elizabethae , which can cause heart disease in humans , and one of the black rats was found to be harbouring B. tribocorum .
However , the scientists noticed one strain that had not been identified in rodents previously .
The strain was finally shown to be close to B. rochalimae .
" Because of the small sample size used in this study , we cannot say for sure that the common brown rat is spreading B. rochalimae , " said Professor Chang .
" However , several different Bartonella bacteria are surely transmitted by rodents .
These results raise concerns about the existence of other reservoirs and vectors for this emerging infection .
This certainly warrants further investigation . "

At the start of the course , the average reading age of the children was four years and ten months .

Yum !
This was a home run .
It 's a little hot here for mac 'n ' cheese , but I had a beautiful heirloom cauliflower ( who knew there were heirloom cauliflowers ? ) and garden tomatoes that needed using , so it was meant to be .
Modifications : Used all gruyere cheese , substituted whole - milk Greek yogurt for creme fraiche , thinned out heavy cream with 1 / 4 cup 2 % milk , used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs , and forgot the mustard .
Oh , and I also augmented the vegetables with 4 - 5 large shallots .
Everyone loved it , even the kids , who are not normally big cauliflower fans .
Leftovers were devoured for next day 's lunch .
Time and heat - saving tip :
Because my kitchen was sweltering , instead of saving the pasta for last last , I cooked it right after the tomatoes and left it in the colander ( placed inside the empty pot ) while I sauteed the vegies and made the bechamel .
Any stuck - together pieces loosened right up as soon as I mixed in the vegetables and sauce , and I did n't have to have that pot of hot water in my kitchen for an extra half hour .
Today , the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand are announcing the establishment of a temporary reciprocal currency arrangement ( swap line ) to address ongoing , elevated pressures in U.S. dollar short - term funding markets .
This facility , like those already established with other central banks , is designed to help improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets .
Federal Reserve Actions
The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized the establishment of a new swap facility with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand that will support the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts of up to $ 15 billion .
This reciprocal currency arrangement has been authorized through April 30 , 2009 .
The FOMC previously authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements with nine other central banks : the Reserve Bank of Australia , the Bank of Canada , Danmarks Nationalbank , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , the Norges Bank , the Sveriges Riksbank , and the Swiss National Bank .

Cats are solitary creatures but need entertainment , the government says Cat and dog owners are to be told to provide " entertainment " and " mental stimulation " for their pets under new government advice .
The code of practice also includes advice on diet and providing " somewhere suitable to go to the toilet " .
It says owners should watch for signs of stress and advises on introducing cats to dogs without the fur flying .
Owners will not be fined for breaking the rules but failure to comply may be used in animal cruelty prosecutions .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) said it wanted to remind pet owners of their responsibilities under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act .
The 26 page document on cat welfare begins with a warning to owners :
" It is your responsibility to read the complete Code of Practice to fully understand your cat 's welfare needs and what the law requires you to do . "
Hot car warning
The document , which will be published as a leaflet and on Defra 's website after an eight week consultation period , says owners must provide their pets with a " suitable place to live " including " somewhere suitable to go to the toilet " .
It also advises providing a separate litter tray for each cat .
This means no one will be able to claim ignorance as an excuse for mistreating any animal
Hilary Benn
Environment secretary
And it adds : " Cats need opportunities to climb and jump , such as a simple ' platform ' type bed or safe access to shelves and the tops of cupboards .
" Cats that are not very tame , such as some farm cats , may prefer to live outdoors in more basic shelter but you still need to look after them . "
The guidelines warn owners they could face prosecution for cruelty for leaving animals in hot cars .
And they give a detailed description of what constitutes normal behaviour - such as scratching and clawing - and tells owners to " watch your cat closely for signs of stress or changes in behaviour " .
" Dogs should be introduced to cats very carefully ; the dog should be held safely on a lead at first so that it cannot chase the cat , " it adds .
On diet , it advises fresh food every day but warns " an obese cat is an unhealthy cat " adding " it is a good idea in a ' greedy ' cat to have the measured food divided up into a number of meals per day " .
Play advice
And it tells owners to provide suitable toys and " entertainment " for their cats .
" You should ensure that your cat has enough mental stimulation from you and from its environment to avoid boredom and frustration .
" It is your responsibility to provide opportunities for your cat to satisfy all of its behavioural needs , such as play and companionship . "
But , the guide adds , cats are solitary creatures and the most common cause of stress is " coming into close contact with other cats they do not like " .
Dog owners , by contrast , are given detailed instructions on ensuring their pets do not become lonely or isolated as " dogs are a social species and need the company of people , dogs or other animals " .
There are similar guidelines for horse owners under the proposals , which are subject to an eight week consultation period .
The proposed leaflet also includes the relevant sections of animal welfare legislation .
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said : " These three new codes of practice will outline the responsibilities under the Animal Welfare Act and give practical advice on how to fulfil them .
" This means no one will be able to claim ignorance as an excuse for mistreating any animal . "

What will they come up with next ?
My family has had many animals and we have not felt the need to be told how to " entertain " them !
My cat is sleeping right now , so do I leave him to sleep , assuming that is normal , or wake him up and entertain him , in case he is just bored ?
Better read the guidelines !
Julie , Dunstable
We 'll be given advice on how to breathe next .
Alex , Edinburgh Unfortunately , the people in need of this advice ( and there are many ) are probably too stupid to read .
Martin , London
Once again the nanny state strikes , full of useless information and pointing out the blatently obvious , we need to stop wasting money on these useless things and put our taxes to more practical use .
Brian , Manchester Entertain a cat ?
When you remove the time our cat spends eating , sleeping and having a quick patrol around the garden there are no hours left in a day !
That 's on top of the fact that any form of disturbance whilst she 's doing any of those things would be met with a look of total disgust .
Anyone who really knows how to care for and look after their pet does n't need this advice .
Anyone who does need to read it should n't be left alone with the poor animal .
It 's another waste of money that could have been put into proper animal welfare .
Des , Reading , England
Yes the code of practice is a good idea and as a dog owner I feel that a dog licence should be re introduced and it should be manditory to have i.d. on the dog i.e. a tag on the collar and / or chipped , also dogs must be kept on leads in public places and £ 2000 fine for dog fouling in public places .
Andy , Devon
Yes it is good to have these quidelines .

Is this a joke ?
Government guidelines telling you that it's a good idea to let your pet go to the toilet ?
There are some things ( and looking after a pet is one of them ) that should be down to common sense .
If you do n't have enough common sense to know that your pet needs to sometimes go to the toilet then you should be in care .
Or is this intended for labour voters who do n't know such things ?
Steve , London I 've provided a small bridge and ' no fishing ' sign for my goldfish .
Is this sufficient under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act ?
Phil , Berkhamsted , UK It is a superb idea .
I live next door to someone whose idea of looking after their cat is feeding it .
It is only allowed in doors when they are at home , and as they are out all week , and stay away at weekends , the poor cat is like a stray , fights with my cat , eats her food , and costs me endless vets bills due to the stress it causes my cat .
The sad thing is that the neighbours cat is a beautiful cat and deserves a loving home .

I would like to know what form of ' entertainment ' is recommended for this age group .
Bingo , perhaps ?
Sarah , Arundel , west sussex
The world has gone mad or at least this government has .
I wonder whether similar guidelines exist on how to treat children and elderly relatives ?
No doubt these guidelines will now be used by the scaremongers from the RSPCA to harass old ladies for not running around with their dogs every day or not buying their cats expensive toys .
I also wonder how much public money has been spent on these guidelines .
Whoever came up with this ' brilliant ' idea should surely be sent to look for a real job together with the rest of the no doubt large department this person works in .
What a shambles !
I was entertaining the thought of having a cat as our boys are very fond of the idea .
No chance of that now !
Too dangerous .
Better have another baby .

For a nation of supposed animal lovers there is a shocking level of animal cruelty in the UK .
Anything that may improve this situation is a good idea although it 's a shame people have to be encouraged or reminded to provide basic care for their animals .
Lorna , Ayrshire , Scotland
When will the big brother , nanny state ever stop interferring ?
It wo n't change peoples hearts or minds , good pet owners do n't need the advice and bad owners wo n't care either way , it 's just more namby pampy nonsense to keep the activists happy , who is going to keep checks and who is going to foot the bill ?
Julian , Salford , UK I think this is a great idea .
Some people need to have these simple things outlined for them in plain English .
A lot of people just get pets for the sake of it and often without thinking about the animals needs .
It is also about time people were unable to get away with animal neglect .
Bringing out these guidelines means they can no longer say they did n't know what they were doing or what they were supposed to be doing .
I know it seems a bit of a waste of time but there are so many people out there who really should n't be getting away with what they are doing .
Lucy , Southampton , UK Just what we need at the beginning of a recession !
An 8 week consultation on " How to pamper your pooch " Glad to see any excess from the government 's rescue of the fat cat bankers is being used to teach us how to look after them .
Mike , York A quite important question is this ; if you need to have home checks , income checks etc for getting an animal , how can anyone choose to have a baby without first being checked out .
Surely these issues are much bigger and more important than whether joe spends a couple of hours a night playing with his cat .
What about his child ?
Martin , Milton Keynes , UK I worked in a pet shop and it is sometimes shocking how little people know about their pets health and lifestyle needs before they buy them .
I think that the government is right to introduce a code of conduct or general information but 26 pages on cat care does seem a little excessive .
Natalie , Brighton , UK
It always pleases me when tougher guidelines and regulations against animal cruelty appear .
However , why is there never anything about the most neglected pet in the UK ( probably the world ) - the rabbit ?
Most domestic rabbits live in tiny cages , with no exercise , poor hygiene and the wrong sort of food .
It is a terrible tragedy that these beautiful animals are so often neglected by owners and the authorities .

As an American historian who knows something of economic law , having learned from the Austrians , I became intrigued with how the United States had remained prosperous , its economy still so dynamic and productive , given the serious and recurring economic fallacies to which our top leaders ( political , corporate , academic ) have subscribed and from which they cannot seem to free themselves — and alas , keep passing down to the younger generation .
Let ’s consider ten .
Myth # 1 : The Broken Window
One of the most persistent is that of the broken window — one breaks and this is celebrated as a boon to the economy : the window manufacturer gets an order ; the hardware store sells a window ; a carpenter is hired to install it ; money circulates ; jobs are created ; the GDP goes up .
In truth , of course , the economy is no better off at all .
True , there is a sudden burst of activity , and some persons have surely gained , but only at the expense of the proprietor whose window was broken , or his insurance company ; and if the latter , the other policyholders who will pay higher premiums to pay for paid - out claims , especially if many have been broken .
The fallacy lies in a failure to grasp what has been foregone by repair and reconstruction — the labor and capital expended , having been lost to new production .
This fallacy , seemingly so simple to explain and grasp , although requiring an intellectual effort of some mental abstraction to comprehend , seems to be ineradicable .
After the horrific destruction of the Twin Towers in September 2001 , the media quoted academic and corporate economists assuring us that the government ’s response to the attacks would help bring an end to the recession .
What was never mentioned was that resources devoted to repair , security , and war - fighting are resources that cannot be devoted to creating consumer goods , building new infrastructure , or enhancing our civilization .
We are worse off because of 9 - 11 .
Myth # 2 : The Beneficence of War
A second fallacy is the idea of war as an engine of prosperity .
Students are taught that World War II ended the Depression ; many Americans seem to believe that tax revenues spent on defense contractors ( creating jobs ) are no loss to the productive economy ; and our political leaders continue to believe that expanded government spending is an effective way of bringing an end to a recession and reviving the economy .
The truth is that war , and the preparation for it , is economically wasteful and destructive .
Apart from the spoils gained by winning ( if it is won ) war and defense spending squander labor , resources , and wealth , leaving the country poorer in the end than if these things had been devoted to peaceful endeavors .
During war , the productive powers of a country are diverted to producing weapons and ammunition , transporting armaments and supplies , and supporting the armies in the field .
William Graham Sumner described how the Civil War , which he lived through , had squandered capital and labor : " The mills , forges , and factories were active in working for the government , while the men who ate the grain and wore the clothing were active in destroying , and not in creating capital .
This , to be sure , was war .
It is what war means , but it cannot bring prosperity . "
Nothing is more basic ; yet it continues to elude the grasp of our teachers , writers , professors , and politicians .
The forty year Cold War drained this country of much of its wealth , squandered capital , and wasted the labor of millions , whose lifetime work , whether as a soldier , sailor , or defense worker , was devoted to policing the empire , fighting its brush wars , and making weapons , instead of building up our civilization with things of utility , comfort , and beauty .
Some might respond that the Cold War was a necessity , but that ’s not the question — although we now know that the CIA , in yet another massive intelligence failure , grossly overestimated Soviet military capabilities as well as the size of the Soviet economy , estimating it was twice as large and productive as it really was .
The point is the wastefulness of war , and the preparation for it ; and I see no evidence whatever that the American people or their leaders understand that , or even care to think about it .
An awareness and comprehension of these economic realities might lead to more searching scrutiny of the aims and methods that the Bush administration has chosen for the War on Terror .
Only a few days after 9 - 11 , Rumsfeld declared that the war shall last as long as the Cold War ( forty plus years ) , or longer — a claim the administration has repeated every few months since then — without eliciting the slightest notice or questioning from the media , the public , or the opposing party .
Would that be the case , if people understand how much a second Cold War , this time with radical Islam , will cost us in lives , treasure , and foregone comfort and leisure ?
Myth # 3 : The Best Way to Finance a War is by Borrowing
Beginning with the War of Independence and continuing through the War on Terror , Americans have chosen to pay for their wars by borrowing money and inflating the currency .
Adam Smith believed that the war should be financed by a levy on capital .
This way the people of the country understand how much the war is costing them , and then can better judge whether it is really necessary .
While he conceded that borrowing might be necessary in the early part of a war , before the revenue from war taxes began to flow into the treasury , he insisted that borrowing be kept to a minimum as a temporary expedient only .
Borrowing increases the costs of war in the form of interest .
Inflating the currency , which often accompanies massive borrowing , as it did during the War of Independence , the War Between the States , and the War in Vietnam ( just to name three ) , is the worst method of war finance , for it drives up prices , increases costs , enlarges debt , spawns malinvestments and speculation , and worsens the redistributive effects of war spending .
In 1861 , the Lincoln administration decided that the people of the north would not stand for much taxation , and that it would increase the already considerable opposition to the southern war .
According to Sumner , the financial question of the day was " whether we should carry on the war on specie currency , low prices , and small imports , or on paper issues , high prices , and heavy imports ? "
The latter course was chosen , and the consequences were a national debt that soared from $ 65 million in 1860 to $ 27 thousand million ( $ 2.7 billion ) in 1865 , and a massive redistribution of wealth to federal bondholders .
In 1865 , the financial question recurred .
It was : " Shall we withdraw the paper , recover our specie [ gold and silver coin ] , reduce prices , lessen imports , reduce debt , and live economically until we have made up the waste and loss of war , or shall we keep the paper as money , export all our specie which had hitherto been held in anticipation of resumption , buy foreign goods with it , and go on as if nothing had happened ? "
The easy route was taken again ( specie payments were not resumed until 1879 , fourteen years later , and almost twenty years after the 1861 suspension ) and the consequences were an inflation - driven stock market and railroad boom that culminated in the panic of 1873 , the failure of the House of Cook , and the Great Railway Strike of 1877 , the first outbreak of large - scale industrial violence in American history .
Myth # 4 : Deficit Spending Benefits the Economy and Government Debt
Three years ago , when then treasury secretary Paul O’Neill objected to the Bush administration ’s policy of guns , butter , and tax cuts he was told by the vice president , Dick Cheney , that , " deficits do n’t matter . "
Of course , they do n’t matter — to him , but they matter to the country .
John Maynard Keynes 's prescription for curing a recession included tax cuts and increased government spending .
" We are all Keynesians now " should be the new motto inscribed on the front of the Treasury building in Washington .
However , Keynes taught that once the recession was over government spending should be reduced , taxes increased , and the deficit eliminated .
Current American policy is to continue deficit spending after the recession is over , and to borrow in peace as well as war .
One longstanding criticism of such policies is that government borrowing " crowds out " private investment , thus raising interest rates .
In an era when credit creation is so easy , and interest rates remain low despite massive deficits reaching $ 500 billion per annum , economists no longer take this objection seriously .
Another criticism is that an accumulating debt saddles future generations with a heavy burden , which is both unfair and detrimental to future growth .
Once again , economists and politicians regard this objection as groundless .
They reason that future generations derive benefits from deficit expenditures — greater security , more infrastructure , improved health and welfare — and that since the principal need never be paid , it is not much of a burden anyway .
They are wrong .
By avoiding having to increase taxes , borrowing hides the price to be paid for increased government spending ( the destructive diversion of capital and labor from private pursuits to government projects ) , and defuses potential public opposition to new or expanded government initiatives , here and abroad .
It is thus both unrepublican and anti-democratic .
Second , depending on how long the redemption of the principal is deferred , accumulating interest payments can double , triple , quadruple , . . . the cost of the initial expenditure ( This country has never yet discharged its Civil War debt ! )
Third , interest payments represent a perpetual income transfer from the working public to the bondholders — a kind of regressive tax that makes the rich , richer and the poor , poorer .
Finally , the debt introduces new and wholly artificial forms of uncertainty into financial markets , with everyone left to guess whether the debt will be paid through taxes , inflation , or default .
Myth # 5 : Government Policies to Promote Exports are a Good Idea
The fallacy that government is a better judge of the most profitable modes of directing labor and capital than individuals is well illustrated by exporting policies .
In the twentieth century , the federal government has sought to promote exports in various ways .
The first was by forcing open foreign markets through a combination of diplomatic and military pressure , all the while keeping our own markets wholly or partially closed .
The famous " open door " policy , formulated by Secretary of State John Hay in 1899 was never meant to be reciprocal ( after all , he served in the McKinley administration , the most archly protectionist in American history ) , and it often required a gun boat and a contingent of hard charging marines to kick open the door .
A second method was export subsidies , which are still with us .
The Export - Import Bank was established by Roosevelt in 1934 to provide cash grants , government - guaranteed loans , and cheap credit to exporters and their overseas customers .
It remains today — untouched by " alleged " free market Republican administrations and congresses .
A third method was dollar devaluation , to cheapen the selling price of American goods abroad .
In 1933 , Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard and revalued it at $ 34.06 , which represented a significant devaluation .
The object was to allow for more domestic inflation and to boost exports , particularly agricultural ones , which failed ; now Bush is trying it .
A fourth method , tried by the Reagan administration , was driving down farm prices to boost exports , thereby shrinking the trade deficit .
The plan was that America would undersell its competitors , capture markets , and rake in foreign exchange .
( When others do this it is denounced as unfair , as predatory trade . )
What happened ?
Well , it turned out that the agricultural export market was rather elastic .
Countries like Brazil and Argentina , depending on farm exports as one of their few sources of foreign exchange , which they desperately needed to service their debt loads , simply cut their prices to match the Americans .
Plan fails .
But it got worse : American farmers had to sell larger quantities ( at the lower prices ) just to break even .
Nevertheless , although the total volume of American agricultural exports increased , their real value ( in constant dollars ) fell — more work , lower profits .
Furthermore , farmers had to import more oil and other producer goods to expand their production , which worsened the trade deficit .
Then , there were the unforeseen and deleterious side - effects .
Expanded cultivation and livestock - raising stressed out and degraded the quality of the soils , polluted watersheds , and lowered the nutritional value of the expanded crop of vegetables , grains , and animal proteins .
Finally , the policy of lower price / higher volume drove many small farmers , here and abroad , off the land , into the cities , and across the border , our border .
Here is an economic policy that not only failed in its purpose but worsened the very problem it was intended to alleviate , and caused a nutritional , ecological , and demographic catastrophe .
Myth # 6 : Commercial Warfare Works
Sumner pointed out that the Americans declared their political independence , they had not entirely freed themselves from the fallacies of mercantilism .
Mercantilists believed that government should both regulate and promote certain kinds of economic activity , the economy being neither self - regulating , nor capable of reaching maximum efficiency if left alone .
Thus , in their struggle for independence , the Americans turned to two dubious policies : commercial warfare ; and inflationary war finance .
I wo n’t rehash the history of the depreciating Continental — which led to the confiscation of property without adequate compensation , defrauded creditors , impoverished soldiers and sailors , price controls , a larger war debt — but I will point out what Sumner so amply demonstrated in his financial history of the Revolutionary War : the commercial war harmed the Americans far more than the British .
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , commercial war took the form of boycotts and embargoes .
The idea was that by closing our markets to British goods , or by denying them our exports , agriculture and raw materials , we could coerce them , peacefully , into changing their policies .
This policy worked only one time , helping to persuade the British to repeal the Stamp Act of 1765 ; but each time thereafter it was tried it only antagonized them and led to some form of retaliation .
In 1774 – 75 , on the eve of war , the Americans stood in desperate need of supplies to prepare for war , and the English offered the best goods at the best prices .
By refusing to trade , hoping to coerce the British into abandoning their own Coercive Acts , the Americans began the war suffering from a supply shortage , which only grew worse ; after a few years of war , they found themselves under the necessity of trading with the enemy , which was carried on through the Netherlands and the West Indian islands of Antigua and St. Eustatius .
President Jefferson ’s embargo of 1807–09 was a complete fiasco .
Not only did it fail to accomplish its purpose of forcing the British and French to respect our neutral commerce ; it devastated the New England economy , which was dependent on commerce and ship - building , hurt southern planters ( who could no longer export ) , reduced federal tariff revenue , and drove the New England states to the brink of secession .
Myth # 7 : The Late Nineteenth Century was an Era of Laissez - Faire Capitalism
Certainly , the late nineteenth century was not an era of laissez - faire , despite the stubborn and persistent myth to the contrary .
True , there were few government regulations on business , but high tariffs , railroad subsidies , and the national banking system prove that the government was no neutral bystander .
Sumner more accurately termed it the era of plutocracy , in which politically organized wealth used the power of the state for selfish advantage .
He also warned , " Nowhere in the world is the danger of plutocracy as formidable as it is here . "
For these indiscretions , the manufacturing and bond - holding hierarchy tried to get him kicked out of Yale , where they thought he was poisoning the minds of their sons with free trade heresies .
Only during two periods since 1776 has the government mostly left the economy alone : during the early years of the federal republic ; and in the two decades previous to the Civil War .
The political economist Condy Raguet called the first period of economic freedom , from 1783 to1807 , " the golden age " of the republic :
Trade was free , taxes were low , money was sound , and Americans enjoyed more economic freedom than any other people in the world .
Sumner thought the years from 1846 to1860 — the era of the independent treasury , falling tariffs , and gold money — was the true " golden age . "
( Historians consider the presidents during this last period — Fillmore , Pierce , and Buchanan — as among the worst we have ever had .
Yet , from 1848 – 1860 , the country was at peace , the economy prosperous , taxes low , money hard , and the national debt was shrinking .
This tells us how historians define political greatness .
Myth # 8 : Business Corporations Favor a Policy of Laissez - Faire
Never in the history of our country have corporations , Wall Street financiers , bond holders , and other large capitalists , as a class or interest , favored a policy of economic liberty and nonintervention by government .
They have always favored some form of mercantilism .
It is surely significant that the second Republican Party , founded in Michigan in 1854 , was funded and led by men who wished to overthrow the libertarian desideratum of the 1840s and 50s .
Of course there have been exceptions .
The merchants and ship - owners of maritime New England put up a good fight for free trade and sound money in the early years of the republic , and the New York City bankers in the nineteenth century were conservative Democrats who supported free trade , low taxes , sound money , and the gold standard .
But these were exceptions .
Consider the testimony of William Simon , who was Secretary of the Treasury under Nixon :
I watched with incredulity as businessmen ran to the government in every crisis , whining for handouts or protection from the very competition that has made this system so productive .
I saw Texas ranchers , hit by drought , demanding government - guaranteed loans ; giant milk cooperatives lobbying for higher price supports ; major airlines fighting deregulation to preserve their monopoly status ; giant companies like Lockheed seeking federal assistance to rescue them from sheer inefficiency ; bankers , like David Rockefeller , demanding government bailouts to protect them from their ill - conceived investments ; network executives , like William Paley of CBS , fighting to preserve regulatory restrictions and to block the emergence of competitive cable and pay TV .
And always , such gentlemen proclaimed their devotion to free enterprise and their opposition to arbitrary intervention into our economic life by the state .
Except , of course , for their own case , which was always unique and which was justified by their immense concern for the public interest .
During the nineteenth century , those who clamored loudest and most effectively for government intervention in the economy were businessmen ; of course farmers sometimes did so as well .
Businessmen sought promotional policies in the form of protective tariffs , a national bank , and public funding of " internal improvements , " such as turnpikes , bridges , and canals .
By the 1820s , proponents of this program called it " the American System , " with Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky its most prominent champion .
Raguet more accurately referred to it as the " British System . "
Clay ran for president on this platform three times , and lost three times ( 1824 , 1832 , and 1844 ) .
His protégé , Abraham Lincoln , learned from this experience , and so when he ran for president in 1860 , hoping to implement the same program , he rarely mentioned it ; instead , he promised to save the western territories from the blight of slavery and to overthrow the " slave power " — political camouflage that worked brilliantly .
The American System was an egregious form of redistributive special - interest politics .
It enriched Louisiana sugar planters , Kentucky hemp growers , New York sheep herders , Pennsylvania iron mongers , New England textile magnates , canal companies , and railroad corporations — all at the expense of planters , farmers , mechanics , and consumers .
The antebellum protectionist movement reached its apogee with the tariff of 1828 , doubling tax rates on dutiable imports to an average of 44 percent in 1829 and 48 percent the next year .
At the time , Raguet calculated that the average American worked one month a year just to pay the tariff .
To his readers , who paid no direct federal taxes at all , nor any excise taxes , this figure was shocking .
In 1830 , tax - freedom day was the first of February ; today it is in June , rendering our tax burden five times greater .
Another income transfer was affected by the vicious banking system of the time , under which incorporated bankers , without capital , charged interest for lending out pieces of paper and deposit credit , which cost them nothing except the cost of printing .
Some libertarians have contended that this was the era of free banking .
It was nothing of the sort .
Bankers were protected under the shield of limited liability and , during financial panics and bank runs , by special laws authorizing the suspension of specie payments — when they refused their contractual obligation to pay specie for their notes .
And their paper was accepted by the federal and state governments ; whether one was buying land , paying import duties , purchasing a bond , or buying bank stock , for the government , bank paper was as good as gold .
These plutocratic measures thus effected a redistribution of wealth , long before the emergence of socialism .
Sumner said that the plutocrats of his own postbellum era ( manufacturers , railroad barons , national bankers , and federal bond holders ) were " simply trying to do what the generals , nobles , and priests have done in the past — get the power of the State into their hands , so as to bend the rights of others to their own advantage . "
The plutocrats of today are still at it , even more successfully , with almost no opposition .
Myth # 9 : Hamilton Was Great
Another myth is that the financial genius and economic statesmanship of Alexander Hamilton saved the credit of the infant United States and established the sound financial and economic foundation essential for future growth and prosperity .
Ron Chernow ’s hagiographic biography of Hamilton is now moving up the best seller charts , cluttering the display tables of Borders and Barnes & Noble , and taking up time on C - Span ’s Booknotes ; but its greatest contribution will be to perpetuate the Hamilton myth for another generation .
Sumner ’s concise and devastating biography of that vainglorious popinjay , written over a hundred years ago , remains the best .
He closely studied Hamilton ’s letters and writings , including the big three — his Report on the Public Credit ( 1790 ) , Report on a National Bank ( 1790 ) , and Report on Manufactures ( 1791 ) — and came to three conclusions : first , the New Yorker had never read Smith ’s Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) , the most important economic treatise written in the Anglo - American world in that period ; second , he was a mercantilist , who would have been quite at home serving in the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole or Lord North ; and third , Hamilton believed many things that are not true — that federal bonds were a form of capital ; that a national debt was a national blessing ; that the existence of banks increased the capital of the country ; that foreign trade drained a country of its wealth , unless it resulted in a trade surplus ; and that higher taxes were a spur to industry and necessary because Americans were lazy and enjoyed too much leisure .
The idea here was that if you taxed Americans more , they would have to work harder to maintain their standard of living , thus increasing the gross product of the country and providing the government with more revenue to spend on grand projects and military adventures .
Hamilton was once stoned by a crowd of angry New York mechanics .
Is it any wonder why ?
Myth # 10 : Agrarianism or Industrialism : We Must Choose
Historians teach that Americans in the 1790s and 1800s had two economic choices — Hamilton and the Federalists who believed in sound money , banking , manufacturing , and economic progress , and the Jeffersonians who believed in inflation , agrarianism , and stasis .
This is a gross simplification .
Not all Federalists were Hamiltonian ; many despised him .
Hamilton dogmatically believed that the United States should become a manufacturing nation like England and that it was the duty of the federal government to bring this about by promotional policies .
Jefferson , on the other hand , oscillated between liberalism and agrarianism .
At his best , he was liberal , but for a long time he dogmatically believed that the United States should remain an agricultural nation , and that it was the duty of the federal government to keep it in such a state by delaying the onset of large - scale manufacturing .
Hence , to expand trade , it should fight protectionist powers and hostile trading blocs , acquire more agricultural land through purchase or war , and , after obtaining the requisite amendment , fund the construction of internal improvements to foster the movement of agricultural produce to the seaports .
Thus , Jefferson authored the Louisiana Purchase , the Tripolitan War , the Embargo ; and his chosen successor , James Madison , the War of 1812 , all designed to fulfill this agrarian vision .
As president , Madison became ever - more Hamiltonian , supporting the re-establishment of the Bank of the United States , the raising of tariffs , conscription , and the appointment of nationalists to the Supreme Court .
He appointed Joseph Story , which is like Ike appointing Earl Warren , or Bush appointing Souter .
Meanwhile , in retirement , Jefferson advocated manufacturing to achieve national economic self - sufficiency .
Why not Freedom ?
Besides industrialism and agrarianism , there was a third position — call it liberalism , or laissez - faire — which maintained that the government should promote neither manufacturing nor agriculture , but leave both alone , to prosper or not , expand or recede , according to the unerring guides of profitability , utility , individual choice , and economic law .
Inspired by the writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo , but even more those of the French radical school of Turgot , Say , and de Tracy , whose mottos laissez nous faire ( leave the people alone ) and ne trop gouverneur ( do not govern too much ) captured the essence of good government .
Outstanding representatives of this liberal philosophy were the young Daniel Webster , who made his reputation for oratory with fiery speeches on behalf of free trade , hard money , and state rights as a New Hampshire congressman , and the great John Randolph of Virginia , who broke with Jefferson over the embargo and opposed the War of 1812 , losing his seat as a consequence , and Condy Raguet , the influential political economist , who was the first American to develop a monetary theory of the business cycle , which he did in response to the panic of 1819 .
Laissez - faire was the cause of those who opposed plutocracy and supported the people .
It represented both the moral high ground and sound economic reasoning .
Conclusion
When he was writing his masterful History of American Currency , Sumner grappled with the question of how North America had withstood levels of inflation and indebtedness that would have ruined any European country .
His answer : " The future which we discount so freely honors our drafts on it .
Six months [ of ] restraint avails to set us right , and our credit creations , as anticipations of future product of labor , become solidified . "
In other words , the country was so productive that the losses engendered by these excesses were quickly made up .
He went on : " We often boast of the resources of our country , but we did not make the country .
What ground is there for boasting here ?
The question for us is :
What have we made of it ?
No one can justly appreciate the natural resources of this country until , by studying the deleterious effects of bad currency and bad taxation , he has formed some conception of how much , since the first settlers came here , has been wasted and lost . "
The unseen again .
Let us begin with geography and resources , to which Sumner alludes .
The lower 48 states are entirely in the temperate zone .
Apart from the desert states of the southwest , all receive ample rainfall .
Most of the land is fertile , and it is abundant .
The country teems with natural resources .
Then there are the people .
Until very recently , the United States enjoyed a low density of population , which meant high wages and low land prices .
And for centuries , the population has been one of the hardest working in the world , creating an infrastructure to build on .
Then there is the culture .
Largely because of the influence of Christianity , the debilitating sin of envy has no social standing here , unlike the Third World where it is perhaps the chief impediment to wealth - creation and development .
Also , for the same reason , there is little bribery , which also impedes growth .
Finally , there is the tradition of law , respect for private property , tradition of profit , and contractual freedom .
These institutions — and not the fallacious ideas , corrupt institutions , and bad policies named above — form the core of American prosperity .
