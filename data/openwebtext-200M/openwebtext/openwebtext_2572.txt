Massive drug sweep nets 750 arrests : US Agence France - Presse
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US and Mexican authorities have arrested 750 people over 21 months in an anti-drug sweep , including 52 members of Mexico 's Sinaloa drug cartel detained Wednesday , Attorney General Eric Holder said .
The cartel members were arrested as part of an " international narcotics trafficking and money - laundering investigation called Operation Accelerator , " Holder told a press conference .
The operation -- which investigated crimes in the United States , Mexico and Canada -- netted some 59 million dollars in cash , 12,000 kilos ( 12 tonnes ) of cocaine , 544 kilos ( 1,200 pounds ) of methamphetamine and 1.3 million Ecstasy pills .
" An operation of that scope and magnitude can only be effective with combined forces against the enemy , " Holder said , praising cooperation between agencies and governments in the arrests .
The bloody war between rival cartels , fighting for control of drug trafficking into the United States , the world 's biggest consumer of cocaine , has produced internal chaos in Mexico .
Unrest related to the drug trade has caused the violent deaths of some 5,300 people throughout the country last year alone , according to official figures , despite a government crackdown that saw the deployment of nearly 36,000 troops .
The US Drug Enforcement Administration 's Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart , speaking alongside Holder , said the investigation unveiled the scope of the cartel 's international network , including a " super meth lab that is so sophisticated we 've seen none like it anywhere . "
The operation not only took out cartel operatives in larger US cities such as New York and Los Angeles , but in smaller towns like Lancaster , Pennsylvania and Stow , Ohio .
Leonhart added that the raids uncovered drug factory machines able to produce 12,000 ecstasy tablets an hour .
The operation effectively " shut down " drug cartel networks throughout North America , she said .
The DEA " will continue attacking the international drug trade with every tool at our disposal , fighting to defeat those who put deadly drugs on our streets and engage in violence in our communities , " she said .

Two and a half years ago , the software engineers behind Google Earth , the searchable online replica of the planet , were poised to fill an enormous data gap , adding the two - thirds of the globe that is covered by water in reality and was blue , and blank , online .
But until then all of the existing features on Google Earth  mountains , valleys , cities , plains , ice sheets  were built through programming from an elevation of zero up .
“ We had this arbitrary distinction that if it was below sea level it did n’t count , ” recalled John Hanke , the Internet entrepreneur who co-created the progenitor of Google Earth , called Keyhole , and moved to Google when the company bought his company in 2004 .
That oversight had to be fixed before the months and months of new programming and data collection could culminate in the creation of simulated oceans .
On Monday , the ocean images will undergo the most significant of several upgrades to Google Earth , with the new version downloadable free at earth.

I was talking bacon ( of all things ) with my friend Cathleen over the weekend , and she told me she makes sure to bring along extra bacon every year when she goes to Burning Man .
The festival works almost completely on a barter system , and bacon apparently tops the list of items including pancakes , Otter Pops and ... tuna .
( You 'd have to be there ) .
Cathleen thinks bacon 's status has something to do with the heat at the festival , which is usually held in late summer , and participants ' craving for salt ( and a little tasty protein ) .
She said bacon works so well that when she and some friends were waiting in a very , very long line for pancakes at this year 's festival , she mentioned that she had bacon .
Just like that , front of the line .
It makes me think .
In these unsteady times , with the economy and our stomachs doing circus backflips , maybe we should turn to something a little more certain .
And comforting .
Like bacon .
So , the latest entry on the quest to find 1,001 things to do with bacon .

In 1938 , Orson Welles narrated and directed a radio adaptation of H.G Wells ' classic sci- fi novel , The War of the Worlds .
Using the book as the basis of a simulated news broadcast , Welles and his cast members detailed the invasion of Earth by a race of malevolent Martians .
While much of what happened after is more suited for the subject of urban legends , there are still reports of panic and hysteria following the broadcast .
It took only a little suggestion before people could smell the black smoke of the Martian war machines and felt the need to flee their homes .
The War of the Worlds broadcast is one of the more famous examples of mass hysteria and the frighteningly powerful delusions of a crowd mentality .
In contemporary times , we too have our own example of humanity 's " herding instinct " going into overdrive .
We have console fanboys , and their increasingly paranoid delusions .
While they sometimes have had reason to be upset ( though only the most tenuous of reasons ) , the fanboy set has quite clearly fallen into the self - sustaining fantasies of collective obsessional behavior .
Very much like War of the Worlds , it has taken very little suggestion , but they now believe fiction as fact .
They can smell the black smoke of their enemies .
Yet just like those who found themselves terrified by Orson Welles that dark October night , these poor lost souls are only trolling themselves now .
Killzone 2 has received intense amounts of press in the month leading up to its release .
While much of the focus has quite rightly been on its blazing hot critical reception , a significant amount of time has also been given over to the incredible " controversy " surrounding the game .
Of course , as with all crowd delusions , there is no controversy outside of what the pack mentality has invented for itself .
Let 's look at some examples .
First of all , we have the famous Totalvideogames review , which our own Jonathan Ross highlighted in his Fanboy Friday column .
The Web site gave Killzone 2 an 8/10 , and the 400 + comment thread that followed was so full of bile , outrage and unacceptably evil - minded nastiness that even I , someone who has received a fair bit of hate mail over the years , was actually shocked .
From claims that the reviewer should lose his job , to accusations of him being a " microshitting fagtart , " the spiteful commentary flew thick and fast , and why ?
Because he dared to give Killzone 2 a great score and not a perfect score ?
Yes ... apparently that 's exactly what the problem is .
" hey jon you obviously jerk off too xbox 360 so if you were here in front of me i would roundhouse ki[ # @ !? ] in your tiny microsoft loving balls , " explains one brave and anonymous commenter .
" also if you think halo is even good your a retard ... it was a mirror of the first two and sucked even harder than the first two ... so dont talk about weak story lines your gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy "
This is because the reviewer said the game was great and not perfect .
Yeah .
It 's astounding to see how often that famous " bias " word comes up , often in multiple times during one post .
This is not because the word has any relevance to the argument , and certainly is n't because the person using it knows what it means .
Most of these trolls use the word " bias " because one of the other members of the herd used it .
This is evidenced by the sheer amount of times the word is thrown around , often in the completely wrong context .
Most of the people accusing others of " bias " have no idea of what the word even means anymore .
They simply use it because it 's used .
Moving on , it 's amazing to find that even G4TV 's 5/5 review garnered hatred from the fanboys , and this is where we see a clear example of how the trolls have begun to troll themselves , to feed their own paranoid fantasies when there 's nothing really there .
G4's Adam Sessler has famously bitten back , answering some of the most ludicrous accusations , but the one I want to linger on a couple that truly show what an Ouroborus this whole situation has become .
" Wow , bias toward the 360 much ? " claims one person , after watching this 5/5 review .
" No - one mentioned the post launch co-op that was already announced , nooooo .
It 's just a bad thing that there 's no co-op , right ?
I really thought Xplay gave honest reviews .
Sure it 's a 5 / 5 but it killed you guys a little on the inside , did n't it ? "
If you do n't think that 's a clear enough example of the crowd seeing only what the crowd wishes to see , then this one will get you :
" No matter what it 's never enough , " the comment ironically opens with .
" 5/5 huh yet no matter how badass it looks you can hear it in Adam and Morgan 's voice that they were almost upset that the game is as good as it is . "
This comment , this comment right here is what struck me with the epiphany that we are now living through our own War of the Worlds panic .
When you can watch a glowing review of a game given a perfect score and then start hearing secret bias in the voices of the reviewers , then you have gone beyond .
You have truly started climbing Jacob 's Ladder .
Finally , we have an example from the pages of Destructoid itself .
Just this Friday , we posted a video of a supposed " glitch " in Killzone 2 that someone struggled incredibly hard to find in the game 's demo .
The maker of the video , with ridiculous amounts of effort , was able to jump up to a spot in the map not intended for travel , and break out of the map itself .
To call it a glitch as if it exposed some huge problem with Killzone 2 was ridiculous , and we mocked such effort .
I wish I could say that the post was some great experiment to " trap " fanboys into betraying their own paranoia , that it was a big prank in order to get an example of a truly indoctrinated herd member , but it was genuinely posted with the goal of entertaining everyone , and nothing more .
There was no attempt at trickery , no clever ploy at work .
I just honestly did n't think someone could be that deluded .
I was wrong .
The post was very clearly sarcastic in its tone , declaring as it did that Sony was doomed by a buggy , glitchy , broken Killzone 2 .
Apparently , however , the whole post betrayed my obvious love of Microsoft and all things Xbox 360 .
" Yup .
Jim is a Xbot Fatboy who is clueless about videogames and the concept of playing more than one console , " helpfully explained one user .
" Lame . "
Of course , when it was explained to this confused individual that he might have missed the sarcasm ( after all , an article called " OMG Killzone 2 is TOTALLY broken OMG actually " just has to be genuine , right ? ) , he responded with yet another beautiful example of herd delusion :
" His sarcasm is just a cover for his actual and true feelings .
The video did n't show a glitch .
It showed some dude hopping around . "
Yes ... my sarcasm is a cover - up for my actual feelings that Killzone 2 really is a buggy piece of shit , apparently .
He then , almost as if to accentuate the self - parody , explained the entire point of my article , as if nobody else had even realized that it was n't a true glitch .
When it gets to the point where people are going into high - scoring reviews and posts that actually defend their precious exclusive games , dreaming up things to be miserable about , perhaps it 's time certain individuals re-evaluated their priorities , and perhaps took up a hobby that does n't cause them so much grief and sorrow .
People are becoming emotionally absorbed , and at a time when PS3 fans should be overjoyed that they have a fantastic videogame coming their way , that fact that all they can focus on is the stuff that upsets them is truly fucking sad .
Xbox fans are no better , somehow feeling threatened by the presence of a great PS3 game and trying to attack it .
Killzone 2 itself has become their Martian invader , the Black Smoke , and they whip themselves up into a frenzy about it just like the PS3 fanboys who have become so paranoid that they can hear voices and see sarcasm as sinister cover-ups .
Nobody has actually done anything though .
Nobody in the press has gone out of their way to hurt Killzone 2 , and nobody has any reason to " harm " the PS3 .
Nobody choked up and died inside when they gave the game full marks , and nobody is hiding their true hatred of Sony exclusives in the tone of their voice or strength of their sarcasm .
In short -- the people in the press are nowhere near as interested in the downfall of the PS3 as PS3 fanboys themselves .
Nobody wants the PS3 to die , but PS3 lovers seem to want people to want it to die .
That 's fucked up .
If all the fanboys and trolls who have made these accusations and spat their bile for the past week actually came together and truly shared a collective mentality in one body , if their obsession , imagination and deluded inability to ever be satisfied came to represent the mind of just one person , that person would have the psychological profile of a serial killer .
These people have lost their minds .
Driven by compulsion , fueled by their dreams of conspiracy .
Trolling themselves , because nobody else cares enough to troll them .

The incomparable beauty of nature changing colors with seasons and the sigh of breeze in the pines can only be experienced at Yosemite Valley ( Pronounced Yo - seh - mit - tea ) .
Yosemite Valley is part of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada Mountains .
This alpine valley offers incredible natural beauty and is just one mile in width and eight miles long with vertical granite walls rising above 2000 feet on either side .
Nine ethereal waterfalls cascade into the valley .
Wilderness hiking trails are as long as 800 miles .
The Niagara Falls – Ontario , Canada and New York , United States
Massive and beautiful waterfalls on the Niagara River , they are also famous for being a source of hydroelectric power .
These falls are divided into three drops ; Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side and American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls on the American side .
These falls are said to have been formed at the end of the last ice age .
These waterfalls may not be the highest but are certainly wide and the most powerful in North America .
Mount Kilimanjaro – Africa
Ernest Hemingway described this mountain as , “ as wide as all the world , great , high and unbelievably white , ” in his book , “ The Snows of Kilimanjaro . ”
The roof of Africa as it is called is the world ’s tallest free - standing mountain and a dormant stratovolcano .
The Kibo Summit at the top of the mountain is one among the few peaks of Africa that still have glaciers .
Mamanuca Islands – Fiji
They are 20 islands in total .
These beautiful islands of Mamanuca are varied ; while some are small and can be walked around in a few minutes , others may take days to explore .
For those who love nature and water bodies , these islands are a paradise with miles and miles of lilley snow white sand and beautiful turquoise blue beaches .
Sahara Sunset – Sahara Desert
While the Sahara Desert is a wonderful place to see for the wide expanse of sand dunes , the sunset there is sure to take your breath away .

This elaborate calcium formation is the largest of its kind , spreading miles and miles .
The pristine surroundings are not only emotionally but physically cathartic .
The water is believed to be therapeutic , curing various maladies .
In spite of being filled with tourists , it still retains the old world charm and peace that we long for .

It was 8.30 on a gloomy winter morning – Thursday 11 December – when the FBI 's Agent Theodore Cacioppi made a house call .
A penthouse call , to be exact .
Accompanied by a sidekick from the bureau , Cacioppi strode into the lobby of the graceful pre-war building on Manhattan 's monied Upper East Side , and announced himself to the doorman who guards access to the elite residents inside .
The relatively modest lobby , with leather chairs and a single orchid for decoration , is at the opposite end of the scale to the dripping opulence of a Donald Trump creation .
The giant apartments at 133 East 64th Street – just two per floor – start at $ 5 m , and duplex penthouses at $ 7 m .
It 's an address for people who want to enjoy the luxuries great wealth affords without shouting about it .
As Cacioppi was ushered to the elevator he cannot have realised that he was about to unmask the greatest fraudster the world has ever seen .
He was there not because of years of dogged detective work , but to follow up an emotional confession made the previous evening to the suspect 's sons , who had turned their father in .
At 8.30 am , Bernard Lawrence Madoff let the officers in .
One of the most outwardly respectable gentlemen in New York finance for decades , Madoff confessed to conning his family , friends , colleagues , clients and regulators to the tune of $ 50 bn .
With his confession to Cacioppi , Madoff drove a final nail into the coffin of the dazzling , wild Wall Street of the past quarter of a century .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We are here to find out if there is an innocent explanation , " Cacioppi said quietly .
The 70 - year - old financier – his grey hair receding but thick and kept long , swept back ; his skin tanned , making him look younger – paused , then replied .
" There is no innocent explanation . "
The words unleashed a firestorm .
As piece by piece the breathtaking scale of this fraud came to light , revealing a vast network of rich and famous victims across the world and banks brought to the brink of collapse , it has become increasingly mind - boggling to trace this maelstrom back to Bernard Madoff .
How could one man alone evaporate so much wealth ?
What was he thinking ?
It is hard to imagine that we will ever have more than a partial answer .
Enron was at least a corporation , where a cadre of executives spun a deceit whose spectacular end came to symbolise the excesses of the dot.com era .
The Madoff affair ( it is indeed pronounced " made off " ) is a more baffling concept .
The bare bones are easily understood .
He was lying when he said he was investing his clients ' money and generating enviable , steady returns .
There were no profits ; instead , their money was going to pay other clients who wanted to cash out .
It is an old fraudster trick , a pyramid scheme , or " Ponzi scheme " , to use the American term , after the immigrant who conned New York 's Italian community around 1920 .
Charles Ponzi discovered that you need ever increasing amounts of new cash to keep the game going ; what is so astonishing is how , over so many years , Madoff did manage to harvest those ever - increasing sums .
Every month , he sent out statements telling clients how their nest eggs were stacking up , statements whose fictitious balances totalled about $ 50bn , as he told Agent Cacioppi that morning .
In fact , there was less than $ 300 m in the pot .
It was just after the end of the trading day on Wall Street when the details of that morning 's arrest popped up on the newswires , and CNBC , the business channel that blares out from the corner of most offices made its breathless announcement : " If you work on a trading desk , stop what you 're doing for one second before you walk out the door and clean your desk out for the day , " said presenter Michelle Caruso - Cabrera .
" Bernie Madoff has been arrested .... "
Madoff may not have been a household name , but for almost 50 years , Madoff Investment Securities has been one of the industry 's most prominent trading firms and Madoff one of its more famous faces .
His is just the sort of hardscrabble tale that Wall Street loves to mythologise – the boy from Queens , New York , who saved $ 5,000 from selling sprinkler systems and then working as a lifeguard on Long Island , and used the money to set himself up as a trader of penny stocks .
Madoff himself revelled in his own myth .
A statue in the grounds of his Palm Beach mansion is of two lifeguards staring out to sea .
( We learnt this because last month , some scurrilous thief stole it , only to return it days later with a note attached : " Bernie the Swindler , Lesson : Return stolen property to rightful owners .
Signed by – The Educators . " )
Madoff 's mother also appears to have been a stockbroker , albeit one who fell foul of regulators , who accused her of failing to comply with financial reporting rules in the 1960s .
Bernard was born to Sylvia and Ralph Madoff in the tight - knit , mainly Jewish community of Laurelton , Queens on 29 April 1938 , and appeared to make little academic impression at Far Rockaway High School or later at the University of Alabama , or Hofstra University , back in Long Island , where he got a degree in political science .

But Madoff Investment Securities , which he founded in 1960 , was one of the iconoclastic firms who challenged the New York Stock Exchange 's old - school brokers , using aggressive marketing techniques to win clients , and promoting a new era of electronic trading .
Madoff became something of a spokesman for these outsiders , and helped create the rival Nasdaq electronic stock exchange , where he later served as chairman .
Although many people who came into contact with him on the golf courses of Florida , have described him as aloof , he was clubbable with the right people , and chummy with the finance industry 's regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission , supposedly consumers ' sharp - toothed watchdog on Wall Street .
They would rib each other – Madoff laughingly called enforcers at the SEC " the enemy " when his niece , the glamorous Shana Madoff , married one of them – but the SEC relied on him and other members of his family to advise them on ways to modernise the markets .
Madoff 's wife , Ruth , meanwhile , was evolving into the New York society wife .
Two years his junior at Far Rockaway , Ruth Alpern had been his childhood sweetheart , an outgoing blonde who was always one of the most popular in her class .
At times , she kept an office at the firm , and investigators believe her name is on some transactions and that she may have helped to reconcile the business 's bank accounts , though there is no evidence she knew of her husband 's fraud .
Indeed , the topic of whether she could have been at her husband 's side for 50 years without believing something was amiss is now a staple of daytime talk shows .
She has not been seen in public since her husband 's arrest .
Ruth Madoff mainly busied herself with philanthropic ventures , particularly the couple 's charitable foundation , set up in 1998 and a big giver to cancer causes and the arts .
In 1996 , she executive - edited a cook book , Great Chefs of America Cook Kosher , a vanity project .
She would spend time decorating the couple 's numerous properties , such as the apartment in Cap d'Antibes on the French Riviera , and in Florida , where their $ 9.4 m winter mansion has five bedrooms and a boat dock for the yacht , The Bull .
They joined all the right clubs , moved in all the right circles .
So it is many years since Madoff could have been described as a Wall Street outsider ; by the time of his confession , he appeared the grandee .
Established , trustworthy .
Maybe it was keeping up those appearances that led him into his desperate deceptions , perhaps after an unexpected loss that he hoped to recoup later .
Or maybe the deceits began long before that , rooted in those raw early days of trading and the desire to build the business that his mother could not .
Investigators are still only at the start of their work .
Appearances are important to Madoff , and employees have numerous tales that suggest an obsessive compulsive disorder .
A former secretary has described how he remodelled offices to eliminate semi-circular shapes , detailing how he squared off the interior of his New York office which had moved into the desirable , elliptical skyscraper nicknamed the Lipstick Building .
Other stories tell of how he installed CCTV to monitor employees in the London branch ( which purportedly managed only a small chunk of Madoff 's personal wealth but is at the centre of an inquiry into whether he pushed money offshore ) .
Any chipped paint would have to be filled in with marker pen .
He once ripped out a carpet tile that had a pear juice stain on it , and rushed to replace it with a clean spare .
The Madoff Investment Securities colour scheme of black and grey was taken to such an extreme that it took on a Soviet feel .
There was a strict ban on using blue pens .
Black ink only .
Nowhere was Madoff 's bizarre behaviour on display more clearly than on the day , a week after his arrest , when the public got the first glimpse of him returning to the Upper East Side after a courthouse tussle over his bail .
Of all the things that he was wearing as he marched along the side side of his building , pushing back a swarm of photographers , it was n't the black diamond - quilted jacket and the baseball cap that caused comment – it was the fixed grin .
And if there is anything calculated to cause public outrage , it is the sight of a self - confessed fraudster grinning .
Suddenly , Bernard Madoff was public enemy No 1 .
At future hearings , where his bail terms have been tightened , he would be escorted to and from the courthouse by US marshals , as protesters circled .
One man , camped outside the building where Madoff has been under house arrest for more than a month , angled a placard so it could be seen from the penthouse window : " Bernie , it 's not too late to do the right thing .
JUMP ! " Amid persistent rumours that Russian mob money found its way into the Madoff Ponzi scheme , a panic button has been installed in the apartment , along with 24 - hour surveillance , as much to protect him as to check he is not planning to flee .
He wears a bullet - proof vest for trips to court .
The fraudster 's notoriety is such that trinkets such as pens and rugs and other giveaways emblazoned with the Madoff Investment Securities logo are selling for hundreds of dollars on eBay .
A hot sauce called " Bernie in Hell " has been launched by a New York artist .
The New York Times , at the weekend , compared him to a psychopath and the Seventies serial killer Ted Bundy .
Madoff never murdered anyone , but the distress he leaves in his wake is huge .
Numerous celebrities have given his crime a photogenic face , among them Kevin Bacon , Steven Spielberg and his business partner Jeffrey Katzenberg , and Zsa Zsa Gabor , down a reported $ 7 m .
But it goes much , much further .
The children of the Long Island Jewish set who relied on Madoff money for their trust funds will probably survive .
But baby - boomers who had budgeted on those fictitious monthly accounts to pay their nursing care and medical bills through retirement face a suddenly bleak old age .
Ordinary pension funds were among those whose billions were funnelled through intermediaries into Madoff , leaving Connecticut 's firefighters among those hit .
And the fraud has had a devastating effect on philanthropic enterprises – from human rights organisations rehabilitating former prisoners , to bone marrow donor networks – because many Jewish charities trusted money to Madoff directly or to the unwitting accomplices who handed over their own hedge funds for him to run .
One woman , Sondra Wiener , 74 , has put her $ 900,000 retirement home in Palm Beach up for sale , and her son , 50 - year - old Charles , has done the same with the home he built in 1971 on Long Island .
Wiener was close to tears when a New York Post reporter spoke to him outside the four - bedroom house .
" It 's a rotten thing , emotionally devastating to our entire family , " he said .
It 's not a good time to be selling your home , but that is not what makes this story so memorable .
Sondra Weiner is Bernard Madoff 's sister ; Charles worked at the firm for 30 years .
Madoff was scamming even those closest to him .
Investigators are turning their attentions now to Madoff 's brother , Peter , seven years his junior , who – although he held no stake in the firm – was a deputy at Madoff Investment Securities , so indispensable that the pair often refused to travel together in case of an accident .
Bespectacled and bow - tied , affable and erudite , Peter Madoff collects classic cars almost as enthusiastically as his brother collects watches .
Like his brother , he split his time between Long Island and Palm Beach , where he was networker - in - chief .
Peter was in charge of the historic stockbroking side of the company , which was always kept separate from the phantom investment business .
It was to Peter that Bernard 's two sons notionally reported , as they rose through the ranks .
Andrew Madoff , now 44 , and brother Mark , 42 , have worked with their father all their adult lives .
Mark was more deeply enmeshed in designing flashy electronic trading systems .
He sat on a string of company boards – although he had to slow down to battle lymphoma earlier this decade – and hobnobbed in the rarefied Core Club , behind an unmarked door a few blocks from the Lipstick Building .
The $ 15,000 - a- year club boasts Bill Clinton , private equity billionaire Stephen Schwarzman , Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and people from the pinnacle of fashion and food on its membership list .
Mark Madoff has just cancelled his .
Both he and Andrew were victims of their father , not his accomplices , their lawyer says .
They had " no access to overall financial information about their father 's firm " .
Mark took his money out of the investment arm to fund a divorce from his first wife in 2000 and both sons used outside investment firms to run their own private philanthropic foundations , shielding them from ruin , but Andrew had millions invested with his father .
There was no Hanukkah gathering for the Madoffs .
Lawyers are standing in between them all .
It was to his brother that Bernard Madoff first confessed his fraud , according to the tale told to Agent Cacioppi , and a day later to his sons , who turned him in .
Now Andrew and Mark have been told not to talk to their father or their uncle while investigators pick through who knew what and when , and since all are at least witnesses in the case they must avoid pre-trial contact .
There is no suggestion that the FBI has evidence family members knew anything until those confessions .
The FBI and SEC have camped out at Madoff 's 17th - floor offices of that lipstick - shaped , salmon - coloured skyscraper .
It was here , we know now , that Madoff kept numerous sets of books , and where the code to this extraordinary fraud may finally be deciphered .
His sons told the FBI that his investment business was run there , away from the historic trading business carried out on the bustling floors above .
He was " cryptic " about the operations on the 17th floor , they said , and there is still no clarity on when he began taking clients ' money with the promise of investment .
He ran the investment arm side by side with a trusted lieutenant , Frank DiPascali , whose arrival at the office in jumpers and jeans belied a taut personality .
He had been introduced to Madoff a year after graduating from a Catholic high school in Queens 33 years ago .
He lives more modestly than his boss : only a five - bed , five - bath house with a pool and cabana on seven acres in the New Jersey suburbs .
He 's " a blue - collar guy , not a Wall Street master of the universe " , says his lawyer , Mark Mukasey , " and he is devastated " .
Notes of investigators ' leaked interviews with DiPascali describe his answers as " evasive " and " incomprehensible " , but he has not been accused of wrongdoing and his lawyer has declined comment on the extent of his knowledge .
Investors were told that DiPascali was the man who carried out the complicated trading that was supposedly returning double - digit percentage profits , year in , year out .
Visitors to the 17th floor describe it in almost eerie terms , a place with banks of computers but hardly a trader in sight .
Supposedly the hub of a multi-billion - dollar fund , there were barely 20 dedicated employees .
The volumes of options trading that Madoff claimed to be doing never showed up on any public exchange or records from the stockbroking side of the company , and no other firm has said it traded with the Madoff 's investment business .
The FBI believes Madoff may never have properly invested any of the money entrusted to him .
Fifty - billion dollars : $ 50,000,000,000 .
No matter how you write it , it is a breathtaking number .
Few Wall Street money managers achieve a business on that scale .
Madoff did it while having to maintain a fiction of Truman Show scale .
For many years , he hid from public view the fact that he was managing other people 's money .
Even after he registered as an investment adviser , at no point did anyone realise the scale of the funds that were pouring into the black hole on the 17th floor .
How could one man do it ?
The answer is he did not do it alone .
A vast network of fundraisers was assembled among a financial aristocracy spanning three continents .
Often secretly , they passed to him billions of dollars , in cash , from acquaintances .
None of which is to say these people knew they were aiding and abetting a fraud .
They profited handsomely from not asking .
Madoff had n't set himself up as a traditional hedge fund , and did n't charge standard outrageous fees of " two and twenty " – 2 per cent to manage the money and 20 per cent of profits .
A string of Madoff 's middlemen outsourced vast portions of their own business to Madoff and charged clients handsomely for profits he claimed to have earned them .
But their lives , too , changed at 8.30 am on 11 December .
One after another , these powerbrokers were forced to admit they had been duped .
Now facing catcalls about their ignorance , and lawsuits alleging negligence , these are the blind accomplices who made Madoff .
Carl Shapiro met Madoff 48 years ago .
Shapiro was a successful Boston businessman and investor – the city is studded with buildings named in his honour , as he fed some of the fortune from his clothing business into philanthropic gestures .
" A friend asked me to meet him , maybe throw him a little business , " Shapiro , now 95 , told the local paper in Palm Beach the weekend after Madoff 's arrest .
He handed over a first cheque for $ 100,000 , " and he did very well with it .
That was the beginning . "
The pair became close .
Friends said Madoff was the son Shapiro never had .
And in the same way that a mutual acquaintance had introduced the two , Shapiro quickly became a cheerleader for Madoff 's investment talents .
In Boston , and later in Palm Beach , he steered friends and acquaintances into Madoff Investment Securities , a miracle - grow fund that seemed to nudge a percentage point or two higher most months .
Madoff never reported a down year .
Even when the stock market was plunging , he reported solid gains .
The strategy , Madoff would say vaguely , was to buy shares in blue - chip companies but take out derivatives to mitigate potential losses .
Any further inquiry would be met with a pained look , as if someone had asked for the secret formula for Coca - Cola .
Still , the returns tasted good , no one reported any problem cashing out , and Bernie had such respectable friends .
There was no reason to be suspicious , and every reason to be fearful that Madoff might turn down your investment , leaving you with the harsh choice of a volatile stock market or mundane interest from the bank .
In Palm Beach , second home to the East Coast 's rich , being in is all .
Being turned down was like social death .
Madoff hardly needed to solicit investors ; they clamoured introductions .
The Palm Beach Country Club was the centre of the financial earthquake .
The grand , stucco - walled building sits , secluded behind trimmed hedges , on the Atlantic coast , and members can range over the challenging , perfectly manicured 18 - hole golf course designed almost a century ago by Scotsman Donald Ross .
Perhaps a third of the club 's members had been ushered into the Ponzi scheme ... Perhaps a third of its members had been ushered into the scheme via Shapiro and his son - in - law Robert Jaffe .
Members ' losses probably come close to the billion dollar mark .
The Shapiros alone have lost $ 545 m .
The club is the height of exclusivity .
As well as the entry fee well into six figures , members are required to contribute to charity .
Set up in 1959 by wealthy Jews who had been excluded by the Anglo - Saxon cliques of other clubs , it remains mainly Jewish .
Madoff joined Shapiro with a membership in 1996 , making local acquaintances there and at the nearby Boca Rio golf club .
It was Jaffe who rang his father - in - law on the day Madoff 's arrest became news .
" Turn on CNN , " he said simply .
The revelation was " a knife in the heart , " Shapiro said .
Jaffe is a larger than life character .
Driving about in his vintage MG , he flaunted the wealth Madoff was bringing him .
" The clothing I wear is more cutting edge , " he told the Palm Beach Daily News when it profiled stylish residents .
" It 's a few years ahead of the pack .
Once you 've had filet mignon , you do n't want to go back . "
Jaffe set up a company for funnelling investors ' money to Madoff .
Cohmad Securities – now under investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general , who has subpoenaed Jaffe – proved to be a model for numerous others .
Another of Madoff 's blind accomplices was Ezra Merkin , one of the most prominent members of New York 's Jewish community , who has spent a charmed life at the intersection of finance and philanthropy .
His parents , Hermann and Ursula , had arrived in the US as refugees from Nazi Germany , made a fortune in shipping and on Wall Street , and bestowed millions on projects such as the Fifth Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan and Yeshiva University , where Merkin and Madoff would eventually serve as trustees .
" It is not easy to stay on the sidelines while others are busy getting rich , " Merkin once wrote – and he had no intention of doing so .
Through his hedge fund , Ascot Partners , he raised several billions of dollars of client money which he funnelled towards the extraordinary Madoff , on whose profits he came to rely .
Yeshiva University saw $ 112 m wiped out , having let Merkin run its endowment fund .
In all , $ 2.4bn of Merkin - related money has evaporated .
The 54 - year - old told his clients in a letter after Madoff 's arrest that he had invested substantially all their money with the fraudster , that he was " shocked " and that he himself had " suffered major losses from this catastrophe " .
Their immediate response was one not of sympathy for a family fortune and a personal reputation ruined , but one of fury .
What had he been doing to earn his multi-million dollar fees ?
Merkin now sits amid a blizzard of lawsuits from investors who say they believe he was managing the money himself , most prominently from New York University , which lost its $ 3 m investment in Ascot and which wants to stop him from liquidating what remains of the fund .
In the early days of the New Year , he resigned as chairman of General Motors ' car loans arm , GMAC .
The betrayal of Jewish charities and individuals by one of their own has brought a particular brand of condemnation .
It has also caused a shudder through the community because of the flecks of anti-Semitism that can be found in some public responses to the scandal .
You do n't have to read too far into an internet discussion on the subject to see the stereotype of the unscrupulous Jewish financier raised anew .
Ponzi schemes are notoriously concentrated within so - called " affinity groups " – but from the Italian community scammed by Charles Ponzi onwards , they have been scattered across a rainbow of ethnic communities .
And in any case , history 's greatest Ponzi scheme has sowed its destruction far beyond the Jewish communities of New York and Palm Beach .
The biggest single character in the cast list of blind accomplices is a native of Nashville , Tennessee .
Walter Noel is patriarch to one of the most famous – and photogenic – families in the world of hedge funds , and the biggest fish in Madoff 's poison pond .
His share of responsibility for the $ 50bn in losses : $ 7.5 bn .
His annual fee on the money his Fairfield Greenwich investment business was outsourcing to Madoff : at least $ 250 m a year .
The scandal has generated more column inches than the Noels ever managed before 11 December – and that was plenty .
With five tall , slender , socialite daughters , all of whom have married well - bred men now working in the family firm , the Noels were gossip page favourites for years .
" Glamazons " , Vanity Fair magazine described them in a fawning 2002 portrait : " The Noel sisters of Greenwich , Connecticut , are turning tabloid - fodder sister acts ( that is , Nicky and Paris Hilton ) on their heads .
In lieu of dancing on tables , the five Noel women have made a name for themselves by shoring up the virtues of a nearly extinct aristocracy .
They 're well educated and well - married , and they 're raising a pack of well - behaved multilingual children while keeping their string - bikini figures intact . "
In the testosterone - fuelled world of hedge funds , getting the Noel family Christmas card was a coveted joy .
At least until Christmas 2008 .
Noel , now 78 but looking a dozen years younger , had been funnelling ever - increasing sums to Madoff for 20 years .
The pair became richer and more successful as their businesses grew symbiotically .
It was the Noel family enterprise , more than any other , that brought Madoff mayhem to South America , the Middle East and Asia .
In Brazil , where Noel 's wife , Monica , hails from a wealthy family with Swiss roots , Fairfield employed Bianca Haegler , a niece , as its representative .
In Geneva , the private bank UBP marshalled its clients into Fairfield ; UBP 's London office is run by a family friend .
Meanwhile , one Noel son - in - law , Yanko Della Schiava , is based in Lugano , Switzerland , selling Fairfield Greenwich funds in southern Europe .
Philip Toub , whose wedding to Alix Noel in Mustique in 1997 made the society pages , marketed the group 's funds in Brazil and the Middle East .
A third , Andres Piedrahita , a Colombian - born banker , ran Fairfield 's UK operation and was the most successful fundraiser .
Since convincing his father to fund a trip around the world on a cruise ship to combine his university studies with making international contacts , he has lived in Palm Beach , New York , London and Madrid , and all the while keeping in touch with the rich of his native Colombia – where it seems some $ 200 m of local wealth has evaporated with Madoff .
With point - men across the world , and news of Madoff 's extraordinary investment performance spreading , wealthy individuals and supposedly sophisticated investment managers scrabbled for access .
Austria is reeling from the nationalisation of one of its fastest - growing banks , Vienna - based Bank Medici .
Its founder , a 60 - year - old called Sonja Kohn – famous for the giant red wig she wore to adhere to her orthodox Jewish faith – denied reports that she had gone into hiding fearing Russian mobsters who may have been among those hit by her $ 3bn of losses .
She said news of Madoff 's arrest hit her like a " tsunami " .
In the UK , Nicola Horlick , the fund manager dubbed Superwoman for her ability to juggle a career with raising children , saw shares in her latest fund venture plunge after it admitted putting almost 10 per cent of shareholders ' assets – about £ 10 m –with Madoff .
Horlick knew who was responsible for her losses : US regulators .
" I think now it is very difficult for people to invest in things that are meant to be regulated in America , because they have fallen down on the job , " she told the BBC .
It was a Frenchman who actually took responsibility squarely on his own shoulders .
On a dark Monday evening , 10 days after Madoff 's arrest , René - Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet told the cleaners at his Manhattan office that he wanted them done by 7 pm .
After they left , the 65 - year - old locked the door and returned to his desk .
There he swallowed sleeping pills and placed a wastepaper basket beneath his desk to catch blood , before slashing his wrists with a box cutter .
Staff found him the next morning , still sitting at his desk , the box cutter on the floor beside him .
He had lost $ 1.4bn of his own and his clients ' money , and the responsibility that he felt for their ruin eclipsed even the despair he felt over his own , according to friends and relatives .
One of the most prominent French financiers on Wall Street , a former head of Crédit Lyonnais Securities in the US , he was the scion of an aristocratic French family who would boast that 20 of his ancestors went to the guillotine .
His hedge fund , Access International Advisors , enlisted intermediaries with links to the cream of Europe 's high society and even royalty to garner clients , and those facing multi-million dollar losses included the continent 's richest woman , Liliane Bettencourt , the L'Oreal heiress .
But not everyone trusted Madoff .
Far from it .
Harry Markopolos , a skinny , slighty nerdy accountant , was the resident maths genius in the offices of Rampart , a Boston investment firm that specialised in trading options .
Rampart had heard of Madoff 's enviable record back in 1999 and wanted a piece of the action , so Markopolos was handed the task of replicating the stock - and - options trading strategy that Madoff had vaguely but consistently outlined for his investors .
Except , even the maths genius could n't do it ; there is no way to guarantee positive returns every month irrespective of what the stock market is doing .
Markopolos said there were only two conclusions .
Perhaps Madoff was inflating returns by using an illegal trick called " front running " , where the broker puts his own little bet on a share price first , knowing that his customers ' order is about to push the price higher .
More likely , as Markopolos wrote more than eight years before that confession last month , " Madoff Securities is the world 's largest Ponzi scheme . "
He passed his concerns via a contact at the local office of the SEC to the regulator 's New York office .
They said thanks , but nothing seemed to happen .
Over the next few years , Markopolos would act as " an army of one " , campaigning to unmask Madoff .
Markopolos voraciously gathered facts , figures , rumour and innuendo and continued to deluge the SEC with tip - offs .
In part , he hoped to win a reward ( under US law , whistleblowers receive a proportion of any fines paid by misbehaving companies , and Markopolos has since turned himself into a freelance investigator encouraging and advising whistleblowers ) .
Mainly , he just wanted to be proved right .
What Markopolos discovered during his campaign was that numerous market players were refusing to do business with Madoff because of the front - running rumours and other concerns .
Many looked at the way Madoff 's books were audited and shied away .
It used a one - person audit firm , Friehling & Horowitz , based in a 13 foot by 18 foot office in a suburb miles outside New York .
Saving pennies , Madoff would say , but the notion that this firm could audit a multi-billion dollar investment business struck many as ludicrous .
Several said that if Madoff was legit he would be running a formal hedge fund and pocketing the giant fees , rather than working only for trading commissions .
Others had reached a similar conclusion to Markopolos , that the hedging system Madoff claimed to be using to safeguard himself from losses was implausible .
It would require options trading on a scale that dwarfed anything going through the official exchanges .
A few were scared off by a 2001 article in the business magazine Barron 's , the one time that the industry 's scepticism was put into print , but Madoff was largely able to laugh it off .
Markopolos was astonished to discover that sophisticated investors could tell him in one breath that they believed Madoff 's returns were being faked , and then in the next that , hell , they were investing with him anyway .
Why did the SEC not put a stop to Madoff ?
Many believe the answer lies in the chumminess between Madoff and the regulators , whom Madoff himself advised .
In one of his last acts as chairman of the SEC , Christopher Cox – the hapless former Congressman – ordered an investigation into all the organisation 's dealings with Madoff , right down to the relationship between Madoff 's niece , Shana , and Eric Swanson .
Until 2006 , Swanson was an SEC attorney in charge of overseeing Stock Exchange regulation of electronic trading and his team had carried out one of the investigations into Madoff Investment Securities .
The pair started dating afterwards , his lawyers say .
Markopolos 's allegations became more shrill until , in 2005 , he got the full - on probe that he was seeking .
His 19 - page private submission to the SEC at that point is a masterclass in analysis , and it has been widely circulated on the internet since Madoff 's confession .
The title of his paper ?
" The world 's largest hedge fund is a fraud . "
Under this investigation , Madoff was finally forced to concede that his sideline in investment management had eclipsed the historic stockbroking business .
He had been trying to shield the scale of his business from public view , keeping up the appearance that clients were entering an exclusive club , trying to keep below the radar .
An angry SEC forced him to register formally as an adviser , and he declared client assets at that point of some $ 17bn .
However , the regulator did not issue the public censure that could have alerted more investors of Madoff 's shady behaviour , and never used the power of subpoena to recover the multiple sets of books kept under lock and key on the 17th floor .
They should have paid closer attention to one of the passages in Markopolos 's opus : " I 've found that wherever there is one cockroach in plain sight , many more are lurking behind the corner out of plain view . "
" If someone provides you with the wrong set of books , I do n't know how you find the real books , " Meaghan Cheung said , her eyes welling with tears when a reporter confronted her after the New Year .
Markopolos has singled out Cheung , a branch head of the SEC's New York enforcement division at the time of the 2005 investigation , as the person responsible for the regulator 's blunder .
His comments sparked a media hunt for the 37 - year - old mother of two , who quit the SEC last September .
" Why are you taking a mid -level staff person and making me responsible for the failure of the American economy ? " she said .
" I worked very hard for 10 years to make a career , and a reputation , and that has been destroyed in a month . "
By contrast , Markopolos 's reputation has gone into the stratosphere .
However , he is uncomfortable in the limelight , crying sick when Congress called him to testify at a hearing into Madoff .
He has received offers from Hollywood , which wants to turn his crusade into a movie .
So far , he has demurred .
" They 'll just add in sex and violence , " he told The Boston Globe .
" And why would people think I feel good about this ? "
Markopolos asked in a series of recent interviews .
" People think I 'm a hero , but I did n't stop him .
He stopped himself . "
The year 2008 will go down as one of the most brutal in investment history .
Even good investments were in trouble , because investors had to pull profits to cover losses elsewhere .
Madoff began to get more phone calls .
Sorry , Bernie , but I have to take money out .
The calls became a flood after the market carnage of September .
The money that clients were demanding had long since been handed out to other investors on their way out , and the credit crisis meant new money was no longer flooding through the door .
With a growing sense of panic , Madoff did what he had never before had to do : he began to solicit money .
Just before Thanksgiving , a pitch document was drawn up with details of a new fund , which he said he was raising from favoured clients , to take advantage of an oversold market .
Ken Langone , a prominent New York investor , got the full charm .
" You would n't think this guy had a trouble in the world , " Langone said , but he demurred .
He was turned off , he said later , by the " convoluted " monthly statements handed to investors and by the possibly illegal promise that investors in this new fund would be given preferential treatment over Madoff 's other clients .
With redemption requests from clients now totalling $ 7bn , and barely a few hundred million in the pot , Madoff returned , desperately , to where it had all began 48 years earlier with a cheque for $ 100,000 – to Carl Shapiro .
The men agreed an extraordinary final transaction , a payment to Madoff of $ 250 m .
It arrived around 1 December .
" Bernie seemed a little anxious this time , " recalled Ruth Shapiro , 91 , Carl 's wife of 69 years .
" He kept calling saying ' I did n't get it , it has n't come yet , are you sure you sent it ? ' "
The cheque would almost double the size of Shapiro 's investment with his long - time friend .
In all likelihood , he will never see any of it again .
The prosecutors will file formal charges .
Until then , the best account of those final days comes to us via the FBI 's Agent Cacioppi , as told to him by Andrew and Mark Madoff , who in turn say they are recounting what their father told them .
On Tuesday of that week , having decided the game was up , Madoff resolved to distribute what was left in the pot not to any of the clients demanding their money , but to employees in early bonuses .
He penned $ 173 m in cheques and placed them in a drawer .
The next day , his sons , suspicious of their father 's peculiar explanation – that the business had made a windfall on recent trading – demanded the truth .
Madoff buckled .
" I 'm not sure I 'll be able to hold it together , " he told them .
At the office , a few hours later , Madoff told them he had already confessed to his brother , Peter , that he was " finished " , that he had " absolutely nothing " , the business was " all just one big lie " and " basically a giant Ponzi scheme " which had been insolvent for years .
He planned to surrender to the authorities the following week , but only after distributing the remainder of the funds to selected employees , family and friends .
Andrew and Mark listened – but did not agree .
They called a friend for advice , Martin Flumenbaum , a lawyer , who called federal prosecutors and the SEC on their behalf .
Bernard and Ruth Madoff are still in the penthouse .
He is under house arrest , on a $ 10 m bail bond that his wife and brother struggled to afford .
He has yet to utter a word in public .
A note he sent round to other residents at 133 East 64th Street reads : " Dear neighbors .
Please accept my profound apologies for the terrible inconvenience that I have caused over the past weeks .
Ruth and I appreciate the support we have received . "
So , an apology only for the media scrum , not for his alleged crimes .
But , crucially for many victims , he has made no further apologies .
After the arrest , the Madoffs parcelled up Bernard 's watches , cufflinks and jewellery and mailed it to relatives and close friends .
Prosecutors became apoplectic ; the victims ' only hope is that Madoff 's possessions and personal fortune will help them claw back a little of what they have lost .
The trinkets have been returned , and must stay in the apartment under court diktat .
But is it possible to see the attempted gifts as a kind of apology , for jobs lost , fortunes dented or evaporated , and trust shattered , at least to a small handful of people ?
Does Bernie Madoff feel guilt ?
It could be years before the full story of Madoff 's fraud can be told , but its epilogue is being written .
He has become a potent symbol of a need to reform the way Wall Street behaves – and the way government watches Wall Street .
Madoff is " a massive fraud that was made possible , in part , because the regulators ... dropped the ball , " Barack Obama said last month .
" And if the crisis has taught us anything , it 's that this failure of oversight ... does n't just harm individuals .
It has the potential to devastate our entire economy . "
Wall Street will no longer be allowed to govern itself .
Even Alan Greenspan , high priest of laissez - faire , has said he was mistaken to believe investors could be trusted to rein in risky practices .
Now we see it even more clearly with Madoff : everyone seemed to be trusting to everyone else to do the due diligence that should have been their own responsibility , even the wise men and the superwomen .
A new era of harsher regulation is just around the corner .
Wall Street , it seems , simply cannot be trusted .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The retail industry 's leading trade group blamed a " deep recession , severe winter weather and five fewer shopping days " for a 2.8 % drop in 2008 holiday sales - a far worse outcome than the industry expected .
The National Retail Federation had originally forecast holiday sales for the combined November - December shopping months to grow 2.2 % , which would still have been the weakest pace of gain in at least six years .
As it was , it turned out to be the first - ever decline in the measure since the group initiated it in 1995 .
The two - month holiday period can account for as much as 50 % of retailers ' annual profits and sales .
" The current economic crisis proved to be more challenging than any had anticipated , " NRF Chief Economist Rosalind Wells said in a report .
" Consumers showed they were more than willing to wait out retailers this year causing increased pressure on prices . "
Also , the group said a shift in the calendar which resulted in five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2008 versus the previous year meant consumers had fewer days to do their gift shopping and merchants had fewer days to log additional sales .
The latest government report on December retail sales , also released on Wednesday , supported Wells ' point .
The Commerce Department report showed overall retail sales fell 2.8 % last month and declined 3.1 % excluding auto purchases , despite a last minute surge in holiday - related purchases in the week before Christmas .
December 's sales drop marked the sixth straight monthly sales decline in 2008 and the longest consecutive stretch of monthly declines in the measure in at least four decades .
What 's more , last year 's ugly holiday sales could force an unraveling of the retailing industry , forcing several chains to go out of business in 2009 .
Many retailers , including Circuit City , Linens 'n Things and Whitehall Jewelers already either filed for bankruptcy or liquidated last year .
That trend is expected to rapidly pick up pace in the weeks and months ahead .
The latest casualty - regional department store chain Gottchalks , which operates 58 stores in six Western states - filed for bankruptcy Wednesday .
But analysts warn that given the credit market freeze , it 's highly unlikely that any merchant who files for bankruptcy in this environment will come out alive .
Liechtenstein is a well - known tax haven
Liechtenstein is to ease its bank secrecy rules and swap information with foreign governments to help combat tax fraud and evasion .
The tiny principality will now adopt OECD standards on cross - border tax negotiations and offer bilateral tax deals on co-operation .
It had come under pressure to co-operate with other states ' investigations into tax evasion .
Liechtenstein has been on an OECD blacklist of tax havens .
" Our bank secrecy has always served to ensure the legitimate protection of the privacy of the citizen , which we will continue to retain , " said Prime Minister Otmar Hasler .
" With this declaration , however , we want to make clear that bank client confidentiality in future cannot be misused to facilitate tax crime , " he added .
Tax evasion
As the world economy deteriorates , European governments have been seeking help in the fight against tax evasion as they try to increase tax revenues .
Liechtenstein came under pressure to ease its tax laws last year when Germany bought data from a former bank employee and used it to open a tax evasion investigation .
In a deal signed in December , the principality agreed to grant US tax authorities access to information kept by its banks on Americans in certain cases of tax evasion .
The US - Liechtenstein deal will come into force in 2010 and will look at tax cases from 2009 onwards .
Liechtenstein's banks have 200bn Swiss francs ( £ 112bn ; $ 165 bn ) in assets , compared with Swiss banks ' assets of 4.5tn Swiss francs .
The crystals near the boundary would tend to be close to horizontal but as you get higher into the wind , their orientations are more dispersed , so the reflections would be more spread out form the vertical line .
Host Sean Daily talks with filmmaker Irena Salina , director of the documentary “ FLOW : How Did a Handful of Corporations Steal Our Water ? ” about the global water crisis and her experience making the film .

Sean Daily : Hi and welcome to GreenTalk , a podcast series from greenlivingideas.com .
GreenTalk helps listeners in their efforts to lead more eco-friendly lifestyles through interviews with top vendors , authors and experts from around the world .
We discuss the critical issues facing the global environment today , as well as the technologies , products and practices that you can employ to go greener in every area of your life .
Hey everybody , this is Sean Daily with GreenTalk Radio .
Most people donâ€™t think about where their water comes from .
They simply take it for granted that it will be available on demand coming out of the tap in plentiful supply .
However , recent books , films and international media coverage on water availability crises around the globe are bringing a greater awareness that perhaps we shouldnâ€™t be taking water for granted .
And in fact , that water , sometimes referred to as â€œblue goldâ€ is a precious resource on par with gold and oil , of which future military and economic crises are inevitable .
In addition , some water experts have pointed to the fact that large corporations , and in some cases , governments , are making backroom deals that may affect the cost and availability of water in the not so distant future .
Because of the essential nature of water to all life on the planet , this has brought water to the forefront of both the environmental and human rights movements .
One of the first feature length films to tackle this subject head on is a documentary called Flow : How did a Handful of Corporations Steal our Water ?
The film asks a basic but very important question : can anyone really own water ?
The film , the brainchild of director Irena Salina opened in September 2008 and has helped to bring a greater awareness to many about the seriousness of these issues and the risks to mankind and the environment if we donâ€™t take action now to curtail present - day activities by corporations and governments that may threaten basic water rights for a large percentage of the worldâ€™s population in the future .
Wired magazine referred to the documentary as â€ œthe scariest movie at the Sundance Film Festivalâ€ after its screening there in 2008 .
My guest on todayâ€™s show is Flowâ€™s director Irena Salina .
Irena started her career at the age of 15 as a radio journalist in Paris .
And Iâ€™ve gotten a chance to speak a little French with her before the interview .
Iâ€™ve been enjoying .
Her first feature length film , Ghost Bird : The Life and Art of Judith Dean , in 2000 won best documentary at the 15th Fort Lauderdale Film Festival .
And the Presidentâ€™s Award at Mexicoâ€™s prestigious … Iâ€™ll try this pronunciation … Ajijiac Film Festival .
So Irena , thank you so much for joining us today .
Irena Salina : Youâ€ ™re welcome .
I just want to add one thing .
The original title was Flow for Love of Water .
Sean Daily :
What happened to the original title ?
Irena Salina :
Well for the markets you have to …the distributor sort of changed it .
But we always liked the idea of including the word â€œlove.â€ 
Sean Daily : Itâ€™s funny .
Fear does sell better than love , unfortunately .
Irena Salina : I know .
I know .
Sean Daily :
Well , first of all congratulations to you on the success of the film .
And I am curious to know why did water become a cause for you in your own life and career as a filmmaker ?
And what originally inspired you to make this documentary ?
Irena Salina : Thatâ€™s a good question .
I have to rewind the film way back because as you know the film came out in festival , the first time in Sundance almost three years ago .
Then you have to rewind almost five years ago , which is almost seven years ago , when I wanted to do a documentary but documentaries are hard to make .
So I wanted to do something that really took my passion on .
At the time , I was a new mother and I had sort of from one ear to the other , heard a couple of stories .
One from Robert Jr. Kennedy , with River Keepers , famous environmental lawyer .
I had heard him on the radio talking about stories of company would come at night and dump on the Hudson River some heavy chemical water and get away with it .
And they were trying to clean the Hudson at the time .
And then I heard about how some chemicals in water would actually come back in our system , one way or another .
As minor doses but if you accumulate them .
And as a new mother , I was like , â€ œWhoa !
Whatâ€™s that ?â€ 
And slowly but surely I made more research and a friend of mine handed me a copy of The Nation , I think it was 2002 , if I recall .
And it said , â€ œWho owns water ?
Is water going to be the oil of the 21st century ? â€ 
That sort of blew my mind .
I never really thought about it like that , you know ?
I live in New York , where you just open my tap ; you sort of take it for granted .
So from there I really went into a journey .
I went to a lot of countries I had never been before .
I went to India .
I went to South Africa .
I looked at the situation here .
And what I really wanted to do is sort of say to people , â€ œLook .
Whether weâ€™re in Africa , whether weâ€™re in America , weâ€ ™re all in the same boat in some ways .
Weâ€ ™re all related to water .
We all need water to survive .
Water has no passport.â€ 
And then global warming started to come .
More and more awareness of it and itâ€™s very related to water as well .
Because when you look at example of water conversation in remote place , in Rajasthan for example , and they do an amazing work of water conservation .
But if the rain that is supposed to come on time , donâ€™t , then you can do all the conservation of water you can or want , if there is no water , there is no water .
So I started seeing how connected , in a way , we were whether we were far away or here .
Does that make sense ?
Sean Daily :
Yes it does .
Irena , Iâ€™m curious … No .
It absolutely does .
And Iâ€™m curious , based on that research and the travel that you did for the film and in general , what countries do you see being the flashpoints and frontlines in the future ?
Or even possibly now for issues around water availability ?
Irena Salina : I think all of us .
Have you looked at the paper recently ?
California going into a drought .
Itâ€™s no longer some place in Africa where they have no water and we donâ€™t really get a sense of it .
I think weâ€ ™re going to get more and more of a sense of it , unfortunately .
But I think we really … and I think when you go to place like Africa or India , I actually made another film for an NGO in India which I had to leave in those xxxx -torn areas in Rajasthan .
I actually had to every day to fetch my water and think of , â€ œWell , I need to boil this , I will need to clean myself .
â€ 
I was given an understanding and it was heavy and you have to bring it from the wells .
And that was such an opening to me because never did I have to think about that here .
I mean people would laugh if you had to tell them that they have to walk half a mile to get water .
But I think weâ€™ve seen it , itâ€™s been some heavy … if you look at the US drought monitor map of the drought thatâ€™s in the United States , you will see that more and more there are places people will be told please donâ€™t water your garden at just any time of the day .
Please conserve water .
I think we are going to become more and more aware of it .
Are we ready for that ?
I donâ€™t know because here we are used to have things served to us .
Weâ€ ™re not used to go and get them .
So thereâ€™s going to be an adjustment I think in general with our consciousness .
But I think this adjustment is not just water .
Iâ€™m totally amazed right now ; people are trying to reduce plastic .
And Iâ€™m totally amazed , when you go to the store , I live in Brooklyn but when I go to a local store youâ€™ll often hear people now say , â€ œNo , I donâ€™t need a bagâ€ .
Like theyâ€™re really making a point they donâ€™t want a plastic bag .
They carry a bag with them where they put their food .
And you ’re thinking to yourself , â€ œWow ! â€ 
Thatâ€™s a minor little thing but people are actually making a natural , individual effort into that so thereâ€™s less plastics .
Sean Daily : I see parallels here between AL Goreâ€™s An Inconvenient Truth and the strengthening of the environmental movement that sort of followed that around global warming .
And your film as well as the new film , Blue Gold World Water Wars .
Do you see an activism movement around water happening in the coming years , similar to what was inspired by An Inconvenient Truth ?
Irena Salina : I realized the power of An Inconvenient Truth when I was on a plane , I think either going to France or coming back from France .
And you know , those are long flights so you walk around and sometime you talk to people .
And there was this old couple ; they must have been in their seventies .
And I donâ€™t know how we started talking , it was years ago , about the Al Gore film .
And they were talking how they didnâ€™t know anything about that .
And they just really they understood so much and it scared them but at the same time , they were happy to know about it .
And I was like , â€ œWow ! â€ 
Because my daughter had told me about it .
They have shown it in her school .
So here goes a seventy - year old couple .
Here goes my daughter at the time was like seven .
And Iâ€™m like … it actually was a great tool to bring the awareness .
You know , I always say , first , because people say , â€ œSo .
What are you expecting ?
People to take action immediately ?â€ 
You know what ?
First , you plant the seed of awareness , you let it grow , then you let people pick at it .
You know ?
Things can not change overnight .
And I think the Al Gore film was a great awakening and I think other film , like I often say , sometime people are like , â€ œYou didnâ€™t talk about the population .â€ 
This is only one film .
If you knew I wanted a three - hour film but my distributor and my producer were not going to agree with that .
And my film and then you know , itâ€™s like a marathon .
Al Gore did the thing and he ran and he passed the wood on to someone .
And I did a film with as much money and time I had and then I passed on the wood .
And then the director Sam Bozzo of Blue Gold , did a film later and then heâ€™ll pass on the wood to someone .
You know what I mean ?
Itâ€™s like itâ€™s escalates .
It escalates .
And we need those films and we need those books and we need those television series to bring awareness .
Sean Daily :
Well , your film is certainly seminal in that regard .
Your film discusses Irena , among other things , the agendas and responsibilities with large corporations with regard to water rights and availability and this issue of how the privatization of water is a threat both to humans and the environment .
My question is , is this true ?
The sound bite ?
Are big corporations stealing our water from us while we sleep ?
Irena Salina :
Well , you know itâ€™s never as simple as that .
There was some case in the last six , seven years of privatization of water , mostly in third - world countries , where what happened is that the hook up to the water was maybe sometime a year of someone working of their salary .
So they couldnâ€™t hook up .
So what was the xxxx is saying , â€ œPrivatization is there and itâ€™s going to help us.â€ 
At the same time , a big company in France lost their contract because the water quality was not good .
The money you had to pay every month raised .
I mean , there are cases over and over .
And the idea is to be realistic .
You cannot say , â€ œOh .
There will be no company .â€ 
Because it takes a lot of money to clean water .
But you donâ€™t want to go into a situation where there is no ownership of water , no community - based water projects .
You donâ€™t want to come in a place where the distribution of water is all private , because itâ€™s usually not very transparent and you donâ€™t know … you want to be sort of in touch of whatâ€™s going on .
And there have been cases that has been documented where there was a lot of problems .
Now to say that there will be absolutely no private company handling the mass , the huge cities in the future , I think it will be unrealistic for me to say that wonâ€™t happen .
But at the same time , there is a message , for example , thatâ€™s given by Peter Gleick in the film when he says , â€ œthe World Bank knows how to give a billion dollars in one place and what we need is a thousand dollars in a billion places .â€ 
And that to me is a really true message because from the places
Iâ€™ve travelled , I have seen remote communities where they were examples of little solutions that work , coming to a be a solution that made much more sense than the idea that one day a buyer from a long distance was going to come and provide them water that they would pay for .
Sean Daily : Okay , well Irena , weâ€ ™re going to take a break right here .
And weâ€™ll be right back .
Iâ€™m talking with Irena Salina .
She is the director of Flow , a new film that discusses issues around water availability and crises around the world .
And asks a basic , but a very important question , can anyone really own water ?
Weâ€™ll be right back on Green Talk Radio .
Sean Daily :
Hey everyone .
Weâ€ ™re back on Green Talk Radio .
This is Sean Daily .
Iâ€™m talking with Irena Salina .
Sheâ€™s a director of a movie called Flow : How Did a Handful of Corporations Steal our Water ?
We were talking before the break , Irena , about the film and some of the issues around the world that deal with the water crisis and the privatization of water .
And I had some specific questions I wanted to ask you .
One of them is about something thatâ€™s become quite famous , or infamous depending on your perspective in the US , that relates to the T. Booneâ€™s Pickenâ€™s plan .
T. Boone Pickensâ€™ plan , I should say .
Pickens , of course , being the highly controversial Texas oilman whoâ€™s spending $ 12 billion on the worldâ€™s largest wind farm in the Texas Panhandle .
A lot of people have seen this as a big cover -up .
Critics of the plan basically are saying that the plan itself is essentially a ruse and is , in effect , a massive land and water grab .
Which a lot of people were puzzled by in the beginning , that was really seeking to put him in a position of controlling water and being in a position to profit from selling water at higher prices in the future .
Did you come across anything in your film research to qualify any of those assertions either way ?
Irena Salina : I want to be careful about what I say because that T. Boone Pickens piece we have in our film came actually from a news feed .
So I am reluctant to talk about someone whom I have not spent an hour speaking with personally , where I can feel their intention .
And I know now heâ€™s into wind power .
I think thatâ€™s what heâ€™s in right now .
But I donâ€™t … I mean , there are a lot of …him , I donâ€™t know but there are a lot of speculation right now with water .
Because , but think about it .
Think about big agro - business farms ; they need a lot of water .
Think of industry .
Think of the pig industry ; they need a lot of water .
I mean , almost everything .
Computers need water , tires need water , to make oil you need water .
So obviously there is , I am sure , out there a lot of big interests in making sure that their company or their big industry have enough water to provide , to produce those products that they want to put out there .
I also think that weâ€ ™re going to , because unfortunately of drought and other things , weâ€ ™re really going to have to re-think our ways .
Weâ€ ™re going to have to re-think of , for example , just to give you an example , if you are going to spend a certain huge amount of water to provide to food that will actually never make it here , itâ€™s just for export , if we are going in a situation where weâ€ ™re running out of water thereâ€™s definitely going to be some struggle there of , â€ œWell , Iâ€™m American .
I want my water for the food that Iâ€™m going to buy here and to drink , so why is all this water being somehow used for something that is going to be exported ? â€ 
Iâ€™m just blabbering about but I really feel like thereâ€™s going to be a re-think of the usage of water .
And therefore , any big company that might want to use too much water for something …
I know that some of those big farms , not only the amount of water that they use but the chemicals that is then going back in the land and then going in our rivers and streams is really not good .
And I just think there is a cycle .
Again , we could talk about big companies and this and that but I think itâ€™s really … the general thing , I think is there is a cycle and weâ€™ve sort of , because weâ€™ve said thereâ€™s a hard path and then thereâ€™s a soft path .
The hard path is the 21st century where we [ xxx just realized dams , big ] projects and I think somehow weâ€ ™re going to have to balance that because weâ€™re going to deal with … and also , you have to remember that , I donâ€™t know the exact number , but 40 % of rivers and streams , like in the United States , are too polluted to fish , swim or drink .
So you also have the pollution problem .
Itâ€™s like how are you going to xxxxx all that pollution .
And then like we talk about in the film , you have both pesticide and herbicide that are very strong and theyâ€™re coming back in the system .
Like atrazine for example .
Atrazine is an herbicide that is banned for , I donâ€™t know , 15 years in Europe because they found out that normally it takes forever …even though they ban it , thereâ€™s still traces of it .
And there are biologists that saw that it was …I donâ€™t know the word in English , but changing the course of reproduction in frogs and things like that .
Sean Daily : Because of genetic mutations ?
Irena Salina :
Yes exactly .
So we look at frogs but then maybe , sure we can prove it now but what about humans ?
But in any case , itâ€™s been banned in Europe .
Itâ€™s not banned here .
Sean Daily :
It takes us some time to catch up here sometimes in the United States with these things where we can be a little slow .
Irena Salina : Itâ€™s a product made in Switzerland , sold in the United States but banned in Europe .
I think in the world we live in now , where we are now , how come a product like that could be sold when itâ€™s banned in all of Europe .
Thatâ€™s like the fundamental thing that I think a few years ago drove me crazy .
As a mother and as a human being .
Wait a minute .
If we know something is not good , why are we putting it somewhere , you know ?
And thereâ€™s this very strange connection , I would say , with farms around the world that have used heavy pesticide and herbicide and decline of sperm count .
Of people being able to have children .
So yes , yes .
We cannot prove it but we want to get to the place where …
I think itâ€™s a fundamental question that talking about regulation usage of water , itâ€™s I think , a fundamental question we need to ask ourselves .
Sean Daily :
And itâ€™s interesting too because I think some free market economists would argue that privatization is better because thatâ€™s the solution to everything .
That private is always better â€ “
Irena Salina :
But thereâ€™s never one solution for everything .
Sean Daily : I agree .
I was going to point out the conundrum that the other faction of folks are those that only trust the government to handle things properly .
Irena Salina :
Well , but thatâ€™s a huge problem .
Is everybody relying on someone else .
And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m saying that somehow , everybody is going to have to get involved .
Why did arsenic , for example , in the United States was at too high of a level and it could have gone like that for a while .
Why did it get stopped ?
Why ?
Because citizens and pregnant mothers and people fought and went door - to - door and started bringing awareness .
And they had to regulate it .
But thatâ€™s the problem .
I hope the new government that weâ€™ve not going to be in a situation where that … but itâ€™s still , we are part of the change .
We canâ€™t just sit home and expect always someone to make the change .
Sean Daily :
Well , that begs the question and , at the risk of sounding somewhat cynical here to follow up on what you just said , one of the things that Iâ€™ve found about these types of global situations in the past , is that by the time youâ€ ™re hearing about them in the mainstream media , a large portion of the damage tends to be already done .
So my question is , in your estimation are we already in deep trouble with regards to water rights ?
And have governments and corporations already been acting behind our backs to determine â€ “
Irena Salina : Itâ€™s not just water rights .
Itâ€™s a lot of other things .
Again , Iâ€™m not an expert but I will again mention Peter Gleick who says the situation now with water is not so good .
But in xxxx .
Iâ€™m talking just in general , is not so good .
But thereâ€™s still hope that , if in the next five years we change our ways of handling with water , if we work with our watershed , if we work with our environment , you know , thereâ€™s a balance .
Then there is hope , you know .
Itâ€™s not just about corporations .
Thatâ€™s the thing .
Itâ€™s not just … itâ €™s a whole thing .
And I think there are good people out there .
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s all dark .
I mean , obviously in the film , there is a definite pointing at things because you need to wake up people .
But I think , in general , there is hope but it really depends how we go from now .
How we get water .
How we regulate it .
How we not build something when we know that this is a recharged area .
We have to think of these things .
We just canâ€™t go on if we know itâ€™s a recharge area for watershed or rivers .
We can not go on polluting .
And just like now thereâ€™s a big thing with bottled water .
A couple of years ago , no one even paid attention .
They just kept on buying bottled water , plastic , boom .
Some gets recycled , most of them donâ€™t , weâ€ ™re creating huge plastic in the sea , the fish are eating it .
And now all of a sudden thereâ€™s a huge awareness around .
You have the Minister of the Environment in London wants to ban bottled water .
You have a lot of places here , that in public place , they want to reintroduce fountain .
Weâ€ ™re re-learning .
We got caught up in this sort of non -stop buying , this , that and I think weâ€ ™re re-learning .
Sean Daily :
These are definitely important issues .
And what do you think are the most important steps that peoples of various countries around the world need to be doing now to , both in terms of , you mentioned the environmental impact of things like bottled water , but what just in terms of securing basic water rights for the future ?
What do we need to be doing as a world population to ensure a better future ?
Irena Salina : Thatâ€™s a question for an expert on water .
I can only tell you as a person â€ “
Sean Daily :
Well , people need to watch the film â€ “
Irena Salina :
Think about one issue that applies to China does not obligatory apply to India .
One issue that applies to India doesnâ€™t obligatory apply to the United States and might not apply to South Africa .
You know what I mean ?
Itâ€™s all different , itâ€™s different terrain .
The one thing that connects us all is global warming .
Thatâ€™s for sure .
That has no passport .
That is everywhere .
If we donâ€™t make effort right away , thatâ€™s a huge issue .
But in terms of how do we ensure that such and such country ?
That all depends .
I just came back from India and thereâ€™s a man in our film called Rajan xxxxx whoâ€™s kind of the water Gandhi of India .
And basically , what he did is he restored the spirit of water conservation and rainwater harvesting in xxxx area of India .
Regions where people have totally left .
The young men left , only the old men and the women live there .
Girls were not going to school due to that .
And then slowly with the community effort , they either built or rebuilt some rainwater water harvesting .
And all of sudden , the monsoons came , the big rain , and the wells were being refilled and the fields , and the mustard fields were growing , and the whole life there was working again and the young men came back .
Okay ?
So right now , for example against all odds , is trying to bring the awareness how important the Yamuna River and the Ganga River are .
They feed a lot of the water in some states .
But itâ€™s highly political .
Itâ€™s so pure from its source in the Malaya but by the time it gets to Delhi and other places itâ€™s been so polluted and raped .
I remember a year ago , I helped him a little bit and I was thinking to myself , â€ œ Oh my God .
Where is he going with that ?â€ 
There were a few politicians , a few activists in Delhi but he didnâ€™t get the voice .
But now , two years later , the ministers are listening to him .
They stopped dams in the Malaya that is injuring the rivers .
So there is hope .
Thatâ€™s one case Iâ€™m giving you .
There is complete hope .
And yes , myself , I was looking at Rajan xxxx and going â€ œWhere is he going with this one ?
He should stay in Rajasthan and concentrate on the rain harvesting .â€ 
You know ?
But I just learned a few weeks ago that he was sitting with some minister to stop some big project that they felt would injure the river and the environment , which was unheard of .
Thereâ€™s huge money involved in those projects .
But how I can talk because Iâ€™m not particularly educated more than some other experts .
I can only talk on a personal matter .
And I think awareness on a personal matter is very important .
At home , I donâ€™t clean my dishes with the same that I used ten years ago .
I donâ€™t buy bottled water anymore .
I try to be aware of those things .
But if you want to make it global I can talk about in terms of certainly have to change our ways but in terms of globalism , I think one of the steps is really pay attention to global warming .
Every effort that weâ€ ™re going to make , every effort will be stopped , if we donâ€™t handle that .
Because where does the water come from ?
Because we need rain .
Sean Daily : Irena , thereâ€™s another film that is coming out soon , or actually has been released , and that is making its way across the country sort of on the heels of your film .
And thatâ€™s called Blue Gold : World Water Wars , basically a â € “
Irena Salina : Yes .
Iâ€™m aware of it because of the book .
Sean Daily :
And I was curious , if perhaps , it addresses many of the same issues and goes into some different areas .
And in fact , Sam Bozzo , the director of that film , is scheduled to appear on this program in the next few weeks .
Iâ€™m just curious , have you met Sam or had the chance to discuss your respective film making experiences on covering water ?
Irena Salina : I have not met Sam .
I have through emails , spoken to him .
At one point , he was wondering if we could distribute our films at the same time .
But my distributor kind of said …
You know how distributors … you canâ€™t distribute two films on water at the same time .
But I heard about his project because I remember he started five , four years after ours or something .
I knew it from Maud .
Maud would tell me a little bit about it .
But I heard itâ€™s great though .
Sean Daily :
Well we will certainly find out .
I have our reviewer copy is coming and weâ€™re certainly going to put it …
Thereâ€™s actually a post up on our website there has a trailer both for your film as well as for the Blue Gold film .
So we encourage people to go to Bluethethingideas.com to check that out .
The film is Flow .
The director is Irena Salina whoâ€™s been my guest today .
The website is flowthefilm.com .
Irena , thank you so much for being with us today on the program .
Irena Salina : Youâ€ ™re more than welcome .
Thank you Sean .

Advertisement Western powers have expressed serious concerns after Iran launched its first domestically - made satellite into orbit .
Iran says the satellite , carried on a Safir - 2 rocket , is meant for research and telecommunications purposes and insists its intentions are peaceful .
But the US , UK and France have voiced concerns that the technology used could lead to ballistic missile development .
The move comes a day before officials from six world powers meet to discuss a row over Iran 's nuclear activities .
Iran is subject to United Nations sanctions because some Western powers think it is trying to build a nuclear bomb .
Iran has an opportunity to step up and become a productive member of the international community
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Tehran denies that claim and says its nuclear ambitions are limited to the production of energy .
The group of six - comprising the US , Russia , China , UK , France and Germany - has offered Iran a package of incentives if it suspends uranium enrichment and enters into talks on its nuclear programme .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking after meeting UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband , said the US representative at the talks in Frankfurt would continue to discuss the approach to take towards Iran .
" It is clear that ...
Iran has an opportunity to step up and become a productive member of the international community , " she said .
" As President Obama said , we are reaching out a hand [ to Iran ] but the fist has to unclench . "
' Great concern ' President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Monday night 's launch of the Omid ( Hope ) satellite had been successful and that with it Iran had " officially achieved a presence in space " .
IRAN SPACE AMBITIONS Feb 2009 : Iran declares launch of first home - built satellite into orbit Aug 2008 : Iran launches rocket ' capable of carrying satellite ' Feb 2008 : Iran launches research rocket as part of satellite launch preparations , Tehran says Feb 2007 : Iran says it launches rocket capable of reaching space , which makes parachute - assisted descent to Earth Oct 2005 : Russian rocket launches Iran 's first satellite , Sina -

Iran 's slow but sure missile advance
The event appeared to be timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Iranian revolution .
Reacting to the launch , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said : " This action does not convince us that Iran is acting responsibly to advance stability or security in the region . "
US state department official Robert Wood said Iran 's activities could " possibly lead to the development of ballistic missiles " and were of " great concern " .
French foreign ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier said France was " very concerned " about the launch .
" We can't help but link this to the very serious concerns about the development of military nuclear capability , " he said .
UK Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell said the launch underlined the UK's " serious concerns about Iran 's intentions " .
" There are dual applications for satellite launching technology in Iran 's ballistic missile programme , " he said in a statement .
" As a result , we think this sends the wrong signal to the international community , which has already passed five successive UN Security Council resolutions on Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programme . "
Iran says its satellite will be used for research and telecommunications Speaking after the launch , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki stressed the satellite project was " for purely peaceful purposes and to meet the needs of the country " .
Iran has now joined a small group of about a dozen nations that have developed the capability to put a satellite into orbit .
Of greater concern to the US and and allies though will be what it says about Iran 's developing missile capability , our correspondent says , because there is little intrinsic difference between a rudimentary space - launcher and a long - range ballistic missile .
It is just such a potential threat that the US missile defence system in central Europe is intended to defend against , he says , and Iran 's move adds an additional level of complication as US President Barack Obama seeks to open a new path of dialogue with Tehran .
John Pike , an expert at the US - based think - tank GlobalSecurity.org , confirmed to the BBC that the launch had been a success and the satellite was now established in a low Earth orbit .
Space centre Last August , Iran said it had successfully launched a rocket capable of carrying its first domestically built satellite , having in February launched a low - orbit research rocket as part of preparations for the satellite launch .
That launch marked the inauguration of a new space centre , at an unidentified desert location , which included an underground control station and satellite launch pad .
The White House called the 2008 launch " unfortunate " , warning it would further isolate Iran from the global community .
In February 2007 , Iran said it had launched a rocket capable of reaching space - before it made a parachute - assisted descent to Earth .

Produced by Kelly JustWith gold trading around $ 1,000 an ounce these days , are you looking into your jewelry box wondering if you see some fast cash - maybe even a lot of cash ?
You have probably watched and listened to the ads promising big bucks for gold you do n't want or even use .
Before you turn over your treasures , KSL 5 Investigative Reporter Debbie Dujanovic goes undercover and puts those claims to the test .
The ads make it all sound both foolproof and profitable .
Take the high price of gold , add a little bit of effort and reap a huge return .
But can you really transform your jewelry box into a cash register ?
The testimonials certainly make it seem so .
One GoldKit.com customer exclaimed , " Who knew it was this easy ? "
" I sold my gold jewelry and took the vacation of a lifetime , " said a Cash4 Gold user .
A woman who did business with Goldpaq said , " I received $ 173 . "
So we decided to raid our own jewelry boxes and purchase a few pieces we could use to test the offers .
We also enlist an expert , jewelry designer Dana Richardson , to examine , test and weigh our loot .
Using the current price of gold , Richardson gives us an approximate scrap value for each piece .
She suggests $ 13.86 for a 10 - karat gold heart pendant ; $ 23.89 for a 14 - karat gold ring .
Dana Richardson , jewelry designer
When it comes to cashing in your gold , Richardson said , " For something broken that you 're never going to use again , why not ? "
Next , we pick four companies to test .
One is right here in Utah .
The other three are national companies we found on the Internet .
In each case , the online companies immediately responded to our inquiries .
One sent a delivery man to our door to pick up the jewelry .
The other two sent prepaid envelopes for us to fill and put back in the mail .
We divided up our gold and silver , and waited anywhere from one to 10 days for our payouts .
First up - our experience with Cash4Gold .
Our expert had figured this shipment was worth roughly $ 60 .
Cash4 Gold offered us $ 9.58 .
In a written response , Cash4 Gold did not address the price difference .
Instead , the company said , " We stand by our 100 percent customer service guarantee and have successfully complete transactions for more than 700,000 customers . "
Next - our dealings with Goldpaq .
Our expert valued these items at around $ 32 .
Our check arrived , made out for $ 2.12 .
By phone , Goldpaq told us they 're the middleman and only pay a small percentage of market value .
A statement from the company president said , " More than 95 percent of our customers are having their monetary needs satisfied at the time they sent their items to us , because our return check rate is less than 5 percent . "
Then , it 's Empire Gold .
Our expert put the estimated value of this shipment in the neighborhood of $ 30 .
The company offered us zero .
Empire Gold said we had screwed up by not understanding the payment chart on the company Web site means it will not accept less than an ounce of gold .
Empire Gold said it was not put out by the mix - up , but we had to wait three hours for the delivery man to show up .
So far , the offers from the online companies total a not - so glitzy $ 11.70 .
But it 's not all bad news .
There 's our visit to the local company we mentioned earlier , Cascade Refining .
We used a hidden camera to make sure the Salt Lake City business treated us like any other customer .
The offer we got this time for our gold and silver : $ 162.40 .
That 's $ 40 more than our expert said it was worth .
We went back to Cascade Refining and gave the news to the Vice President of Production Craig N. Wright II .
" Awesome , " said Wright .
" 162 ? " he questioned .
" Forty dollars more ? "
Some possible reasons for the bigger payout include the fluctuation price of gold .
Also , Cascade melts the metal on site .
There is no middleman .
" We can assess exact purity of each piece , and then we 're able to refine it directly , " explained Wright .
" That allows us to pay more . "
What did our expert take away from our experience ?
It appears the best use of your time is to visit a local refinery where you can get an immediate estimate .
If you do n't like the number you hear , you simply keep your jewelry .
If you do like the offer , you go home with a check .
This is just one of the things we learned about the process .

You have a great idea for an invention that is practically guaranteed to be a big moneymaker .
Even if it does not live up to the various advertising claims you would make about it , it will sell well and earn you a fortune .
In fact , no amount of scientific proof that your invention does not do what you will claim it does is going to hurt your sales .
Sounds pretty good , does n't it ?
There is just one small problem .
You see , you know that your invention does not work .
So you could n't ethically market it as doing something that you knew it could n't do , right ?
Not so fast !
Things are not quite as simple as I 've made them sound .
Your customers are absolutely convinced that the device works , and no amount of evidence to the contrary is going to dissuade them .
I want you to imagine that the invention I described above is a prayer amplifier .
And now we 'll consider the ethical implications of selling such a product .
At first glance , it would be morally wrong for me to sell a prayer amplifier .
It does not work , and I know it does not work .
Selling it anyway would be dishonest and exploitative .
But what is it about my selling such a product that bothers us the most - that the device does not work or that I know that the device does not work ?
If we are mostly bothered by the fact that the device does not work , regardless of what I think about the device , then we are dealing with a " truth in advertising " issue .
We are saying that it is morally wrong to sell a product that objectively does not perform the claimed function regardless of what those selling it believe about the product .
By this line of argument , we would have to conclude that the entire nutritional supplement and vitamin industry is morally wrong .
Are we prepared to make such a concession ?
If so , what other industries would we eliminate ?
Suppose instead that what bothers us about this scenario centers on my knowledge that the device does not perform as advertised .
Would it make sense to grant me a reprieve if I actually believed in the defective product ?
If I was convinced that it worked even if the evidence said that it did not , would this absolve me of my responsibility for selling the product ?
That seems like an odd argument to make , does n't it ?
Here 's the thing , whether the prayer amplifier works or whether I think it works are both irrelevant .
What really matters is whether prayer works .
I think that the moral queasiness most of you are feeling at this point has nothing to do with the prayer amplifier and everything to do with me trying to make a buck off of prayer , something we all know does not work .
Suppose I build a prayer amplifier which I claim " helps ( my preferred ) god hear your prayers . "
Further , suppose that I run infomercials on cable in which I explain that the love of my " god " cannot be scientifically measured and that those trying to discredit my device are merely jealous .
We all know I 'm full of shit , and I think that this is what bothers us far more than what my device does or whether I am deluding myself .
Would this mean that we would regard the entire industry of Christian merchandise to be morally wrong ?
Do the millions of devoted Christians who will buy my device not bear some responsibility here ?
After all , who can say for sure that none may be helped by using it ?
The placebo effect is a powerful thing , and if it makes them feel better ...
Here is the question for you to consider :
If you believe that it is morally wrong for someone to sell a prayer amplifier , what exactly makes it wrong ?

City authorities say they are fighting the problem with vigour
The US capital is suffering an epidemic of HIV / Aids worse than some African nations , with 3 % of over - 12s infected , the city 's department of health says .
Its report suggests the hardest - hit sections of the population are black men , and people aged between 40 and 49 .
The infection rate puts Washington DC on a par with Uganda .
But one factor may be a drive towards more HIV / Aids testing , and the city government insists much is now being done to tackle the problem .
According to the report , both the United Nations and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) have " historically defined an HIV epidemic as generalised and severe when the overall percentage of disease among residents of a specific geographic area exceeds 1 % .

More from BBC World Service
The overall proportion in the District is three times higher , " the report says .
By comparison , less than half of 1 % of Americans are living with cancer .
Even the 3 % figure , the report says , is certain to be an underestimate , as so many of Washington 's residents are unaware that they are infected .
" In the District , nearly every population group and age is experiencing a substantial epidemic , " the report says , with the greatest rates of infection among black men ( 6.5 % ) , Hispanic men ( 3.0 % ) , and white men ( 2.6 % ) .
In terms of age , those aged 40 - 49 are the worst affected ( 7.2 % ) , followed by those aged 50 - 59 ( 5.2 % ) .
The main mode of transmission is men having sex with men , followed by heterosexual sex and infection through drug use .
' Actually 5 % '
The chief medical officer at the Whitman - Walker clinic , one of Washington 's biggest HIV organisations , told the BBC that the real figure could be even higher .
" When they 've tested large groups of the District population it looks like the prevalence is actually about 5 % , which is higher than the 3 % but a lot of the people have n't been tested yet , " said Dr Raymond Martins .
" I think we 're seeing the increase recently because the new director of our HIV / Aids administration here in Washington has put a large push for everyone to get tested and so with that testing you 're discovering all these people that are HIV - positive that did n't realise they were . "
The report says the city 's Mayor Adrian Fenty and the department are following a three - pronged strategy to tackle the epidemic , by promoting testing for the virus , preventing transmission by providing free condoms and needle exchanges , and doing more for those already living with HIV / Aids .

LA PAZ ( Reuters ) -
Two weeks after he accused the CIA of conspiring against his energy policies , leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales expelled a U.S. Embassy official on Tuesday .
“ Today , I ’ve decided to declare Francisco Martinez ... who works for the United States embassy , persona non-grata , ” Morales , a fierce critic of the United States , said at a press conference in La Paz .
The president said he needed to expel Martinez “ to put an end to a foreign conspiracy . ”
Morales , who often calls the United States “ the empire , ” previously ejected the U.S. ambassador and U.S. anti-narcotics officials from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
A spokesman at the embassy said Martinez was a mid-level official at the diplomatic mission , and that his title was second secretary .
The embassy made no other comment .
Last month , Morales accused Washington of plotting against the state - run energy company , YPFB , a claim the U.S. government dismissed .
Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador from Bolivia last year , charging he was conspiring , accusations that the United States called “ false ” and “ absurd . ”
Earlier this year , Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa expelled a U.S. Embassy official that he said was the director of the CIA in Ecuador .
Correa is a close ally of Morales , as is Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who expelled the U.S. ambassador to his country last year .
All three of the leftist leaders have said the U.S. meddles in their domestic politics .
It ’s hard to be a Billionaire for Bush when there is no Bush .
The group might have recast itself as Billionaires for Obama .
But that would have required “ irony we can believe in , ” said Andrew Boyd , who sometimes goes by his Billionaire name , Phil T. Rich .
“ Here ’s the conundrum , ” Mr. Boyd said .
“ Can you point out that the emperor has no clothes when you like the emperor  and his clothes ? ”
We told you this was a crisis .
Not that it ’s entirely new .
Satirists have struggled with the ascension of Barack Obama for a while now .
Clearly , some white comedians are pulling their punches out of fear of being accused of racial insensitivity ( though racial equality should mean that a black president may be skewered as thoroughly as a white one ) .
Race aside , many comics feel that any new president deserves to be cut some slack .
As an added inhibitor , some have said , this president is simply not his predecessor .
“ He ’s difficult to satirize , ” Mr. Boyd said .
“ He ’s very self - aware .
He calls himself out on stuff .
He ’s able to leaven his own heaviness . ”
Self - awareness , Mr. Boyd said , was not a conspicuous trait of the previous president .
It should be noted that the Billionaires are not exactly equal opportunity offenders .
Their politics fall squarely left of center .
But unlike many activists , left or right , their weapon of choice is a rapier rather than a sledgehammer .
In their reverse world , Vice President Dick Cheney was unfairly attacked and Halliburton wrongly maligned .

More Aging Americans Leaving US
There are now a record 47 million Americans without health insurance , while the percentage of children without insurance rose for a second consecutive year , according to newly released US Census Bureau data .
Medical tourism , in order to obtain affordable health care , is beginning to be a necessary option for some as US citizens go to Cuba for medical procedures , Canada and Mexico for medicine and to Mexico for elder care .
More Aging Americans Leaving US
As the economy crashes in on many older Americans and their savings , more and more are looking to Mexico for the solution to their assisted living needs .
With 75 million baby boomers heading toward retirement and the cost of private nursing care in the US greatly outstripping retirement funds , Mexican developers say they have an irresistible product in the works : active senior and assisted living facilities in a warm climate full of friendly people for as little as $ 1,100 USD a month .
The monthly charge also includes food , housekeeping and personal assistance .
In the US , such facilities usually cost from 3-5,000 USD per month .
The drug cartel violence that gets so much corporate media coverage rarely touches civilians .
Mexico is as safe as or safer than the US .
Many Americans will come perhaps not because they want to , but out of necessity and will find Mexico far more modern and far safer than they had imagined .
One retiree in Mexico reported that he has satellite television in his facility , so he does n't miss any American news or programs .
When he wants to see a movie or go shopping downtown , the taxi ride is only $ 2 - $ 3 to Guadalajara , a culturally rich city of 4 million people , just 30 miles away
There are up to 50 Mexican cities and towns that are ideal for assisted living facilities aimed at the US and Canadian markets and the timing for the development of these facilities is just right as the baby boomer generation is entering retirement age .
One thing that operators of the new facilities call a major selling point is not just the price , but the Mexican - style care that comes with a society used to caring for their parents and grandparents throughout their lives .
One problem , according to some health care lobbyists , is a lack of regulations .
The private assisted living and nursing industry is so new in Mexico – there are about a half dozen facilities under construction – that laws need to be written to cover their activities .
However , the Mexican Association of Retirement Communities is lobbying for legislation similar to that in the US .
Mexico has a national health care system ( which Americans can buy into for only $ 350 a year ) along with many private hospitals and clinics with US trained doctors .
Average life expectancy for Mexicans is 75 years , just three less than in the US , according to the retirement organization AARP ( American Association of Retired Persons ) .
Since most Mexicans take care of their parents until death , there has not been much of a nursing home industry at all , except for those run by charities or the government .
It is shameful that in the US many have no health care at all and cannot afford assisted living services .
Taxpayer money is a shame to waste on wars and other foreign adventures .
The society has also not progressed to the point where Americans take care of their aging parents .

PRAVDA .
Ru
( CNN ) -- Dr. J. Stephen Jones had seven vasectomies to perform in a day .
Some urologists around the country are reporting increased numbers of patients coming in for vasectomies .
The schedule for Jones , a Cleveland , Ohio , urologist , has become more crowded during a recent boom in vasectomies .
" My staff came to me and said , what 's happening ? " said Jones , the chairman of the Department of Regional Urology of Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic .
" Why are we suddenly having an explosion in guys asking for vasectomies ? "
They looked at their statistics and realized the uptick started around November as the economic crisis deepened .
October went down in the history books as one of Wall Street 's worst months .
Since then , the Cleveland Clinic has seen a 50 percent increase in vasectomies , an outpatient surgery that is the cheapest form of permanent birth control .
Vasectomies are less invasive and cheaper than tubal ligation , which involves blocking , tying or cutting a woman 's fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy .
" It 's unlikely that some guy read the Dow Jones numbers that day and said , ' Why do n't we have a vasectomy ? ' " Jones said .
" More likely , people have already been considering it and typically a guy and his wife have spoken a year or two about this . "
Jones was told by patients that they were getting vasectomies because they were losing their jobs and health insurance , or concerned about being out of work soon .
" They realize they do n't have the financial security long - term with what 's going on , " Jones said .
" Several of them have mentioned , ' We can't afford to have any more children in this economy . '
My perception is that it's more of the concept of raising children in an uncertain economic future . "
Much like Jones , Dr. Marc Goldstein , surgeon - in - chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine in New York , saw a 48 percent increase in vasectomy consultations compared with the same time last year .
" I have never seen anything like this , " said Goldstein , a urologist for the last 30 years .
" When things started to go south in the stock market , then the vasectomy consults went north . "
Half of Goldstein's New York patients work in the financial sector .
New patients filed into his office in November .
" I think the situation of finance and the economy is the major reason , " Goldstein said .
" Some of them have mentioned that , ' It cost $ 30,000 a year to put my kids in private school and I can't afford to have another one . '
It 's never the sole reason , but it 's certainly a contributing factor . "
During the vasectomy , the doctor cuts the two vas deferens , which are the tubes carrying sperm from the testicles to become semen .
After the procedure , men can still have sex , but their semen does not contain sperm and therefore they can no longer father children .
Doctors can attempt to reverse the procedure , but vasectomy reversals are expensive and only work half the time in restoring sperm flow .
Carl Haub , a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau , a private research firm , said the National Center for Health Statistics ' data showed that , " During bad economic times , the Depression and the recession in the 1970s , the birth rate did go down . "
See the chart on fertility rates in the United States from 1917 to 2007 »
" Some folks will postpone having kids , " he said .
" If you had a vasectomy , you 've made a bigger decision that you 're never going to have another child . "
When people stop having children , it implies a loss of confidence in their future employment prospects .
" Am I going to have a job in six months or a year from now ? "
Haub said .
" If I 'm concerned about that , people are not going to increase their financial obligations ...
It 's naïve to say the economy did n't play a significant role in lowering the birth rate . "
It 's too early to tell whether this recession has crimped the birth rate , Haub said .
At this point , most of the evidence of increased vasectomies has been anecdotal from practicing urologists , because there is no national registry for sterilizations .
The number of appointment requests spiked 30 percent in January 2009 on the Web site vasectomy.com , which links people with local urologists .
But throughout the last few months , appointment requests have been fairly level , said Dr. Ted Benderev , founder of the site .
Dr. Lawrence Ross , a professor of urology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former president of the American Urological Association , said the school 's clinics have seen moderate increases in the last six months to a year and that vasectomies are growing popular among lower - income clients .
" My guess is that since economic times have worsened , people are concerned about their ability to raise larger families and are opting for more permanent birth control , " Ross said .
People who are concerned about losing their health insurance are trying to take advantage of the coverage for a procedure they 've long considered .

" It may have something to do with the economy , " said Dr. Bryan Kansas , a urologist .
" I can't count on my hands , in the last three months , the number of times someone has said they 're about to lose their insurance and ask to squeeze them in . "
He and his colleagues have seen a similar uptick in their Austin , Texas , practice called The Urology Team .
Throughout March Madness , Kansas ' office has a special on vasectomies called , " Vas- Madness " to capitalize on their patient 's obsession with the college basketball tournament .
Patients " would love to have a procedure , go home and sit there when you 've got all - day programming , watch basketball , " Kansas said .
After the less - than - hourlong procedure , patients usually spend a day or two recovering , moving gingerly and icing the soreness .
Some men time their vasectomies around the time of major sports events such as the Masters Golf Tournament and the NCAA basketball tournament to keep themselves entertained during recovery .
Vasectomies are likely to produce tenderness , discomfort and slight swelling and the patient is usually able to return to usual activities within a week .

To Hell With Bad Browsers — the sequel
Almost exactly eight years ago , Jeffrey Zeldman wrote To Hell With Bad Browsers , in which he implored web developers to start ignoring Netscape 4 because its standard support sucked majorly .
Yesterday several large Norwegian sites placed a warning against IE6 on their pages .
Web developers from all over the world are following this initiative with interest .
To Hell With Bad Browsers is obviously in for a remake .
Just now I added an IE6 warning to QuirksMode.org ( not that my visitors need any ; this site probably has the most browser - savvy audience in the world ) .
I also wrote an upgrade page that attempts to explain the problem and its solution to end users .
I ’ll probably work on this page some more ; I wrote the text quickly and it can probably use some light editing , or maybe the insertion of an extra paragraph about security .
I ’d like to call upon all my readers to think about following the example set by the Norwegians .
True , we web developers are mainly preaching to the choir , but somebody has to start .
So add that conditional comment to your site and outline the possibilities .
If you wish you can use my upgrade page to gently explain what ’s going on , but you can also write one yourself , of course .
Conditional comments and Ajax
Incidentally , I discovered that you can also add conditional comments to your pages later on ; they do n’t have to be available when the page is being rendered .
That does n’t hugely surprise me , but it ’s always good to know that what should work in theory actually does work in practice .
I added this to my header .
txt file , which is included by Ajax on every page :
<!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < p class= " ie6 " >< strong > IE6 ?</ strong >
Really ?
Is n’t it time to < a href= " /upgrade.html " > upgrade to a better browser </a >?
( Unless you ’re here for testing purposes , of course . ) </p> <![ endif ] -->
The conditional comment is parsed and obeyed when I set my header ’s innerHTML to the HTML contained in header .

This week seemed an apt time to ponder our nation ’s political ghosts .
We all know Abraham Lincoln haunts the White House along with Andrew Jackson and a host of first ladies , Woodrow Wilson is seen in a rocking chair at Blair House .
Updated 2/9/2020 – A great many ghosts are associated with the other federal government buildings in Washington .
But one ghost is known to be seen in at least two places always heralding disaster for the nation .
It is the Phantom black cat .
Seen in the basements of the White House , the mall and the Capitol , DC as it is called ( short for Demon Cat ) is reported to appear just before national disasters .
When seen , it is sometimes reported to appear as a kitten , but as you get closer it grows into a menacing and angry tiger - like animal with red glowing eyes .
While psychics have seen it in visions on various occasions , physically it is only seen at night , and normally only by people that are alone .
It made an appearance before the stock market crash of 1929 , and again before the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
At the White House , it is usually seen during times – such as now – when the presidency is moving to a new person .
The origin of the story may lie with the fact that the capitol was once infested with rats .
The problem became so severe , that caretakers released a large number of cats in the building to control the rat population .
Ever since , the black cat has made his appearance .
Guards fear even talking about seeing the animal , mainly as it might cause them to lose their security clearance , but stories abound from retired federal employees .
Personally I wish they ’d tell us whenever it is seen .
Whether a concocted urban legend or a legitimate paranormal phenomena , DC remains a fascinating and little - known phantom that remains unique in its ability to appear in multiple different places , always before a disaster .
If it really does exist , more information would be quite welcome .

Obama unveils education plan in speech RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday March 10 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  President Barack Obama will unveil an overhaul of the underperforming US education system , with a goal of restoring America to the top-ranks of learning excellence on Tuesday , a senior administration official said .
The speech , to be delivered to the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce , would introduce a " broad vision for improving the quality of education , from cradle to career . "
It will be the first major address on education from Obama since taking office in January .
Officials said Tuesday 's speech will flesh out remarks made by Obama in his maiden address to Congress last month , in which he promised to pump funds into American schools , with a goal toward creating a " world class " US education system .
Senior officials said Obama 's sweeping reform program will address education in all of its facets -- from early childhood schooling to post - graduate learning -- with an eye to making America 's education system the envy of the world .
" The countries that out - teach us today will out - compete us tomorrow , " Obama said in the speech last month to Congress that touched upon some of Tuesday 's education themes .
Obama is set to renew his call for Americans to commit to one year or more of higher education or career training as he seeks to reverse America 's runaway high school dropout rate , the highest among industrialized countries .
Another plank of his program would reform higher education , with a goal of producing the " highest percent of college grads in the world by 2020 , " the administration official said .
Aides said the president also plans to propose better tracking of students ' education progress and merit pay for high - performing teachers .
" What he 'll be calling for ... is to reward good outcomes " in the classroom , the senior administration official said .
Obama was also expected to issue a " national call for people to enter education " to improve the talent pool of those who choose the teaching profession , including the recruitment of mid-career professionals from other fields .
The overhaul envisioned by the president expands preschool and kindergarten education , and would make college more affordable with a by improving the terms and conditions of financial aid programs .
But in a departure from many policy reforms introduced by the new administration , Obama does not scrap the keystone school reform introduced by the George W. Bush administration , the No Child Left Behind program .
Instead , Obama seeks to " augment " Bush 's education plan by imposing tougher but voluntary standards , along with the needed funding to implement his reforms .
No Child Left Behind comes up for reauthorization by Congress later this year .
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , show American school children trailing their counterparts in other industrialized nations in reading , mathematics and science .
But the overhaul is likely to fuel criticism that the Obama administration is taking on too many crises at once , as it also attempts to repair the ailing US banking system , deal with a rising tide of home loan foreclosures and tackle wars on two separate fronts .

The attempted assassination of a South Carolina deputy sheriff was a gang initiation carried out by three illegal immigrants including a 15 - year - old boy who was supposed to “ kill a cop ” in order to be admitted as a member , according to a confidential Department of Homeland Security advisory .
Lexington County , S.C. , Deputy Sheriff Ted Xanthakis and his K - 9 police dog , Arcos , were attacked by the three illegals armed with a 12 - gauge shotgun during a Feb. 8 incident in West Columbia , S.C. , shortly after 3 a.m .
The deputy and his dog survived .
Two of the men were identified in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) report as members of the Surenos gang , or SUR - 13 , a collection of Mexican - American street gangs with origins in the oldest barrios of Southern California .
Hundreds of SUR - 13 gangs operate in California and have spread to many other parts of the country .
The paramilitary organization has been described by federal law enforcement agencies as actively involved in illegal - immigrant and drug smuggling .
According to the ICE report , the attack occurred as the deputy responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle .
The 15 - year - old and two others , Carlos Alfredo Diaz De Leon , 17 , and Lucino Guzman Guttierrez , 20 , were later arrested by sheriff ’s deputies and members of the U.S. Marshals Service .
Diaz De Leon and Guzman Guttierrez were charged with assault and battery with intent to kill .
Deputy Xanthakis and his dog were in a marked patrol car at the time of the shooting .
The 15 - year - old was taken to a pre-trial detention facility , where he was awaiting a hearing in family court .
Prosecutors said they would recommend that the boy be prosecuted in family court on a charge of assault and battery with intent to kill .
Under state law , law enforcement officials cannot identify the boy because he is a juvenile .
Lexington County Sheriff James R. Metts told reporters that Diaz De Leon , Guzman Guttierrez and the 15 - year - old illegally entered the United States from Mexico .
He said Diaz De Leon and Guzman Guttierrez were living in West Columbia and a search of their house netted items thought to have been stolen in vehicle break - ins in Lexington County , including a Global Positioning System devices and car stereo systems .
The sheriff also said that deputies recovered the shotgun that was used to shoot at Deputy Sheriff Xanthakis .
ICE detainers have been lodged against the adults .
The ICE report , made public Wednesday by the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC ( ALIPAC ) , said interviews determined that the 15 - year - old was the shooter and the incident was a gang initiation .
It said gangs “ have long posed a threat to public safety and law enforcement but the threat is now increasing in scope .
…
Never before have the street gangs in South Carolina actively targeted law enforcement officers for gang initiation . ”
ICE agents , as part of a nationwide crackdown on gangs , have arrested members of SUR - 13 in Tennessee and Georgia on charges ranging from felony theft and illegal re-entry after deportation to murder , attempted murder , carjacking , armed robbery and drug dealing .
William Gheen , president of ALIPAC , described the attack as the “ beginning of America ’s nightmarish future as we descend into the type of anarchy found in Mexico .
“ In Mexico , things have deteriorated so much that police are demoralized and are being killed by these gangs of a weekly basis , ” he said .
“ That ’s what happens when your nation loses respect for the rule of law as we see with the effect of millions of illegal aliens in America . ”
He said the U.S. needs to secure its border and enforce its immigration laws “ or we will begin to lose more officers and as we loose officers , gang rule will replace the rule of law . ”

Windows 7 UAC whitelist :
- Code-injection Issue
- Anti-Competitive API
- Security Theatre
( Still needs an edit / re - write / chainsaw but I can't be bothered .
I have wasted enough time on this already . )
As I was typing more words into this page , this appeared in my text editor at the 10,000th word ! :-)
Quick Windows 7 RTM update : Everything below still applies to the final retail release of Windows 7 ( and all updates as of 14 / Sep / 2011 ) .
Quick Windows 8 update : Everything below still applies to the Windows 8 Developer Preview released on 13 / Sep/2011 .
It is early days , of course , but from a quick look it does not seem that anything UAC - related has changed at all in Win8 .
Program , Source Code and Step - by - Step Guide While Windows 7 was still in beta Microsoft said this was a non-issue , and ignored my offers to give them full details for several months .
so there can't be an issue with making everything public now .
March 2020 : Binaries removed as I got sick of the page being marked as malware , even by Google ( FFS ) who themselves publish thousands of similar disclosures .
There 's no way to contact a human being at Google .
The old binaries still worked completely on Windows 10 in the year 2020 and the issue is never going to be addressed by Microsoft , but apparently providing proof of it is bad in some way .
Whatever .
The source code remains up but you can find the binaries yourselves .
If you end up getting ACTUAL malware because you could n't get the binaries from a safe , official source , blame Google .
Win7 ElevateV2.zip ( 32 - bit and 64 - bit binaries ; use the version for your OS .
Win7 ElevateV2_Source.zip
( C++ source code , and detailed guide to how it works . )
Source in HTML format ( for browsing online )
Step - by - step guide ( description of what the code does )
This works against the RTM ( retail ) and RC1 versions of Windows 7 .
It probably wo n't work with the old beta build 7000 due to changes in which apps can auto - elevate .
Microsoft could block the binaries via Windows Defender ( update : they now do via MSE ) , or plug the CRYPTBASE.DLL hole , but unless they fix the underlying code - injection / COM - elevation problem the file copy stuff will still work .
Fixing only the CRYPTBASE .DLL part , or blocking a particular EXE or DLL , just means someone has to find a slightly different way to take advantage of the file copy part .
Finding the CRYPTBASE.DLL method took about 10 minutes so I 'd be surprised if finding an alternative took long .
Even if the hole is fixed , UAC in Windows 7 will remain unfair on third - party code and inflexible for users who wish to use third - party admin tools .
Microsoft Security Essentials detects proof - of - concept as " hacktool "
As originally reported by Maurice at AeroXperience , the free Microsoft Security Essentials anti-virus tool now detects the Win7 ElevateV2 binaries as HackTool : Win32 / Welevate .
A and HackTool : Win64 / Welevate .A.
Apparently recompiling the binaries in VS2010 means they are no longer detected .
So as well as being named after the proof - of - conept executables the detection seems to be looking for those executables specifically , rather than detecting a general pattern within them .
That seems pointless when , aside from demonstrating what a program could do , the proof - of - concept executables do n't do or allow the user to do anything that could n't be done using Windows Explorer .
The point of them is to demonstrate that anything Windows Explorer is allowed to do can be hijacked by any other program .
Another program using the same technique would not be detected by MSE 's current anti-virus signatures .
If this whole thing is a non-issue then why block the proof - of - concept binaries ?
On the other hand , if bypassing UAC does makes something dangerous then should n't Explorer .
exe be detected and blocked as well ? :-)
Some quotes ( Bold emphasis is mine . )
User Account Control ( UAC ) is a core security feature in the next release of Windows Vista and Windows Server code name Longhorn .
-- Microsoft 's UAC blog
The other fact is that User Account Control ( UAC ) is one of the most important ways that we hope to protect people in Windows Vista . [...]
Once the OS is released , if you absolutely can’t stand a security feature that is designed to protect you , by all means , turn it off
-- Jesper 's Blog ( Senior Security Strategist in the Security Technology Unit at Microsoft . )
Here ’s my million dollar question :
If UAC was n’t designed to ultimately protect us from anything , why does its icon resemble a damn shield ?
-- Rafael 's Within Windows Standard user accounts are a distraction and an excuse as far as Windows 7 UAC goes .
You might as well say " People should use Linux to be more secure " as it's about as relevant and likely to happen .
If Windows 8 ( or whatever ) actually makes standard user the default , and improves the user experience to one that people might actually put up with , then the argument will hold water .
-- Me :-)
Win 7 UAC Code - Injection : Summary On 5th February 2009
I wrote a proof - of - concept program to demonstrate a flaw in Windows 7's UAC under default UAC / account settings .
This simply copied a file to Program Files without the user 's consent .
In other words , it performed a file copy to a protected location from an unelevated process , bypassing UAC .
" So what ?
All it does is copy a file ? "
On 9th February 2009 I extended the proof - of - concept program into to something which , without requiring elevation itself , can run and elevate any command or program without triggering a UAC prompt .
All of this is done without using the SendKeys or RunDll32 holes which were found earlier in February .
It is done using a method which can attack almost any Windows executable and which is inherent to the changes Microsoft have made to UAC in Windows 7 .
The proof - of - concept works on unmodified installs of Windows 7 , including the October retail release , both 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions , at default settings .
Setting UAC to its highest level , or using a non -admin account , will prevent the proof - of - concept from working by forcing it to display a UAC prompt .
However , neither of those are the default settings of a Windows 7 install .
As well as discussing the proof - of - concept code I argue that : Microsoft should either admit that local process elevation is a problem and make Windows more secure by default or admit that the Windows 7 default UAC settings are security theater ( as they offer no protection ) and anti-competitive ( as they are inflicted on third - party code despite local elevation supposedly being a non-issue ) .
admit that local process elevation is a problem and make Windows more secure by default admit that the Windows 7 default UAC settings are security theater ( as they offer no protection ) and anti-competitive ( as they are inflicted on third - party code despite local elevation supposedly being a non-issue ) .
If there is to be a UAC whitelist , or the equivalent of one , then it should be up to the user which Microsoft and third - party software is on it .
Users should not be forced to expose themselves to risks from software they do not use .
Conversely , if reducing UAC prompts in frequently - used software is needed to stop people disabling UAC entirely then that applies to third - party software as much as to bundled software ( especially once a machine is past the " setup " phase ) .
The " elevate without prompting " UAC option should be available in the main UAC control panel , in particular so that Home Premium users can access it .
( This allows you to turn off UAC prompts without turning off the undeniably good parts of UAC such as Protected - Mode IE . )
UAC itself was a good API and a good design that was given a bad name because of the way it was used by Microsoft 's application - level code ( such as Explorer and Control Panel ) .
Accordingly , the user experience of having UAC enabled could have been vastly improved by changing the application - level code without opening a huge hole in UAC .

Accordingly , the user experience of having UAC enabled could have been vastly improved by changing the application - level code without opening a huge hole in UAC .
Microsoft created these problems themselves and , rather than fixing them properly , have taken the easy way out , unnecessarily making UAC less secure in the process .
At the same time Microsoft expect third - party vendors to do a better job than they bothered to do using the API which they themselves designed .
If UAC is inherently " undefendable " then that applies equally to UAC when used for elevation from a standard user account .
If the only goal of UAC is to coerce third - party programmers into working better under standard user accounts then there are far , far better ways to achieve that .
Microsoft need to get their message straight about what UAC is and is n't supposed to do .
They need to stop saying that UAC is a security feature only to say it is n't , depending on what suits them at the time .
And , for the record , I like Windows and much of what Microsoft do , in general .
I even like UAC ( the API , not the way it has been used ) .
I wrote this page because I care about the platform not because I get a kick out of attacking something Microsoft have done .
I call things as I see them .
I attack and criticise some of what Microsoft do and I support and defend Microsoft other things that they do .
Win 7 UAC Code - Injection :
The good news
All of this only affects the default account type and UAC level of Windows 7 ( builds 7000 & 7022 , but probably also the retail given Microsoft 's stance so far ) .
If you go against the defaults and run as a non -admin user or turn UAC up to the Always Prompt level , so it behaves like it did in Vista , then it is no longer possible for code - injection from unelevated processes to bypass UAC prompts .
So the advice remains as before :
If you are using Windows 7 and want to be protected against silent elevation then turn UAC up to the highest level .
However , I would add to that advice :
If , on the other hand , you do n't care about silent elevation then you should turn down UAC to Elevate Without Prompting -- so that UAC is still enabled but it never prompts you -- because the default level is n't buying you much except a few pointless prompts which can be bypassed by any program which wants to .
The Elevate Without Prompting mode , which was available on Vista as well , can be set via the Local Security Policy control panel ( screenshot ) but is n't one of the options in the simplified UAC control panel .
You either care about silent elevation or you do n't .
Pick one .
Win 7 UAC Code - Injection :
How it works
In the quest to reduce the number of UAC prompts , for their code only , Microsoft have granted ( at least ) three groups of components special privileges : Processes which anything else can run elevated without a UAC prompt .
This is the list of about 70 processes published on Rafael 's Within Windows blog .
( Update : New list for RC1 build 7100 . )
If you run a process on this list and it requires elevation then it -- the whole process -- will be given elevation without showing you a UAC prompt .
Discovery of this list is what lead to the earlier RunDll32. exe exploit where you could ask RunDll32. exe to run your code from within a DLL and it would do so with full elevation and no UAC prompt .
Microsoft have since removed RunDll32.exe from the list but there are still plenty of other processes on the list , several of which can be exploited if you can copy files to the Windows folder .
Processes which can create certain elevated COM objects without a UAC prompt .
Programs on this second list are able , without being elevated themselves , to create certain elevated COM objects without triggering a UAC prompt .
Once such an object has been created the processes can then tell it to perform actions which require administrator rights , such as copying files to System32 or Program Files .
This appears to be a superset of the first list .
In fact , it seems to include all executables which come with Windows 7 and have a Microsoft authenticode certificate .
Unbelievably , as of build 7000 ( and confirmed in RC1 build 7100 ) , the list includes not only programs like Explorer .
exe which use this feature ( or potential security hole , if you like ) but also programs such as Calc.exe , Notepad.exe and MSPaint.exe .
Microsoft appear to have done nothing to minimize the attack surface and have arbitrarily granted almost all of their executables with this special privilege whether they actually use it or not .
You can see evidence of this yourself by opening MSPaint , using the File Open dialog as a mini- file manager , and making changes within Program Files ( e.g. create a folder or rename something ) ; it 'll let you do that without the UAC prompt that non-MS apps should trigger .
I doubt that is intentional and it shows how little thought has gone into the UAC whitelist hacks MS have added to make their own apps seem better .
COM objects which can be created with elevation , by the things in list 2 , without a UAC prompt .
Full enumeration of this list has not yet been done .
The list is known to include IFileOperation and may simply be all Microsoft - signed COM objects that allow elevation at all .
It does not look like third - party COM objects can be elevated without triggering a UAC prompt , even by Microsoft processes , so the process and object must be on lists 2 and 3 respectively to bypass the UAC prompt .
Given the number of processes which can be attacked and the fact that there are Microsoft COM objects to do many admin tasks , that is n't much of a consolation .
My proof - of - concept program is a standalone executable that is run as a normal unelevated process .
I made from scratch in about a day and a half .
Keep in mind that , while I am an experienced Windows developer , I am not a " security researcher " or " hacker " and this is n't the kind of thing I write every day .
The proof - of - concept works by directly copying ( or injecting ) part of its own code into the memory of another running processes and then telling that target process to run the code .
This is done using standard , non-privileged APIs such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread .
If the target process is on list 2 ( above ) then our process gains the ability to create and control elevated COM objects from list 3 ( above ) without triggering a UAC prompt or giving any indication to the user ( under default Windows 7 beta settings ) .
Typically , Explorer.exe is targeted because it is always running to provide the Windows taskbar and desktop .
However , innocuous programs such as Calc.exe and Notepad.exe can also be targeted , launching them first if required .
Like the proof - of - concept program , the targeted process is unelevated ( and must be for direct code - injection to work ) .
The target process can have ASLR on or off and can be 32 - bit or 64 - bit ; neither matters .
( However , ASLR should mean that it would be difficult to launch a code- injection attack directly and reliably from a remote - code - execution exploit .
Such an exploit would probably have to write - out and launch a separate EXE . )
The underlying problem is that the silent elevation feature , enabled by default in Windows 7 beta , does not check where the code requesting elevation comes from .
It checks which process it is running within but not the particular code came from .
So , for example , if you inject code into Explorer , or get Explorer to load your DLL , then you can create elevated COM objects without the user 's knowledge or consent .
There are many ways to get your code into another process that 's running at the same security level .
That usually is n't a problem because there 's usually nothing you can do in that other process that you can't already do in your own .
The silent elevation feature changes that .
Getting your code into another process can be done in various ways .
You can use buffer - overflow exploits ( although ASLR helps greatly to mitigate those ) or you can install yourself as a plugin DLL which the targeted program loads , like an Explorer shell extension .
My proof - of - concept program uses a well - known technique called code injection .
Code injection has the advantage that you do n't have to trick the target program into loading your code ; you simply push it into the other process and tell it to run it .
This is n't a hack , either ; everything is done using documented , supported APIs .
( Legitimate uses of the APIs include debugging and inter-process communication .
The APIs do not require elevation to use . )
( Note : The Wikipedia article on code injection is , at the time of writing , about a related but different type of code injection .
Unlike what 's described there , the code - injection technique I am using does not depend on feeding the target program a specially - crafted input that confuses it .
Instead , I am calling Windows APIs which allow one process to copy code and data into another and then make that target process execute the code .
The technique is often called DLL injection in the Windows world , but that name is n't accurate here because I am not injecting a DLL .
I am copying , or injecting , the code directly from my in - memory exe to the target process .
Update : A second technique which does use a DLL is used as well now , but the main technique discussed here still does n't invole DLLs .
See the source archive for details . )
Update : Now that the Program and Source Code have been released you can download it or , read it online , to see exactly what it does .
I have also written a separate step - by - step guide which goes into more detail about exactly what the source does , including the CRYPTBASE.DLL issue which had not been discussed before the source release ( June 2009 ) .
UAC in Vista and Windows 7 : Mistakes then and now Consider this combination : UAC in Vista was criticised mainly because of the excessive frequency of prompts .
Microsoft want to reduce the number of prompts .
Nobody is against them doing that .
The problem is how they are doing it .
The excessive prompts were due to the way UAC was used at the application level , not the design of UAC itself .
In general , UAC was a well - designed , flexible and secure elevation API .
However , converting old code to use UAC and provide a good user experience requires refactoring .
Microsoft failed to do this in Vista and in particular with Windows Explorer , the Control Panels and Properties dialogs .
Rather than refactor they retrofitted existing code and this resulted in excessive UAC prompts .
( See " UAC Comparison " below . )
UAC in Vista provided a good security layer between admin and non-admin code and user interfaces .
UAC was not a security boundary in the strict technical sense but it did do a good job of making it very difficult to cross from one side to the other without user consent .
That is worth keeping .
With Windows 7 , Instead of modifying their application - level software to use UAC better , Microsoft have taken the easy way out and modified UAC to allow their software -- and only their software , or so they intended -- to elevate for free , without prompting .
In other words , Microsoft are still avoiding the refactoring work which their code has desperately needed since the early versions of Vista .
In doing so Microsoft have created several obvious , easy - to - exploit and inherent flaws .
Had they created secure silently - elevating processes then , perhaps , they could have argued that their code deserved special trust ; they could have argued that it was too dangerous to allow silent elevation for any third - party code .
They failed spectacularly to so and thus cannot be allowed to argue either point .
Beta or not , you design security in from day one , not at the last minute .
Even if they patch over some of the security issues the fact is that the system is inherently flawed and more holes will be found in time .
The best they can do , without drastic changes , is obfuscate things .
Another thing :
The design of UAC in Vista shows that Microsoft had already predicted the very problems they are now opening up in Windows 7 .
Things which Vista 's UAC went out of its way to prevent are now not only allowed but used routinely .
The real aim of UAC , we are told , is to coerce developers into refactoring their software .
While trying to dismiss the holes they 've opened up , some from Microsoft appear to be saying that UAC is n't supposed to be a security feature for admins at all .
Instead , it seems , its aim is to coerce third - party developers into making their software to work better with limited user accounts and over - the - shoulder elevation , not requiring admin rights all the time ( for that increases the attack surface ) , and elevating only when required without nagging the user too much ...
The eventual goal of UAC is to have everyone running as standard users , not admins , and yet : Nothing has improved for non-admins .
The imbalance between admin and non-admin has grown .
If people complained about UAC as admin on Vista they 'll complain even more about running as non-admin .
In the rush to respond to complaints about running as administrator it seems the situation for standard users -- the stated end - game for UAC -- was completely overlooked .
Standard users still get just as many UAC prompts as before .
Crucially , since non-admins ( understandably ) have to type an admin password for every prompt , running as standard user is more annoying than running as admin was on Vista .
Since Microsoft know that running as admin on Vista was too annoying for many people they can't seriously think that people are going to switch to an even more annoying standard user account in Windows 7 .
If they wanted people to switch then they should have been working to improve the user experience of that mode ( or all modes ) , not add silent elevation for admins and make it even more convenient for people to use the admin mode they want them to move away from .
Leaving UAC as it was and refactoring the Windows applications & applets to use UAC better would have made Windows better for all types of user and would have encouraged people to move to non-admin accounts , all without creating such large security issues .
Now , wait a minute ... UAC exists to make developers change their code .
Microsoft retrofitted UAC to their code but it annoyed too many people .
Microsoft needed to refactor their own code but decided it was too hard ( or failed to imagine how it could be done ) .
So they left their code the same , and instead changed UAC to exempt themselves from having to do the job properly .
Yet they still expect everyone else to do the hard work they failed to do , using the system they themselves designed .
On top of this , in the quest to make their own apps less annoying with as little effort as possible , they have made the whole OS less secure under default settings and made the admin / non - admin choice even more weighted towards the admin option .
And they have done nothing to improve the user experience of third - party apps under UAC for any type of user .
Nor that of unbundled Microsoft apps such as the popular SysInternal tools which require elevation .
Under default settings they are forcing UAC prompts on third - party code purely to maintain the illusion of security while giving their own poorly designed apps a free pass and dismissing new local code elevation issues .
Security has being reduced , the quest towards non-admin accounts has been harmed and third - party applications are being punished all for Microsoft 's failure to properly design around their own API .
We should not accept this .
Microsoft : Eat your own dog food before feeding it to us !
( This section would n't be complete without a quick mention of the UAC Secure Desktop feature : Great idea but what went wrong with the implementation ?
It seems somewhat dependent on the videocard brand / driver and system load but , whoever is responsible , it simply is n't acceptable for the whole desktop to go unresponsive and turn completely black -- worse if you have multiple monitors -- for up to 10 seconds while Windows does who - knows - what before the dimmed desktop -- still annoying with large / multiple monitors -- and UAC prompt actually appear and allow you to continue ( perhaps after another 10 seconds of black screen ( s ) ) .
I really cannot believe that modern hardware has to take that long to switch from one picture and mouse / keyboard input queue to another .
If that switch was implemented better then UAC would have been half as painful .
That 's one thing I do blame UAC itself for , or maybe a particular popular video card vendor if it's their fault , rather than the applications that use UAC . )
UAC Comparison :
Two file - managers I make the claim that UAC itself is okay and the problem has largely been how it has been used at the application level , particularly in Windows Explorer and the Control Panels .
Since Vista 's release UAC has always allowed applications to cache their elevated objects for as long as they need to .
If the same program shows you two prompts it 's because it was designed that way , not because UAC forced it to .
Here is some evidence to back that up .
The two videos below were made back in 2007 just over two months after Vista 's released .
They compare two file managers on Vista : Windows Explorer and Directory Opus .
Note how much better the user experience is when using Opus compared to Explorer .
Then note how much longer Microsoft had to redesign their file manager for their API and wonder how they did such a bad job .
Then wonder why they decided to improve nothing about the way UAC was used in Windows 7 and instead botched the default UAC mode to cover up their annoying prompts while still expecting everyone else to do a better job , now on an unlevel field .
( Vista SP1 was released since these videos were made and improved Explorer 's handling of new folder creation .
Perhaps someone saw my video ?
I do n't know .
So maybe this is n't a fair comparison today but note that only the new folder case was improved and the excessive prompting in Explorer continues to this day for other actions , even in Windows 7 ( build 7000 ) if you disable silent elevation .
Even if Vista SP1 had fixed the other cases , which it did n't , by then the bad taste had already been left in people 's mouths . )
2007 video : See how Opus behaved compared to Explorer 's gratuitous UAC prompting .
Opus , again back in 2007 , also included an Administrator Mode option where you could click a button , consent to just one UAC prompt and then perform as many admin actions as you wanted to until a time limit ( which you specified ) ran out .
A lot of people criticised UAC for not having a mode like this , like other platform 's have , but there was nothing about UAC itself preventing such a thing from being implemented : 2007 video : Administrator Mode in Opus .
Note that Delete Confirmation was turned off for this video .
The Delete Confirmation setting is independent of admin mode .
It 's worth pointing out that Administrator Mode in Directory Opus does open as security hole .
If you choose to use it and consent to the UAC prompt then you are sacrificing some security for some convenience while the mode is active .
You will have a non -admin window from which you can trigger actions on an elevated COM object and that window is vulnerable to other non-admin applications sending it mouse and keyboard events .
Also , if you run Opus buttons which you 've configured to launch third - party apps ( usually command - line driven batch - processing tools that are run on the selected files ) then they will be run with admin access .
The assumption is that if you switch into admin mode to run such a command then it's intended to modify the files and thus the command needs write access to them .
This is different to what Microsoft have done with their applications on Windows 7 : On Windows 7 ( build 7000 with default settings ) , Explorer ( among other things ) is always running in this insecure mode .
There 's no UAC prompt when you enter it ( because you 're always in it ) .
You can't turn it on and of as and when you wish to perform a bulk of admin actions and sacrifice security for convenience , except by changing the system - wide UAC level ( which is hardly convenient , either ) .
In Opus you have to opt-in to use Administrator Mode by clicking a toolbar button ( which is n't shown in the UI by default ) and then consenting to the one - off UAC prompt .
That UAC prompt in turn prevents other programs triggering the mode by themselves , though they could obviously wait for it to happen .
I 'm not saying this Administrator Mode is right for all programs or even right for all Opus users .
I rarely use it myself as I do n't find the normal UAC prompts annoying , outside of exceptional circumstances .
I 'm just showing it as a demonstration that UAC is a flexible API and there are more ways to use it than many people realise .
If a whitelist makes sense then it must be user - configurable ( I talk about the concept of a whitelist here .
As currently implemented , special elevation privileges are granted via manifest attributes and code signing , rather than a literal list , but conceptually the two are the same . )
Let 's play a game of what if ...
I do n't believe there would be a need for a whitelist if application - level code such as Explorer and the Control Panels were improved , but let 's assume I 'm wrong and a whitelist is needed .
The default UAC setting in Windows 7 is : " Do n't notify me when I make changes to Windows settings . "
What this really means is : " Do n't notify me when Microsoft applications * require administrator rights . "
( * Or malware , but let 's pretend the whitelist could be made secure for a moment . )
At the moment the whitelist , if you use it at all , is hardcoded and only for Microsoft 's own code .
Users cannot add third - party apps to the list .
Users also cannot remove Microsoft apps from the list .
This was confirmed by Microsoft Online Community Support in a microsoft.public.win32.programmer.kernel thread :
The change we made in Windows 7 default UAC settings is that any operation that is necessary to manage windows will not require an elevation - which in technical terms translates into a white list of trusted action / binaries which the user can make perform without UAC prompting from an elevation .
This list does include windows file operations .
You see a prompt in your File Manager program because your binary is not an inbox binary - i.e. not an executable which ships with windows .
Hope that explains and clarifies .
For security considerations , Windows 7 does not allow any 3rd party binary to be in the Windows trusted list .
Therefore , your File Manager program still needs to handle the elevations .
There are several other worthwhile comments in the short thread discussing user experience issues as well as the pitfalls of developers having to workaround the problem via their own solutions in order to provide parity with Microsoft 's components .
The " for security considerations " part of the quote above is particularly ironic given it is this very whitelist which has opened a hole in UAC which allows silent elevation for any process that does n't care about doing things properly ( or 100 % reliably ) and uses the backdoor .
If we are to have whitelisting then why is it limited to only Microsoft 's code ?
And why can't the user remove particular Microsoft binaries from the whitelist ?
Microsoft cannot argue that it's too risky to let users whitelist third - party code :
By creating so many obvious security flaws just in the way UAC has been abused in Windows 7 , Microsoft have demonstrated -- without the need to look through history -- that they are no better at making secure application - level code than anyone else .
Microsoft 's user - mode executables have not earned special treatment when it comes to security or trust .
The core OS should treat them with the same level of distrust as any other unelevated process making the same API calls .
If people want to whitelist some of the Microsoft executables then that 's up to them but there is nothing inherently trustworthy about them .
( In addition , since they are well known and installed on every system , granting them whitelist status is more risky than doing the same to third - party or unbundled code . )
Microsoft cannot argue that it's too risky to let users whitelist third - party code because Microsoft 's own code has shown a disregard for preventing other processes hijacking its special elevation status .
Allowing users to add third - party code to the whitelist cannot make things less secure , only less annoying :
As it stands , if the whitelist is enabled at all , UAC prompts can be bypassed by anything that wants to .
It is therefor hard to imagine how UAC could provide less security if the user was able to whitelist chosen , trusted and regularly used third - party programs .
With the whitelist enabled UAC prompts are nothing more than security theater that protects against very little and only really gets in the way of legitimate programs and user - triggered actions , both of which the user will consent to when prompted .
Seeing a UAC prompt when you do certain things in certain programs may give the illusion that UAC is still doing something towards your security but in reality it is n't doing much .
The prompts in Vista , and in Windows 7 if you change to Always Prompt mode , made it very difficult for unelevated processes to gain elevation .
In Windows 7 's default mode you might as well turn the prompts off entirely .
This also applies to non-bundled Microsoft applications such as the SysInternals tools .
Why is it that Task Manager can create an elevated version of itself without prompting but if you use the superior Process Explorer then you have to confirm its launch via a prompt ?
Where is the security benefit here given that malicious code can bypass the prompt and Microsoft , so far , seem to say they do n't care and have no intention of changing anything ?
The inability to remove unused apps from the whitelist means security is being traded for nothing in return :
A whitelist is about trading some security for some convenience .
Every program on the whitelist adds to the attack surface of code that potentially can be exploited to gain admin rights .
Every single item on the whitelist trades off a bit of security by making such an exploit more likely to be found .
If some of the whitelisted components are ones which the user rarely / never uses , what exactly is gained in return for this reduced security ?
For example , I do not use Windows Explorer ; I use another file manager .
If I left the whitelist on then I would want to remove Explorer from .
The only thing that might try to modify a protected folder on my machine using Explorer is a piece of software remote controlling Explorer either by sending mouse and keyboard events to it or , like my proof - of - concept program , by code - injection .
I gain no convenience by having Explorer on the whitelist .
I also gain no convenience from having things like Calc.exe , Notepad.exe and MSPaint.exe on the COM elevation whitelist when they are programs which never actually use COM elevation unless something else has injected code into them !
Too many UAC prompts encourage users to turn off UAC ; it does n't matter which vendor causes the prompts :
People typically use software because it lets them do what they want , not because it 's internally well designed or secure .
If someone wants to use a program that triggers a lot of UAC prompts then they are more likely to turn off UAC than to switch programs .
So , if the aim of the whitelist is to make UAC more bearable and discourage people from turning off prompts entirely then people need to be able to whitelist whichever applications they want .
That way they will keep UAC on and UAC will still catch things done by programs they do n't use often , or new programs .
( Assuming , of course , that Microsoft manage to improve the UAC whitelist implementation so that malicious software cannot bypass the whole thing ! )
As said earlier , the excuse that UAC is supposed to make developers write better code does not wash when Microsoft 's response to that challenge was to exempt their own code from UAC .
If it 's good for the goose then it 's good for the gander .
To those saying , " but it requires code to get on the box " Engineering Windows 7 blog : I really do n't buy the logic behind this statement on Microsoft 's Engineering Windows 7 blog ( which was written after the RunDll 32. exe issue was found but before this page / issue was published ) :
It is important to look at the first step — if the first step is " first get code running on the machine " then nothing after that is material , whether it is changing settings or anything else .
This is n't true .
Yes , a problem which allows remote execution is far more important than one which allows local elevation .
However , it very much is material whether or not a remote execution exploit can be turned into a remote admin code execution exploit .
And there are other ways to get code to run on a box .
Indeed , if all code already on the machine was immaterial then why do we have UAC prompts for anything in the first place ?
Are the prompts just there for show ; just security theater ?
Also , why do we have the Secure Desktop for UAC prompts if not to prevent running , supposedly - trusted applications from clicking their own UAC pompts and elevating without the user 's permission ?
( In both Windows 7 and Vista you can configure UAC to " Elevate Without Prompting " .
That most keeps UAC on but automatically accepts all elevation requests .
It still forces developers to write code that supports UAC , over - the - shoulder elevation for non-admin users , running minimal code at admin level , and so on .
So the excuse that UAC prompts only exists to pester developers does n't wash either . )
Either it is important to prevent random processes from elevating arbitrarily and silently , or it is n't :
If it is important then Microsoft cannot dismiss this code - injection issue ( or the SendKeys / RunDll32.exe issues which the E7 post was responding to ) .
If it is n't important then the default UAC mode should get rid of all UAC elevation prompts for all applications , not just the Windows ones and the ones that bypass the prompts via exploits .
In other words , run in the " UAC but without any prompts " mode that Vista already had .
I can see arguments for and against both bullet points .
Some people want to know when code they run requests full admin :
More security and less convenience .
Some people implicitly trust any code they run and have it granted automatically : Less security and more convenience .
I 'm cool with people in either camp .
What I cannot accept is an argument for any mixture of the two : Less security and less convenience .
It makes no sense to punish well - behaved apps by making them inflict UAC prompts on their users while ignoring apps that use exploits by allowing them to bypass the prompts ( not to mention the malware that people do end up running , one way or another ) .
If prompts are important then they should not be something you can bypass with a trivial amount of code .
On the other hand , if prompts are not important then let 's get rid of them completely by default .
Pick one .
You can't say that process elevation is worth protecting against when it 's convenient ( i.e. in places where Windows 7 already prompts by default and requires no code / design changes ) while simultaneously saying that process elevation is n't an issue in cases where it is n't convenient ( convenient to the Windows 7 ship date , that is :-) ) .
That 's illogical , captain .
When the prompts are so easy to bypass by anything that wants to , having the prompts at all is pure security theater .
Secunia ( via The Register ) : Secunia said something similar in response to The Register 's coverage of this code - injection issue :
This is n't a major issue ; after all it requires that the user already downloaded some executable code and decided to run it .
No matter which security features have been built into the operating system , then the user should never run code , which they do n't trust in the first place .
Untrusted code should only be run on dedicated test systems .
First , it seems that Secunia 's response is aimed at corporations who are unlikely to be affected by the problem at all because they tend to run everyone as non-admin anyway .
General home users are unlikely to have " dedicated test systems " on which to test untrusted code .
Second , as for it not being a " major issue : " I do n't dispute that there are more important issues , in particular remote code execution issues .
Obviously .
That does not mean that this issue is not worth worrying about , however .
It can be used in conjunction with a remote code execution to worsen the damage .
You do not wait until someone combines issues into a blended attack before you acknowledge them .
Malicious code does get on to people 's machines .
That 's a fact of life .
People can be tricked into running things that do n't look like executables , which is the rampant Conflicker Worm is doing as I type this .
Even if we ignore trickery , exploits are regularly found which allow remote code execution though no action or fault of the user .
Once code gets on to a machine , one way or another , it 's important to minimize what it can do .
If someone finds a remote execution exploit in a non-admin process then it should not be easy for them to use it to gain full admin access .
They can still do damage to an affected user 's files but damaging the entire machine / OS should not be made easy , especially with methods which are completely silent to the user and do not arouse any suspicion ( e.g. unexpected UAC prompts or visible user - interface remote - control ) .
Especially when this problem was not that in Vista .
The hole I have found allows non-admin code to elevate to full admin without the user seeing anything at all .
The only reason the proof - of - concept videos show a UI is for demonstration purposes .
So while it is n't the most important security hole in the world -- and nobody ever said it was -- I find it strange that it could be considered unimportant ...
I guess it 's all relative , though .
( It is relatively unimportant compared to a lot of what Secunia look at , to be fair ! )
And , certainly , it 's not important if you turn UAC up to its highest level , but the defaults need to be considered because that 's what most people will use .
If you do consider it unimportant that , with the default settings , code can elevate itself freely once on the box then you must follow that to its logical conclusion .
If local process elevation is a non-issue , and given that it 's broken by default in Windows 7 anyway , then Windows 7 should default to elevate without prompting and not inflict UAC prompts on any programs .
If people want to argue that then it 's fine by me , provided I still have the option of setting UAC to always prompt on my own machine .
More to the point , there were better ways that Microsoft could have made UAC less annoying without opening such a large hole , as I explained in detail above .
To those saying , " but UAC is n't a security boundary "
That is a cop-out , IMO .
Yes , there were ways things could piggy - back on or spoof elevations on Vista .
Just because you can break some glass to enter a house does n't mean you leave the doors unlocked , though .
First , I 'm not aware of any UAC hole in Vista that could not be fixed .
Changing the command prompt registry setting is often brought up as an example , so I 'll use that : MS could fix that by making admin command prompts ignore the HKCU settings and only read from HKLM or an admin-ACL 'd part of HKCU .
Or by making either the UAC prompt itself or the admin process confirm to the user what it was about to run before it happens .
( The OS needs to prove some way for elevated processes , whether by admin-approval or over - the - shoulder , to confirm what they ahve been asked to do before they go and do it . )
Or maybe stuff like making Windows Defender alert you if the HKCU value is changed ...
There 's a bunch of ways that problem could be addressed , as with every other I 'm aware of .
None of them are an excuse to ignore the code- injection issue in Windows7 ; rather , they are just other flaws in UAC ( and how UAC is used ) which should also be addressed .
( Following on from that , almost all of the piggy - back and spoofing issues apply eqally to over - the - shoulder elevation . )
Second , I think there 's a significant difference between a program being able to gain elevation silently , the moment it wants to , and one which has to lie in wait for the user to do something it can exploit .
Using the same example agan , if something wants admin on my box and modifies the command prompt settings in HKCU , it still has to wait for me to launch an elevated command prompt .
It could be days before I trigger the action it is waiting for .
Meanwhile it has to hope that I do n't notice whatever changes it has made and , more importantly , that my anti-virus tool does n't get an update which detects those changes .
On the other hand , if something does n't have to wait to get full admin access then it can immediately install a rootkit which means the anti-virus tool may not be able to detect it even after a signature update .
I mean , think about a typical single - user home or small office computer :
What 's important ?
Your data is important .
You do n't want something to delete or steal your private data , but full admin rights are not required for that so UAC is irrelevant to that discussion .
It 's also important to prevent your computer from being remote controlled , e.g. as a spam zombie , but once again admin rights are not required for that .
Admin rights let things jump from one user to another but typically there only is one real user ( possibly with multiple accounts ) on the machines where UAC is used at all .
The main reason I can think of that a typical home user should care about software gaining full admin rights , over gaining any control to the system at all , is that with those rights it can hide itself deeply and never be detected ( or only be detected a very long time in the future ) , or maybe install low - level stuff like keyboard hooks to sniff passwords .
In cases like those I think it does matter how long something has to wait to gain that access .
If something has got on my machine through a remote execution exploit in Adobe Flash ( or whatever ) and I 've had my data compromised , or become part of a botnet , then that really sucks .
But it 'll suck even more if I do n't realise it 's going on for six months instead of a day .
I 'm not saying a solid UAC will always prevent that from happening but it could prevent it in some cases and should do a hell of a lot more than a UAC which can be trivially bypassed .
Third , what is UAC actually supposed to do ?
The reality is that you 'll get a different answer from different people .
Sometimes if you ask the question in different contexts you will get a different answer from the same people .
Because UAC is a fuzzy thing that 's supposed to kinda help make things sort - of more secure and also to kinda force developers to do some stuff differently , without breaking anything or annoying any one too much , and it's all a bit undefined , and Microsoft now have one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everyone else ...
The realiy is that UAC does whatever it 's most convenient to tell you it does at any particular time , and goals that UAC had in Vista have apparently been reduced -- or removed entirely by revisionism -- in Windows 7 .
I 'm asking for UAC 's purpose to be properly and explicitly defined and for Microsoft to then consistently and fairly stand behind whatever that is , for both their own software and third - paty software .
( And if getting people to run as standard user is really the aim of UAC , and not just a BS excuse to ignore the problems people raise , then it'd be nice if Microsoft actually made doing that not a giant pain in the behind that is even worse than the UAC prompts they know people do n't like . )
There are more of my arguments along these lines throughout this page but I 'll repeat one more example of the schizophrenia :
Why do we have a Secure Desktop for UAC prompts if it does n't matter that applications can silently elevate via a backdoor ?
To those saying , " but it 's only a beta "
Of course Windows 7 is only a beta .
All of us trying to expose the problems introduced by the UAC changes hope that Microsoft will improve things before Windows 7 ships .
However :
It took a lot of people making a lot of fuss to make Microsoft take notice of the first two UAC flaws .
Ignoring the Web2.0 abuse of the phrase , the point of a beta version is to allow testing and feedback .
We are testing and providing feedback on UAC .
Too many people seem to think that " beta " means " a way for me to get a shiny new piece of software early . "
Stop it .
Like it or not , Microsoft tend to do a terrible job at fixing things in a reasonable amount of time .
There are many examples but for a particularly bad one , consider the file - corruption bug in Windows Home Server which was known about when the OS was in beta and not fixed until a year after it was released to retail .
Security design and code is best done sooner rather than later .
It is very difficult to take an insecure design and make it secure .
The sooner problems start to be addressed the better .
Microsoft have said there will not be another public beta of Windows 7 .
The next public release will be RC1 .
Windows 7 is clearly on an aggressive release schedule .
There is no point waiting until the retail release of Windows 7 to complain .
Getting Microsoft to change anything in Windows after a version has shipped is like pulling teeth .
By then it is too late .
It may already be too late but we live in hope .
be too late but we live in hope .
Update : Windows 7 RC1 ( build 7100 ) is out now and nothing has changed in this area .
( A lot of other stuff has changed and it's a better version of Windows , but the UAC / injection stuff still works like it used to . )
It now seems even more unlikely that anything will be changed in time for the RTM , especially as MS still have n't replied to my offers to give them full details .

I�ve been trying to resolve what�s behind the recent inversion of the historic premium that West Texas Intermediate [ WTI ] Crude Oil has enjoyed versus Brent Crude ?
Historically , West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil trades at a premium price to Brent Crude Oil for quality as well as logistical reasons .
In recent weeks and months � WTI has been trading at a deep discount to Brent Crude : From an historical perspective , this price disparity pictured above is BACKWARDS .
There is a reason :
Recently , I shared with my subscribers some unusual machinations which are acknowledged to have occurred by the U.S. Dept. of Energy [ DOE ] back in May / June 2008 � from the DOE 2008 annual report :
The excerpt above illustrates that the DOE stopped filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve [ SPR ] as of last June [ 2008 ] � an activity that had been underway � more or less continuously � since 1999 .
But the above excerpt says more than just that ; it specifically states that , � Oil from the MMS offshore leases has been exchanged for other crude oil �
The �exchange� cited in the aforementioned quote above is also known as an � OIL SWAP .�
Where Else Has the U.S. Government Done Swaps ?
There is proof that the U.S. Government is involved in Gold Swaps .
From James
Turk�s ,
The US Gold Reserve is Now in Play : I have long suspected that the US Gold Reserve is being used by the gold cartel as a tool to help it try capping the gold price .
See for example the April 23 , 2001 press release by the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee [ http://www.gata.org/node/4223 ] which refers to my then recently published article , � Behind Closed Doors� .
The complete article is available at the following link :
http://www.fgmr.com/clsddoor.htm
� Behind Closed Doors � provided compelling evidence that part of the US Gold Reserve had been swapped for gold in the Bundesbank .
Gold was then removed from the Bundesbank�s vault and loaned into the market as part of the gold cartel�s price capping scheme .
We now have more evidence that all may not be well in Fort Knox .
Many thanks go to Bill Rummel of Charleston , South Carolina for bringing the following to my attention .
The US Treasury quietly made a subtle change to its weekly reports of the US International Reserve Position , which includes the US Gold Reserve .
This change was first made on May 14th .
The differences can be seen by comparing the report�s old format release on May 8th to the new format used the following week .

Note the additional description of gold provided in the new reporting format .
It says the US Gold Reserve is 261.499 million ounces and importantly , that the gold is now reported �including gold deposits and , if appropriate , gold swapped� [ emphasis added ] .
This description provides clear evidence that the US Gold Reserve is in play .
Gold has been removed from US Treasury vaults and placed on deposit , presumably in the couple of bullion banks the Treasury has selected to assist with its gold price capping efforts .
The U.S. Treasury has only recently acknowledged that they have been involved in gold swaps .
Not withstanding , for accounting purposes , they still claim to possess the SAME NUMBER OF PHYSICAL OUNCES .
When gold is swapped or leased � it almost always physically leaves the vault and it is sold into the market � and it is replaced with an IOU .
As evidenced above , crude oil has also been swapped � likely sweet crude , WTI - for less expensive sour crude .
Under such a scenario � physical sweet crude left the SPR � creating a market glut of �premium sweet oil� .
This set off an engineered over - supply chain reaction in the crude complex which depressed WTI�s price relative to Brent Crude .
Because supply chain storage facilities are finite and were completely filled in the Texas / Cushing region � this also contributed to further price declines in the crude complex .
This would also explain the phenomena of the world�s VLCC [ very large crude carrier ]
Fleet being fully booked for storage purposes while the Baltic Dry Index is at or near record lows .
Like the price trend of gold - the price trend of WTI crude is widely viewed as a benchmark for inflationary expectations in the economy .
In the scenario described above , there would be NO APPRECIABLE ACCOUNTING CHANGE to the reported gross number of barrels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve [ SPR ] � but only the �subtle acknowledgement� of the composition alluded to in the DOE�s annual report .
We know that such actions were contemplated because of law makers � unsuccessful attempt [ in May of 2008 ] to pass a law making such actions legal and above board when H. R. 6067 failed to pass into law � because it was deemed to compromise long - term U.S. energy security : H.R. 6067 , The Invest in Energy Independence Act This item is from the 110th Congress ( 2007 - 2008 ) and is no longer current .
Comments , voting , and wiki editing have been disabled , and the cost / savings estimate has been frozen .
Detailed Summary ` Invest in Energy Independence Act - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to publish a plan to : ( 1 ) exchange light grade petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) for an equivalent volume of heavy grade petroleum plus certain cash bonus bids received that reflect the difference in the market value between light grade and heavy grade petroleum and the timing of deliveries of the heavy grade petroleum ; ( 2 ) deposit into the SPR Petroleum Account , from the gross proceeds of the cash bonus bids , the amount necessary to pay for the costs of the exchange ; ( 3 ) deposit 90 % of the remaining net proceeds from the exchange into the Energy Independence and Security Fund established by this Act ; and ( 4 ) deposit the remaining balance into the SPR Petroleum Account to acquire additional petroleum for the SPR .
So we do know that efforts were made to do this �above board� .
Heck , even then candidate for President Obama liked the idea , ANALYSIS - Obama oil plan may weaken U.S. emergency stockpile Tom Doggett
Reuters North American News Service Aug 07 , 2008 11:43 EDT WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's plan to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve may lower crude and gasoline prices in the short term , but it could also leave the United States more vulnerable in a supply emergency .
Obama called this week for easing fuel prices by releasing some 70 million barrels of light , sweet crude from the nation 's stockpile and swapping it for less expensive heavy , sour oil .
The hope is that putting more oil on the market will push down crude prices and those savings will be passed on to consumers at the gasoline pump .
Cheaper crude would make it more profitable for refiners to make gasoline , diesel fuel and heating oil , and encourage them to produce more of those petroleum products .
The additional supplies would lower the prices for the fuels .
" Would it bring down prices initially ?
Sure , " said Sarah Emerson , managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc , a Massachusetts - based consulting firm .
" It 's more supply and the price will go down . "
Obama says releasing oil from the reserve is meant to provide short - term relief for consumers , and is not a long - term solution to the nation 's energy problems� �
From all of this evidence � and yes it is EVIDENCE � it is now highly likely that after failing to gain legal authority to utilize sweet crude in the SPR � DESPERATE authorities � who , no doubt will wrap themselves in the flag and claim they acted in the name of National Security � DID CONDUCT oil swaps .
The timing of all these events lines up perfectly with the Waterfall decline in oil prices :
The smoking gun is the counter intuitive �lingering wide price discrepancy � with West Texas Intermediate trading at a big discount to Brent Crude Oil .

It ’s been almost a week since the state of New Jersey took Deborah Campbell ’s three children from her home and she says officials have yet to tell her and her husband why .
But Campbell suspects it has something to do with the names they bestowed upon their kids .
Not sure when she will be able to see her kids again , Deborah decided to break a judge ’s gag order and make a public plea for the return of her children .
" They belong home with their mother and father .
They do n’t belong out there in a stranger ’s home , " Campbell told NBC10 ’s Mike Strug Monday night .
Officials from the NJ Division of Youth and Family Services took the children -- Adolf Hitler Campbell , 3 , JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell , 1 , and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell , who will turn 1 in April – from the Campbell ’s home in Milford , N.J. last Tuesday , saying only that they felt the children were in danger .
“ They felt the children were in danger for their lives .
They did n’t say physically , mentally … nothing like that , ” said Campbell .
The Campbell ’s three children were dropped into the center of a media firestorm last December when they asked a grocery store in Greenwich , N.J. , to write “ Adolf Hitler ” on their son ’s birthday cake .
The store refused , saying it was inappropriate .
The store refused to give an apology when the parents demanded one .
A local Wal - Mart ended up honoring their request .
DYFS officials were tight - lipped when asked why the children were removed from the parents ’ care , citing confidentially laws , and local police would only acknowledge that they escorted DYFS to the Campbell ’s home the week before .
In an interview with the New York Times , The Campbell 's landlord Larry Lippincot said he would hear the kids playing late into the night and that the family would often argue with a family member who " threatened to firebomb the house : "
" Mr. Lippincott said he had decided — before the cake incident — not to renew the Campbells ’ lease when it expired in November because , he said , a relative they frequently argue with threatened to “ firebomb the house . ”
He expects to begin eviction proceedings soon .
“ They ’re not destroying anything , the house is clean and they pay their rent on time , ” he said .
But , he added , “ There comes a point when you say , ‘ Enough is enough . ’ ”
It is not clear if these circumstances have any bearing on DYFS ' decision , but Deborah has her own theory .
She believes the childrens ' names are to blame .
" The names , I believe are the problems .
But they just do n’t want to come out and say that , ” Campbell said .
The couple has defended the names of their children saying they reserve the right to name the kids whatever they like .
“ A name is a name , ” Heath Campbell said last December .
Jeanne Coverdale , the kid ’s aunt , offered an analogy to people who feel the names are in bad taste .
“ What about tomorrow night when the President of the United States stands up and say , is forced to say , my name is Barack Hussein Obama .
How ’s that going to hit the world ? ” Coverdale said .
" I 'm saying the one with the middle name he has , was a terrorist . ”
Coverdale says it ’s “ no different ” than having a name like Adolf Hitler .
Deborah insists they are not part of the Aryan Nation or fans of what Hitler is famous for and said the swastika tattoo her husband displays on his arm is simply art .
The Campbells are asking for an attorney to help them fight to bring the children home .
“ We would like you to please help us get my three innocent children back . ”

You are lucky my friend that you can read this post .
Being sight - impaired is not a situation you want to be in .
It gets even more complicated if you are blind and ca n’t even read Braille .
Luckily there is some though process being invested in the Braille Interpreter , a single - finger glove that features a tactile sensor , a Bluetooth headphone and interpreting software .
The index finger portion of the glove hosts the said tactile sensor .
Skim it over the Braille surface and it sends a feed to the main device housed on the back of the glove .
Over here the feeds are interpreted and beamed to the headphone via Bluetooth as voice data .
Skim - Interpret - Hear Voice ; nifty enough solution for those who ca n’t cope with Braille .

日本デジコムは2009年2月12日，米国のイリジウム衛星（写真）とロシアの通信衛星が2月10日の16時55分（世界標準時）にシベリア上空790kmにおいて衝突し，破壊されたと発表した。同社は，海外向けイリジウム衛星携帯電話サービスを提供している。
今回衝突したのは，米イリジウムのイリジウム衛星（約560kg）と，ロシアの通信衛星「Cosmos2251」（約900kg）である。両衛星とも破壊され，数百の破片が衛星軌道上に散乱したという。これらの衛星より低い約350kmの軌道には国際宇宙ステーション（ISS）があるが，米航空宇宙局（NASA）の発表によると，現時点では衛星の破片による障害の恐れはほとんどないという。
イリジウム衛星携帯電話サービスは，低軌道を周回する全66基のイリジウム衛星で提供されている。今回，そのうちの1基がロシアの通信衛星と衝突した。ロシアの通信衛星は，以前から機能を停止していたという。
イリジウム衛星はサービスを提供している66基以外に，数基のスペアが常に打ち上げられている。イリジウムによると，30日以内にスペアのイリジウム衛星が破壊された衛星の位置に移動し，現状に復帰するとしている。また，静止衛星と異なり，イリジウム衛星は低軌道を高速で周回しているため，一つの地域で長時間サービスを受けられなくなることはない。ただし，一時的に通信できなくなる可能性はあるという。

March 19 , 2009  --
In a move to quell the growing outrage over the massive bonuses given to employees of companies such as AIG , the U.S. House of Representatives voted today to heavily tax the money doled out by large companies that took federal bailout money .
As they debated the bill , Democrats said enough is enough .
" The American people have said no , and they have said , ' Hell no , give us our money back , ' " said Rep. Earl Pomeroy , D - N.D .
New York Democrat Charles Rangel said the companies need to " stop the thieving at taxpayers ' expense . "
" The only way to get their money back is to tax it back , " said Rep. Steve Israel , D - N.Y .
Should the Names of Those Who Received Bonuses Be Made Public ?
Tell ABC News .
Approved 328 to 93 , the bill would slap a 90 percent tax on the bonuses of any employee making more than $ 250,000 at any company that received federal bailout money .
However , the angriest voices today came from Republicans .
They accused Democrats of making the bonuses possible .
" Listen , this bill is nothing more then an attempt for everyone to cover their butt up here on Capitol Hill , " said House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" It 's full of loopholes . "
Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , echoed the sentiment , telling his colleagues , " Do n't come up with this political cover - your - backside language , trying to excuse all the people who are responsible for this in the first place . "
Rep. Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , called the matter a " scandal that 's brewing in Washington , " and said , " We need to have answers . "
At issue is a tiny provision in last month 's stimulus bill that exempted contracts signed last year from limits on executive compensation .
Call it the AIG loophole .
The loophole was part of measure written by Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , but he told ABC News that it was the Treasury Department that pushed for it during closed - door negotiations with House and Senate leaders .
" I was not in the room , " he said .
Geithner , Pelosi on Loophole
But House and Senate leaders were .
House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , told ABC
News that the language in the measure " never came to the House side .
...
It 's a matter of absolute fact and record . "
Asked if she opposed the final bill , Pelosi said , " The language that related to this is in the Senate bill . "
Speaking on the House floor today in support of the bonus tax , Pelosi said , " It just simply is n't right .
When there is a reward , a spelled - out - in - advance reward for those who will take undue risk -- when they fail , they get a bonus , the taxpayer gets the bill .
This must end . "
In an interview conducted by CNN today , Geithner acknowledged Dodd's " enormously important leadership role " but added that the Treasury Department " expressed concern " about the provision as the government wanted to " make sure it was strong enough to survive legal challenge .
" But we also worked with him to strengthen the overall framework , " Geithner added , " and his bill has this very important provision we 're relying on now to go back and see if we can recoup payments that were made that there was no legal ability to block . "
The bill approved by the House today still needs to pass the Senate , but the bigger question is whether it will stand in court if the companies or those who received the bonuses try to mount a challenge .
Daunting year ahead for Bay Bridge retrofit
Iron workers work on a temporary trestle for the new Bay Bridge single - tower suspension span on Wednesday , January 21 , 2009 .
The trestle , located on the north side of the current bridge , will serve as a temporary structure for the construction of the suspention tower .

Months of delays caused by welding troubles at the Chinese company that is building the pieces of the new $ 6.3 billion Bay Bridge make this an even more critical year than anticipated for the construction of the single - tower suspension span .
This already was expected to be a hectic period in the seemingly endless effort to replace the eastern span of the Bay Area 's busiest bridge to withstand a major earthquake .
After years of controversy , politics , planning and preliminary work , this is the year that commuters and bridge watchers will begin to see the structure 's soaring white suspension span rise from the waters of the bay .
They 'll also face a three - day closure of the bridge and a shift of traffic onto a curving detour that will slow traffic for the next three to four years .
" This is the moment we have been waiting for , " said Bart Ney , a Caltrans spokesman .
" This is the start of the suspension bridge . "
And it 's the end of a six - year - long operation to demolish and rebuild the San Francisco approach to the bridge .
On Monday , the Harrison Street off - ramp for westbound traffic will reopen at 5 a.m .
The barriers that slowed westbound traffic also will be removed .
A week or two later , the eastbound barriers will be hauled off , and the project will be completed .
The rebuilt approach means " the entire Bay Bridge from Yerba Buena Island to the Fifth Street ramps is seismically safe , " Ney said .
Dealing with delays
That , of course , leaves the east span .
Despite a six - month delay to fix the welding problems , Caltrans officials say the $ 1.4 billion suspension span is on track to be completed in 2013 - thanks to some extra time built into the schedule for unanticipated problems .
But Caltrans can't afford any other delays .
Officials are trying to make up for lost time by speeding fabrication of the bridge deck and tower pieces in Shanghai as well as the temporary trestle .
" We are very well aware that this project has been delayed many times by political delays , " said Steve Heminger , executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and a member of the three - person committee overseeing construction of the eastern span .
" This is really the first major construction delay .
We 've worked it out with the contractor , and we have picked up the pace . "
Yerba Buena Island and the nearby waters of the bay are busy with crews building the double - deck bypass , towers for the temporary trestle and the massive concrete beam that will support the west end of the suspension span .
To the south of the existing bridge , the framework for the first 900 feet of the 1,200 - foot - long bypass is in place , and workers are pouring the decks .
The final section will be one of the most dramatic steps of the project .
An engineering feat
The entire bridge will be closed for three days while crews slice through the steel of a 300 - foot stretch of the existing span near Yerba Buena Island .
That piece of bridge will be rolled to the north on a special set of rails .
Then the connecting piece of the bypass will be lifted into the air , set atop rails and rolled into place .
The equipment , and the process , will be similar to what was used during the September 2007 bridge closure when a viaduct just east of the Yerba Buena tunnels was demolished and a replacement was rolled into place .
The work is being done by C.C. Myers , the Sacramento - area contractor with a reputation for completing tough jobs with tight deadlines - such as the MacArthur Maze replacement and the Yerba Buena viaduct work - ahead of schedule .
" The big difference , " said Ney , " is that this time it will take place 150 feet in the air . "
Caltrans and the contractor have yet to pick a date for the aerial act .
Caltrans is eyeing Labor Day weekend , used for the 2006 and 2007 bridge closures because of historically light traffic , but is not sure if everything will be ready by then .
" We do n't want to rush things , " Ney said .
" Because if something happens and we lose that section , we 're not getting the Bay Bridge back for a long time . "
At least three cable television networks - National Geographic Channel , HGTV and DIY Network - are working with Caltrans to record the event .
Once the drama is done , traffic will be switched onto the bypass , where a slight curve will cause a 10 - 15 mph reduction in the 50 mph speed limit .
With the traffic shifted , the existing connection to the tunnels will be demolished and a link to the suspension span constructed .
Caltrans plans to award a contract for that work in July .
Finishing touches
Across the island , to the north of the current bridge , a temporary steel trestle is rising from Yerba Buena Island and the bay .
Towers , which will rise higher than the existing bridge , are being erected , and steel beams soon will reach between them , forming a structure that will support the suspension span 's steel deck pieces until the 525 - foot tower can be built and the bridge 's supporting cable slung over the tower and under the deck .
The deck and tower pieces are expected to begin arriving from Shanghai this spring or summer and continuing through the year .
A huge floating crane also is expected to be delivered this spring .
It will be used to lift the deck pieces and place them atop the temporary trestle , though cranes atop the temporary towers will be needed to lift the upper reaches of the 525 - foot white steel tower .
Once the tower and decks are in place , the cable will be slung over the tower and wrapped beneath the deck .
Then the temporary trestle will be removed , and the suspension span will stand on its own .
" I think we 're at the point now where everyone is excited about the suspension bridge , " Ney said .
" But we 've got some really tough times ahead . "
Comment
The individual right to take photographs is being threatened , and distrust of police and government motives in respect of photography is growing .
On Monday , the issue will be defiantly , peacefully raised as a mass demonstration , supported by comedian Mark Thomas , converges on New Scotland Yard to assert the right of snappers to take pictures .
The demonstration is a direct response to new powers that the police will acquire on that day under the Counter - Terrorism Act 2008 , which many fear will be used to further restrict and harass photographers .
This follows a year in which the issue of the individual right to photograph has rarely been out of the news .
The new law makes it an offence to elicit or attempt to elicit information about an individual who is or has been a member of Her Majesty ’s forces , a member of any of the intelligence services or a constable , " which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism , or publishes or communicates any such information " .
In line with the model used in related laws , the offence itself is " strict liability " : it is the gathering of information that will be deemed to be the offence , and a defence that the person had a " reasonable excuse for their action " is only allowed after the offence has been charged .
An obvious concern is that the police will quickly decide that any photograph of a serving officer is likely to be useful to a terrorist .
This new law would therefore allow them to clamp down on the practice – on which the police have previously voiced concern - of independent filming of police conduct at demonstrations .
As with all such powers , the government claim is that they will only be used where necessary .
However , the recent history of stop and search under the Terror Act 2000 gives good reason to be wary of any government claims in that respect .
Latest figures suggest that around one in a thousand stops under existing law result in an arrest - this , in turn , strongly supports the view that the police are not using these powers where they have grounds to suspect an individual of a particular offence – but are being used as a general stop - and - search power .
When it comes to photography , the list of " unfortunate incidents " to have taken place in 2008 is well - publicised .
Early in the year , the Met made few friends amongst the photographic community by running a poster campaign that urged the public to be on the lookout for suspicious photographers .
Throughout the year , there have been repeated reports of police – more usually community support officers ( CSOs ) - stopping individuals while taking photographs and demanding explanations from them under existing terror legislation .
These stops range from the questionable - the grounds for suspicion appear light to non-existent – to the potentially illegal , where the stop has been accompanied by a seizure of camera or deletion of photographs .
The counter - argument from police and government is that these incidents are exceedingly rare : people continue to take hundreds of millions of photos every year , and while these encounters , when they happen , are clearly intimidating to the individuals concerned , they affect a negligible fraction of the populace .
' Mummy , do n't ' : Woman kills her only daughter , 12 , after boyfriend says , ' It 's the child or me '
A mother murdered her only child after being told by her boyfriend : ' It 's her or me . '
Penny Boudreau strangled 12 - year - old daughter Karissa after Vernon MacCumber threatened to end their affair because he did not get on with the girl .
Boudreau drove her daughter to a deserted wooded area , knocked her to the ground and strangled her , a Canadian court heard .
Murder : Penny Boudreau leaves the funeral home with her boyfriend Vernon MacCumber following her daughter Karissa 's funeral service in February , 2008 .
Boudreau pleaded guilty to strangling her daughter after MacCumber told her ' It 's the child or me '
The heartless mother ignored her terrified daughter 's cries of ' Mummy , do n't ! ' as she pinned her down and wrapped a rope around her neck , prosecutor Paul Scovi said .
She then drove to a nearby river and pulled her daughter 's trousers partly off to make it look as if she was the victim of a sex attack , before rolling her into the water .
Boudreau later claimed her daughter had gone missing after they had an argument and made TV appeals for her return .
Two weeks later Karissa 's body was found on the banks of the river .
' Mummy , do n't ' : Karissa Boudreau 's last words as her mother strangled her
Boudreau was caught by undercover officers posing as gangsters offering to destroy any evidence police had against her .
She was charged with murder in June last year .
Boudreau broke down in tears in the courtroom in Bridgewater , Nova Scotia , as she pleaded guilty to murder and said : ' I 'm sorry . '
Boudreau pleaded guilty to second degree murder and was jailed for 20 years without parole .
Relatives wept openly in the courtroom as Karissa 's final hours were revealed by prosecutors .
The court heard that the single mother moved in with her boyfriend Vernon MacCumber .
MacCumber did not get on with the 12 - year - old Karissa , and issued an ultimatum that either she went or he would end the relationship .
Bourdeau chose to sacrifice her daughter 's life .
On returning home she threw away some of Karissa 's clothes to make it look like she had run away .
She also called her boyfriend to tell him her daughter had gone missing .
It is unclear if MacCumber knew what she had done .
The pair attended Karissa 's funeral together .
Police always suspected Boudreau but had no evidence to charge her after Karissa 's body was found in February 2008 .
Undercover investigators only learned the grisly details of the murder after a sting operation in which officers posed as organised crime bosses who convinced Boudreau they could destroy whatever evidence the police might have against her .
Boudreau took the bait and began talking .
She was charged with murder in June 2008 .
The judge Justice Margaret Stewart , looking directly at Boudreau , told her : ' You can never call yourself mother .
' The words , " Mummy , do n't , " are there to haunt you for the rest of your life '

US Energy Secretary Steven Chu has floated the idea of a carbon emissions tax to fight global warming , in an interview with The New York Times Thursday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
During the US presidential campaign , the notion was kept largely on the back burner as candidates were reluctant to promote the idea of costlier energy at a time when gasoline prices were soaring .
But since President Barack Obama ’s administration took office in January , Congress has been working on setting up a system for swapping greenhouse gas emissions quotas similar to the one used in the European Union .
And Chu said “ alternatives could emerge , including a tax on carbon emissions , ” the Times reported .

According to police figures , the bushfires have now claimed 33 people in the small hamlet of Kinglake and nine in Kinglake West .
Ten people have now been confirmed dead at nearby Marysville .
New deaths have been reported at Narbethong where eight people died and Yarra Glen which has one fatality .
The toll for St Andrews has been revised down from 10 to six .
A total of 19 people have been killed in Gippsland , with nine fatalities in the town of Callignee and one in Upper Callignee .
And much worse is still to come .
The Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , said : " Hell in all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria in the last 24 hours , and many good people now lie dead ; many others lie injured .
" I fear in the days ahead that the news is going to be bad and , I believe , the nation needs to prepare itself as full facts become known , " he said .
There were 31 active fires across the state as of 7.20 am today , with five - at Beechworth , Churchill , Murrindindi , the Kinglake complex and Bunyip - causing the most concern .
The Beechworth blaze has burnt 30,000 hectares and continues to threaten the communities of Stanley , Bruarong , Dederang , Gundowring , Gundowring Upper , Kancoona , Kancoona South , Coral Bank , Glenn Creek and Running Creek .
Strike teams are also working between Buxton , Marysville and Narbethong to clear access along roadsides into properties .
Among the first victims identified last night were Channel Nine 's former chief newsreader Brian Naylor , 78 , of Kinglake West , and his wife , Moiree .
Their daughter - in - law , who lived across the road , is believed to have survived with her two children .
The first victim named was Peter Avola of Strathewen .
And slowly , but surely , the names of the many other victims trickled in .
Rae Carter of St Andrews .
George Jackson of St Andrews .
John and Sue Wilson , whose home at Barwidgee Creek was destroyed .
Among the missing were the former Blue Heelers actor Reg Evans .
The towns of Kinglake and Marysville have been wiped out as if they had been bombed , and authorities are treating the disaster like a terrorist attack , with more than 330,000 hectares of land affected .
Almost half of Victoria may be declared a crime scene , with arsonists believed responsible for several of the fires .
Police said an offender implicated in the fatal fires could be charged with the offence of arson causing death , a crime with a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail .
NSW was lucky to escape .
Despite more than 50 fires blazing , there has been no loss of life or property , although one man was charged with arson over a blaze in Peats Ridge , on the Central Coast .
Police have also charged a boy , 15 , with arson over a small fire at Faulconbridge .
He is expected to face Parramatta Children 's Court in several weeks .
Marie Jones of Canberra , who was visiting a friend at Kinglake , said a badly burnt man had arrived at the property where she was staying with his infant daughter , and told her his wife and other child had been killed .
" He was so badly burnt . . . . his little girl was burnt , but not as badly as her dad , and he just came down and he said , ' Look , I 've lost my wife , I 've lost my other kid , I just need you to save [ my daughter ] ' , " Ms Jones said .
More than 70 people died in the Black Friday fires of 1939 , and 75 on Ash Wednesday in 1983 - 47 of them Victorians .
Senior police sources told the Herald they feared the final figure would be double that .
The military has been put on stand - by to provide assistance .
The first of several interstate victim identification teams arrived yesterday to help Victoria Police and coronial staff under a terrorist contingency plan framed in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 .
Bodies in burnt - out cars will have to be removed first so that roads can be opened to the public before gutted buildings can be combed for remains of the missing .
Victoria 's morgue was full last night - and hospitals and universities were being asked to store bodies until formal identifications could be made .
Some of the 80 people in hospital were not expected to survive .
Ten people remain in a critical condition .
The once pretty alpine town of Marysville was reduced to a tangled mess of smoking rubble and twisted iron .
Most residents were evacuated to nearby Alexandra , which was under threat from fire last night .
But some of those who left too late or stayed to fight the fire lost their lives .
The fire that began at the old Murrindindi sawmill near Yea earlier on Saturday raced across the Black Spur and razed the hamlet of Narbethong and then Marysville , house by house , street by street .
After one terrible hour Marysville was no more .
Few buildings escaped .
Every public building - including the police station , post office , telephone exchange - and the much - loved guest houses and a hotel , had been destroyed .
Worse was the fact that some of the gutted cars and buildings had human remains in them .
Names were unavailable last night but the few residents who stayed and survived talked numbly yesterday of one firefighter 's family being killed , of an age pensioner dying at home and of cars being found with human remains in them .
They hoped the toll was as few as five - but it could be much higher , they said .
Leigh Jowett , a third - generation resident , saved the old house he had grown up in - then helped his neighbours save theirs .
" There might only be 15 or 20 houses left in Marysville , " Mr Jowett said .
" There 's only three left in Falls Road - and the whole main street is gone apart from one motel . "
He listed the burnt - out buildings : the Marylands and the Cumberland guest houses , post office , police station , kindergarten , general store , time - share apartments , caravan park and the Marysville Hotel .
Graham Haycraft , formerly of Marysville , was distressed to hear his old family home had been destroyed but counted himself lucky to have moved out .
" My heart goes out to people who are part of my life . "
He expected to return to town for the funerals .

Indian mobile games publisher Indiagames was showing off a bunch of titles at the ShowStoppers event tonight , on the eve of Mobile World Congress 2009 in Barcelona .
They included the latest video trailer for BioShock .
Yep , the famously immersive PC first - person shooter is on course to appear on a mobile phone near you very soon , in two separate versions - 2D and 3D .
Watch the 3D trailer below , before seeing what Indiagames ' Sean Malatesta had to say about it .

So , we caught up with Malatesta at ShowStoppers , and asked him what he could tell us about BioShock for mobile , which Indiagames has licensed from 2 K Games .
" We have two different versions : a 2D version and a 3D version , depending on the phones , and it's gonna be outstanding ! " he says .
" The 2D version , even when I first thought of it , I said ' how can you do a 2D version of BioShock ?
I 'll tell you what : our guys and 2 K have really captured the essence of the game in a 2D format .
It 's really unbelievable .
It obviously does n't look like BioShock as you know it , but it gives you the same essence .
The guys are pretty proud of it . "
The game is currently going through its final approval stages , and will then take time to deploy , but Malatesta says " we 're getting close " - so it should be available soon .
In the meantime , the game is up for the Excellence in 3D award at the IMGA Awards this week , and Malatesta is hopeful that BioShock will be going home with some silverware .
" BioShock has been nominated as best 3D game , and we 're going up against a lot of great competition of course , including what I feel are some of the best developers , " he says .
" Just to be nominated is great .
We 've lost in that category for the last two years , so ... sometimes you have to lose before you can win !
Touch wood , we hope we can maybe come away with a winner this time . "
Shoulda ’s users have long enjoyed the brevity and simple , declarative nature of macros .
These test - generating methods cut the most common ActiveRecord and ActionPack tests down to one beautiful , readable line .
However , it does n’t seem fair in this time of unity to leave our RSpec brothers and sisters out in the cold .
If you like RSpec and Shoulda , but would just as soon never use the word Test : : Unit : : TestCase again , you have some good news in store .
Shoulda ’s ActiveRecord macros have been rewritten to use RSpec - like matcher classes under the hood .
That means that , providing you ’re using at least version 1.1.12 of RSpec , you can write model specs like this :
describe User do it { should belong_to ( : account ) } it { should have_many ( : posts ) } it { should validate_presence_of ( : email ) } it { should allow_value ( " test@example.com " ) . for ( : email ) } it { should_not allow_value ( " test " ) . for ( : email ) } end
You can see more examples in the Shoulda rdoc .
We ’ve also added a dash of detection so that RSpec users can just require ‘ shoulda ’ and be on their way - the ActiveRecord matchers will be mixed into your model examples automatically .
The ActionPack macros have n’t been converted yet , but that process is already under way , so stay tuned for those .
By Shoulda 3.0 , we plan to have every macro in Shoulda to RSpec users .
For all your loyal Test :: Unit users out there , you can keep using the same syntax you ’ve always used :
class UserTest < ActiveRecord :: TestCase should_belong_to :account should_have_many : posts should_validate_presence_of :email should_allow_values_for :email , " test@example.com " should_not_allow_values_for : email , " test "
end
Whether you like to TDD , BDD , test , or spec , Shoulda macros are available for a framework near you !
Thanks go out to David Chelimsky for helping to make integration with RSpec a possibility .
Update : if you ’re having issues with undefined methods when using Shoulda with RSpec via config.gem , try updating to Shoulda 2.9.1 .
Those of you familiar with Shoulda may have noticed the new names in the examples above .
If you ’ve ever had to dive into the Shoulda documentation to figure out if the method you were looking for was shouldrequireattributes or shouldrequirepresenceof or shouldneedtohave_a , the latest version will bring some peace to your mind .
Shoulda macros that directly corresponded to an ActiveRecord validation macro have been renamed to follow the fine example set by Rails :
# Before : should_require_attributes :name should_require_unique_attributes :email should_only_allow_numeric_values_for :age should_require_acceptance_of :terms_of_service # After : should_validate_presence_of : name should_validate_uniqueness_of : email should_validate_numericality_of :age should_validate_acceptance_of :terms_of_service
We ’ve also renamed should _protect_attributes and added a new macro for consistency :
# Before : should_protect_attributes : password # After : should_allow_mass_assignment_of :name , : email should_not_allow_mass_assignment_of : password
The old names still work for now , but you ’ll see deprecation warnings in your tests .
Every day we drive , take a cab , or use a subway , train , or bus to get to wherever it is we need to go .
On occasion , we pack our bags and jump on a plane , take a break from the day to day hassles of life , and go on vacation .
Still , no matter where we are in the world or where we are going , transportation plays a key role and knowing the types of environment we may be driving in can make day - to - day life and vacations safer and more enjoyable .
On the Move
In November , I decided to jump on that plane and fly half - way across the world to Bangkok , Thailand , on a five - month Southeast Asian tour .
For the past three months , I ’ve traveled by car , bus , minivan , train , motorbike , “ tuk tuk , ” taxi etc to get to temples , waterfalls , beaches , mountains , borders , guesthouses , Wats , and plenty of other tourist attractions .
On my journey , I ’ve grown to appreciate the steady chaos of driving back home in Los Angeles .
No Helmets , No Problem
One amazing aspect of driving in Southeast Asia is that motorbikes are readily available for rent everywhere regardless of whether or not you know how to maneuver one .
On the road , you will see many locals driving their scooters without helmets up and down the streets nearly crashing into everything -- not to mention cutting off every vehicle in their way .
Some drivers will have young children clutching their backs and others will have up to three other passengers squished together on the back .
You ’ll even see some tourists hobbling around with ace bandages wrapped around their ankles and legs from exhaust pipe burns , famously known in Thailand as real “ Thai tattoos . ”
Luckily in Thailand , most of the roads are paved .
Asia Motorbikes 101
Motorbikes are fairly easy to drive , even for inexperienced cyclists such as myself .
Manual , automatic , and semi-automatic bikes are available to rent at varying prices .
Of course , automatic motorbikes are the easiest to ride .
They are a point - and - shoot type of ride , meaning keep your right hand on the throttle and use your arms to steer .
It ’s that simple .
Still , I recommend not driving above 60 kilometers per hour ( about 40 mph ) until the handling becomes more natural .
Semi-automatics do not have a clutch , but still have a pedal for shifting .
Know that cars will drive uncomfortably close to your bike to pass you and other bikes will stop close and squish in at red lights and stop signs .
Always stay near the shoulder and do n’t forget into which lane you are turning .
On the Road : Picking Your Turn Lane
In Thailand , Malaysia , and Indonesia , the roadways ( as they are in Britain ) , are on the left - hand side , otherwise known back home as “ the wrong side of the road . ”
Driving on the opposite side of the road means a little bit more than sitting in a different seat .
One thing that is apparent is that making left turns becomes easier and right turns harder .
The trick is remembering into which side of the road to turn .
When my friend and I rented a car in Lang Kawi , a beautiful island off the western coast of Malaysia , I kept confusing my turn signal with the windshield wipers as well as always wanting to look to my upper right for the rearview mirror .
Thankfully , the gas , brakes , and clutch are all in the same positions .
To be safe , we paid the extra few Ringgits to rent an automatic car to avoid the trouble of left - hand shifting .
Unlike Thailand , Laos , and Indonesia , Malaysia seemed to be a very safe place to drive – paved roads , well - marked signs , and more cautious drivers .
However , we were on an island and not more chaotic cities such as Kuala Lumpur .
Holding the Key
Traveling abroad can open the gateway to new experiences and even a newfound respect for home .
Our world is one on wheels , where we can go to and from practically everywhere .
Sometimes we only need a driver ’s license to get there .
Knowing how to drive is more than just a means to an end .
What we tend to forget in our daily lives of stop - and - go rush - hour traffic is the pleasure of driving .
You do n’t have to fly across the world to know the joy of traveling .
All you need are the keys to your car .
Even if your journey is only a mile , make it a fun one .

She specializes in Search Engine Marketing and Optimization , web copy and editing .
Google is today rolling out a key upgrade to the algorithm powering its search engine which is based on " Australian - made " technology originally developed by a PhD student at the University of New South Wales .
The student was Ori Allon and the search engine process he developed at the university ’s Kensington campus in 2005 was called Orion .
In 2006 , Google acquired the rights to the Orion technology for an undisclosed sum and whisked Mr Allon , then aged 26 , off to the Googleplex - its sprawling headquarters complex in Mountain View , California .
Today , as a senior engineer with Google ’s search quality team , he is unveiling the fruits of the hard slog which turned his university project into an integrated component of Google ’s omnipotent search infrastructure .
In the world of online search , which is dominated by Google , the holy grail is to respond to a query with speed and relevance - a non-trivial task given the amount of content now clogging up the web .
Google ’s new search feature purports to “ better understand associations and concepts related to your search ” , and therefore to deliver a more meaningful search experience .
This is achieved by integrating a new technology into the Google search infrastructure that enables a better understanding of concepts and associations related to the search query .
All of it pocessed in real time and in any one of 37 different languages .
“ For some people it ’s going to be a big deal and for some people it ’s not .
So it ’s very subjective , ” Mr Allon said in a telephone interview .
“ [ But ] we are very excited .
We see many more opportunities for this technology now that it ’s integrated into the [ Google ] system . ”
Mr Allon , now a naturalised Australian , was born and raised in Israel and came to Australia in the mid-'90s .
After completing his bachelor and masters degrees at Melbourne 's Monash University , he moved to UNSW to further his studies and research .
“ Whatever I had in the [ Australian ] university it was very basic , ” he said .
“ Yes , it ’s based on the idea but we have made numerous improvements .
It was n’t able to do what it ’s doing now - which is to serve millions and millions of users a day . ”
And its not just all happening in the background .
Google users will see a new row of additional links at the foot of the first search return page under the heading “ searches related to ” .
“ I ’m very proud of this and I ’m very proud that it ’s coming all the way from Australia - all my education is from Australia , ” Mr Allon said .
And it ’s very satisfying to be able to compete with Stanford students , with Yale students , Harvard students and to be able to bring this kind of innovation . ”
Mr Allon 's PhD supervisor , Dr Eric Martin , a senior lecturer is computer science at UNSW , said that Google 's acquisition of the rights to Orion was unusual .
" We have quite a few students who come up with good ideas but making it commercially attractive is not that easy to do , ” he said .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
All 18 people aboard a helicopter that crashed off the coast of Scotland have been recovered alive , a Royal Air Force officer told CNN .
A Super Puma helicopter , similar to the one in this file photo , went down about 120 miles east of Aberdeen .
The Super Puma ditched about 120 miles east of Aberdeen while approaching an offshore platform .
" Everyone has been recovered from the water , " said James Lyon , assistant controller of the RAF 's aeronautical rescue coordination center at RAF Kinloss , Scotland .
" We do n't know their condition , but we believe there are no major injuries . "
Five helicopters were scrambled when the Super Puma helicopter ditched .
" Some were recovered by helicopter and some by boat from the platform , " Lyon told CNN .
The RAF was providing helicopter assistance to the Aberdeen Coast Guard in the rescue .
Lyon said earlier that rescuers had been picking up emergency signal beacons from the lifejackets of the 18 people .
He did not know if the pilot transmitted a mayday before the aircraft ditched .
View a map of the crash site »
" We believe it was quite close to the platform it was supposed to be landing on , " he added .
The area is home to a number of offshore oil rigs .
Lyon said he did not know which one the helicopter was heading to or where it was coming from .
The RAF received its first report of the crash at 6:43 p.m. ( 1:43 p.m. Eastern time ) .
Lyon said the Super Puma is regularly used to transport people to and from oil platforms in the North Sea and as far as he was aware it has a good safety record .
Weather at the crash site is relatively good , though slight fog is hampering visibility , he said .
A spokesman for BP told the UK's Press Association : " The 16 passengers and two crew who were on board have been accounted for and have been rescued .
Three people are on the ETAP Platform and a further 15 are on the Caledonian Victory rescue vessel .
" The priority of the company is the safety of all personnel involved in this incident and we have implemented our full emergency response procedures . "

He also cautioned that for Americans , “ it does n’t matter how many passports you have , you must enter and leave with a U.S. passport . ”

In addition , he recommended that anyone considering dual passports think first of the tax consequences and the potential for military service , though , he added , “ you can get exemptions for all of this because you ’re a U.S. citizen . ”
Israel allows anyone of Jewish heritage to use what is called aliyah , or the Law of Return , to become a citizen , but the military draft can be an issue .
Noam Greenberg , a press officer with the Israeli Consulate in New York , said that the maximum age for the draft is 28 for men and 22 for women , although married women are exempt at any age .
Americans can apply for exemptions .
The draft was an issue for Abdullah Daglioglu , an actor whose stage name is Neil Malik Abdullah .
Born in Austria to parents from Turkey , he has both nationalities , but avoided Turkey because , he said , “ I would have to do the military . ”
He lives in Germany and works on films throughout the European Union .
“ I can act in movies all over Europe , ” he said .
“ There ’s no visa necessary . ”
Mr. Daglioglu , who played one of the Sept. 11 terrorists , Ahmed al - Haznawi , in the British television movie “ Hamburg Cell , ” said he used his Austrian passport for the United States visa that he needed for part of the filming in Florida .
On paper , there was “ no background showing I am actually Turkish , ” Mr. Daglioglu said .
“ It ’s easier to travel with the Austrian passport because it is European , rather than the Turkish passport .
Everybody makes a problem when your last name is Abdullah . ”
Ruth Yoffe also has dual passports .

Last month , after his wife was nominated as secretary of State , former President Clinton attempted to put an end to speculation about his secretive overseas fundraising by disclosing the names of some 208,000 donors to his foundation , which has collected more than $ 500 million to pay for a presidential library and to combat AIDS , malaria and other scourges .
But nowhere on that list was the name Sakura Capital Management Co. Ltd .
In 2003 , Sakura , a short - lived Japanese American start - up , many of whose principals are not known , paid Bill Clinton $ 500,000 , the highest cash fee he has reported receiving for a speech , for a talk he never delivered .
As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes up Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s nomination today , she is expected to parry questions about whether she might be influenced in any way by any of her husband ’s donors by pointing to her husband ’s new openness .
But as the Sakura tale illustrates , Bill Clinton ’s sprawling business and charitable activities retain the potential to complicate his wife ’s work as the nation ’s chief diplomat .

“ I think it remains a tricky , difficult situation , the safeguards that are in place notwithstanding , ” said Robert Walker , former chief counsel of the House and Senate ethics committees .
“ President Clinton ’s [ previous ] fundraising from foreign governments and foreign entities poses the potential for appearances of conflict .
That ’s going to be there . ”
There are several unanswered questions about the fee from Sakura .
Why was it so high -- two or three times what he was paid for other speeches on the same trip ?
Why was the speech canceled by Sakura , and why was Clinton paid the full amount anyway ?
Not much is known about the company .
Sakura ’s former president , a New York securities dealer , says he knew only the last name of the partner who is said to have provided the money for the speech .
The Panama - based former chairman of the company was the also chairman of a bankrupt flooring company .
Bill Clinton ’s spokesman at the William J. Clinton Foundation , Matt McKenna , declined to answer most questions about the speech , but he confirmed the payment from Sakura to Clinton .
The former president donated the money to the foundation without taking a tax deduction , McKenna said , which he said was why Sakura ’s name did not appear in last month ’s disclosures .

The payment was listed as personal income to her husband in Hillary Clinton ’s Senate financial disclosure form for 2003 , he pointed out .
“ He gave the foundation the $ 500 K [ less expenses ] , paid the taxes out of his own pocket and took no credit or deduction , ” McKenna said .
Bill Clinton ’s involvement with Sakura was announced in a July 2003 news release written by veteran New York publicist Ken Sunshine .
Headlined “ President William Jefferson Clinton to Address ‘ Embracing Our Humanity : Global Security in the 21st Century , ’ ” it described an economic symposium hosted by Sakura to be “ attended by several hundred of Japan ’s prominent civic and business leaders . ”

Clinton ’s appearance was to have been sandwiched between appearances in South Korea on Nov. 14 , 2003 , and Nisshin City and Kyoto in south - central Japan on Nov. 19 .
His fee was double the $ 250,000 he was paid for the South Korea and Nisshin City speeches and more than triple the $ 140,000 he collected for his Kyoto appearance , according to Hillary Clinton ’s financial disclosure forms .
Sunshine said he wrote the releases at the request of John Matthews , a New York securities dealer who was listed as Sakura ’s president .
Sunshine said Matthews was a friend from Democratic political circles .
Matthews managed an office for the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1980s .
Sunshine ’s news release stated that “ John Matthews , a financial services consultant , heads both offices in New York and Tokyo as president . ”
For his part , Matthews insisted that he had only a minor role in Sakura .
“ I was peripherally involved , ” he said .

Matthews said he invested no money in the company and understood that financing came from a “ Mr. Tanaka ” in Tokyo .
Matthews said he never met Tanaka , did n’t know his full name and had no telephone number or other contact information for him .
Matthews said he dealt with Tanaka on the telephone and put him in touch with Clinton ’s representative , the Harry Walker Agency of New York , which did not return messages seeking comment .
About a month before the Nov. 17 , 2003 , date scheduled for the speech , Matthews said he received a call from Tanaka announcing the cancellation .
“ My guess is the [ Japanese ] partners had a fight .
We were all supposed to go to Japan for the speech .
I was very embarrassed , ” Matthews said .
He said Tanaka was an acquaintance of Sakura ’s chairman , Facundo I. Bacardi , who lives in Panama .
In a biography on the Sakura website , Bacardi is listed as chairman and president of Nations Flooring , a bankrupt concern that eventually was liquidated .
Matthews is listed as a director of Nations Flooring .

Stan Brand , former general counsel of the House of Representatives , said that although Hillary Clinton was under no legal obligation to disclose details of the Sakura and other of her husband ’s engagements , such omissions could hamper her foreign policy work .
“ The question will come on a specific case .
She will be forced to deal with an issue in a country where a contribution was made .
The question will be ‘ what was the relationship ’ ” between Bill Clinton and the donor , Brand said .

Special correspondent Hisako Ueno in Tokyo contributed to this report .
… and 38 percent simply “ do n’t know ” what they want , according to a poll being conducted by Facebook in selected user ’s news feeds discovered by CNET .
The poll , which asks whether or not Facebook should return to its previous Terms of Service , follows yesterday ’s blog post by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , in which the company ’s founder defended the social network ’s policy of keeping your content indefinitely , even after you delete your account .
The uproar began over the weekend , when it was discovered that Facebook had altered their terms of service , to among other things , grant the company an “ irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license to use , copy , publish , stream , store , retain , publicly perform or display , transmit , scan , reformat , modify , edit , frame , translate , excerpt , adapt , create derivative works and distribute [ your content ] . ”
Looking at the results of the poll so far – which is presumably being conducted with a representative sampling of Facebook users – just about no one likes the change , as only 6 percent have indicated that Facebook should n’t change the ToS back .
And while “ Do n’t Know ” makes up a sizeable portion of the poll result , it ’s clear that the story has moved beyond technology blogs to become an issue at least a fairly significant portion of Facebook users are aware of .

Along those lines , the same type of protest we saw around the Facebook re-design is starting to transpire within the social network itself .
The group “ People Against the new terms of service ” has swelled to more than 60,000 members and appears to be adding dozens every few seconds .
And in perhaps an even more serious concern , The Electronic Privacy Information Center is set to file a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about Facebook ’s ToS , according to PC World .
As with Facebook ’s past transgressions , the problem seems to be less about the net result than the poor communication on the company ’s part .
While they blogged about changes to their terms of service back on February 4th , the changes to the part everyone is now furious about was omitted from that post .
And once again , the company ’s increasingly well - known CEO is hung out to dry , defending unpopular changes , as opposed to promoting all the exciting things going on at Facebook .
Meanwhile , since the poll is only being conducted with selected Facebook users , we figured we ’d open it up to everybody here .

Pakistan 's government today blamed Taliban elements for a bloody raid on a police training centre in Lahore in which gunmen killed 11 officers and cadets , seized hostages and held out against security forces for eight hours before being overpowered .
In the second brazen terrorist attack in the city this month , the assailants stormed the Manawan police centre soon after dawn .
Gun battles between the attackers and police and army officers surrounding the compound raged throughout the day , and there was a series of loud explosions .
The head of the interior ministry , Rehman Malik , said the militants were Pakistani Taliban elements loyal to Baitullah Mehsud , a commander who claims to have trained a succession of suicide bombers , and was accused of involvement in the December 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
Other experts speculated that a Punjabi group may have been responsible , though the lines between the various outfits trying to undermine the Pakistani state are increasingly becoming blurred .
The siege reached a climax at about 3.30 pm ( 11.30 am BST ) , when security forces were seen emerging on to the roof of a building where the gunmen had been holed up .
They began firing into the air in apparent jubilation at the end of the situation .
Officials said as many as eight had been killed and six captured ; Malik said one of the suspects was an Afghan .
He added that 52 officers had been wounded in the attack but gave no word on the number killed , while Geo News television channel said the toll was 20 .
The incident was the second major terrorist attack in the Pakistani city within a month after the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team .
On the roof of the building where hostages were kept , journalists were shown body parts , blood and spent ammunition strewn about .
Three loud explosions were heard from within the compound shortly after 1.30 pm .
Police speculated that at least some of the gunmen may have blown themselves up to avoid being arrested .
Other gunmen continued firing as troops and police prepared to mount an operation to retake the buildings , a reporter at the scene said .
Earlier , one suspect was seen being led away from the compound by a group of officers .
The gunmen opened fire on helicopters that were monitoring the situation , forcing one down .
One wounded policeman described how the attackers struck while police recruits were going through their regular morning drill on the parade ground .
" A grenade hit the platoon next to ours … then there was continuous firing for about 20 minutes , " the policeman told reporters from his hospital bed .
" A man in light - coloured clothes – I think they were white – stood in front of us , firing at us .
They wanted to do as much damage as possible . "
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , today condemned the attacks in a statement released by the Foreign Office in London : " It is deeply saddening that Pakistan has today suffered another deadly attack , this time against people dedicated to protecting Pakistan 's security .
" We condemn the attack unreservedly , and extend our sympathies to the families of the victims .
" The attack is yet another reminder of the threat that Pakistan faces from violent extremism .
It is a threat that the international community must help Pakistan to tackle , in the interests both of Pakistan 's people and of wider stability . "
" We are at a state of war , " Afzal Ali , the former head of Pakistan 's police academy , said : " This was a relatively soft target .
You ca n't expect recruits to take on hardened terrorists . "
Raul Castro said Cuba was not " desperate " to hold talks with the US Cuban President Raul Castro has said he is ready to hold direct talks with US President - elect Barack Obama , but played down any quick breakthrough .
Mr Castro described Mr Obama as an " honest man " , but said his election had given rise to " excessive hopes " .
He was speaking a day after Cuba marked the 50th anniversary of its revolution .
Mr Obama has indicated he will ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba but maintain the 46 - year US trade embargo on the island .
Speaking on state TV on Friday , President Castro repeated his previous assertions that Havana was ready for direct talks with the US " without intermediaries , directly " .
" But we are in no rush , we are not desperate , " he stressed .
Mr Castro said Mr Obama , who is due to take office on 20 January , could " do a great deal , could take positive steps " .
" A president is coming in who has raised a lot of expectations in many parts of the world , hopes that are too high , I think , " he added .
Muted celebrations
On Thursday , people across Cuba celebrated the anniversary of the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power .
Mr Obama has said he wants to meet Cuban leaders Speaking from the same balcony where his older brother , Fidel , declared victory on 1 January 1959 , President Castro predicted the revolution would survive another 50 years .
The festivities were muted as Cuba struggles with big economic challenges and the aftermath of three hurricanes .
The frail health of Fidel Castro also dampened the mood of celebrations , says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana .
The 82 - year - old has not been seen in public since undergoing major surgery almost 18 months ago .
Reacting to the anniversary , a White House spokesman said the US continued to seek freedom for the Cuban people .

Israel has lifted a ban on UN and foreign aid workers entering Gaza
The BBC is under pressure to air a charity appeal for aid to Gaza after other channels agreed to broadcast it .
Director general Mark Thompson has said by airing the appeal the BBC would risk reducing public confidence in its impartial coverage of the conflict .
But Communities Secretary Hazel Blears urged a review of the decision as 2,000 protested at the BBC's London HQ .
BBC
Trust chairman Michael Lyons voiced concerns over political interference in the BBC 's editorial independence .
Earlier , rival broadcasters ITV , Channel 4 and Five agreed to broadcast the Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) appeal .
It will be screened for the first time on Monday .
' Objective coverage '
In a blog message on the BBC website explaining the decision , Mark Thompson said : " Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programmes but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations .
" The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story . "
When we have turned down DEC appeals in the past on impartiality grounds it has been because of this risk of giving the public the impression that the BBC was taking sides in an ongoing conflict

Mark Thompson on Gaza appeal Send us your comments
He stressed the corporation would " continue to cover the human side of the conflict in Gaza extensively across our news services where we can place all of the issues in context in an objective and balanced way " .
Earlier on Saturday , police said at least 2,000 protesters gathered outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London , and chants of " BBC , shame on you " were heard as a petition was handed in to the corporation .
There were seven arrests at the rally - five people were arrested on suspicion of obstructing police at the Piccadilly Circus junction with Regent Street .
One person was arrested on suspicion of assault of police outside St Martin's in the Field , Trafalgar Sqaure , while another was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs .
Veteran politician Tony Benn , a speaker at the protest , said : " We can't ignore suffering in the interests of what the BBC call impartiality .
Disasters Emergency Committee Gaza humanitarian appeal : Launched by UK charities on 22 January to raise money for Gaza aid relief and reconstruction Participants : Action Aid , British Red Cross , Cafod , Care International , Christian Aid , Concern Worldwide , Help the Aged , Islamic Relief , Merlin , Oxfam , Save the Children , Tearfund , World Vision Information on 0370 60 60 900 or at DEC website " We can't allow others to die when we have an opportunity to save their lives . "
Earlier , ITV and Sky had been in agreement with the BBC that they would not air the appeal .
But ITV later reversed its decision .
Sky says it is still considering the Disasters Emergency Committee 's request .
The DEC - an umbrella organisation for several major aid charities - wants to raise funds for people in need of food , shelter and medicines as a result of Israel 's military action in the Gaza Strip .
Previous DEC appeals shown on multiple TV and radio channels have raised millions of pounds for victims of wars and natural disasters .
' Human suffering ' International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the British public could " distinguish between support for humanitarian aid and perceived partiality in a conflict " .
" I really struggle to see in the face of the immense human suffering of people in Gaza ... that this is in any way a credible argument , " he added .

" They [ the BBC ] still have time to make a different judgement to recognise the immense human suffering . "
Shadow international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said it was " clearly a decision for the BBC and other broadcasters " whether they showed the appeal .
But the Conservatives believed it should be played to allow the public to make up their own minds about the appeal , he said .
Liberal Democrat media spokesman Don Foster said the BBC's " disgraceful " decision must be reversed .
" It is unbelievable that the BBC claims to know better than either the government or the 12 major charities that form the DEC about whether aid can get through , " he added .
In a letter to the BBC director general on Saturday , BBC Trust chairman Michael Lyons expressed concern that the " level and tone " of some of the political comment was " coming close to constituting undue interference in the editorial independence of the BBC " .
He assured Mr Thompson the Trust would " do everything in our power to ensure that you are given the space to make the editorial decisions you feel , after due consideration , are right in the circumstances " .

BBC political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said the corporation was facing " quite a lot of pressure " , but its position had been shored up " a little bit " by the Trust 's move .
" In other words - a warning to government to say , ' Keep your tanks off our lawn , ' " our correspondent said .
Geoffrey Dennis , chief executive of the global humanitarian group Care International , said it was not a time for politics .
" As far as being impartial is concerned , that 's our job ... we know exactly what we are doing on the ground , there are a lot of people in real danger at the moment . "

Six years after the start of Darfur 's messy conflict and days before Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir is expected to be charged with war crimes , the steady stream of people arriving at the region 's aid camps is a reminder of the scale of humanitarian crisis in Darfur .
A United Nations - led military force is on the ground .
Government officials are subject to international sanctions and the world is demanding action .
Yet people like Yacoub Suleiman Hari are still staring death in the face , forced to flee their homes after recent attacks by the notorious government - backed Arab janjaweed militia .
He is one of 50,000 people displaced from the town of Muhajiriya in South Darfur after a rebel advance followed up by government and janjaweed reprisals in February .
More than 23,000 have trudged and trucked their way to the capital of North Darfur , filling already overstretched aid camps to the breaking point .
Thousands more have been arriving in Otash , on the outskirts of Nyala , the capital of South Darfur .
" We knew something like this was going to happen .
We had been afraid for a long time , " said Mr. Suleiman , as he put the finishing touches on his new home , a simple hut built from sticks covered with reed mats – a gift from his brother .
" Things had been very difficult with lots of small fighting , " he says .
" Then the janjaweed came and attacked our home . "
More than 300,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million people have been displaced since the conflict in Sudan 's troubled Darfur region broke out after rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
The town of Muhajiriya had been under the control of guerrillas loyal to Minni Minnawi , the only rebel leader to sign a 2006 peace deal with the government .
However , a spate of defections and fighting saw the town switch to another rebel group , the Justice and Equality Movement in January amid weeks of deadly clashes .
That was the signal for the government forces to retake the town , which they did with the help of air support .
Suleiman , a father of 30 , gathered up the seven children he still had living at home as gunmen on camels and horses swept through the town just as dawn was breaking .
They walked for two hours to a neighboring village before venturing back the next day to salvage what they could .
" There was nothing left .
All my animals were gone , my goats , everything , " he said .
His home had been torched .
The family 's remaining possessions – a battered suitcase and a sack of dirty clothes – were sitting in the new shelter .
All around , other families are trying to make their homes in the sprawling camp , already home to more than 70,000 people .
They face a constant battle against the dust that swirls through the air and the uncertainty of life in the camps .
Many of the alleys become no - go areas at night .
Gunshots and robberies are a daily hazard .
Suleiman arrived on Friday , a reminder that all the world 's efforts to resolve Darfur 's multilayered conflict have made little difference to more than 2 million people forced into camps for their own protection .
Once again aid agencies are faced with a fresh emergency .
Toby Lanzer , the UN 's deputy humanitarian coordinator in northern Sudan , says the UN is now desperately trying to reach all the people displaced from Muhajiriya and surrounding towns .
" It 's a bad time to be on the move because the land is bone dry , " Mr. Lanzer says .
" It 's very difficult to reach people in rural areas , and we know there are places where there are thousands of people in dire straits . "
On Wednesday , judges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague will announce whether President Bashir will face charges for his government 's actions in Darfur .
The court 's chief prosecutor has presented them with evidence of war crimes , murder , and – most contentious of all – genocide .
They are expected to issue a warrant for Bashir 's arrest , their first for a sitting head of state .
All eyes are now on how Khartoum reacts .
Officials and government - controlled newspapers have gradually stepped up their rhetoric in recent days , preparing the ground for pro-Bashir rallies planned for immediately after the ICC judges announce their decision .
Bashir himself spoke at a mass gathering during the weekend .
" Where was international justice during the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , the bombing of Gaza , and the crimes committed in the prisons of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib ? " he said on Sunday .
Most diplomats and observers in Khartoum say the Sudanese government will avoid a knee - jerk response and take its time responding .
But no one knows for sure .
Aid workers in Sudan fear a backlash that could prevent them from reaching people in need .
" We are the ones on the ground , and while we will try to keep operating as normal , it is very difficult with all of this hanging over us , knowing that the government could easily expel some of us just to make a point that it is still in control , " said an aid worker , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Abdallah Adam Khatir , an independent analyst in Khartoum , said the government was preparing to maintain the illusion of business as usual .
" We have heard propaganda from officials and the president himself , " he says , " but they are all trying to play down the ICC and make it seem as if it is irrelevant . "
YAOUNDE ( Reuters ) - Cameroonian security forces have smashed up the street stalls , where thousands of people earn a living , to give the capital Yaounde a face - lift for a visit by Pope Benedict next week .
Pope Benedict XVI greets the crowd during his visit at the Campidoglio in Rome March 9 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Giampiero Sposito ( ITALY POLITICS SOCIETY RELIGION )
Pope Benedict makes his first trip to Africa as pontiff next week , visiting Cameroon before continuing to Angola to mark 500 years of Christian evangelism there .
“ My 10 years of investments have been ruined .
I do n’t know now what to do to survive , ” wailed Mariane Ngoupendji on Monday when she found her typing and printing shop reduced to rubble .
“ Will the Pope ’s visit replace what I ’ve lost ? ” she said .
Ngoupendji , 43 , collapsed weeping to the ground as youths pulled pieces of corrugated iron , girders and planks from the ruins , hoping to sell them or use them to build elsewhere .
Many people make their living through informal stalls or boutiques , selling everything from imported electrical goods to local produce in a country where millions of people live in poverty even though it boasts one of Africa ’s biggest economies .
But authorities say the stalls , ranging from simple wooden shelves to secure lock - ups built with steel and concrete , are an eye - sore and began to tear them down last week .
No compensation will be offered , the government said .
“ On Monday the authorities of the Yaounde urban municipality continued pulling down illegally erected structures down in the town center with the support of security forces , ” state radio reported on Monday .
“ They vowed that the process will continue as part of efforts to embellish the city and give it a new face - lift . ”
Yaounde council officials could not be reached for comment .
Security forces have deployed in large numbers to prevent trouble .
Previous attempts to clear traders from African cities have triggered widespread violence , including in Senegal before last year ’s Organizationof the Islamic Conference summit .
Police beat youths and stallholders at the weekend on Yaounde ’s Avenue Kennedy , where many hawkers sell cell phones and other electrical items imported from Dubai , witnesses said .
“ I saw gendarmes and police chasing after fellow Cameroonians , beating them up with such ferocity and smashing their goods , ” said a Cameroon Telecommunications company worker , who watched from a third storey window as police cleared stalls near Avenue Kennedy on Saturday .
“ Why not simply ask them to assemble their goods and move away instead of destroying everything .
Must the Pope ’s visit bring so much trouble for the people ? ” said the worker , who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals .
But a senior police officer said stallholders had refused to comply with several previous requests to move on .
“ Now , with the Pope coming , the authorities are left with no other choice than to use force to get them out , ” he told Reuters .
“ African traditional hospitality demands that you keep your house clean when expecting a guest . ”
Visa Tests Credit Card With Random Number Generator
Built - in second factor of authentication could slow online card fraud
Visa is testing a new credit card that can generate a random - number passcode to help ensure it wo n't be used by unauthorized individuals .
In trials starting this week at four banks -- Bank of America UK , Corner Bank in Switzerland , Cal in Israel , and IW Bank in Italy -- Visa and EMUE Technologies are testing a Visa PIN card , an alternative to the " CCV " code currently printed on the back of most cards to help ensure that the individual is actually in possession of the card .
The technology was first introduced in June .
An alphanumeric display and keypad is built directly into the card .
When making a transaction online , customers type their PIN into the card , which creates a one - time security code .
That code can be entered into a Website or given to a phone operator to help reduce " card - not - present " ( CNP ) fraud , the companies said .
The card features a battery that lasts three years .
A number of banks have expressed interest in the card since its introduction this past summer , according to Visa .
" The interest in this solution in the industry has been overwhelming , " said Sandra Alzetta , head of innovation and new products at Visa Europe .
" We look forward to working with the banks involved in the pilots to gain greater insights into how effective this solution can be in the longer term . "
Visa has experimented with other CCV replacement schemes , including Verified by Visa , an ill - fated process that was found to be flawed -- hackers were sometimes able to reset the password by stealing the card 's details and the user 's birth date .
Security experts pointed out that the new card is still vulnerable to man - in - the - middle attacks , in which the attacker sets up a false site and fools the user into giving away a valid PIN .
But officials at EMUE say that the cards could be loaded with digital signature technology , which would make attacks much more difficult .
The trials will go for six to 12 months , raising the possibility that the technology might be more widely available late next year .

In the last three months , Amnesty International has received reports of waves of arbitrary arrests and harassment , directed particularly against members of Iranâs religious and ethnic minority communities , students , trade unionists and womenâs rights activists .
These measures may in part be intended to stifle debate and to silence critics of the authorities in advance of the forthcoming presidential election in June 2009 .
Amnesty International is calling on the Iranian authorities to end such repressive measures and to uphold the rights to freedom of belief , expression , assembly and association .
Scientists were surprised to learn that Bonnie the orangutan , shown here , can whistle .
Turns out she 's not the only one , it seems .
When the mood strikes her , Bonnie whistles .
She 's not very good at it — she utters only single notes and can't carry a tune .
But do n't judge her too harshly ; as an orangutan , she 's the first nonhuman primate ever documented to whistle , or to spontaneously mimic the sound of another species .
Now thirty years old , Bonnie lives at the Smithsonian 's National Zoological Park in Washington , D.C.
In the 1980s , she probably heard a happy caretaker whistling , and she soon made whistles of her own , seemingly just for the fun of it .
Recently , a team of primatologists , led by Serge A. Wich of the Great Ape Trust of Iowa in Des Moines , took a closer look at Bonnie 's abilities .
By comparing recordings , they confirmed that the sounds she makes are nothing like normal orangutan sounds or vocalizations , and that her whistling tends to be imitative .
For example , she usually replicates the duration and number of whistles ( one or two ) that caretakers produce in front of her .
Other orangutans and chimpanzees known to produce unusual sounds have typically received extensive training — yet Bonnie is n't alone in her spontaneous whistling .
Another National Zoo orangutan named Indah also took up the habit , but died before she was recorded .
And Wich says that since publishing , he 's heard from workers at other zoos with whistling orangutans in their care .
The research was detailed in the journal Primates .
On a typical cleaning day in a typical Canadian home , levels of chemicals in the indoor air can be hundreds , even thousands of times higher than the outdoor air in the most polluted of cities .
In fact , indoor air pollution levels would be high enough to trigger an inspection by health and safety authorities in any workplace setting .
( The Nature of Things , CBC - TV 2002 ) .
Many chemicals contained in household cleaning products are the same as those used in industrial settings .
Many scientists are now becoming concerned that long - term low - level exposure to chemicals may be just as dangerous as short - term high - dose exposures .
They also worry that we do not understand the impact of exposure to the cocktail of chemicals found in household air and dust .
Testing for human health effects is normally done on single chemicals .
But in the real world , we are all exposed to a variety of chemicals every single day .
Prior to WWII most household cleaning tasks were accomplished using relatively safe ingredients commonly found in most homes .
With the proliferation of petroleum - based chemicals after the war , corporations began to manufacture ready - made cleaning products .
Today , most people are accustomed to buying a wide range of products custom - designed for the many surfaces , materials and rooms in their homes .
Most cleaning chores can be easily handled without these toxic products .
Everyday ingredients like baking soda , vinegar , salt , lemon juice , vegetable oil , soap , borax , hydrogen peroxide and washing soda can do the job as they did in olden days .
Consumer demand and recognition of the hazards of many chemical ingredients are leading more companies to manufacture less toxic cleaning products .
The ingredients contained in conventional petrochemical - based cleaning products are not usually listed on labels .
Many , but not all , less - toxic products will have ingredients listed on their labels .
Following is a list of some of the most common toxic chemicals found in household cleaning products ; however there are many others .
Common Hazardous Ingredients in Cleaning Products
Acetone - A neurotoxin , acetone may cause liver and kidney damage , and damage to the developing fetus .

Less - Toxic Household Cleaning Products
Air Freshener , Deodorizer , Odour Remover
Far from freshening air , chemical - based air fresheners and deodorizers add dangerous chemicals to the air we breathe .
Air fresheners work by using a nerve - deadening chemical that interferes with our sense of smell , by coating nasal passage with an oily film , by masking an offending odour with a different odour , or by deactivating the odour .
Air fresheners are made from a number of chemicals including formadehyde , a carcinogen and sensitizer , naphthalene , a suspected carcinogen , xylene , a neurotoxin and possible reproductive toxin , butane gas , a neurotoxin , cresol , ethanol , phenol and strong fragrances .
Some solid deodorizers include the pesticide paradichlorobenzene , a carcinogen which can also cause liver and kidney damage .
Aerosol air fresheners release chemicals as tiny particles which can be inhaled deeply into lungs and transferred into the blood stream .
Plug in air fresheners break chemicals into even smaller particles .
The key to freshening air is to remove or dilute the offending odor ( by cleaning , ventilation or absorption ) , not to cover it with another chemical .

Disinfectant
It 's doubtful whether disinfectants are needed at all for most household uses .
Ordinary cleanliness is sufficient to eliminate hazardous bacteria .
Soap , water and rubbing ( the old " wash your hands " requirement ) is the best method to prevent disease .
The fad for disinfectants and anti-bacterials is based on a false fear of germs .
Homes do not require the same types of cleaning as hospitals , where disease and infection is common .
Besides being a waste of money , some brands of disinfectants use highly caustic chemicals like sodium hydroxide , sodium hypochlorite and phosphoric acid that can burn eyes and skin .
Breathing vapours can burn lungs .
Disinfectants may also contain phenols which can damage DNA as well as the liver , kidney and nervous systems , cresol , a suspected carcinogen and respiratory toxin , formaldehyde , a carcinogen , sensitizer and suspected central nervous system depressant , chlorine , a lung irritant , and alcohol .
There are more than 300 different active ingredients approved for use in anti-microbial products , ingredients classified by the EPA as pesticides , because they kill microbes .
In the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases , Dr. Elaine Larson wrote that because of potential health risks , antibacterial agents and disinfectants should be reserved for hospitals and home care of patients with suppressed immune systems .
Scientists are also concerned that products containing antibacterial and anti-microbial agents kill beneficial bacteria and contribute to the creation of antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
Not all bacteria will be killed by antibacterial agents .
The surviving bacteria are resistant to antibiotics and go on to produce new generations of resistant bacteria .
Triclosan , one of the most popular antibacterial agents , creates dioxin , a carcinogen , as a by - product .
Triclosan is a derivative of 2,4 - D , an herbicide .
There is concern that use of antibacterial products may affect human health .
A Swedish study found high levels of this bactericide in human breast milk .

Drain Opener
Drain cleaners usually contain sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite , which can cause permanent damage to skin and eyes on contact .
Vapours can burn lungs .
These chemicals are often mixed with ammonia or volatile petroleum distillates .
Drain cleaners may also contain dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride , a severe eye and skin irritant , and dichlorodifluromethane , an eye irritant which is also neurotoxic .
Drain cleaners may be fatal if ingested .
Biological products containing stabilized enzymes and bacteria are less toxic , equally effective and more environmentally friendly .

Dry Cleaning
Conventional dry cleaning fluids contain highly toxic chemicals including tetrochloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , a carcinogen , central nervous system toxicant , and respiratory irritant , naphthalene , a suspected carcinogen and reproductive toxin , toluene which may cause damage to a developing fetus and is neurotoxic , and xylene , a neurotoxin .
They also contain benzene , formaldehyde and trichloroethylene , all of which are carcinogenic .
Many of these substances are also known to cause liver and kidney damage .
The US Environmental Protection Agency has noted that fumes from slightly damp dry cleaned clothing are a common indoor air pollutant .
Exposure to these chemicals occurs as they evaporate from clothing into indoor air , and when contact is made with skin .
Dry cleaning fluid has a half life of 40 days .
Water process dry cleaning is an excellent alternative .

The cleaning agent they use is fragrance free , and items cleaned this way have been tolerated by people with chemical sensitivities .
Serves many areas of Colchester and Cumberland counties .
Call Roop 's to find out if there is a drop off spot in your area .
Tips
Some clothing marked ' dry clean only ' does not actually need to be dry cleaned .
Manufacturers simply want to avoid disgruntled customers who may wash clothes incorrectly .
Generally , you can wash almost anything without harm if you know how to do it properly .
After all , how did people clean wool and silk before the age of petrochemical dry cleaners ?
If you must use conventional dry cleaning , remove plastic bag and hang clothes outside or in an area separate from living quarters to encourage evaporation of solvents .
This could take up to a week but will be faster the warmer it is .
The best option is to avoid buying clothes that need to be dry cleaned .
Washing clothes yourself and having them pressed by a dry cleaner can provide that crisp look without the chemical exposure , and for less money .

Dusting
Removing dust and dust mites is important , as they are a common trigger of allergic reactions .
It 's important to dust in a way that really removes dust , rather than raising it into the air where it will resettle later .
Microfibre cloths are excellent for dusting .
They are untreated and reusable .
The soft attachment on a vacuum can be used to remove dust from hard surfaces , the small hard attachment can be used on upholstered furniture , drapes and mattresses .
Make sure the vacuum you use does n't release particle ridden air into the room .
Sheep 's wool dusters will draw dust to them with an electrostatic charge - available from Lismore Sheep Farm , River John , NS , www.lismoresheepfarmwoolshop.com.

Fabric Softener
Fabric softeners are designed to reduce static in synthetic fabrics .
They serve no purpose with natural fabrics .
Fabric softeners may contain quarternary ammonium compounds ( quats ) and imidazolidinyl , both of which are known formaldehyde releasers .
For about 5 % of people , quats are an extreme sensitizer .
They may cause a variety of asthma - like symptoms , including respiratory arrest .
Exposure to formaldehyde can cause joint pain , depression , headaches , chronic fatigue and a variety of other symptoms .
In lab tests formaldehyde has caused cancer and damaged DNA .
Both quaternium and imidazolidinyl can cause contact dermatitis .
Fabric softeners work by leaving a residue on the fabric which never completely washes out .
It can cause allergic reactions through skin contact and inhalation .
Fabric softeners may also contain carcinogenic coal - tar dyes , ammonia and very strong scents .
When fabric softeners are exposed to hot water , heat from dryers or ironing , vapours may be emitted which can be deeply inhaled , increasing their impact .

A ball of aluminum foil in the dryer can reduce static cling without adding chemicals .
You may be able to dramatically reduce your use of fabric softener and still get the desired effect .
One person reports she puts a dab of liquid softener on a damp washcloth , places it in her dryer and reuses the same washcloth for many loads without adding more softener .
One bottle of softener lasts her years .
Tips
To reduce static in synthetics , run dryer on “ air dry ” or “ no heat ” setting when laundry is almost dry , then hang clothes up until completely dry .
This will also reduce the need for ironing .

Vacuums
Vacuum cleaners work by sucking air , along with dirt and debris , into a paper or cloth filter bag .
In theory , dirt and debris stay in the bag while the air is exhausted back into the room .
However , a large percentage of the particulate matter ( very fine particles ) is often blown back into the room , depending on the quality of the vacuum cleaner .
Particulate matter can contain dust mite fragments and feces , soil , lint , human and pet hair , human and pet dander , mould spores , pollen grains and pesticide residues .
Vacuuming can provoke allergic and asthmatic attacks in susceptible people .
A good quality vacuum is especially important where there is carpeting , as carpet can store a large amount of contaminants .
Best
Central Vacuums - Central vacuums vented outside eliminate the problem of recirculating particulate matter .
The motor can be located away from the main living area , reducing noise and any fumes created .
Central vacs can be vented indoors but outdoor venting is cleaner and healthier .
HEPA - Filtered Vacuums -
Many vacuums now use HEPA filters .
HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Arresting .
These filters are made of synthetic materials so that most particulate matter cannot pass through .
There are varying qualities of HEPA vacuums .
People with severe allergies will want a true HEPA vacuum while people interested in capturing just moulds and pollens can opt for a less expensive HEPA - like vacuum .
( Some older vacuums can be retro - fitted with HEPA filter attachments . )
More efficient vacuum cleaner bags , designed to capture more of the particulate matter , can be purchased to fit some regular vacuums from vacuum cleaner shops .
Any vacuum filter is only as good as the seal around the filter which prevents leakage .

It 's not exactly a secret that for companies like ATI and NVIDIA it is hard to keep the rumor mill under control .
It was early January this year already that certain details surfaced on this lovely wise web hinting about the fact that ATI was working on 40nm products .
Weeks later another rumor surfaced , some 40nm products should be arriving in the April / May timeframe and among the new products would be a chipset that carries product codename ( ASIC name ) RV740 , slated as the first 40nm release .
And that 's interesting all by itself .
Now .. the technology industry works in mysterious ways and a pre-production model , slash prototype RV740 board to Guru3D.com arrived at our office a couple of days ago .
Not being tied to an NDA , without further ado , lets meet and greet with that RV740 graphics chipset .
RV740 is positioned somewhere in the upper segment of budget level products .
We are sure this product is going to be cheaper than 99 USD / 89 EUR .
And considering where the product is targeted in the market , ATI is pulling a rabbit out the hat with a head the size of an elephant .
Why ?
What can you expect ?
Well , from what we see ... performance is really close to the performance level of a Radeon HD 4850 .
So meanwhile others are re-labeling and reinserting their products at a new price point , ATI is moving forward with more interesting steps .
Smaller die -size , more shader processors ( compared to RV730 ) , oh and that life - size rabbit I just mentioned ... it 's GDDR5 memory .
We are going to bring you guys a nice little sneak preview of what ATI is working on .
Let me clearly state , nothing in this review is finalized or can be seen as a concluding fact , the specifications ( clock frequencies ) and configurations might change for all we know .
We are testing an early engineering sample here .
It will however be a pretty good assessment of what ATI is going to release somewhere in April .
You guys ready ?
Let 's meet the RV740 , and though we do n't know it 's real name just yet , allow us to call this product the Radeon HD 4750 for the ease of understanding , product placement and well ... the sake of the most logical name for this product , mmhh okay ?

Survival+ : Chapter Two ( March 25 , 2009 )
Let 's begin by considering Context One : Human Nature in more depth .
Entire libraries have been written on the subject of human nature , but for our practical purposes those which probe humanity 's " default settings " such as Jared Diamond 's The Third Chimpanzee : The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal and E.O. Wilson 's Sociobiology : The New Synthesis are the most useful .
Although we can slice and dice complex human responses in hundreds of ways ( for instance , Who am I ?
The 16 Basic Desires that Motivate Our Actions and Define Our Personalities ) , for the purposes of a stripped - down practical analysis we can group our " default responses " into four basic categories : inertia , fear / panic , casting our lot with a " Big Man " / leader or fatalism / giving up .
Since we cannot sustain the emotionally charged state of fear / panic ( " fight or flight " ) for long , decisions made in this instinctive mode tend to be rash , hasty , impulsive and poorly planned .
Thus the key is to recognize this mode and consciously avoid making decisions with long - term consequences while in the grip of this " instant response " survival - mode .
Humans , like our relatives the chimpanzees , are social animals .
Like chimps , we are " wired " to form groups and select / follow leaders who reach their high status by offering something back to the community : protection , " potlatch " type sharing of wealth , etc .
We will examine this political / social response to crisis in a later section .
But humans also have the capacity to be alone , like our other primate relatives the orangutans .
Thus withdrawing from the community has deep roots in human nature and history .
Being creatures of habitand habits are a survival mechanism , for why change anything when " everything 's working " ?-- humans prefer the status quo until crisis forces us to change .
The underlying state in this inertia / attachment to the status quo is complacency , which acts as a cognitive and emotional " attractor " or trap , as does fatalism / withdrawal .
Complacency and Fatalism Complacency and fatalism are both seductive " cognitive traps " and emotional " attractors " which we have to avoid if we are to think clearly .
Each is an " attractor " because each is highly appealing for several fundamental reasons .
1 . Human nature veers between these basic social / anti-social emotions : complacency / status quo ( inertia ) and fatalism / resignation ( withdrawal ) .
2 . History reveals these attractors ( complacency and fatalism ) were active in previous great declines / collapses , such as the Roman Empire circa 400 - 576 C.E. ( see below ) 3 . Humans prefer simplistic " answers " to challenges / problems , and a blind faith in the status quo or resignation both fit the bill .
Complacency is best understood as what 's expressed in the phrase , " Do n't worry , it will sort itself out on its own . "
In stable " normal " times , this complacency is usually rewarded ; various corrective feedback loops within complex systems kick in and problems are met with countermeasures that act to restabilize the system .
But in very dynamic eras , destabilizing factors overwhelm the usual corrective feedback mechanisms , and things do not sort themselves out .
Dramatic , even radical action must be taken .
In these times , complacency is not a practical or helpful strategy : it is a soothing but dangerous cognitive trap which guarantees the believer will be unprepared for the challenges just ahead .
In the cognitive trap of fatalism , we recognize the risks / dangers of the situation but feel helpless to correct or solve the problems .
In this trap , we remove ourselves from action and give up , dooming ourselves to being swept up by whatever passing winds arise .
The goal here is to avoid these traps , analyze the challenges we face clearly , and then plan out a simple but interconnected three - part strategy for not just survival but prosperity and security .
Complacency can take many forms .
For instance , a person who has prepared themselves for a doomsday collapse of civilization , i.e .
" The end of the world as we know it " ( TEOTWAWKI ) may well find themselves ill - prepared for an equally probable slow decline in social cohesion and living standards .
That is , living conditions in highly developed nations may descend not to a Collapse of Civilization into Chaos but to a Third World level of stable impoverishment .
This highlights the need to ground our analyses and expectations in history not because it repeats , but because it rhymes .
No one can know the future , so we must be cautious about putting all our eggs in one basket / scenario .
Prudence suggests always maintaining a skeptical point of view : what if we 're wrong ?
What 's our Plan B/ alternative strategy ?
Fatalism is similarly devious .
People who withdraw from society are certainly taking action , but they have surrendered the opportunity to influence the outcome positively : that is fatalism of the first order .
If you 're reading this , then you have already advanced beyond the naïve complacency of " do n't worry , everything will work itself out " which is mesmerizing large segments of our citizenry .
You may well be a member of The Remnant more on that later .
The Politics of Complacency and Fatalism In Greek mythology , two sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis forced sailors into an unsavory choice of facing one or the other when navigating the Strait of Messina .
In modern vernacular , we might say the sailors were " between a rock and a hard place . "
Our " default mode " responses were selected for a hunting - gathering lifestyle ; humanity has pursued agriculture for perhaps 5 % of its long history as homo sapiens sapiens and dealt with advanced technology for perhaps 1 % of its history .
The consequences of these unconstructive responses can be seen in the advanced civilizations ( Mayans , Rome , etc. ) that collapsed despite a wealth of experience and knowledge .
As a result , even as we work at devising rational , long - range solutions , we will be fending off the " monsters " of complacency and fatalism every inch of the way .
Analyzing challenges and then plotting out practical solutions is arduous , precarious work , as the answers are rarely clear and painful trial - and - error attempts are often the only way forward .
Rather than engage in this difficult process , many find doing nothing ( complacency ) or withdrawing ( fatalism ) much less risky and demanding .
This inaction feeds on itself , setting up a point - of - no - return that could have been avoided by bold action when the problems were first visible .
Humans cannot remain in the high - stress " fight or flight " status for long ; we seek a resolution or equilibrium , both intellectual and social .
Thus the most constructive approach is to assess the challenges in a clear - eyed fashion , hashing out the strengths and weaknesses of each major strategy .
Then make a decision , and commit to giving the chosen strategy the time , resources and unity it needs to succeed or fail conclusively , perhaps , at which point we make a reassessment based on what we 've learned from the experience .
At every point in this process , two new temptations arise : to either leap erratically from strategy to strategy as a short - term desire ( " fight or flight " mode ) for instant results sabotages any long - term effort , or to tire of the process of negotiation and analysis and give up any sustained effort .
Many who do engage the challenges will do so out of raw self - interest and thus they will base their solutions on inflexible ideological ( political and / or religious ) worldviews that are too rigid to be practical / realistic .
Rather than face the problems with an eye on actual solutions , these players seek to protect their own fiefdoms , privileges and benefits under the guise of emotionally appealing ideologies .
Faced with the loss of their sacrosanct ( to them ) privileges and benefits , they view the battle for diminishing resources as a " fight to the death . "
In a real sense , their status and advantages are definitely at risk ; but ironically , by focusing on their ideological opponents instead of the actual problems , they seal their own destruction by insuring the collapse of the entire system .
Both ends of the political spectrum are prone to this frantic defense of the failing status quo : the plutocracy / holders of wealth and those drawing benefits / welfare .
This too mirrors the experience of the Roman Empire 's decline , which saw massive expansion of wealth disparity ( those at the top gained ever more wealth at the expense of the middle class ) even as an ever - growing army of unproductive recipients at the bottom received the infamous " bread and circuses " of free bread and public entertainments .
As a consequence of this rabidly self - serving political battle over diminishing resources and surpluses , those championing flexible , practical solutions are crowded out by the shrill , desperate voices of those protecting their fiefdoms and privileges .
The result is a profound disunity in the body politic in which compromise is abandoned and common ground vanishes .
As external and internal threats increase and surpluses / resources shrink , the culture and economy are frozen into warring camps , each of which seeks to undermine the other rather than actually address the severe problems facing the entire body politic and economy .
All these forces complacency , fatalism , fanatic self - interest , ideological rigidity at each end of the political spectrum and political disunity pose enormous challenges to those seeking long - term solutions to critical problems .
If we seek historical examples of the immense power of complacency , we need look no further than the Western Roman Empire .
For an explication of just how destructive such deep complacency can be , I turn to the excellent account of the causes of the Roman Empire 's collapse by Michael Grant , The Fall of the Roman Empire .
" Enmeshed in classical history , all he can do is lapse into vague sermonizing , telling the Romans , as many a moralist had told them throughout the centuries , that they must undergo an ethical regeneration and return to the simplicities and self - sacrifices of their ancestors .
There was no room at all , in these ways of thinking , for the novel , apocalyptic situation which had now arisen , a situation which needed solutions as radical as itself .
His whole attitude is a complacent acceptance of things as they are , without a single new idea .
This acceptance was accompanied by greatly excessive optimism about the present and future .
Even when the end was only sixty years away , and the Empire was already crumbling fast , Rutilius continued to address the spirit of Rome with the same supreme assurance .
This blind adherence to the ideas of the past ranks high among the principal causes of the downfall of Rome .
If you were sufficiently lulled by these traditional fictions , there was no call to take any practical first - aid measures at all . "
But fatalism , often expressed by opting out / withdrawing from society , can be just as destructive as complacency .
As Grant noted elsewhere in The Fall of the Roman Empire : " Considerable sections of the population of the later Roman Empire decided to opt out altogether .
In the first place , a large number of people , finding the social system intolerable , went underground and became its enemies .
But a second movement consisted of numerous men and women who merely abandoned the company of their fellow human beings and divorced themselves from the community .
And so as the final political and military reckoning rapidly approached , this substantial number of men and women was no longer available to contribute either to the actual defense of the Empire or to the revenue needed to pay for the defenders . "
Grant traces much of the intellectual justification for what might be termed " a fatal fatalism " to Christian thinkers like Augustine : " And so Augustine preached , as other had before him , that 'we do not want to have dealings with the powers that be . '
That is frank : a call to withhold service from the government .
Equally frank is his reminder that the Empire is bound to collapse anyway .
Augustine shifted the center of gravity so that the state is now a good deal less that half of what matters : far from helping his own country to survive , his attitude contributed to its downfall .
But his suggestion that , since it was up to Providence whether the Roman world should collapse or not , human endeavor could do nothing about it in any case , met with the strong disapproval of thinkers such as Pelagius .
Pelagius ' reaction to the sacking of Rome in 410 by Alaric was by no means limited to fatalistic gloom and despair .
Both before and after the capture of the city , he found himself deeply dissatisfied with the moral sluggishness of many prosperous people of Rome .
He insisted on a strenuous individual effort to attain salvation : we sin by a voluntary imitation of Adam , and an equally voluntary decision can cast our sins behind us .
His doctrine of the will at least wanted people to try .
Augustine 's philosophy , on the other hand , led to fatalism .
Given the stupendous inertia of complacency , the fierce defense of the status quo from those contributing little but reaping plenty and the intellectual and emotional charms of fatalist surrender or withdrawal , those seeking practical solutions and strategies may well see the battle as essentially hopeless .
As tempting as that fatalism might be , there is hope offered by the Pareto principle : the influential few ( The Remnant ) can indeed lead the trivial many .
Opting Out / Opting
In
The desire to withdraw from a corrupted , declining society , or indeed , from the imperfect company of humans , stretches back to the dawn of civilization .
In many cultures , a spiritual quest for Oneness with God / Enlightenment encourages withdrawal and rejection of worldly goods and goals .
We have seen in the example of Rome how eras of crisis encourage many to " opt out " of society .
But opting out of society can mean either a withdrawal to what we might call " splendid isolation " or an opting in to an alternative social structure .
Thus the yogi , spiritual seeker , or Transcendentalist might well seek complete isolation in a wilderness , while others opting out of a failing state might join a religious commune or monastery .
Such communities are largely self - sustaining , even as they retain ties to various parts of the greater society and economy .
Both of these methods of opting out have deep roots in American culture and history .
The noble desire to seek Oneness with God and fulfillment via oneness with Nature was championed by Henry David Thoreau in Walden , while various faith - based communes and communities have found fertile ground in every century .
Splendid Isolation also ties directly into a key American Myth : the Rugged Individual .
This is a tangled web of fantasy , reality and hidden dependence on a functioning economy beyond the wilderness .
Thus even Thoreau walked back to town on numerous occasions , for food and social contact , and the Buddhist mendicant monks of Southeast Asia rely on the alms of productive people for their sustenance .
In other words , Splendid Isolation still relies in most cases on " the outside world " to grow the grain , etc. which the " one alone " ultimately relies upon .
It is exceedingly difficult to grow , nourish and sustain all that life requires alone .
That is the fundamental reason why most primates , including humans , form groups : a group is simply a far more productive , robust survival structure than a single individual .
Thus , rugged individuals who could survive on their own form communities to reap the advantages of such mutually beneficial networks .
A few years ago the U.S. Army ran an advertising slogan " An Army of One . "
But this was a misnomer , for the single most important combat asset is unit cohesion .
Even the supreme Rugged Individual survives best in a circle of others willing to fight together for a common cause .
Another enduring myth of American culture is " living off the land . "
Many of my correspondents who hunt and fish report that when discussions of financial hardship arise , many of their acquaintances say they will simply bag some deer and go fishing to feed their families .
Sadly , what was possible in the remote , largely unpopulated America of the distant past is not possible for a nation of dwindling wilderness and 300 millions mouths to feed .
The more one has actually walked remote areas of the nation like the Rockies , High Sierra , great deserts and untilled plains , the more one comes to understand just how little food for humans exists in the wild .
This is why hunter - gatherers require vast tracts of land : Nature is indeed bountiful , but rarely for humans .
It is easy to over - estimate the number of wildfowl , fish and large mammals available for human consumption in the " wild , " and even easier to overestimate the calories available to be reaped from the wild before the land is stripped of game and other edibles .
The hunter who bags several dozen pheasant , for instance , ends up with a pitifully small bag of dried meat at the end of the process .
As for the plentiful fish let 's not forget they were stocked by an advanced - technology , oil - fueled , well - funded state agency .
Once the fish are no longer stocked , the illusory bounty disappears .
To the unknowing eye , the Hawaiian rain forest looks like it must be a veritable cornucopia of edibles suitable for human consumption .
In fact , the truly native Hawaiian rain forest offers very little to hungry humans .
If you come across a mango or banana tree , that was planted by other humans .
You would also find that the " wild " mango tree is remarkably stingy with its bounty .
Growing high above the ground , most of the fruit is unreachable , even with ladders , and the fruit is small and mostly seed ; the actual pulp is stringy and meager compared to the farm - coddled mangoes we find in markets .
Thus a small intensive garden may well contain more human - suitable food than a square kilometer or square mile of wilderness .
Many bounteous wild crops like acorns require a backbreaking amount of work before they can be rendered suitable for human consumption and they require copious amounts of fuel for cooking .
It is sobering to recall that tiny bands of primitively armed humans hunted the wooly mammoth to extinction in a matter of a few decades , and a relative handful of better - armed Americans shot millions of bison in a few short years , driving the herds which once blackened the plains to the precipice of extinction .
We should be very wary of all such complacency traps : there is simply no way to feed 300 million people by foraging a mostly calorie - barren landscape and fish - stripped sea .
Such a stupendous population requires a large - scale , heavily mechanized intensive production of grain .
Conclusion # 1 : everyone who opts out of a given social circumstance opts into some other circumstance .
There can be no " opting out " without a corresponding " opting in " to something else .
Conclusion # 2 : Opting into a myth is not a sustainable option ; humans developed social networks / communities and agriculture precisely because the alternative options of Splendid Isolation and foraging were perilously less successful survival strategies .
Conclusion # 3 : The key difference between opting for isolation and opting into alternative communities / networks is the sustainability and productivity of the community .
Very few who live in isolation are truly independent of a larger productive society .
This simple truth is the engine behind agriculture and urban centers .
Thus the skeptic gazes at the latter - day isolationists who stockpile six months of advanced - economy , advanced technology consumables in a remote cabin and asks :
What happens in Month Seven when the stockpile is gone ?
Or make it Month 13 or Month 25 ; the point is withdrawing without creating a productive sustainable source of food , energy and other critical necessities is not a survival strategy at all , it 's simply pushing the day of reckoning forward a bit .
Creating an integrated , independent , sustainable productivity by oneself or as a couple is akin to raising a child in isolation : it looks fun until you really give it a try .
A baby may well be adorable to a teen for an hour or so , but give the teen the baby for 48 hours straight and his / her reaction will be quite different .
Haul water in five - gallon buckets from a stream for a few weeks , cut wood by hand , carry a 5 - gallon propane tank by bicycle down to the refilling station , sharpen a chisel by hand , fix a balky gas - powered refrigerator the list of skills and energies required are far longer than a myth - based culture can even imagine .
While it is possible to envision a technology - rich " splendid isolation " fueled by solar panels , water pumps , satellite Internet links , geothermal - exchange heating , triple - pane windows , all protected by elaborate security technology , there are two difficulties with this scenario : few can afford to set it up , and those few who do have created a high - value , very vulnerable target in the middle of an existing population with whom they have no social or economic ties .
One need look no farther than luxury vehicles being smashed and burned in the streets to foresee the possible responses such wealth disparity causes .
There is a model for barricading oneself and one 's wealth behind high walls of security : all " planet of slums " cities in the Third World contain small heavily defended islands of wealth in a vast sea of poverty .
If this lifestyle appeals to you , there are ample opportunities to try it out today in any Third World mega - city / mega - slum .
The skeptic wonders if the Isolationist expects others to have constructed a large - scale productive sustainable economy in their absence , and to welcome those who opted out of contributing to the arduous construction of this sustainable future with open arms .
Just because the grasshopper squirreled away a stash to last the winter does not mean the productive colony of ants will welcome his future freeloading come spring .
Thus the goal must be a truly sustainable productivity , not a temporary opting out dependent on a stockpile of unsustainably produced consumer goods .
In some societies , the religious mendicant can freeload off the productive society because the productive members believe feeding the mendicant provides them with religious merit .
But the U.S. is not such a society ; its historical religious principles are expressed in the line , " The Lord helps those who help themselves , " and stockpiling high - tech goodies to last a few months is not actually helping oneself or others in any long - term , sustainable fashion .

The number to which a total fucking idiot attorney interviewed by a total fucking idiot reporter wants to reduce her salary to avoid Obama 's proposed tax increase on those making $ 250 k or more .
As J. Chait correctly notes , " the tax code does n't work that way .
A tax increase affects thedollar that a person gains .
That 's means only every dollar $ 250,000 is taxed at a higher rate .
Obama is not proposing a tax system whereby somebody who goes from $ 249,999 to $ 250,000 suddenly becomes poorer .
Nobody has ever enacted a tax hike like that in the history of the United States . "
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Organic nanotubes could make rapid strides as functional nanomaterials in a new approach to nanoelectronics and biomedicine , as they can be made of easily varied and modified building blocks .
Researchers led by Chulhee Kim at the Inha University in South Korea have recently developed nanotubes made of dendrons and cyclodextrins .
As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie , they have now successfully functionalized the surfaces of the tubes so that , among other things , they can be used to make biosensors for the detection of a specific protein .
Dendron is the Greek word for tree .
Dendrons are tree - shaped branched molecules .
Kim and Chiyoung Park selected a molecular “ tree ” with four long hydrocarbon chains as “ branches ” .
At the end of the “ trunk ” they attached a pyrene group , a system made of four aromatic carbon rings .
In solution , these dendrons come together “ branch to branch ” to form vesicles , or tiny bubbles .
If the researchers add cyclodextrins , which are ring - shaped closed chains of glucose rings , each of these settles around a pyrene group like a cuff .
This makes it more favorable for the dendrons to group themselves into long nanoscopic tubes whose surfaces are coated with the cyclodextrin “ cuffs ” .
What makes this concept into a truly universal construction set is that the cyclodextrins can easily be equipped with a large variety of functional groups , which then dangle out into the solution from the surfaces of the tubes .
The team was thus able to attach special groups that like to bind gold nanoparticles .
Nanotubes that are densely covered in metal particles could have interesting applications in nanoelectronics .
The pyrene groups on the nanotubes have another special advantage : they fluoresce .
This property allows them to be used in the design of biosensors .
To demonstrate this concept , the researchers constructed a specific test for the protein avidin .
They equipped the surfaces of the nanotubes with biotin , a biomolecule that specifically binds the proteins avidin and streptavidin .
If streptavidin bound to gold nanoparticles is added , these bind to the nanotubes by way of the biotin anchors .
This brings the gold particles into the vicinity of the pyrene groups , which causes them to interact electronically , “ switching off ” the fluorescence .
If the protein avidin and the gold - bound streptavidin are added , biotin anchors on the surface of the tube preferentially bind avidin .
Pyrene groups in the vicinity of avidin fluoresce .
The fluorescence quencher gold - strepavidin can only bind to the binding sites not occupied by avidin .
The intensity of the fluorescence therefore depends on the avidin concentration .

Many renewable energy technologies , most notably photovoltaic , are struggling to reach what 's called " grid parity , " where the cost of the power they generate matches that of fossil fuel generation .
One technology that 's largely there is wind , as maturing turbine technology and economies of scale have made the economics of wind power quite competitive .
Those economics can clearly be seen in the latest figures on the growth of the wind industry , which cover 2008 .
Among the milestones : wind was the largest component of Europe 's growth in electric generating capacity , the US became the world 's top wind energy producer , and China doubled its installed capacity in just a year — for the fourth year running .
In total , the global installed capacity for wind energy went up nearly 30 percent last year , reaching 121GW .
The 27GW installed represent an increase in total installations of 36 percent compared to the figures from 2007 .
The Global Wind Energy Council estimates that the market for new facilities alone is nearly $ 50 billion dollars .
With growth like that , there is a lot of good news to go around .
Europe accounted for 8.9GW of the global growth , which made wind the leading source of new grid capacity ( in the US , it came in at 42 percent of new capacity ) .
The GWEC says that , in contrast to years past , when growth was concentrated in Denmark , Germany , and Spain , it was more evenly distributed in 2008 , with countries like France and the UK adding significant capacity .
Asia as a whole accounted for about a third of the added global capacity , but there was nothing like an even distribution there — China accounted for 6.3GW of new installation , which marks the fourth year in a row that the country has doubled its installed wind power capacity .
With more projects already in the works and the government having chosen to build wind capacity as part of its response to the economic crisis , the country is set for a repeat performance in 2009 , which would take it past traditional wind users like Spain and Germany to second place in the global market .
It would be taking second place behind the US , which took the top spot after increasing its capacity by 50 percent in 2008 , building 8.4GW of new facilities .
The pace of growth had been picking up , as nearly half that figure came online during the fourth quarter .
Unfortunately , the US affiliate of the GWEC , the American Wind Energy Council , says that orders have tailed off due to the credit crunch , and turbine manufacturers are beginning to cut jobs .
That 's bad news for one of the economy 's bright spots — the AWEC estimates that wind energy jobs grew 70 percent last year .
As is happening globally , on the state level , the traditional users of wind power are being passed by some of the newer converts .
California , with its famed Altamont Pass Wind Farm looking increasingly quaint compared to more recent facilities , has seen Iowa push it into third in terms of total installed capacity .
Both are dwarfed by Texas ' 7 + GW of capacity , which is more than the next three states combined .
With facilities that are in the works , all of the top - 10 states should exceed a Gigawatt shortly ; that list includes New York , indicating that this growth is n't limited to the western two - thirds of the US .
Like most energy projects , wind power facilities are capital intensive , and capital is hard to come by in the US these days , so the report is accompanied by hopes that the US stimulus package will include provisions to expand wind energy even further , which should limit the job losses in manufacturing and prevent them from spreading downstream to construction and maintenance .
The AWEA 's CEO , Denise Bode , stated , " The hope is that provisions such as those included in the House stimulus bill to restore the effectiveness of the tax incentives for renewable energy will quickly become law and provide the capital needed to continue to build projects . "
El Segundo , Calif. , Mar. 27 , 2009 - In another blow to the beleaguered electronics contract manufacturing business , Nokia - the world 's largest mobile handset brand - announced that it has stopped using outside contract manufacturers for the assembly of its phones .
The company cited weak global demand for mobile devices as the reason it will cease employing outsourced production to Electronics Manufacturing Service ( EMS ) providers and Original Design Manufacturers ( ODMs ) .
" Amid the global economic recession and slowing sales of mobile handsets , Nokia in recent months had begun the process of shifting some of its assembly operations away from contract manufacturers and back inside the company , " said Adam Pick , principal analyst for EMS / ODM at iSuppli Corp .
" However , this announcement clearly illustrates just how severe the situation in the mobile handset market really is . "
Nokia in 2008 outsourced approximately 17 percent of the manufacturing volume of its mobile phone engines , which include the phone and software that enable its basic operations , to providers including Foxconn International Holdings , BYD , Elcoteq and Jabil Circuit .
" This does n't help the eroding EMS / ODM industry , " Pick continued .
" Nokia 's pull - back will shed more than $ 5 billion in revenue from electronics contract manufacturers .
That most means more overcapacity , more headcount reductions and , obviously , more problems . "
iSuppli 's current forecast calls for the EMS / ODM market to contract 9.9 percent in 2009 to reach $ 270.8 billion , down from $ 300.7 billion in 2008 .
However , given Nokia 's announcement , iSuppli will downgrade its forecast for 2009 and the following years .
The attached figure presents iSuppli 's current global EMS / ODM revenue forecast .
While the announcement is bad news for the contract manufacturing and mobile handset businesses , it represents a positive commentary on Nokia 's capability to adjust to changing market circumstances .
" Nokia is an operational juggernaut with leading procurement and supply chain techniques , " noted Jeffrey Wu , iSuppli 's senior EMS / ODM analyst .
" You have to give Nokia credit for maintaining a hybrid manufacturing system that adjusts pursuant to volatile demand patterns . "

An ethics complaint brought against Gov. Sarah Palin alleges that she violated state ethics laws by wearing a jacket from her husband ’s sponsor during a snow machine race .
Palin responded by calling the complaint asinine political grandstanding .
The complaint brought by Linda Kellen Biegel contends that Palin was at the race in her capacity as governor , and , “ Governor Palin knew that this race would glean not only a great deal of Alaskan media attention , but national and international as well .
The Palins had to be aware that Sports Illustrated was coming to Alaska to do a story on Todd , as the reporter clearly followed him across Alaska throughout the race . ”
It continues , “ The Palins have received a significant amount of income / financial support from Arctic Cat , Inc…enough that it is necessary to claim it on disclosure forms year after year .
The Governor wearing the Team Arctic
Cat outerwear at this event was the equivalent of a kid getting paid to walk around with a sandwich board in New York .
Any boost to the fortunes of Arctic Cat , Inc. can only be fortuitous to the Palin family as benefactors of their sponsorship .
This is about as clear a conflict of interest as it gets . ”

The governor ’s defense is that she was cold , “ Are Alaskans outraged , or at least tired of this yet – another frivolous ethics charge by a political blogger ?
This would be hilarious if it were n’t so expensive for the state to process these accusations and for me to defend against these bogus harassments .
Yes , I wore Arctic Cat snow gear at an outdoor event , because it was cold outside , and by the way , today , I am wearing clothes bearing the names of Alaska artists , and a Glennallen Panthers basketball hoodie .
I am a walking billboard for the team ’s fundraiser !
Should I expect to see an ethics charge for wearing these , or the Carhartts I wear to many public events ?
How much will this blogger ’s asinine political grandstanding cost all of us in time and money ? ”
I think that Palin is ethically challenged to say the least .
The governor seems to not understand the difference between wearing the free gear of the company that sponsors your husband in public in an official capacity , and wearing other clothing .
The difference between the Glenallen basketball hoodie and the jacket she wore involves money .
I doubt that the basketball team paid her to wear the hoodie .
This is such a petty complaint that it really should have never been brought , but Palin also should have known better .
Her husband had the same sponsor last year , and she was n’t pimping the gear , but now that her celebrity has been elevated , she wore the jacket .
I am really trying to cut Palin a break here , but I ca n’t seem to find another example of a politician endorsing a product , while their family is benefiting and they are still in office .
This complaint is n’t as baseless as Palin would like us to believe , but I think that in order for the charge to stick it would have to be proven that Palin was at the race in an official capacity , and that her wearing of the jacket was part of her husband ’s sponsorship deal , but I believe that the evidence will be lacking on both of these points .
The UK has ordered its first three Joint Strike Fighter ( aka F - 35 or " Lightning II " ) supersonic stealth jumpjets .
The initial trio of UK planes will be prototypes built as part of the F - 35 's development phase , giving Blighty access and input to the jet 's final design .
The F - 35B operating as a normal runway plane .
" The Joint Strike Fighter will form an essential part of our Future Combat Air capability , " said Defence minister John Hutton , announcing the buy yesterday in Washington .
" By purchasing three aircraft for testing , we will secure access to the development of the programme .
Working alongside their US colleagues , our pilots will gain an unrivalled understanding of this awesome aircraft and its capabilities .
" This is a vital programme for UK Defence both for the military and for industry , with over 100 UK companies involved in the programme . "
The American F - 35 programme will produce three different versions .
One will be a conventional runway plane , intended for service with the US Air Force and various overseas buyers .
Another will be built for catapult launch and arrester - hook landing , and will be bought only by the US Navy on current plans .
The other type , the F - 35B , will have a central lift fan driven by the engine and a downward - swivelling exhaust .
This will deliver vertical thrust , letting the plane land on a pad like a helicopter if lightly loaded .
The F - 35B is meant to replace the famous Harrier jumpjet with many of its current operators , including the US Marines , the RAF and the Royal Navy .
There are indications that the RAF is actually more than a bit lukewarm about replacing its present force of Harriers ; senior airmen would perhaps prefer to sink that money into enhancing the third tranche of Eurofighter , making the Euro jet into a proper deep - strike bomber .
( It can drop smartbombs already , but the RAF regard this as an " austere " capability . )
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Do n't have a job ?
Struggling to keep up with payments on a home worth less than half the mortgage ?
Owe way more than your home 's value , but can still afford the payments ?
Sorry , but you likely are n't among the 9 million people who may get help under President Obama 's $ 75 billion foreclosure prevention program .
The program , unveiled Wednesday , is being hailed as the most comprehensive fix for the foreclosure crisis plaguing the nation .
The president says it helps both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default .
But not everyone will benefit .
The program does virtually nothing for the unemployed , who often do n't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable .
And , since it relies more heavily on lowering interest rates than on reducing principal , it does little for borrowers concerned their homes will never recoup their value .
Take Joe Martinez of Bristow , Va. , who fits the profile of the " responsible " homeowner Obama cited in the plan .
The government contractor and his wife thought they did everything right when they bought their brand new $ 600,000 house two years ago .
They put 5 % down and got a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage they could afford .
Others in their neighborhood , however , could n't keep up with the payments .
As foreclosure rose , the value of the couple 's home plummeted to $ 450,000 , leaving them doubtful they 'd ever recover their investment .
Martinez called their lender to try to get into the Hope for Homeowners program , which would reduce their loan balance to 90 % of the home 's current value .
But they were turned down because they were n't in default .
So two months ago , the couple stopped paying their mortgage , hoping they could then qualify .
But even if they do n't , they are willing to take the hit on their credit scores to stop throwing money down the drain .
" There 's just no point to stay here , " said Martinez , 29 , adding he could rent the house across the street for half his monthly mortgage payment .
" We do n't want to give up our home , but it 's never going to come back . "
Foreclosures will continue
The administration 's program is n't designed to help every homeowner , experts said .
Nor should it .
" It 's a mistake to think we can stop all foreclosures , " said Edward Morrison , a professor at Columbia Law School .
" Only about one - third of existing foreclosures can be stopped . "
The plan calls for loan servicers to modify mortgages for those at risk of or already in default so that the monthly payment is no more than 31 % of the borrower 's income .
This will be done primarily through interest rate reductions , which are more palatable to most servicers than principal write - downs .
The federal government will subsidize the interest rate reductions , as well as provide a multitude of incentives for servicers , mortgage investors and borrowers .
Also , borrowers with little or no equity in their homes who are on time with their payments could be eligible to refinance to take advantage of the current low interest rates , which hover around 5 % .
The plan lifts the guideline that borrowers must have at least 20 % equity to refinance , allowing those with loans as large as 105 % of their home 's value to qualify .
This is designed to help people who have seen their equity eaten away by falling home prices .
No job ?
Out of luck
A growing number of people are falling behind in their payments because they 've lost their jobs , ensuring the tidal wave of foreclosures will continue as long as unemployment keeps rising .
It 's very tough , however , to help people who lose their income , experts said .
Reducing monthly payments can only go so far since the loan 's value after modification has to be worth more than it would be if the home were put into foreclosure .
Those who lose their jobs often can't make payments large enough to overcome this hurdle .
For these people , the solution often is a short sale , in which the lender agrees to take forgive the loan balance above the home 's sale price , experts said .
" In some cases , the homeowners can't stay in the home , " said Marietta Rodriguez , director of the National Homeownership Program for NeighborWorks America .
The best way to help the unemployed facing foreclosure is to get them jobs , experts said .
The Obama administration is addressing that in the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package the president signed into law on Tuesday .
It is expected to create or save up to 3.5 million jobs .
Underwater borrowers
Many underwater borrowers -- those who owe more than their home is worth -- may find the plan falls short .
Some estimates say up to 12 million homeowners may be underwater , with 4 million of them behind on their payments .
The danger is that some of these borrowers may decide it 's just not worth it to continue paying if the home is n't likely to recoup its value .
This is especially true of those finding it hard to make their payments .
Some struggling borrowers will qualify for lower monthly payments , but they will likely continue to be underwater .
The government is offering to reduce their principal by $ 1,000 a year for five years , but that sum wo n't do much to bring them back into balance in most cases .
The only way to effectively help those with negative equity in their home is to forgive part of the loan balance , some experts say .
They are disappointed that this measure is not given more emphasis in the program .
" Cutting principal is really what 's needed to contain foreclosures , " said Christian Menegatti , lead analyst for economic research firm RGE Monitor .
Other borrowers , however , are too far gone to get a modification .
" If you 're so far underwater , more than about 150 percent loan - to - value , we think you 're very unlikely to succeed -- those will not be eligible , as well , " Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan said Wednesday .
As for those who can afford their payments , the program contains little to address their housing problems .
Only those with loans worth 105 % or less of their home 's value can partake in the refinancing offer .
Martinez is n't interested in having his interest rate lowered .
He would like to see some of his principal forgiven .
" Why would it be such a big deal for them to modify my loan ? " he said , noting that his tax dollars are being used to finance the program .
" Would n't that stabilize the economy ? "
Some experts , however , say Martinez is the exception .
Those who can make their payments are n't likely to walk away because still need a roof over their head , said Howard Glaser , a mortgage industry consultant .
" Homeowners are n't day traders in their homes , " he said .
" The investment value is not an issue . "

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was in stable condition and recovering from head injuries Friday night after a car wreck that killed his wife , Susan , medical sources told CNN .
Tsvangirai and his wife , Susan , were en route to the prime minister 's hometown of Buhera .
The crash , on a busy two - lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare , comes just weeks after the start of a power - sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival , President Robert Mugabe .
Analysts say the crash is bound to raise suspicion of foul play , with one former U.S. diplomat calling for an outside investigation , saying it is not the first time that a political foe of Mugabe has been killed or injured in a car crash .
Members of Tsvangirai 's political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash is anything other than an accident .
Tsvangirai's aide and driver also were injured in the head - on collision with a large truck , according to his spokesman , James Maridadi .
Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa said he spoke to Tsvangirai at the hospital , and the party leader was in " relatively stable " condition .
An MDC spokesman describes ' critical ' accident »
Sources at The Avenues Clinic in Harare said that Tsvangirai was in stable condition with minor head injuries and that the prime minister was alert and talking .
One source said the attending doctor had told him of his wife 's death .
Another said that doctors were planning to keep Tsvangirai overnight for observation and that specialists were checking his condition .
Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , took office last month under a power - sharing deal with Mugabe after a contentious election .
Tsvangirai's MDC reached the power - sharing agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence .
More than 200 deaths , mainly those of opposition supporters , were reported leading up to and in the aftermath of the election .
" I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , " said Tom McDonald , the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 .
" President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they do n't like . "
Watch more on the fatal crash »
McDonald cited the 2001 death of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi , Employment Minister Border Gezi's death in 1999 and the death last year of Elliot Manyika , a government minister and former regional governor .
All three died in car crashes .
" This is several , " McDonald said .
" So , when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident , it gives me pause . "
McDonald , now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler , urged a full investigation by outside authorities .
One analyst who studies the region said the collision could " exacerbate " the fragile unity government .
" There will undoubtedly be suspicions about the cause of the crash and whether there was foul play involved , " said Jennifer Cooke , director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
" At a time when there needs to be confidence - building measures , this incident potentially raises suspicions and undermines the potential for greater cohesion of the government .
[ There is ] huge potential for the agreement to be manipulated by Mugabe . "
McDonald , however , was quick to say that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe .
The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two - lane road where tractor - trailers are common , vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and drivers often are inexperienced , he said .
" It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , " he said .
The collision occurred on the Harare - Masvingo Road as Tsvangirai and his wife headed to his hometown of Buhera , south of the capital , Harare , his spokesman said .
The couple , who were married in 1978 , have six children , according to the British Broadcasting Corporation .
Last month , Susan Tsvangirai told a BBC affiliate that the past decade had been an " endurance test " for her husband and his MDC colleagues .
" People went through hell , but they stuck to their ideals to seek change through democratic means , " she said .
" This was a struggle that we endured with MDC cadres , activists , supporters and peace - loving Zimbabweans .
" To them I say thank you so much for the support they gave the MDC to reach this momentous period . "
A former miner and union organizer , Morgan Tsvangirai first ran for president in 2002 against Mugabe , who has been the country 's leader since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980 .
Since then , Tsvangirai has been charged with treason twice and accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe .
Tsvangirai was arrested and allegedly beaten in 2007 .
The criminal charges against him were dropped .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse , Alan Silverleib and Doug Gross contributed to this report .

Plans to make ID cards compulsory for UK citizens at some point in the middle distance have been officially abandoned , apparently .
According to the Home Office 's revised counter - terrorism strategy document , published today , " It is not our intention that identity cards should be mandatory for UK nationals . "
This in some senses reverses the previous plan , which was for ID cards to be made compulsory via a vote in parliament after they had achieved significant penetration among the UK population .
In most senses , however , it changes nothing .
ID cards will be issued to airport workers " initially for an 18 month evaluation period " this year , offered to " young people to assist them in proving their identity " next year , and will " start to enroll people at high volumes " from 2011 / 12 .
The hordes of people desperate for ID cards and the luckless population of Manchester seem to have fallen off this roadmap , possibly for reasons of space but more likely because both ideas were ridiculous .
Presuming ( possibly a big presume ) that the Home Office does n't change its mind about compulsion again , the roadmap is now more closely aligned to David Blunkett 's cunning plan to save the ID scheme .
Once ID cards become available to the general UK population , people will be given " a choice between an identity card , a passport or both " .
Whatever they choose , their details will be added to the National Identity Register , and as it's the database that 's the point , not the card , the Home Office is happy to let them decline the latter .
The two problems with this , from the point of view of the Home Office , are first that people who do n't want or need a passport wo n't go onto the NIR ( which is why Blunkett wants to make passports compulsory instead ) , and second that EU citizens living in the UK will escape the scheme entirely .
So in the unlikely event of New Labour and Smith ( majority 1,948 ) remaining in place after the next election , we can perhaps expect a compulsory passport announcement in a few years time .
Should the 2011 part of the 2011 / 12 general rollout actually happen , incidentally , it 's likely to be the last time you will be able to collect a passport , and presumably ID card , without handing in your fingerprints .
These will be required for passport renewals from 2012 , according to today 's document . ®
Climate change deniers are “ ridiculous ” and akin to “ flat - earthers ” , according to Sir Nicholas Stern , who advised the government about the economic threat posed by global warming .
The respected economist compared climate naysayers to those who deny the link between smoking and cancer or HIV and Aids in the face of mounting scientific evidence .
Sir Nicholas Stern : Climate change deniers are flat - earthers | guardian.co.uk —
This new meme around the word “ denier ” is cropping up all over the UK and starting to appear in the USA .
In an effort to quash dissent about the mechanism of climate change ( man vs natural ) an all out attack has begun on anyone who has any question about the validity of the global warming promoters .
So the “ deniers ” have been grouped with holocaust deniers in particular .
Another track has them categorized as insane , literally .
They are also being associated with the Creationists as much as possible .
This is getting good .
Socialist / activist / columnist George Monbiot chimes in with another funny analogy .
Apparently if you question the global warming agenda you think AIDS can be treated with beetroot and lemon juice .
Interesting assertion by a non-existent association .
I mean , cripes !
Sammy Wilson ’s appointment as Northern Ireland environment minister appears to have been conceived as some sort of practical joke .
It ’s no longer very funny .
He fills the same role as the former South African health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , who claimed that Aids could be treated with beetroot and lemon juice .
Huh ?
Sarah Palin 's teenage daughter tries to stop ' white trash ' father from seeing baby
It was one of the more sensational stories of the U.S. presidential election when Sarah Palin revealed that her unmarried teenage daughter was pregnant .
Coming just days after her appointment as John McCain 's running mate in the battle with Barack Obama , the story threatened to damage Mrs Palin 's credibility among religious and conservative Republicans .
In the ensuing media furore , the baby 's father , Levi Johnston , 19 , was wheeled out at party events to stand by Bristol Palin , 18 , and the pair became engaged .
Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston :
The pair , pictured holding hands at last year 's Republican national convention , have separated after reaching a mutual decision 'a while ago '
Now , however , just two - and - a - half months after the birth of their baby and with Senator McCain 's failed election race a distant memory , the couple have announced their separation as Mr Johnston reportedly has little contact with their son , Tripp .
His sister Mercedes told a magazine that after the relationship ended , Miss Palin made it difficult for him to see his son as ' she does n't want Tripp around " white trash " . '
Miss Palin denies the claim and said in statement : ' Unfortunately my family has seen many people say adn to many things to cash in on the Palin name .
' Sometimes greed clouds good judgement . '
In an interview last month , Miss Palin , who was 17 when she became pregnant , said her fiance was a ' hands - on ' dad who saw the baby every day .
Mr Johnston , who was pictured at the Republican national convention last year sporting a tattoo on his ring finger that read ' Bristol ' , said that they had mutually decided ' a while ago ' to end their relationship .
The pregnancy was just one of several scandals to hit former model Mrs Palin , 45 , during the race for the White House .
The Alaska governor , who has been tipped to run for the presidency in 2012 , attracted ridicule for her apparent ignorance of world affairs and was forced to deny claims that she had tried to use her position to get her former brother - in - law fired from his job as a state trooper .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A plan by Republicans in the Senate aimed at pushing mortgage rates lower has gone down to defeat at the hands of Democrats .
The plan by Nevada Republican John Ensign would have encouraged banks to issue mortgages with interest rates of 45 to 4.5 % .
The government - controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have bought the mortgages on the secondary market .
Jumbo loans would have been ineligible .
Democrats killed the idea Thursday night by a 62 - 35 vote .
The plan also contained an assortment of expensive tax cuts such as cutting the bottom 10 % income tax rate in half for two years .
New York Democrat Charles Schumer said the plan was too expensive and would provide a windfall to banks charging fees to refinance mortgages .

( CNN ) --
A floating city off the coast of San Francisco may sound like science fiction , but it could be reality in the not - too - distant future .
The Seasteading Institute has drawn up plans for a floating city off the coast of San Francisco .
The Seasteading Institute already has drawn up plans for the construction of a homestead on the Pacific Ocean .
One project engineer described the prototype as similar to a cruise ship , but from a distance the cities might look like oil - drilling platforms .
According to the plans , the floating cities would not only look different from their land - based counterparts , but they might operate differently , too .
Patri Friedman , a former Google engineer who now works for the Seasteading Institute , said floating cities are the perfect places to experiment with new forms of government .
Some of the new political ideas the group is tossing around include legalizing marijuana and making intellectual property communal -- so that everyone would take ownership in art produced on the city at sea .
" The idea is n't just about getting away from rules or getting rid of rules .
It 's about a system that encourages experimentation with different political systems , " he said .
Do n't Miss Seasteading Institute : Info , FAQ , blog , forums
Friedman said the floating city may be built in modular pieces so that city blocks and neighborhoods can be recombined to create new urban layouts .
The idea of building cities on the sea is not new , he said , but the Seasteading Institute has come closer to realizing the goal than others .
" A lot of people over the past hundred plus years have had this idea and even specifically building cities on the ocean to try out new forms of government , " he said .
" But they 've pretty much been totally imagined and if they did try , they totally failed . "
There are several unknowns about future attempts to create floating cities , said Christian Cermelli , an engineer and architect with Marine Innovation and Technology , based in San Francisco .
Cermelli , who is part of a team of designers creating a blueprint for the first seastead , said it 's unclear if construction is possible -- or what it would cost .
Still , a prototype for the idea may be finished in as little as three years , he said .
Friedman said seasteads are loosely based on oil rigs , but with important modifications .
" We care more about sunlight and open space , so the specifications are different , " he said .
" Also , oil platforms are fixed in place .
We think it 's important to have more modular cities .
So you would build a city out of buildings that can actually be separated and rearranged . "
Cermelli said the ocean cities may use technology from suspension bridges " to expand the space at sea and basically get a roomier platform . "
Friedman says the idea of seasteading has met a range of reactions .
" Some people think we 're crazy .
A lot of people think we 're crazy , " he said .
" Some people think terrible things could happen , others think it would be great . "
About 600 people have joined the Seasteading Institute .
Some of them , like Gayle Young , say the idea is exciting partly because it 's so different .
" I love the idea because it 's audacious .
It 's big , " she said .
" It 's about pushing frontiers . "

Enlarge By Chris O'Meara , AP FBI files reveal the alleged criminal side of late daredevil Evel Knievel , seen here in May 2006 in Clearwater , Fla .
MIAMI ( AP )  Evel Knievel never denied his scrapes with the law — the late motorcycle daredevil often reveled in them .
But even he objected to a 1970s FBI investigation of whether he was involved in a string of beatings .
According to documents obtained by The Associated Press , the federal government came close to charging Knievel , who in turn threatened to sue the FBI for alleging he was connected to a crime syndicate .
Neither followed through .
Knievel , who died last November in Clearwater , Fla. , repeatedly denied his involvement to both investigators and victims , according to the documents .
GAME ON BLOG : Daredevil 's reputed defiance of the law " Knievel stated that he was not responsible for what just happened to ( name redacted ) and that he had no control over the ' thing " ' according to one phone conversation recounted in an FBI interview .
Knievel , immortalized by the Smithsonian Institution as " America 's Legendary Daredevil , " donned red , white and blue for his death - defying stunts .
He had a knack for outrageous yarns and claimed to have been a swindler , a card thief , a safe cracker and a holdup man .
His most well - known run-in with the law was a 1977 attack on movie studio executive Shelly Saltman , whom the daredevil beat with a baseball bat in the parking lot of 20th Century Fox .
Saltman promoted Knievel 's infamous attempt to jump Idaho's Snake River Canyon and then wrote a book about the experience , angering Knievel by portraying him as " an alcoholic , a pill addict , an anti-Semite and an immoral person . "
Knievel was sentenced to six months in jail and Saltman won a $ 12.75 million judgment , but never collected .
Saltman did not return a phone message recently to discuss the FBI file .
Knievel 's file shows investigators believed he was involved with other violent acts — a threat in Phoenix , an attack in a Kansas City hotel room and a vicious beating in San Francisco .
All were allegedly carried out by Knievel associates , according to subjects quoted in the file .
The investigation bounced between field offices in Miami , Chicago and California .
Knievel 's business associates were interviewed , his phone records examined .
Of the 202 pages of Knievel 's 290 - page file released to the AP , some were heavily redacted , with identities , interviews and contact information excluded .
The names of victims were not released , though some details of their experiences were .
One man told agents he received a threatening phone call , and shortly after was beaten by a Knievel associate who left him hospitalized .
The man was interviewed by the FBI , but could remember his assailant 's black loafers better than his facial features .
He told the AP he wants to remain anonymous because he had moved on from the attack and into a career not associated with stunt jumping .
He said the FBI wanted to know if he could identify his attacker .
" They gave me mug shots at one point in time and I could n't pick him out , " he said .
" It was a dark room , he had dark glasses on him .
All I know is he was big .
I could describe his shoes better than anything . "
Authorities first wanted to charge Knievel with violations of the Hobbs Act , which prohibits a person from interfering with interstate commerce by attempting to rob or extort someone .
But the case was dropped when it inherited new federal prosecutor who decided there was insufficient evidence .
The federal government today will not comment .
" The Department follows the facts and the law in making decisions and beyond that , could n't comment on matters in which no public federal charges were filed , " Department of Justice spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said in an e-mail .
The daredevil 's widow , Krystal Kennedy - Knievel , said she was unaware of any FBI investigation involving her husband and declined further comment .
They were married in 1999 .
FBI files are available to the public after the death of their subjects and can provide rare glimpses into the private lives of public figures .
For example , former President Ford advised the FBI that two of his fellow Warren Commission members doubted the bureau 's conclusion that John F. Kennedy was shot from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas , according to his file .
Not all of Knievel 's altercations were detailed by the FBI .
Bob Gill , a competitor of Knievel 's during the 1970s , said he was part of a confrontation associated with Knievel , but the daredevil later apologized and denied his involvement and the two became friends .
Gill was not interviewed by the FBI , but said his run-in mirrored others described in the file .
He declined to elaborate .
" I was really , really mad at Evel over the whole thing , but he apologized at least 10 times , and said it was out of his control and I believed him , " Gill said .
Gill , who was paralyzed after a failed stunt , said Knievel tried to help him set up a meeting with a doctor who Gill thought would help him walk again .
He said Knievel also devised a plan to help pay for the expenses .
" Evel 's never done any wrong besides that one little incident , " Gill said .
" And he 's made up for it 1,000 times . "

After landing on the West Coast , Obama turns and points right back to Washington .
Obama heads to Reagan country
COSTA MESA , Calif . – After landing on the West Coast , President Barack Obama turned and pointed back to Washington – a place he said was “ all in a tizzy ” looking for someone to blame for the AIG bonuses amid the economic crisis .
“ Listen , I ’ll take responsibility .
I ’m the president , ” Obama said .
“ So for everybody in Washington who ’s busy trying to figure out and blame somebody else , just go ahead and talk to me , because it ’s my job to make sure we fix these messes even if I do n’t make them . ”
Advertisement
It was a new message out of a White House on the defensive – and it was delivered in one of the ways Obama likes best , far away from Washington , so he could separate himself from that city where “ everybody ’s pointing fingers . ”
In the immediate sense , Obama ’s two - day trip to California is designed for take him where the economic pain is intense , and to rise above the fights ensuing in DC over AIG and his $ 3.6 trillion budget .
One out of every 10 Californians is unemployed , he was quick to point out , and the state has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation .
But California is also a state the last Democratic president , Bill Clinton , tended to regularly , due to its hefty electoral vote count and generous campaign donations .
Clinton visited California more than 70 times in eight years .
So it ’s politically natural that Obama made a point to visit here early – within his first 100 days in office .
But the new Democratic president did n’t begin in the usual places .
He went straight for Reagan Country .
Obama ’s first stop at a town hall - style meeting was in the heart of Orange County , otherwise known as the place Ronald Reagan designated “ where the good Republicans go before they die . ”
He ’ll follow it up with another event in what was once called “ America ’s most Republican county ” on Thursday .
It took Clinton two - and - a - half years into his first term before he stepped foot in Orange County
Obama ’s California itinerary is a politically savvy move for a president who faces Republican criticism of his agenda .
He avoids appearing as if he ’s only embracing California ’s liberal enclaves — Hollywood and San Francisco – while giving a beleaguered GOP a poke in the eye .
But even Orange County is no longer the Republican bastion it once was .
Sen .
John McCain carried the county by only a margin of 51 - 49 .
And , incidentally , Obama won in the two places where he planned stops during his trip – Costa Mesa and the heavily Hispanic Santa Ana .
Creating an image that must be startling for the Republican Party , the crowd at Obama ’s Costa Mesa town hall on Wednesday cheered at the mention of raising taxes .
“ We would return to the tax rate that we had under Bill Clinton , ” Obama said , adding that he means those making more than $ 250,000 a year .
“ These folks can afford it .
They were rich back in the 90s . ”
“ What that does is allow us to pay for health care reform for a lot of people who are out there working every day but are just one ill away from bankruptcy , ” Obama added .
“ Now I do n’t think that ’s unreasonable .
I do n’t think that ’s socialism .
I think that ’s part of understanding that we ’re all in this together . ”
Obama struck a mostly optimistic tone Wednesday .
And while he delivered a strong rebuke of AIG , he also stood by the government ’s decision to bail out the company “ even though it makes you angry . ”
“ With AIG it was the right thing to do to step in , ” he said .
“ It ’s almost like they ’ve got a bomb strapped to them and they ’ve got their hand on the trigger .
You do n’t want them to blow up , but you ’ve got to ease their hand off the trigger . ”
The president appeared comfortable and relaxed , if not a bit relieved , on the stage in the stifling hot room at the Orange County Fairgrounds .
He shed his jacket before taking questions .
He joked with the audience of 1,300 voters , who greeted him enthusiastically , breaking into chants of “ O - ba - ma ” at times as he spoke .
Obama put his hand in his pocket and nodded as he heard from a recently laid off teacher and later an out of work auto industry employee .
The majority of the questions from the audience in a stifling hot room related to the economy .
In answering them , Obama often took on many of the Republicans ’ arguments against him head on .
Using a mimicking voice , he ’d say things like :
“ Obama ’s trying to do too much , they say . ”
“ Obama - he ’s a spendthrift . ”
“ He ’s a tax - and - spend Democrat . ”
“ Well , I say the realities are too large to ignore , ” Obama said .
“ You did n’t send us there to say no to change .
You sent us there to get things done . ”
The president seized opportunities to exude outside - of - Washington humility .
Asked if he plans to run for president again in four years ?
“ I would rather be a good president , taking on the tough issues , for four years , than a mediocre president for eight years , ” said Obama .
“ Ultimately I answer to you .
I ’m your employee . ”
Obama took some time afterwards to shake hands before boarding a helicopter bound for Los Angeles , where he will appear Thursday on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno .
It ’s his second out of town overnight as president .
As he said in his opening remarks , “ It 's always good to get out of Washington for a little while . ”
Daily Show : Darth Vader wants Cheney analogies to stop David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday February 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Host renames Cheney segment , ' Why Are You Such A Dick ? '
Jon Stewart may have just ended a cultural meme .
Comparisons of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Star Wars villain Darth Vader , who led the evil galactic empire as the emperor 's right hand , abound on the Internet .
But it 's not just the netizens who are fond of the likening .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , as a Senator from New York in 2007 , told a Times Square town hall meeting , " you can always tell when the republicans are restless - because the Vice President 's motorcade pulls into the Capitol .
Darth Vader emerges .
And honestly Im not invited to their meetings I dont know what he says or does . "
Even Cheney once joked about analogies between he and the cinema baddie , noting at a 2008 Republican fundraiser , " I asked my wife , Lynne , the other day , ' But does n't that bother you ? '
And she said , ' No , it humanizes you . ' "
In responding to the media storm that descended after Cheney 's Tuesday Politico interview -- his first since Obama 's inauguration -- Stewart announced a name change for one of his program 's popular recurring segments .
It seems after Cheney claimed that preventing hundreds of thousands of American deaths from a large - scale terrorism attack will be difficult without maintaining the Bush administration 's policies -- saying , " Whether or not they can pull it off depends whether or not we keep in place policies that have allowed us to defeat all further attempts , since 9/11 , to launch mass - casualty attacks against the United States " -- he 'd gone just too far for Stewart .
In honor of " his glibness , " Comedy Central 's Daily Show , its host feeling now - citizen Dick Cheney not worthy of " cute " mockery , changed the title of the reappearing segment from " You Don't Know Dick " to " Why Are You Such A Dick ? "
" Over the years , we have tried very hard to make Dick Cheney look evil , but in kind of a cute way , " Stewart said .
" Kinda , funny , cartoonish , lot of Darth Vader jokes , funny pictures , man sized safe , and then we did that funny wheelchair mock - up . "
As he trailed away , the audio cued up a rendition of composer John Williams ' ' The Imperial March ' from George Lucas ' film The Empire Strikes Back .
" In fact , do you know how big a dick he now is ? "
Stewart continued .
" This was the message that I recently got on my answering machine . "
Stewart 's answering machine beeped , and after a greeting by song , the Dark Lord of the Sith began his message .
" Hello John , " Vader said .
" Please , stop comparing me to Dick Cheney .
I redeemed myself , remember ?
Saving Luke from the Emperor ? "
R2D2 , the prolific Star Wars robotic companion to both characters Skywalker , chimed in with a series of beeps .
" I 'll be right there , honey , " Vader said .
" But seriously .
Stop comparing me to Dick Cheney ! "

What makes the plant unique is that Raser can generate zero-emissions electricity using water that ’s scarcely hotter than a cup of coffee , opening up previously unusable ( and far more common ) low - to medium - temperature geo - thermal resources .
What ’s more , Raser developed and built the Utah plant in under a year by stringing together small , modular generators that arrive on the back of a truck , reducing construction time from the more typical five or seven years and slashing capital costs , which have historically accounted for about half the expense of a large new power plant .
The Utah facility is set to provide power to Disneyland and thousands of homes in Anaheim , California .
Seven more sites are under development in the United States , including one in New Mexico that will send power to Phoenix this year .
All told , Raser–which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange last December , plans to add 600 - plus megawatts of capacity over the next five years .
In an important step towards creating synthetic life forms , genetics pioneer George Church has produced a man-made version of the part of the cell that turns out proteins , which carry out the business of life .
" If you going to make synthetic life that is anything like current life ... you have got to have this ... biological machine , " Church told reporters in a telephone briefing .
And it can have important industrial uses , especially for manufacturing drugs and proteins not found in nature [ Reuters ] .
Church 's team built a functional ribosome from scratch , molecule by molecule .
Ribosomes are molecular machines that read strands of RNA and translate the genetic code into proteins .
They are exquisitely complex , and previous attempts to reconstitute a ribosome from its constituent parts – dozens of proteins along with several molecules of RNA – yielded poorly functional ribosomes , and even then succeeded only when researchers resorted to “ strange conditions ” that did not recapitulate the environment of a living cell , Church said [ Nature blog ] .
Next , the researchers want to produce man-made ribosomes that can replicate themselves .
Church 's work has n't yet been published in a peer - reviewed journal ; instead he presented his preliminary results at a seminar of Harvard alumni over the weekend .
He described how his research team first disassembled ribosomes from E. coli ,
a common lab bacterium , into its component molecules .
They then used enzymes to put the various RNA and protein components back together .
When put together in a test tube , these components spontaneously formed into functional ribosomes ....
The researchers used the artificial ribosome to successfully produce the luciferase enzyme , a firefly protein that generates the bug 's glow [ Technology Review ] .
Pharmaceutical companies presently use the naturally occurring ribosomes in bacteria to make proteins for vaccines and drugs , but biomedical researcher James Collins explains that genetically engineered ribosomes would improve the process .
“ Then you could program ribosomes so that they shut down much of the rest of the cell , only making the proteins you want to produce .
You could shift the cell ’s machinery to making certain products or fuels , for example , and really increase efficiency ” [ Bloomberg ]
, he says .
But Church wants to go further .
His fondest wish is to create ribosomes that can turn out an entirely new class of protein --
those that are the mirror image of the proteins found in nature .
Proteins and many other molecules have a " handedness , " or chirality , to their structure .
Amino acids made in nature are almost exclusively left - handed .
And just as a glove fits on only one hand , left - handed enzymes can only catalyze reactions of [ molecules ] with the correct handedness .
This means that mirror - image molecules would be resistant to breakdown by regular enzymes , says Church .
That could have important industrial applications , generating long - lasting enzymes for biofermentation , used to create biofuels and other products [ Technology Review ] .

“ We ’re both thrilled and honored to be marketing and distributing all of DreamWorks ’ signature upcoming live - action motion pictures , and to begin a new relationship with such respected colleagues as Steven , Stacey , and their creative team at DreamWorks .
Steven has made some of the biggest and most loved films of all - time , and continues to be one of the great icons of our industry .
Stacey has an impeccable reputation and a phenomenal track record for making a wide variety of quality films .
Their motion pictures will be the perfect complement to the already robust slate of Disney and Touchstone films being made by Oren Aviv and his team . ”
“ We are tremendously pleased to join forces with Steven Spielberg , whose artistic vision and commitment to quality filmmaking are legendary .
DreamWorks has had a great creative and commercial track record under the leadership of Steven and Stacey Snider and I am delighted they ’re now associated with Disney . ”
“ Disney is the birthplace of imagination and has always been as close to the worldwide audience as any company ever has .
I am so pleased that industry leaders like Bob Iger and Dick Cook reached out to become our distribution partner .
This is a major step forward for us and Reliance . ”
The Walt Disney Studios has agreed to a long - term exclusive distribution deal with ‘s DreamWorks SKG movie studio .
Under the terms of this arrangement , Disney will handle distribution and marketing for approximately six DreamWorks films each year .
The first DreamWorks motion picture to be released under the Touchstone Pictures banner is scheduled to hit theaters in 2010 .
The deal comes after Universal and DreamWorks had been unable to finalize their previously announced distribution arrangement .
DreamWorks left Paramount in October to re-establish DreamWorks as a privately operated company .
Commenting on the announcement , said : , president and CEO , The Walt Disney Company , added : said :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Strep infections and not the flu virus itself may have killed most people during the 1918 influenza pandemic , which suggests some of the most dire predictions about a new pandemic may be exaggerated , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .
An emergency hospital at Camp Funston , Kansas , for soldiers sickened by the 1918 flu .

The findings suggest that amassing antibiotics to fight bacterial infections may be at least as important as stockpiling antiviral drugs to battle flu , they said .
Keith Klugman of Emory University in Atlanta and colleagues looked at what information is available about the 1918 flu pandemic , which killed anywhere between 50 million and 100 million people globally in the space of about 18 months .
Some research has shown that on average it took a week to 11 days for people to die -- which fits in more with the known pattern of a bacterial infection than a viral infection , Klugman ’s group wrote in a letter to the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases .
“ We observed a similar 10 - day median time to death among soldiers dying of influenza in 1918 , ” they wrote .
People with influenza often get what is known as a “ superinfection ” with a bacterial agent .
In 1918 it appears to have been Streptococcus pneumoniae .
“ Neither antimicrobial drugs nor serum therapy was available for treatment in 1918 , ” Klugman ’s team wrote .
Now there are also vaccines that protect against many different strains of S. pneumoniae , which cause infections from pneumonia to meningitis .
WORST - CASE SCENARIO
Most health experts agree that another pandemic of influenza is inevitable .
There were smaller pandemics in 1958 and in 1967 .
Many government projections have been based on a worst - case 1918 scenario , in which tens of millions of people would die globally and up to 40 percent of the work force would be out for weeks , either sick , caring for others who are sick , or avoiding public places for fear of infection .
“ Based on 1918 we would project less mortality in an era of antibiotics , ” Klugman said in an e-mail .
“ We -are currently modeling this -- assuming of course that the bacterial superinfections remain susceptible to the antibiotics and that sufficient antibiotics are available . ”
No one knows when a pandemic of flu might strike .
Every year seasonal influenza kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people .
A pandemic occurs when a new strain of flu begins infecting people .
One big fear is that H5N1 influenza , currently infecting many birds in Asia , Europe and Africa , might make the jump to people .
H5N1 currently infects people only rarely but it has killed 254 out of 405 infected since 2003 , according to the World Health Organization .
Many countries and companies are stockpiling antiviral drugs and vaccines in case it does strike .
After a month - long poll , the public has chosen to aim the Hubble Space Telescope at Arp 274 , a pair of merging spiral galaxies .
The pollsare closed and the votes are tallied :
The public has decided to aim the Hubble Space Telescopeat a pair of merging galaxies and take a snapshot of the cosmic smashup .
Out of the 140,000 votes in an online NASA contest , a pair of interacting galaxies knowncollectively as Arp 274 beat five other astronomical contenders as the people ? schoice for the iconic observatory ?s next target .
Voting ending on March 1 .
Arp 274 weighedin with a hefty 67,021 votes to top the polls of NASA ?s ?

Orangutans from Sumatra and Borneo are among our closest relatives Orangutans can help each other get food by trading tokens , scientists have discovered - but only if the help goes in both directions .
Researchers from the University of St Andrews found orangutans could learn the value of tokens and trade them , helping each other win bananas .
An article in Biology Letters , claims it is the first evidence of " calculated reciprocity " in non-human primates .
Gorillas and chimpanzees were much less willing to co-operate , they report .
Two orangutans - Bim and Dok - who live in Leipzig Zoo , Germany , were especially good at helping each other .
Initially , they were given several sets of tokens , and learned the value of the different types .
It 's not just humans that calculate about giving ; orangutans do that too
Valerie Dufour
An animal could exchange one type for bananas for itself , another type could be used to gain bananas for a partner , and a third had no value .
Initially , Dok , the female , was especially good at swapping tokens to get bananas for Bim , the male .
Sometimes Bim would point at the tokens to encourage her .
But he was less interested in trading tokens that would win bananas for her .
As she became less willing to help him out , Bim responded by trading more and more , until their efforts were more or less equal .
" So we have a calculation behind the giving , " explained Valerie Dufour who led the research at the Scottish university .
" If you do n't give me enough , then I do n't give you either ; but if you give me enough , OK , then I buy your co-operation , and I secure it by giving too . "
Many animals exchange goods and services with each other ; the grooming of primates is an obvious example .
But the researchers say there has been no experimental evidence before of " calculated reciprocity " , where animals adapt their own behaviour in response to how another is helping them .
" It 's not just humans that calculate about giving , and it's not just humans who expect to be given something in return when they are co-operative , " Dr Dufour told BBC News .
" Orangutans do that too . "
However , other apes - chimpanzees , gorillas and bonobos - were less able or willing to play the game .

Chris Pieper began looking for an academic job in sociology about six months ago , sending off about two dozen application packets .
The results so far ?
Two telephone interviews , and no employment offers .
“ About half of all the rejection letters I ’ve received mentioned the poor economy as contributing to their decision , ” said Mr. Pieper , 34 , who is getting his doctorate from the University of Texas , Austin .
“ Some simply canceled the search because they found the funding for the position did n’t come through .
Others changed their tenure - track jobs to adjunct or instructor positions . ”
“ Many of the universities I applied to received more than 300 applications , ” he added .
Mr. Pieper is not alone .
Fulltime faculty jobs have not been easy to come by in recent decades , but this year the new crop of Ph.D. candidates is finding the prospects worse than ever .
Public universities are bracing for severe cuts as state legislatures grapple with yawning deficits .
At the same time , even the wealthiest private colleges have seen their endowments sink and donations slacken since the financial crisis .
So a chill has set in at many higher education institutions , where partial or full - fledge hiring freezes have been imposed .
A survey by the American Historical Association , for example , found that the number of history departments recruiting new professors this year is down 15 percent , while the American Mathematical Society ’s largest list of job postings has dropped more than 25 percent from last year .
If the previous generation wants to talk to young feminists , they should stop assuming that we are all members of the “ Pole - dancing , walking around half - naked , posting drunk photos on Facebook , and blogging about [ our ] sex lives ” sector , and realize that we ’re still working — we ’re just doing different things .
If the previous generation wants to talk to young feminists , they should stop assuming that we are all members of the “ Pole - dancing , walking around half - naked , posting drunk photos on Facebook , and blogging about [ our ] sex lives ” sector , and realize that we ’re still working — we ’re just doing different things .
In her blog on Mother Jones yesterday , Debra J. Dickerson blamed the apathy of young feminists for the lack of staff in abortion clinics .
“ Women want reproductive choice to remain more than rhetoric , they ’d better stop assuming these clinics will be there when they need them .
Because like priests and nuns , abortion doctors are not reproducing . ”
Sounds to me like there needs to be more funding for these clinics .
Or perhaps this is a job for lobbyists — like one comment on the blog suggests — to oppose the Physician ’s lobby and “ [ push ] more states to open up the right to perform abortions to nurse practitioners . ”
I certainly appreciate the fact that most abortion doctors are approaching retirement — which is happening across all sectors , not just healthcare — and how the dangers associated with the job can scare away potential doctors , but I fail to see how this indicates that young feminists are doing nothing .

“ Tell me exactly what today ’s feminists are doing for the struggle , ” she wrote .
I ’d like to suggest that feminists are out there and working , we ’re just a little spread out right now .
True , we have begun to drift away from taking abortion advocacy to the streets .
We were a little preoccupied by global wars and poverty caused by overpopulation , a deteriorating ecosystem , and the depression that is quickly creeping its way across the globe — problems that my generation certainly did n’t create , but ones that we will be left to solve .
Ms. Dickerson is sick of young women ragging on her generation .
Fair enough .
I ’m a little tired of being criticized for not always having the same priorities as a feminist would ’ve had 30 years ago — or being told that my supposed apathy is the cause for a slew of new problems .
Does being a feminist mean that I can only pay attention to traditionally “ feminist issues , ” and ignore everything else ?
Sometimes I get distracted from abortion access in the states when , on the same news feed , I ’m getting reports of millions of women tormented by AIDS , starvation , and the constant threat of kidnapping , rape , torture and death .
To say that we are not as active as the previous generation is n’t true ; we ’ve just got a lot of new problems to pay attention to , on top of all the old ones .
The hardware hard sell
The public 's insistence on thinking of e-books in physical terms — books with batteries and a screen — rather than in terms of their content has a direct analogue in the business world .
Businesses , after all , are composed of members of the public .
To both consumers and businesses , dedicated reading devices seem to be the obvious answer to the e-book question .
During the early days of e-books ( i.e. , the 1990s , not 2006 , as many seem to believe these days ) , a steady stream of purpose - built e-book reading devices were launched , in many shapes and sizes , using many different technologies , and at many different price points .
Today , even those in the business are hard - pressed to remember all their names .
Ironically , the very thing that motivated the creation of all those book - like dedicated reading devices is the same the thing that kept customers from buying them .
Dedicated readers were actually a bit of a running joke back at Peanut Press .
Especially in a nascent market like e-books circa 2000 , it 's difficult to get people to shell out $ 100 or more for a device that then requires them to pay again for each e-book they plan to read on it .
The Peanut Press guys saw this from the start and wisely decided to concentrate on creating e-book reader software for devices that people already owned .
Back then , PDAs were the richest target , and Palm PDAs in particular .
No other device had a better combination of computing power , size , weight , screen technology , and most importantly , market penetration .
Compared to contemporary e-book devices , the Palm PDA seems like a woefully inadequate reading platform .
Early Palm PDAs were tiny , and the screen resolution was , from today 's perspective , inconceivably low : 160 pixels square .
Even when using very small text ( itself a problem ) it was hard to fit more than a few sentences onto the screen .
And yet , while the technically and optically superior dedicated e-book reading devices came and went , the few companies that had wisely chosen to ride the hardware wave of PDAs ( and , eventually , cell phones ) were the ones that came out on top .
Ironically , the very thing that motivated the creation of all those book - like dedicated reading devices is the same the thing that kept customers from buying them .
Businesses could n't see past the physical connotations of the word " book , " leading them to produce book - like hardware devices .
And customers , when presented with said devices , compared their value proposition to the obvious physical analog , paper books , and decided that they sure as hell were not going to pay triple - digit prices for such a thing when they could get a paperback for less than $ 10 .
( I know many of you are probably already thinking of the Kindle , but remember that , thus far , I 've been talking about the past , not the present or future .
We 'll get there eventually , I promise . )
The inevitable e-book
The straightforward application of logic and reasoning to the actions of large groups of people is a futile exercise .
All of the previous arguments about screen quality and medium / content separation crumble to dust in the face of these inconvenient truths : broadly speaking , people are n't buying e-books ; people do n't want e-books ; people do not want to read book - length texts off of a screen .
Or , to paraphrase a long - forgotten but nevertheless surprisingly applicable movie from the 90s , people love their books .
But the truth is , these things always turn out the same way .
And I have some bad news for the bibliophiles .
The beloved , less technically sophisticated information conveyance with the pedigreed history does n't win .
Time and again this happens , and it can happen without changing a single person 's mind .
To put it bluntly , people die .
Indeed , death is arguably the single most important driver for all human progress .
Even in a community as reason - based as science , it 's often necessary to wait for one generation of scientists to die off before a new theory gains mainstream acceptance .
It 's a bit much to hold consumers ' text - based media preferences to a higher standard .
So , death and the passage of time — hardly romantic .
It does n't have to be that way , of course .
Plenty of new technologies gain widespread adoption without the aid of a generational turnover .
But so far , books have held their ground .
The message here is simply that , on the long graph , the result will be the same .
The next generation , though influenced by the prejudices of their parents , are nevertheless more likely to judge new technologies on their merits , and so on for each new generation .
And in the case of e-books , the merits are there , as plain as day .
In fact , they 're some of the same merits that have driven other successful media transitions .

But is that really enough ?
Are these things so important that they 're going to inevitably foment a media transition ?
That seems like a pretty dubious claim .
To gain a better perspective , think about some of the other media transitions that have happened in your lifetime .
What advantages did CDs have that allowed them to replace vinyl records and cassette tapes ?
The geeks are surely thinking about audio quality ( although vinyl fans may debate that ) and the possibility of digital copies .
But digital copying was not mainstream when CDs first burst onto the scene , and increased audio quality does n't exactly have mass - market appeal ( as we 'll see in a moment ) .
The CD 's most important characteristics were much more mundane .
CDs were more durable and smaller than vinyl , and you did n't have to fast - forward , rewind , or flip them over to play a certain song .
( Oh , and record companies could n't wait to have everyone re-purchase all their music , but that 's true of every media transition , so it cancels out . )
The audio quality and futuristic shiny appearance were just icing .
And the digital copying , well , even most geeks were n't thinking about that in the days when CDs first arrived ( when computers still had RAM measured in kilobytes and CD burners did not yet exist ) .
Speaking of which , let 's consider another transition , from CDs to digital downloads .
We 're in the midst of that one right now .
What advantages do AACs and MP3s have over CDs ?
Time for some more extremely boring features .
You can purchase a digital download without leaving your house , and you can start listening to it immediately .
The physical storage space for each album is also eliminated .
That 's about it .
What about the audio quality ?
That 's actually gotten worse during this transition .
Consumers also gave up lyrics and liner notes , and accepted decreased fidelity for the album art .
This is an upgrade ?
In the eyes of consumers , the answer is a resounding " yes . "
Behold , the power of convenience and instant gratification !
Now look again at the virtues of e-books listed above .
I hope you 'll agree that they 're more than sufficient .
Still not budging ?
Okay , time to go to the nuclear option …
Horses for courses
If you remain unconvinced , here 's one final exercise , in the grand tradition of a particular family of Internet analogies .
Take all of your arguments against the inevitability of e-books and substitute the word " horse " for " book " and the word " car " for " e- book . "
Here are a few examples to whet your appetite for the ( really ) inevitable debate in the discussion section at the end of this article .
" Books will never go away . "
True !
Horses have not gone away either .
" Books have advantages over e-books that will never be overcome . "
True !
Horses can travel over rough terrain that no car can navigate .
Paved roads do n't go everywhere , nor should they .
" Books provide sensory / sentimental / sensual experiences that e-books can't match . "
True !
Cars just can't match the experience of caring for and riding a horse : the smells , the textures , the sensations , the companionship with another living being .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
Did you ride a horse to work today ?
I did n't .
I 'm sure plenty of people swore they would never ride in or operate a " horseless carriage " — and they never did !
And then they died .
Whether you call them suckers , water sprouts or stump twigs , chances are you have a pretty low opinion of the long , skinny branches that grow from tree stumps or inhabit ditches and fencerows .
But wait — instead of resenting woody whips that insist on regrowing year after year , why not turn them into an asset ?
Armed with an active imagination and a lopping pruner , you can transform green sticks into pretty trellises , fence panels and plant supports .
These simple structures are easy to make , cost practically nothing , and give your garden a handcrafted look .
Indeed , once you get the hang of making things with bent and woven wood , you might find yourself wanting to grow these useful branches on purpose .
This is not a new idea .
Beginning in the Bronze Age , when knives , saws and hatchets came into use , many Europeans and early residents of the British Isles developed wattle work , the art of weaving branches into walls , fences and roofs .
Wattle fences are made by weaving flexible green sapling wood between upright posts , like a wooden tapestry , so they ’re both beautiful and strong .
They were originally used to contain domestic animals , such as sheep .
These days , wattle weaving is a great way to build all kinds of useful rustic garden accents from sustainably harvested wood .
English wattle fences were historically made from willow or hazel wood , both of which are flexible by nature .
Wattle work still is a viable small industry in rural Great Britain , where underwood trees are cut back near the base ( coppiced ) every few years to allow a new crop of fresh shoots to emerge .
Lee Zieke Lee of Willowglen Nursery in Decorah , Iowa , grows willows for the sole purpose of coppicing them every fall , then uses the branches she harvests to make baskets and willow towers .
“ Close spacing helps the branches grow tall and slender , but they get thick and branchy if you let them go too long — which is two years in our area , ” she says .
Lee grows more than 30 varieties of willow , all of which are well - behaved selections that do n’t spread by producing vigorous root buds the way many native species do .
“ You can work with native willows , but not in your yard .
With most native species , it ’s better to coppice them in the wild , ” she says .
Lee gathers her willow branches in the fall and keeps them in her root cellar , tied into bundles , through winter .
Small willow branches , or osiers , can be allowed to dry , then rehydrated by soaking them in water to restore pliability .
This wo n’t work with species other than willow , but that ’s OK because in most climates , you can cut green branches year - round , as you need them .
While some projects do require willow , which is more pliable and splinter - resistant than other woods , you can still do a lot with branches from random tree species .
As I tried my hand at wattle crafts , I used whatever wood was available , which included a little willow and lots of maple , dogwood , oak and other hardwood branches gleaned from my property , as well as from ditches beside public roads .
You can use shrub and fruit tree prunings , too .
Make Garden Wickets
By growing her own willow for coppicing , Lee has a renewable wood source on hand for making a variety of garden accessories .
“ I love the notion that with a few skills , when you need a little fence or plant supports , you do n’t have to go buy anything , ” Lee says .
She and her husband , Lindsay , bend pliable branches into arches to make garden wickets that protect perennials from foot traffic .
“ If you leave them in place , they can work as plant supports later in the season , ” she says , noting any type of wood can be used for wickets .
Whether you link them together to form an edging or place them over plants , all that ’s involved is bending 3 - foot - long smooth , green branches into an arch , then sticking the ends in the ground .
Indoors , two parallel wickets inserted into a pot can provide great support for floppy houseplants , like “ paperwhite ” Narcissus .
When using wickets as outdoor plant supports , Lee suggests placing two or three of them over a plant in one direction , then crossing them with another set of wickets that arch over the first .
Build Wattle Hurdles
Functional wattle fence panels , called hurdles , make it easy to section off parts of your yard and garden , plus they ’re fun to make .
In addition to willow , you can use minimally bendable woods , including oak and maple .
You should be able to build a hurdle in a single day , provided you have a source of 30 or so 6 - foot - long branches that measure less than 1 inch in diameter at the base ends .
I rescued some from a roadside ditch , and now I have a beautiful , handmade 3 - by - 5 - foot hurdle to show for my efforts .
While the art of wattle weaving is generally more detailed than described here , I created a simple , useful hurdle — here ’s how it ’s done .
First prepare five posts that are about 1 ½ inches in diameter , and 12 inches longer than the anticipated hurdle height .
( Crowded saplings taken from the woods work great . )
Use a hatchet to sharpen the bases of the posts , then drive them into the ground , 14 inches apart and 12 inches deep .
I used a piece of rebar to make guide holes for my posts since I was pounding them into hard clay .
You can also make a baseboard for the fence by splitting a long log in half and drilling holes along it for the posts .
Collect a number of long , supple branches and weave them in and out of the posts , allowing the ends to protrude .
Alternate the weave of each new row by starting it on the opposite side of the post from the last row .
Also alternate the base ends of the branches with tip ends , since the thick bases give a tighter weave .
After each branch is in place , push it down to the base of the fence .
When you are satisfied with the panel , use loppers to trim off the ends .
For extra stability , I wove hemp string through the ends to further tighten the hurdle .
When working with sticks , I ’ve come to regard hemp string as the duct tape of the craft .
If something ’s not quite right , you can usually fix it with hemp string , though traditional wattle hurdles are crafted by wrapping the weaving branches around the end posts to secure them .
Craft Towers and Trellises
Woven wattle hurdles require lots of branches , but you can make a beautiful twig tower for growing any type of vining plant using only a half dozen 6 - foot - long sections .
For my beginner ’s project , I made a tower in a large soil - filled pot .
Stick the uprights as far down into the pot as they ’ll go , at equal intervals , to hold the tower steady .
Next , wire the top ends of the uprights together .
I made two “ stretcher ” hoops to add structure to the inside of the tower .
Using pliable branches and wire , I slipped a small hoop inside the top section of the tower , and a larger one near the bottom .
The hoops and wires I used to fasten them together ( and to the uprights ) disappeared as I wove pieces of grapevine into the tower .
I decided the trellis would work better if it had more horizontal structure , so I gathered more grapevines and added a third band of woven branches .
A tight wrap with honeysuckle vines made a great finishing touch for the top .
The tower proved to be both beautiful and practical .
After it supported a spring crop of snow peas , it served as a summer home for ‘ Cypressvine ’ morning glories .

The Lees teach a similar method at their garden workshops , where participants make their own towers .
Starting with 12 to 13 8 - foot branches for the uprights , they tie the uprights together about 2 feet down from the tops .
To give the towers added stability , Lee attaches a wire ring inside the uprights , about 12 inches from the ground .
To make the ring , she bends # 9 fencing wire into a circle and secures it with duct tape , before attaching the ring to each upright on the tower using short sections of wire .
Once it ’s in place , you can weave branches and vines into the tower above the ring any way you like .
To secure the finished tower outside , Lee pounds three pieces of 2 - to - 3 - foot - long rebar into the ground , then wires three of the uprights to the metal stakes .
Of course , there is no law that a plant tower must be 6 or 8 feet tall .
Using the methods described here , you can make one shorter or broader , or even a lean - to tower that can be attached to a wall or fence .
Use your imagination !
“ We humans are really an ingenious lot , but we ’ve allowed our culture to dumb us down , ” Lee says .
Use the Little Sticks
If you work with wattle , you ’ll quickly accumulate lots of small sticks that you ’ve trimmed from the ends of larger ones .
I tied a bunch of these together with hemp string to create a roll - up twig mat that I place over my big planting containers to keep out birds and squirrels while the seeds are germinating .
Then I tied together more small sticks to make a seed cover — a long , shallow box that I topped with plastic and use to foster strong germination in my salad bed .
Use shorter twig tips to make a twig vase .
Just rescue a glass jar from the recycling bin , place three rubber bands around it , and start sticking in twigs around the outside of the jar .
Trim off overly long ends with pruning shears , then tie the twigs in place with hemp , jute , ribbon or raffia .
Remove the rubber bands , and you ’re done !
If you want more ideas , keep your eyes open when visiting country stores or antiques shacks .
I ’ve seen little wall shelf units , picture frames , door handles , wind chimes and even decorative window shutters made out of branches and sticks .
If you get really serious , there ’s rustic twig furniture to consider , though you ’ll be wise to start small , with a simple table .
But that ’s a subject for another day .
Right now , you probably know of a spot or pot that could benefit from a few wickets , a hurdle or a twig tower .
The more you play with sticks , the more nifty uses you ’re likely to discover .
Three Wonderful Willows
Want to start a willow patch at your place ?
By growing new willows from cuttings , you can expect good osier production within three years .
“ We do n’t recommend starting the cuttings in pots , ” says Bobbie Harrison , who grows dozens of willow varieties with her husband , Ron , at Willow Dreams Farm in Edmonton , Ky . “ Willows are one of the most potent natural sources of rooting hormones , so you can expect nine out of 10 cuttings to root successfully , if you root them directly in the ground and control weeds for the first year . ”
Harrison says that you can grow willows in any climate that has at least two months of winter dormancy ( roughly Zones 2 to 8 ) .
To plant cuttings in the spring , push an 8 - inch - long cutting into rich , loose soil so that only an inch or so of the stem is showing .
Within a couple of months , roots will grow from the nodes on the stem .
These three willow species are suggested to use for coppicing :
Golden Willow ( Salix alba vitellina ) :
This species includes many varieties with beautiful yellow - orange osiers , and it ’s the most cold hardy of willows grown for coppice .
Hardy to Zone 4 .
Purple Willow ( S. purpurea ) : Purple willow can be found in many forms , including named varieties , most of which produce purple osiers .
This is the most popular willow grown for coppice .
Hardy to Zone 4 .
Violet Willow ( S. daphnoides ) : Similar to purple willow , this species grows into a tree rather than a shrub if it ’s not coppiced .
It is slightly more heat tolerant than purple willow .
Hardy to Zone 5 .

America ’s worst allies : friends we could ’ve lived without
Back to Pakistan ’s “ get out of jail free ” card for Khan , I was left again with that nagging feeling that we are headed down a familiar road for the United States , where allies we embrace for seemingly pragmatic reasons ultimately become our worst nightmares .
In fact , making a list of America ’s worst allies reveals a trend that suggests that the world ’s hyper power could easily have been cast alongside Jennifer Aniston and Scarlett Johansson in He ’s Just Not That Into
You as one of those prototypical women who buys the line of every sweet - talking guy in town and wakes up in the morning wondering why she feels so used .
Seriously , we ought to be taking relationship advice from Anne Hathaway at this point .
Let ’s make the list .
Pick the five worst allies the United States has had in the past 100 years .
Set up some reasonable criteria , things you look for in a good ally .
So for example , one criterion would be advancing our national interests ( or , alternatively , not dedicating themselves to our destruction ) .
Another would be constancy ( or , alternatively , not using us and then ditching us when the next best looking cause glides into town ) .
Another , since this is a list of worst allies ( all alliances , like all marriages , are imperfect and require work ) , would be to measure the degree of the damage they did to us or sought to do to us .
Finally , other guidelines probably need to be used — for example , if a country underwent a coup or a revolution that changed completely its political orientation it probably ought not to be included on a list of allies who turned against us while under the same leadership that created , sought or supported the alliance .
Before listing the very worst cases of turnabout , it is worth noting a few of the countries that were candidates for various reasons .
( My candidates follow , but please , offer your own suggestions . )
Certainly some of you will nominate the likes of France for being allies who made it difficult for the Atlantic alliance to get anything done and which — often for little more reason than modest economic gain — undermined embargoes and other measures to pressure bad actors into behaving .
I have no doubt that others will suggest that Israel has actually put us and our interests at risk by allowing the settlement of the West Bank and heavy - handedly keeping the Palestinians down .
Some may feel that the embrace of Taiwan has caused more problems than it was worth , though it is undeniable that they were doing what many in the United States thought was in our collective interests .
Still others might contend that the billions spent in Egypt or Colombia resulted in abuses or supported regimes whose interests were not always well aligned with ours .
Suharto was a good “ friend ” except to the extent that he was behind the genocide in Timor or was breathtakingly corrupt .
The Shah of Iran was a good ally for years , modernizing that country , but it can be argued that between the abuses of SAVAK , his secret police , and his lavish spending , he provoked a revolution that has upset the balance in the Middle East for years .
Venezuela was once America ’s best friend in Latin America but now , not so much .
The list goes on .
So who are the worst in modern U.S. history ?
5. France
While they are not guilty of undercutting American interests in ways that are anything like the four other countries cited on this list ( all of whom have gone or seem ready to go from being allies to actually being enemies ) , France has earned a special place on America ’s frienemies list for being so relentlessly difficult to deal with .
They might call it tough love , but for as long as the Atlantic Alliance has existed they have been a drag on it and in numerous cases in the emerging world they tacitly or directly supported our adversaries or undercut American interests .
To be fair , it is tough to pick on them for undercutting us when , especially for most of the past eight years , our policies have often been so worthy of undercutting .
And furthermore , it would be unfair not to acknowledge that there has been a thaw in the air of late thanks to the more pro-U.S. attitude of President Sarkozy .
Still , it is clear that the country that coined the term hyperpower has n’t quite gotten over the fact that the little band of colonies it helped midwife into existence as a nation long ago passed it in influence politically , militarily , economically and , culturally .
So , in the end , they earn the special distinction of being the most dysfunctional of our more high functioning alliances .
4. Pakistan
Pakistan is number four with a bullet .
( For those of you outside the record industry , that means number four but moving up the list . )
This is a country that we have supported and to which we have provided copious aid that nonetheless has become a haven for our worst enemies , a violator of the most fundamental interests of the modern world ( against WMD proliferation ) , a host for terrorists that strike out against other allies and which seems increasingly to be a coup away from fulfilling its long - touted promise of being the most dangerous place in the world .
Few countries can match their record of being so anti-American even as they were still ostensibly our allies .
One of the worst foreign policy errors made in modern history was the decision post 9/11 to look the other way on the emergence of Pakistan ’s nuclear program and lift sanctions associated with it in order to gain tactical “ advantage ” in our war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan by shutting off escape routes into Pakistan .
Only problem : not only is it impossible to shut off those routes , but big portions of the Pakistani intelligence service and the Pakistani population were actively allied with the Taliban and al Qaeda .
So much so that now they call our ally home .
3. Saddam Hussein
We made Saddam .
We sought him as a counter - balance against the power of revolutionary Iran .
We gave him aid , looked the other way when he used chemical weapons and brutally murdered and abused his people and generally wrote off the ugliness to realpolitik .
Then , he literally became our enemy entering in effect a constant state of war with the United States for a decade and a half .
He ultimately cost us trillions , strengthened our enemies , and invited us into a conflict that has deeply undercut our stature in the world and sapped our military strength .
As in all of these twisted alliances , we bear plenty of responsibility for making the situation worse .
But as ungrateful , self - serving , twisted , bad allies go , Saddam is certainly headed for a place in the Hall of Fame .
2. The Mujahideen of the Soviet - Afghan War
Yes , with our help they managed the only major defeat suffered by the Soviet Army and in so doing they probably help precipitate the decline and fall of the Soviet empire .
Yes , they fought heroically against a much more heavily armed foe that employed horrific tactics .
But in the end , many members of the Mujahideen kept the weapons and turned their anti-Western attitudes against the United States .
From these groups came both the Taliban and al Qaeda .
Among them was Osama bin Laden , who used the skill sets he developed as a U.S. - backed fighter to build the terror organization that ultimately conducted the most deadly attack on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor .
As he remains our number one enemy and a symbol to a movement that still threatens us worldwide , his place high atop this list ca n’t be disputed .
1. The Soviet Union
There are few examples of the backfiring of the playing the enemy - of - my - enemy - is - my - friend card that will ever rival this one .
The Soviets not only went from by our indispensible ally in defeating the Nazis to being the Evil Empire with which we were locked in a death struggle for almost half a century , but they for a while , they were clearly both .
As World War II drew to a close , it was already clear that battle lines were being drawn for a potential future conflict with the Russians .
Joint victory celebrations , laden with tension , became opportunities to divide up Europe into what would instantly become its Cold War boundaries .
In the name of the “ cold ” conflict that followed , hot wars bled the world for decades and the planet was at the precarious edge of self - inflicted extinction throughout .
But as I say , these are off the top of my head coming out of the weekend .
Better ideas are welcome , especially since I do n’t really like lumping France in with these really bad relationships .
( Although it ’s always fun to tweak them . )
And it feels wrong to leave out Asians or Latins .
So … suggestions anyone ?

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina , friends said , but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled .
Things were n't adding up .
Money appeared to be missing .
John and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island , South Carolina .
So they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns , recalled one close friend , Nancy Cappelmann .
The Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3 , she added .
It would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple .
The Calverts lived part - time on their yacht , docked at the island 's Harbor Town Yacht Basin , the same marina where they managed boat slips .
They spent the rest of the year in Savannah , Georgia , and also had a home in Atlanta .
They were an active , affluent couple in their mid-40s , and their absence was quickly noticed .
On the evening of March 3 , 2008 , the evening they were to meet with their accountant , both of the Calverts ' phones were turned off .
Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones .
Watch an update on the case »
Family and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4 , after they missed appointments and still could n't be reached .
" I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late , so when 20 minutes went by , I got worried and called his cell , but it went straight to voicemail , like it was turned off , " Cappelmann said .
She was a good friend of the couple 's and worked at one of their harbor businesses .

Police and search teams scoured the island .
Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing .
The Calverts ' small airplane was still at the island 's airport and provided no clues .
Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes , a gated community six miles from where the Calverts ' yacht was docked .
The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues .
In reconstructing the Calverts ' last days , investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look .
They now say they believe the 54 - year - old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive .
Gerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts ' four businesses on Hilton Head Island .
Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company , The Club Group .
They named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared .
An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $ 2.1 million from the Calverts and others , police said .
Gerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest , slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife , authorities said .
He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case , said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner .
Tanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions , but did n't say specifically what those actions might have been .
Police also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing , including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared .
In addition , police learned that Gerwing 's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts .
If Gerwing were alive , Tanner said , police would n't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him .
Police executed search warrants on Gerwing 's office , home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing 's kitchen .
Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert .
Friends and family are offering a $ 65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts ' disappearance .
Police urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert to call the tip line at ( 843 ) 524-2777 .
Police also are seeking help from anyone who saw the Calverts ' 2006 Mercedes Benz E320 , Georgia Tech license plate GT821B on or about March 3 , 2008 .

We surveyed a thousand people who still have landline phones and no caller I.D.
We asked for their opinion on our new technology .
34 % said , " Fiddlesticks , " and 23 % could n't hear the question .
43 % thought we were in the room with them and offered us a hard candy .
By selling his secret recipe of regular and sugar - free lemonade , 13 - year - old Mark Rinkel raised enough money to get a service dog to help his little brother Jason cope with Type 1 diabetes .
But Mark says the dog he worked so hard to get did not detect serious changes in his brother ’s blood sugar , as was promised , and the dog also bit Jason ’s hand when he tried to pet him .
“ It turned out to be a scam , ” said the boys ’ mother , Marisa Rinkel .
“ After he bit my son , we gave him back . ”
The story of Mark ’s lemonade stand was featured in summer 2007 on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” and CNN , helping him raise $ 17,000 , more than the $ 6,000 needed to buy a service dog that was supposed to be trained to detect when his 11 - year - old brother ’s blood sugar was dangerously low or high .
Jason has hypoglycemic unawareness , which means he may not know that his blood sugar is out of control until he gets violently ill .
Mark , who lives in Aurora , obtained the dog named Jedi from Heaven Scent Paws , a company based in Missouri , and donated the leftover money to the company so other families with diabetic children could get their own service dogs .
Now the Missouri attorney general has filed a lawsuit against Heaven Scent Paws after receiving 28 complaints from consumers , including one from Mark Rinkel , who say they were scammed .
David G. Bandre , an attorney for Heaven Scent Paws , said the Rinkels ’ allegations are false and that Jedi has been a successful service dog with the family he lives with now .
“ A core group of about 10 families who are unhappy with Heaven Scent Paws never followed through on their contractual relationship with the company , including the follow - up care and training at home , ” Bandre said .
“ These are people who expected to get home with the dog who alerted 100 percent of the time right away , and frankly , that defies logic after a one - week class in Missouri . ”
The dogs are supposed to respond by barking or making some kind of commotion when they smell the child ’s blood - glucose level dropping or rising — which puts the diabetic at risk for seizures and blackouts .
The dogs can sometimes detect a rise or fall in blood sugar before a monitor can , Marisa Rinkel said .
The Rinkels took Jedi to seven experts who told them he was an ineffective service dog and that he was prone to bite people when scared .
Although the Rinkels returned Jedi , Mark wo n’t get his money and donation back .
Bandre says the family benefited from the company ’s training and materials while they were in Missouri .
“ I suppose if the Circuit Court of Cole County ( in Missouri ) directs them to give it back , but absent that , no , ” Bandre said of the money .
The lawsuit filed by the attorney general says Heaven Scent Paws took thousands of dollars from consumers who purchased dogs that did not perform as promised and refused to return customers ’ money .
It also says Heaven Scent Paws misrepresented that its trained dogs could alert diabetics for low and high blood sugar when some of the dogs could not .
A hearing to set a trial date is scheduled Jan. 22 .
Meanwhile , Mark ’s story of raising thousands to help his brother won him a $ 5,000 award from Prudential that required him to give the money to the charity he was working with .
Mark did not want to turn the prize over to Heaven Scent Paws and decided to start his own service - dog charity .
Mark named his charity Red Alert Dogs for Diabetics to raise money for other families who ca n’t afford to purchase a scent - trained service dog .
The Rinkels eventually got Jason another dog from a different service - dog provider .
The dog is a fox red British labrador they named Red .
Red starts to pace , wildly wags his tail and begins to bark when he detects that Jason ’s blood sugar is out of control .
“ Red has saved Jason ’s life at least three times , ” his mother said .
Mark also is training a puppy named Lucy to detect the glucose scent so she can work for another diabetic child .
He hopes Lucy and the family she goes to can be used in a scientific study so that a device to detect changes in blood sugar through a person ’s breath can be developed .
Dr. H. Peter Chase , a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine , has expressed interest in helping Mark with the research , but they need to raise $ 30,000 in grant money to do the work .
“ I want to figure out what the dogs are smelling and work with the scientific community , ” Mark said .
“ It would change the lives of thousands of people . ”

Feb . 6 , 2009  -- Which Bushism is not like the others ?
" The true strength of America happens when a neighbor loves a neighbor just like they 'd like to be loved themselves . "
" This foreign policy stuff is a little frustrating . "
" Waterboarding feels great !
It 's a spa treatment at Bliss -- look it up . "
Maybe that was too easy .
It 's the third , of course , that comes not from the former president of the United States but from his most famous doppelganger , Will Ferrell , who mined the canon of Bushisms to come up with " You 're Welcome , America : A Final Night With George W. Bush . "
Ferrell 's first Broadway play opened Thursday , and in addition to his iconic impression , it includes a sexbot Condi Rice , a breakdancing Secret Service agent and a phone call with " Brownie " -- aka Michael Brown , the former head of FEMA .
In an excerpt from that phone call , Dubya reminisces with Brownie about fumbling the rebuilding of New Orleans post - Hurricane Katrina :
" Remember when Kanye West on national television said that I hated black people ?
I do n't hate black people .
I never even think about them , ever .
Yeah -- it 's not in my day to day . "
Implying that Bush is racist is one of Ferrell 's softer shots .
" You 're Welcome , America , " which Ferrell wrote with former " Saturday Night Live " cohort Adam McKay , fabricates a gay past for the former president as well as an " animal - like " affair with his secretary of state .
It 's wacky , it 's weird , it 's out there and it's not at all kind -- but , Ferrell explained , he felt biting satire was warranted given public opinion on the Bush presidency .
" We do n't really comment on anything that did n't happen .
In terms of sensitivity , we are n't really saying anything that is n't really a fact , " he told ABCNews.com at the party following the show 's premiere .
" [ Bush ] displayed a certain attitude , and that 's the attitude I convey onstage .
There 's a lot of material , and in some ways I look at the show and think that we held back . "
Why Will Ferrell 's Doing Dubya Now
Why now , after change has come to the White House and America 's entered a new era ?
Ferrell said he sees the show as a release , closure -- like venting after a breakup .
" The comments I 've gotten [ about the show ] is it feels like a cathartic experience , " he said .
" You 're getting to go through the last eight years and we 're commenting on things that just were n't commented on . "
A spokesperson for Bush said the former president does n't plan to see Ferrell 's show and declined to comment further on it .
It 's just as well .
If " You 're Welcome , America " is to Ferrell what an Alanis Morissette song is to an angry ex , the former president ought not to watch .
It could get ugly .
Funny , but ugly .
British taxpayers are being left to plug a multibillion - pound hole in the public finances as hundreds of the country 's biggest companies increasingly employ complex and secretive tax arrangements to limit the amount they hand over to the exchequer .
An extensive Guardian investigation has examined the accounts of the UK 's biggest companies - many of them household names - and discovered a series of sophisticated tax strategies which , critics say , amount to an almost unstoppable tide of perfectly legal corporate tax avoidance .
The veil of confidentiality that covers these tax avoidance schemes is so difficult to penetrate that nobody knows exactly how much tax goes missing each year .
But HM Revenue & Customs estimated that the size of the tax gap could be anything between £ 3.7bn and £ 13bn .
The Commons public accounts committee put it at a possible £ 8.5bn and the TUC said £ 12bn .
UK listed companies are not required to set out exactly how much UK corporation tax they actually hand over to HM Revenue & Customs .
When the Guardian asked each FTSE 100 company to provide this information only two offered a response .
Similarly each company was asked what its official policy on so - called tax planning is and how this is implemented .
No company was prepared to answer the question directly .
However , the investigation , which we publish over coming days , has established that :
• The UK - based drinks giant Diageo plc has transferred ownership of brands worth billions of pounds , including Johnnie Walker , J&B and Gilbey 's gin , to a subsidiary in the Netherlands where profits accrued virtually tax - free .
Despite average profits of £ 2bn a year , it paid an average of £ 43 m a year in UK tax - little more than 2 % of its overall profits .
• Two major drug firms have shifted ownership of their brands to tax havens in the Caribbean .
Their UK operations can then be made to pay royalties for the use of the trademarks , reducing their profits and the amount of tax due in this country .
• An internationally renowned corporation has structured itself so that it is now simultaneously a British public company , tax - resident in Amsterdam , but whose brands are Swiss - owned .
• The makers of an iconic British food product have shifted the rights in it to a tax haven in Switzerland .
• A household name has been deliberately loaded with debt so that it no longer has any profits to pay tax on .
• Top accountancy firms are charging £ 500,000 a time to invent tax - avoidance schemes .
• Some UK - listed companies which have moved control to Dublin to benefit from Ireland 's low - tax regime appear to have little real presence there .
According to the National Audit Office , in 2006 more than 60 % of Britain 's 700 biggest companies paid less than £ 10 m corporation tax , and 30 % paid nothing .
Britain's top taxman , Dave Hartnett , told the Commons public accounts committee last year that 12 major corporations had " extinguished all tax liabilities in 2005 - 6 " thanks to avoidance schemes .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats ' deputy leader , said last night : " The scale of corporate tax - dodging exposed by the Guardian research is absolutely mind - boggling .
It will deeply anger households and businesses who pay their fair share .
" The baroque complexities of corporate tax - avoidance schemes are similar to the elaborate structures which have now devastated a substantial part of the banking system .
The tax authorities should stop trying to compete in the complexity stakes and apply the general principle that if companies deliberately seek to avoid taxation they should be penalised and charged . "
According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies , overall tax receipts - including personal income tax - will be £ 7bn lower next year than forecast as a result of the downturn .
The respected thinktank says key Labour programmes face being squeezed , in particular health and education spending .
The result , say unions and campaigners , is that ordinary taxpayers have to make up the difference .
If the TUC estimate of £ 12bn is correct , it takes the average income tax contribution of 2.4 m households just to fill the gap left by the perfectly legal tax manoeuvres of big business .
That £ 12bn is the equivalent of around 480 new schools , 300 hospitals or more than 1.3 m new nursery places .
Today , theguardian.com is also launching a unique interactive database of the corporation tax figures recorded in the accounts of each FTSE 100 compay in the last four years .
It reveals the low amounts of tax paid by some , and a reluctance to supply meaningful numbers to the public .
Despite their efforts to shift profits out of the country and minimise UK tax , the companies enjoy a range of important benefits by being based in Britain and listed on the London stock exchange .
This has given them access to one of the widest pools of capital in the world ; they have enjoyed light - touch but respected regulation and high corporate governance standards ; and it has enhanced their international reputations to be listed in the UK , helping them to attract the best talent .
Companies here also benefit from political stability and - perhaps most important of all - the directors want to live near London
Many of the companies the Guardian looked at are already feeling the effects of the recession on their profits so their tax bills will go down .
But campaigners insist that this makes the task of collecting maximum tax revenues more , rather than less , urgent .
Failure to do so , they say , will put a massive strain on public finances already being stretched to breaking - point .
Brendan Barber , TUC general secretary , said : " Tax avoidance is hollowing out the tax system .
With the rest of us having to fill the tax gap left by Britain 's most wealthy , there is a real threat to the future of public services - especially as the recession takes its toll on normal tax flows .
" It will be hard to maintain public support for tax when it looks increasingly optional for big companies and the super - rich , who increasingly float free from the network of mutual obligations that underpin any civilised society . "
As they watch tax receipts dwindle through a combination of legal avoidance schemes and economic downturn , governments also face international pressure to crack down on the entirely separate problem of illegal tax evasion .
In the US , Barack Obama introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act in 2007 when he was still just an Illinois senator .
Obama and his fellow sponsors of the act , Democrat Carl Levin and Republican Norm Coleman , claimed the US annual tax gap was approaching $ 100bn .
" We need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our tax laws so that those who work hard and play by the rules are n't disadvantaged , " Obama said .
Political concern is growing across Europe .
German chancellor Angela Merkel launched hostilities against individual tax evaders after her secret service bought computer discs from a whistleblower detailing the bank accounts of thousands of wealthy Germans in the tiny Alpine tax haven of Liechtenstein .
In Britain , the Revenue paid £ 100,000 for the same information about individual UK tax dodgers and is now pursuing them .
And just before Christmas , Alastair Darling , the chancellor , launched a potentially explosive review of British - linked tax havens .
The are a lot of interesting browsers around here : Firefox 3.1 beta2 , Opera 10 alpha , Chrome , Safari 4 beta , Epiphany , Arora , but which one will offer the best Web Application Experience ?
The Web Applications and HTML5 will be more and more important ( Palm Pre did a WebOS on it ) and the new HTML5 Storage will permit to decrease the gap between online and offline applications .
if you have a WebKit based browser you can test already the Note demo app .
It has nice animations and it works offline .
Dromaeo All tests
This test is Dromaeo ( All tests ) from Mozilla .
It tests some real world javascript libraries like Prototype , YUI , .. and it takes about 33 minutes each browser .
The browsers tested are Firefox 3.1 beta2 , Opera 10 alpha , Google Chrome and some WebKit - based browser like Safari 4 , Arora ( - qt - webkit ) and Epiphany ( - gtk- webkit )
The Linux binaries come from Mozilla and Opera sites .
Windows is XP SP3 and Vista SP1 .
The Linux OS used is Ubuntu 8.10 ( and Ubuntu 9.04 ) .
A benchmark with IE8 is avalable from ZDNet Australia .
Higher is better
The WebKit based browsers are really fast , with the Arora exception .
The same version of Firefox or Opera in Linux are slower than in Windows .
We 'll investigate this point later but a similar benchmark was already known .
The V8 Benchmark
The V8 test from Google is done with Firefox 3.0.6 , Opera 9.6.3 , Epiphany - Gecko 1.9 and - WebKit .
Higher is better
Why Firefox is slower on Linux ?
Epiphany Gecko acts as Firefox Linux .
Opera is Qt4 and it is slower in Linux too .
The problem is not the GTK GUI toolkit .
The fglrx or the radeon drivers does n't change the results and even Firefox / Opera - wine are faster that the Linux native version .
Xorg is not the problem .
The Linux version of both browser is proportionally slower .
Conclusion
Maybe the major culprit is the compiler .
What do you think ?
This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending and presenting at the annual SXSW conference , down in Austin , TX .
I participated in a panel discussion called ‘ More Secrets of JavaScript Libraries ’ ( a follow - up panel to last year ’s talk ) .
The synopsis was as follows :
In a reprise from last year ’s popular panel – the JavaScript libraries authors are getting together again to impart their what they ’ve learned from their experience in developing solid , world - class , JavaScript libraries .
Covering everything from advanced aspects of the JavaScript language , to handling cross - browser issues , all the way up to packaging and distribution .
A complete set of knowledge for a JavaScript developer .
The talks went really well – we each gave a quick 10 minute presentation on a topic that interested us and finished up with some Q&A .
The individual talks were as follows :
Getting Loaded ( All about network performance and file loading ) – by Nate Koechley of YUI .
Meta -Language Frameworks ( Talking about the abstractions provided by frameworks ) – by Andrew Dupont of Prototype .
Real World Accessibility ( A quick examination of the upcoming ARIA specification ) – by Becky Gibson of IBM and Dojo .
Performance and Testing ( Looking at various performance analysis and testing techniques ) – by John Resig of jQuery .
The full presentation and audio can be found online .

Leaked Red Cross report renews call for probe of Bush era Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday March 17 , 2009
Print This Email This A leaked Red Cross report on CIA " torture " of detainees offers fresh ammunition to demands that officials from the Bush administration be prosecuted for their conduct , rights groups have revealed .
President Barack Obama has so far sidestepped calls from some fellow Democrats and from civil liberties activists to go after officials from the previous administration over torture allegations , saying he wants to " look forward . "
But his administration will face renewed pressure to take action following the leaking of the internal document from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , which describes abuse in harrowing detail .
" The more these kind of reports come out , the more pressure it puts on the government to do something , " said Sarah Mendelson , director of the human rights and security initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Providing the most detailed account yet of the treatment of detainees under former president George W. Bush , the 2007 report by the ICRC describes beatings , sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures and " suffocation by water , " of 14 suspected Al - Qaeda members .
The abuse described by the detainees , including being slammed into walls and deprived of sleep and solid food for days , " constituted torture , " the Red Cross document said .
Other methods " constituted cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " it said .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Constitutional Rights have both urged an aggressive investigation of officials who allegedly approved the use of torture , citing revelations in court documents and other sources already made public .
" I think there is enough evidence in the public domain to warrant a much more serious investigation than has been conducted thus far , " Jameel Jaffer , director of ACLU 's national security program , told AFP .
" And there 's certainly enough evidence out there to warrant the appointment of an independent prosecutor to look into criminal responsibility for the torture of prisoners in CIA custody , " Jaffer said .
ICRC officials did not dispute the authenticity of the report , but a spokesman at the agency 's headquarters in Geneva regretted that the document was made public .
The CIA declined to comment .
The report carried added weight given the neutrality of the ICRC , a humanitarian organization that carefully avoids political comment and works to assist those detained or displaced in war .
At least five copies of the report had been shared with the CIA and top White House officials in 2007 , but barred from public release by ICRC guidelines intended to preserve the organization 's policy of neutrality .
Rights activists speculated the document may have been leaked by officials in the current administration amid internal debates about detention policies .
As a signatory to the UN convention banning torture , the United States may be legally obliged to carry out a probe of former officials , Mendelson said .
" I think they are compelled to open some kind of investigation by allegations of torture , under the convention against torture , " she said .
" That investigation does not need to be made public but they need to be doing it . "
Some Democrats in Congress have called for a truth commission to look into a range of alleged abuses by the former administration as part of the " war on terror , " including CIA interrogations at secret sites and warrantless wiretapping .
Obama has offered a cool reception to calls for truth commissions but has not ruled out possible prosecutions , saying no one should be above the law .
The president said last month that " my general orientation is to say let 's get it right moving forward . "
Since Obama took office , government departments have released documents that have shed light on how the previous administration carried out controversial policies , such as the transfer of prisoners for secret interrogations .
Republican lawmakers meanwhile have condemned the truth commission proposal as a witch - hunt .
Some critics of the Bush administration say even a truth commission inquiry would be a half - measure .
" This is not about mistakes .
This is about fundamental lawbreaking , about the disposal of the Constitution , and about the end of treaties , " Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , said in a radio interview earlier this month .

Clojure ( リンク ) はLISP ファミリの言語のかなり新しいメンバであり、Javaプラットフォームで動作する。2007年に導入され、すで高い関心を集めている。ひとつの理由はClojureの並行処理へのアプローチであり、ソフトウェアトランザクショナルメモリ( STM)のコンセプトを踏まえている。
Stuart Halloway氏は「 Programming Clojure 」 ( リンク ) （ Pragmatic Programmersで公開されている）の著者であるが、この本は現在ベータ版である。私達はStuart氏とClojureやSTM、ツール、さらにたくさんのことを話した。
InfoQ : Clojureは並行処理の支援にSTMを使用していますが、STMについて簡単に教えて下さい。
STM はもっと大きな話である、ミュータブルな状態のための明確なAPIの一部です。みなさんのコードを純粋な機能的でミュータブルなレイヤに分割することによって、２つの大きなメリットがあります。
*純粋な機能的なコードは、テストや再利用がずっと簡単です。
*明確でミュータブルなAPIを選択することが可能ですが、このAPIはみなさんの並行性や拡張性のニーズにぴったりです。Clojureは様々な状況に対して４つの異なるAPIを提供します：refとSTM、agent、varそしてatomです。さらに、いつでもレベルを落としてJava Concurrency API を使用することが出来ます。
InfoQ : Clojureに興味を持っているもう一つのグループは既にLISPに親しんでいるプログラマ達ですが、彼らがClojureを試す場合にはどのようなことに気をつける必要がありますか？
私か らLisperへのアドバイスは 「 初めは我慢して下さい」です。Clojureは他のLispとの後方互換性に制約されないLispです。これが実際問題として意味しているのは、多くの違いがあるということです。少しClojureを使うとすぐに、みなさんはおそらくRich氏の設計の決定は十分に熱意を持ったものであることに同意するでしょう。
Clojureのウェブサイトには、他の多くのLISPとの違いを示すドキュメントがある(リンク)
。Clojureの作者であ るRich Hickey氏は、Java開発者のためにClojureを説明したスライド(リンク)と、逆にLISPerの視点から(リンク)書いたものを提供している。
InfoQ : Java利用者、あるいはもっと一般的には、オブジェクト指向プログラミングに慣れている開発者は、Clojureを使うためにどのような習慣を捨てる必要がありますか？
他のホットな新しいVM言語とは異なり、Clojureはオブジェクト指向では
*ない* のです。初めはこのことに臆するかもしれません：「どのようにしてオブジェクトなしでシステムを設計するのでしょうか？」
しか しClojureは、皆さんがオブジェクト指向から望む多くのものを提供
*して* います。
* カプセル化（名前空間、private記述と閉鎖による）
*強力な多相性（マルチメソッド）
* 機能的な再利用は継承より優れています（機能とイミュータブルな状態は継承階層よりもうまく構成されます）。
Clojureと多くのオブジェクト指向言語の違いは、オブジェクト指向言語が固定のメニューを提供するのに対して、Clojureの機能はアラカルトなことです。
InfoQ : LISP から始める場合はどのようなリソースがおすすめですか（もちろん、あなたの本の他に）？
Clojureはたくさんの素晴らしいアイデアを結び付けています。Programming Clojureに加え、
* Lispの知識を得るために はSeibel氏 のPractical Common Lisp（邦訳：実 践Common Lisp、オーム社）
* Lispマクロに はGraham氏 のOn Lisp（邦訳 ：On Lisp、オーム社）
* 並行処理で はGoetz氏他 のJava Concurrency in Practice（邦訳 ：Java並行処理プログラミング、ソフトバンククリエイティブ）
* 機能的プログラミングに はO'Sullivan氏他 のReal World Haskell
* Abelson氏 とSussman氏 のStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs（邦訳：計算機プログラムの構造と解釈、ピアソンエデュケーション）
をお勧めします。誰もが読むべきだからです。

InfoQ以前からあるLISPのパターン/プラクティスでClojure開発者が避けるべきものは何ですか？（例えば、いたるところでリストを使う代わりに、可能な限り、マップやベクタのようなClojureのデータ構造を好むようにするとか？）
あなたはほとんど質問の中であげています。Clojureでは、リストはほとんどコードのためのものです。データには、ジョブに適した構造を選び、シーケンスのライブラリを採用してください。Java APIを直接呼び出すことも恐れないで下さい。
InfoQ:Clojureのライブラリはどのようになっていますか？
どんなニーズ（ウェブ開発、DBアクセス、テスト、ビヘイビア駆動開発）のためにも、３つか４つの有望なClojureライブラリがあります。著書は「Clojure in the Wild」という章で終わるのですが、その中ではこれらのいくつかを簡単に紹介し、test-isテスティング・フレームワークとCompojureを使ってもっと拡張した例を示しています。
Clojureのメーリングリストで 、Rich Hickey氏が先ごろClojureライブラリのメンテナに、彼らが取り組んでいるライブラリの報告を求めていた(リンク)。たくさんのClojureプロジェクトをGitHubのClojure言語のカテゴリ下(リンク)で見つけることができる。
InfoQ : （ Javaプラットフォームだけではなく）マルチプラットフォームのClojureを見てみたいと思いますか？
いいえ 。Clojure がJavaと統合されていることは、そのパワーの鍵です。もちろん、私は機能的なLispが.NETプラットフォームと一緒になったものを歓迎します -- しかし、それはClojureであるべきではありません。
InfoQ : あなた はClojureプログラミングにどんなツールを使っていますか？
私はEmacsと、SLIMEをときどき使っています。しかし、私は既にEmacsユーザだったので、この選択はいうまでもなかったことです。viやEclipse、IDEA、NetBeans用のプラグインもあります。
IDE /エディタ のClojureサポートの例としては：clojure-dev(リンク) （Eclipse）、clojure-intellij-plugin(リンク ) （IntelliJ）、enclojure ( リンク ) （ NetBeans）がある 。Gorilla( リンク ) （VIM ） はSLIME (リンク ) （Emacs）と似ている。 （Bill Clementson氏はClojure用にEmacsとSLIMEを設定する方法を知っている。(リンク ) )
これらのツールの多くは同じようなことをする必要があるので、こうしたツールのための共通のバックエンドを共同で行う話がある(リンク)。ひとつの選択肢はSLIMEやGorillaのようなアプローチを使うことであり、つまり、Clojureインスタンスを実行し、ドキュメントのルックアップ（Clojureのシンボルはドキュメンテーション文字列をメタデータ(リンク)として持っている）、コードのルックアップ、名前空間のブラウジング等の問い合わせを行うのである。
InfoQ : あなたは今、商用の重要なプロジェクトでClojureを使用したいと思いますか？
もしあなたがアジャイルチームにいて優れたテストスイートがあれば、私はClojureを製品に使用することをためらわないでしょう。
InfoQでは先ご ろClojureで作成されたアプリケーションが製品で使用されている例(参考記事)をレポートした。（InfoQにはさらなるClojureに関するコンテンツがある(参考記事リンク )）。
みなさん はClojureを検討したいと思われるだろうか？みなさんが面白いとおもわれるのはClojureのどの面だろうか

A drug deal that is mainly about the drugs .
That was many analysts ’ assessment Monday of Merck ’s agreement to pay $ 41.1 billion in cash and stock for Schering - Plough .
The merger would join pharmaceutical companies that had combined sales of $ 46.9 billion last year .
Mega -mergers of this sort have been widely expected ever since Pfizer began the consolidation race in January by agreeing to pay $ 68 billion for Wyeth .
And others are likely to follow , as many of the same factors — like expiring patents and soaring development costs — propel drug makers into one another ’s arms .
But if Pfizer - Wyeth was driven in part by desperation , analysts said , for Merck the Schering deal may actually be a good opportunity to restock its medicine chest .
Merck ’s former blockbuster bone drug Fosamax has gone generic , and in a few years the same thing will happen to its best - selling allergy and asthma drug Singulair .
The merger gives it access to successful brand - name Schering products with much longer patents , like the prescription allergy spray Nasonex .
And Merck could capitalize on Schering ’s investments in promising biotechnology drugs .
“ It ’s better than the other deal , ” Robert Hazlett , an analyst with BMO Capital Markets , said of the Merck - Schering merger .
“ I ’m not enamored of Pfizer - Wyeth . ”
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- China has blocked the popular video - sharing Web site YouTube but did not offer a reason for the ban .
YouTube was blocked in China as of Wednesday .
Google , which owns YouTube , said it began noticing a decline in traffic from China about noon Monday .
By early Wednesday , site users insider China continued to encounter an error message : " Network Timeout .
The server at youtube.com is taking too long to respond . "
" We do not know the reason for the blockage and we are working as quickly as possible to restore access to our users , " said Scott Rubin , a spokesman for Google , which owns YouTube .
It 's not the first time users in China have been unable to access the site .
In March 2008 , China blocked YouTube during riots in Tibet .
Watch more about the decision »
At the time , protesters burned vehicles and shops , some advocating independence from China , and others demonstrating against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area .
The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead , according to the Chinese government .
Tibet 's self - proclaimed government - in - exile put the death toll from the protests at 140 .
Many in the country speculated the latest ban may be an attempt to filter access to footage that a Tibetan exile group released .
The videos show Tibetans being kicked and beaten , allegedly by Chinese police officers after the riots .
" Though there is much footage of the protests taking place throughout Tibet last year that were splashed across the world , the following is rare footage of police beating of protesters , the suffering and death of a captive , and paramilitary presence in Lhasa ( the Tibetan capital ) , which managed to make its way to the outside world , " the Tibetan government - in - exile in Dharamsala , India , said of the videos .
Xinhua , China 's state news agency , accused the supporters of Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , of doctoring the video to " deceive the international community . "
China , with 298 million Internet users , has routinely blocked access to Web sites it considers politically unacceptable , including the Voice of America and The New York Times .
The Chinese government has also censored television broadcasts , including those by the BBC and CNN , during coverage of issues such as its policy in Tibet and Taiwan .
The Chinese government did not directly address whether it has blocked YouTube .
" China is not afraid of the Internet , " said Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Tuesday .

We know who ’s hot now , but who are the hottest women from the past and the recent present ?
Even if you already know , it ’s till nice to look !
Oh , and we put some words in here too .
Let ’s start from the beginning …
Mae West ( 1893 – 1980 )
Mae West was a hot number in the 1930s and 1940s in particular as she starred in films such as “ Go West , Young Man ” ( 1936 ) and “ Little Chickadee ” ( 1940 ) .
Some sexy lines that she made famous include , “ Is that a pistol in your pocket or are you just happy to see me ? ” and from “ I ’m No Angel ” ( 1933 ) , she said , “ When I ’m good , I ’m very good .
When I ’m bad , I ’m better ” .
Hubba , hubba !
Greta Garbo ( 1905 – 1990 )
Greta was an active actress way back when silent movies were around until 1941 with her last film appearance in “ Two - Faced Woman ” .
The fact that she spoke with a Swedish accent made her even more irresistible and mysterious .
I ’m sold !
Fay Wray ( 1907 – 2004 )
Faye
Wray started her acting career in the early to mid 1920 ’s , but she ’s the best known for her performance as Anne Darrow in the 1933 classic “ King Kong ” .
It ’s a shame the big ape got to her first .
Bette Davis ( 1908 – 1989 )
Bette Davis is one of the few that stood the test of time .
From her first film , “ The Bad Sister ” in 1931 to her last one , “ Wicked Stepmother ” in 1989 , Bette Davis was in 103 films , six TV series , one miniseries , and made guest appearances on several other TV shows .
She showed the world that she was n’t just a pretty face , but she had that too .
Ingrid Bergman ( 1915 – 1982 )
Ingrid Bergman was another actress that was more than just a pretty face as her film career of nearly 50 years shows .
Though she was in movies from 1932 to 1978 , her most famous one was “ Casablanca ” ( 1942 ) where she plays opposite Humphrey Bogart .
Lucky Bogey !
Betty Grable ( 1916 – 1973 )
Betty Grable starred in her first movie in 1929 , but was really big in the 1930s and 1940s .
At the end of the 1940s , Betty was the highest paid actress in Hollywood .
Rita Hayworth ( 1918 – 1987 )
Hayworth actually got her start in show business at the age of 6 as part of her family ’s dancing group “ The Dancing Cansinos ” .
By the mid 1930 ’s , she ’d worked her way into films and was a big name in the 1940s and 1950s , but she still appeared in films through the mid 1970s .
Marilyn Monroe ( 1926 – 1962 )
Marilyn Monroe is probably considered the sexiest woman ever in our history .
In her short life of only 36 years , she had been in 35 movies , posed for Playboy ’s centerfold ( December 1953 ) and been married three times .
There , of course is a lot of controversy surrounding her alleged affairs , especially the one that was said to involve President Kennedy .
In fact , some say the Kennedys had her killed .
I do n’t know if she was killed , but she had killer looks .
Bridget Bardot ( 1934 -)
This French actress started to wow America in the 1950s and continued for two decades .
In 2007 , she was named as one of America ’s top 100 sexiest film stars .
Oh , I love the French !
Farrah Fawcett ( 1947 -)
Farah Fawcett is perhaps remembered most by her role in “ Charlies ’ Angels ” , but her first appearance on television was in 1967 on “ Bat Girl ” .
Fawcett also did some film acting as well .
As many know , she was married to Lee Majors from 1973 to 1982 when they got a divorce and she married Ryan O’Neal that same year .
Hmmm …
Bo Derek ( 1956 -)
Bo Derek got her start in the late 1970s when we saw her first in “ Orca : The Killer Whale ” ( 1977 ) .
Perhaps her most famous role was in the movie “ 10 ” .
From that point on , she was known as the “ perfect 10 ” .
Yah !
Madonna ( 1958 -)
For over a decade , it seemed as if Madonna ’s number one objective was to get attention – and that she did !
From her “ Like a Virgin Days ” to her sex controversy , she was wild and “ out there ” , but always a fascination to Americans .
Nowadays , she ’s still active in the music industry , but she ’s toned thing down a lot .
It ’s been kind of boring since then .
Do n’t you miss the old Madonna ?
Sharon Stone ( 1958 -)
Though Sharon Stone had made appearances in films in the 1980s , her career really did n’t take off until the 1990’s .
Her first big break was her role in “ Total Recall ” ( 1990 ) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and she ’s still active in films today .
Heather Locklear ( 1961 -)
Heather Locklera got her start in 1979 with small parts here and there , but landed her first spot a regular cast member on “ T.J. Hooker ” in 1982 starring William Shatner .
From there Locklear went on to be in roles on shows such as “ Melrose Place ” and “ Spin City ” .
Ca n’t get enough of Heather !
Courtney Cox ( 1964 -)
Courtney Cox started her show biz career in the 1980s and was somewhat successful , but never huge until the 1990s .
Perhaps her most prominent role before “ Friends ” was as Alex P. Keaton ’s ( Michael J. Fox ) girlfriend Lauren on “ Family Ties ” .
In 1994 , she began her 10 - year run with “ Friends ” , where she became huge .
Since 2007 , she ’s been starring on FX Network ’s “ Dirt ” .
It ’s good to have her back and she’ s sexier than ever .
Halle Berry ( 1966 -)
Model and actress Halle Berry has turned the heads of millions and why not ?
She ’s hot !
She actually been on television since 1989 and has been active in TV and movies ever since .
In addition , she appears in a few new series that have yet to come out , so look for her in “ Framkie and Alice ” and other upcoming shows .
Cindy Crawford ( 1966 -)
Who does n’t know Cindy Crawford ?
Though she ’s been in some films , she ’s best known as one of the hottest supermodels ever .
‘ Nuff said !
Pamela Anderson ( 1967 -)
Uh – How do you start talking about Pamela Anderson ?
How about with “ Wow ” ?
She ’s been on the acting and modeling scene for almost two decades and she still looks awesome !
While looking great and being bubbly are definite talents of Pamela Anderson ’s , staying married is not .
She ’s been married three times , but the last two only lasted a few months .
The first marriage to Tommy Lee lasted three years and as a product , they have two children ..
Does she look like someone ’s mother to you ?
No way !
Kelly Hu ( 1968 -)
I think we will see Kelly Hu in films for years to come .
However , she only started her film career in 1995 when she was in “ No Way Back ” when she starred as an undercover police officer .
What you may not have known was that in 1985 , Kelly became the 1985 winner of the Miss USA pageant and in 1993 , she came in fourth place in the Miss USA pageant .
Yasmine Bleeth ( 1968 -)
Yasmine played some roles on a couple of soap operas and gained some exposure in the late 1980s and early 1990s , but her big break and great exposure cam in 1994 when she was in the hit TV series “ Baywatch ” .
Since then , she ’s still remained active on television and on the big screen .
Jeri Ryan ( 1968 -)
Though she starred in roles before her big break and in several after , Jeri Ryan will forever be most famous for her role as 7 of 9 on the science fiction series “ Star Trek : Voyager ” .
When she first appeared on the show , the ratings soared through the roof !
Who would ’ve thought that that would happened ?
Duh !
Look at her !
Jennifer Aniston ( 1969 -)
Jennifer Aniston appeared here and there , but we never really knew who she was until the popular sit-com “ Friends ” first aired .
After that Jennifer ’s career took off as a film and television actress .
Cameron Diaz ( 1972 -)
Cameron Diaz has played many roles in movies .
What I find that ’s so ironic is that one of the roles she ’s known best for is the voice of Princess Fiona in the “ Shrek ” movies .
We do n’t even get to see her in those movies !
Angelina Jolie ( 1975 -)
Angelina Jolie has gotten some prominent roles in Hollywood , but I think what boosted her career the most was getting involved with Brad Pitt .
Of course since he was married at the time , there was some controversy .
Drew Barrymore ( 1975 -)
We ’ve been enjoying Drew Barrymore since she was first on the big screen at the age of 5 .
She ’s really grown up since then and we ’ve noticed !
During her childhood , she was troubled for a while and entered rehab at the early age of 13 .
She turned herself around and her career – along with – other things – has blossomed .
Kate Hudson ( 1979 -)
Kate Hudson has been in films since 1998 where her first role was in “ Dessert Blue ” .
She continues to excel as an actress .
Did you know that her mother is Goldie Hawn ?
Goldie ’s cute and all , but Kate ’s gorgeous !
Jessica Simpson ( 1980 -)
In the summer of 2003 , Jessica Simpson gained a lot of publicity with her reality show that she shared with her then husband Nick Lachey .
The show was called “ Newlyweds : Nick and Jessica ” .
The show itself was really stupid , but everyone tuned in because the men wanted to look at Jessica and the women wanted to look at Nick .
Since then , she ’s been singing mainly , but she can make a living just on being hot .
Beyoncé Knowles ( 1981 -)
The talented singer Beyoncé started singing and dancing at a young age .
Eventually , she ended up with the group Destiny ’s child before going out on her own .
I ca n’t think of anyone who does n’t think she ’s smokin’ hot !
Jessica Alba ( 1981 -)
Jessica Alba started in movies and TV on the same year ( 1994 ) , but for the past few years has just been concentrating on her movie career .
Look for her new movie that will be coming out in 2010 , “ Sin City 2 ” .
In the meantime , just look at her .
She ’s flawless .
Jessica Biel ( 1982 -)
She sure has come a long way from playing Mary Camden on 7th Heaven from 1996 to 2006 .
Especially in the first couple years of the show , did you ever once picture that Jessica Biel would be this sexy ?
There ’s your list of the 30 sexiest women of all time : from Mae West to Jessical Biel and all of the hotties in between , it makes us proud to live in America !
During Jan / Feb AIG would call up and just ask for complete unwind prices from the credit desk in the relevant jurisdiction .
These were not single deal unwinds as are typically more price transparent - these were whole portfolio unwinds .
The size of these unwinds were enormous , the quotes I have heard were " we have never done as big or as profitable trades - ever " .
This is largely due to AIG - FP unwinds .
Allowing for significant reserve release and trade PnL , I think for the big correlation players this could have easily been US $ 1 - 2 bn per bank in this period .
far
these profits were a ) one - time in nature due to wholesale unwinds of AIG portfolios , b ) entirely at the expense of AIG , and thus taxpayers , c ) executed with Tim Geithner 's ( and thus the administration 's ) full knowledge and intent , d ) were basically a transfer of money from taxpayers to banks ( in yet another form ) using AIG as an intermediary .
This protocol would allow non-market close outs
The purpose of the Protocol is to permit parties to agree upfront that in the event of a counterparty default , they will use Close - Out Amount valuation methodology to value trades .
Close - Out Amount valuation , which was introduced in the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement , differs from the Market Quotation approach in that it allows participants more flexibility in valuation where market quotations may be difficult to obtain .
Industry participants observed the significant benefits of the Close - Out Amount approach following the default of Lehman Brothers .
In launching the Close - Out Amount Protocol , ISDA is facilitating amendment of existing 1992 ISDA Master Agreements by replacing Market Quotation and , if elected , Loss with the Close - Out Amount approach .
" This is yet another example of ISDA helping the industry to coalesce around more efficient and effective practices , while maintaining flexibility , " said Robert Pickel , Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer , ISDA .
" The Protocol permits parties to value trades in the way that is most appropriate , which greatly enhances smooth functioning of the market in testing circumstances . "
Zero Hedge is rarely speechless , but after receiving this email from a correlation desk trader , we simply had to hold a moment of silence for the phenomenal scam that continues unabated in the financial markets , and now has the full oversight and blessing of the U.S. government , which in turns keeps on duping U.S. taxpayers into believing everything is good .
I present the insider perspective of trader Lou ( who wishes to remain anonymous ) in its entirety : " AIG - FP accumulated thousands of trades over the years , all essentially consisted of selling default protection .
This was done via a number of structures with really only one criteria - rated at least AA - ( if it fit these criteria all OK - as far as I could tell credit assessment was completely outsourced to the rating agencies ) .
Main products they took on were always levered credit risk , credit - linked notes ( collateral and CDS both had to be at least AA - , no joint probability stuff ) and AAA or super senior portfolio swaps .
Portfolio swaps were either corporate synthetic CDO or asset backed , effectively sub - prime wraps ( as per news stories regarding GS and DB ) .
Credit linked notes are done through single - name CDS desks and a cash desk ( for the note collateral ) and the portfolio swaps are done through the correlation desk .
These trades were done is almost every jurisdiction - wherever AIG had an office they had IB salespeople covering them .
Correlation desks just back their risk out via the single names desks - the correlation desk manages the delta / gamma according to their correlation model .
So correlation desks carry model risk but very little market risk .
I was mostly involved in the corporate synthetic CDO side .
As these trades are unwound , the correlation desk needs to unwind the single name risk through the single name desks - effectively the AIG - FP unwinds caused massive single name protection buying .
This caused single name credit to massively underperform equities - run a chart from say last September to current of say S&P 500 and Itraxx - credit has underperformed massively .
I can only guess / extrapolate what sort of PnL this put into the major global banks ( both correlation and single names desks ) during this period .
For those to whom this is merely a lot of mumbo - jumbo , let me explain in layman 's terms :
AIG , knowing it would need to ask for much more capital from the Treasury imminently , decided to throw in the towel , and gifted major bank counter - parties with trades which were egregiously profitable to the banks , and even more egregiously money losing to the U.S. taxpayers , who had to dump more and more cash into AIG , without having the U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner disclose the real extent of this , for lack of a better word , fraudulent scam .
In simple terms think of it as an auto dealer , which knows that U.S. taxpayers will provide for an infinite amount of money to fund its ongoing sales of horrendous vehicles ( think Pontiac Azteks ) : the company decides to sell all the cars currently in contract , to lessors atbelow the amortized market value , thereby generating huge profits for these lessors , as these turn around and sell the cars at a major profit , funded exclusively by U.S. taxpayers ( readers should feel free to provide more gripping allegories ) .
What this all means is that the statements by major banks , i.e. JPM , Citi , and BofA , regarding abnormal profitability in January and February were true , however For banks to proclaim their profitability in January and February is about as close to criminal hypocrisy as is possible .
And again , the taxpayers fund this " one time profit " , which causes a market rally , thus allowing the banks to promptly turn around and start selling more expensive equity ( soon coming to a prospectus near you ) , also funded by taxpayers ' money flows into the market .
If the administration is truly aware of all these events ( and if Zero Hedge knows about it , it is safe to say Tim Geithner also got the memo ) , then the potential fallout would be staggering once this information makes the light of day .
And the conspiracy thickens .
Thanks to an intrepid reader who pointed this out , a month ago ISDA published an amended close out protocol , i.e. CDS trade crosses that were not alligned with market bid / offers .
Of course ISDA made it seem that it was doing a favor to industry participants , very likely dictating under the gun .
And , lo and behold , on the list of adhering parties , AIG takes front and center stage ( together with several other parties that probably deserve the microscope treatment ) .
So - in simple terms , ISDA , which is the only effective supervisor of the Over The Counter CDS market , is giving its blessing for trades to occur ( cross ) below where there is a realistic market bid , or higher than the offer .
In traditional equity markets this is a highly illegal practice .
ISDA is allowing retrospective arbitrary trades to have occurred at whatever price any two parties agree on , so long as the very vague necessary and sufficient condition of " market quotations may be difficult to obtain " is met .
As anyone who follows CDS trading knows , this can be extrapolated to virtually any specific single - name , index or structured product easily .
In essence ISDA gave its blessing for below the radar fund transfers of questionable legality .
The curious timing of this decision and the alleged abuse of CDS transaction marks by and among AIG and the big banks , is striking to say the least .
This wholesale manipulation of markets , investors and taxpayers has gone on long enough .
Pakistan government has released over a dozen jailed Taliban commanders to secure the release of a Chinese engineer who was kidnapped by the militants nearly six months ago .
Officials were tight - lipped about Long Xiaowei 's release though ' The News ' daily reported that the government swapped more than a dozen Taliban prisoners for the Chinese national .
" Yes , a number of militants were freed to secure the release of the Chinese engineer , " an official with knowledge of the deal told the newspaper .
He refused to give the exact number of prisoners who were released .
" Efforts were intensified to secure his release before the President 's ( Asif Ali Zardari ) upcoming visit to China .
It 's a gift to the people of China on the occasion of his visit and it is also expected that the President will take him ( Long ) along to China , " the official said .
Long reached the Chinese embassy in the federal capital on Sunday , a day after he was freed by the local Taliban in the troubled northwestern
Swat valley .
Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan initially claimed Long was freed as a " goodwill gesture " but later admitted the government had freed some prisoners in exchange for the Chinese national .
" Over the last one week , the government freed several Taliban prisoners but most of them were ordinary fighters .
Actually , a majority of the prisoners released hailed from Waziristan , " Muslim Khan said .
A source close to Pakistani Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah said 16 important militant commanders from Swat were released on Saturday by the authorities .
The Pakistan government was under immense pressure for securing the release of the Chinese engineer after the recent execution of Polish national Piotr Stanczak by Taliban militants in Darra Adam Khel region .
Poland cancelled a visit by a Pakistani parliamentary delegation after Stanczak was beheaded by the militants .
Besides , pressure has been mounted on Pakistan by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon for securing the release of John Solecki , an American employee of the UN refugee agency who was recently kidnapped in Quetta .

In a dramatic story that has been stoked by amateur YouTube videos , the aftermath of the fatal New Year ’s Day shooting of a young man by a BART police officer accelerated Wednesday night as hundreds of protesters rampaged through the streets of downtown Oakland , creating a near - riot that lasted for several hours .
Oakland police are bracing for more protests this morning after at least 105 people were arrested for a variety of offenses Wednesday night .
Police said charges for those arrested included assault on a police officer , looting , vandalism and arson .
Some of those detained were found to have drugs , which added another count to the charges .
Angry about the New Year ’s Day shooting of Oscar Grant III by a BART police officer , protesters smashed businesses and set fires in downtown Oakland , and confronted Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums on the steps of City Hall .
Today , Oakland police are hoping protests will be less violent , but plan to have extra officers on the streets and will be in riot gear .
A protest is expected outside BART headquarters , where the agency ’s board meeting will be held at 9 a.m .
Businesses downtown are cleaning up this morning , dealing with the aftermath of smashed windows and cars .
Leemu Tokpa had swept glass shards into two piles outside her shop , Creative African Braids , on 14th Street so that clients could get in the door .
She said a group of vandals smashed up her downtown Oakland shop and threw bottles at her while she was holding her 8 - month - old baby .
She was working on a client in her business when a group of black males came over and started swearing and smashing her windows .
She shouted at them , saying ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’
Tokpa said .
That ’s when one threw a bottle at her .
“ I had to run in the back to hide .
They were cussing , saying the f-word and trying to force the door open , ” Tokpa said .
“ It had nothing to do with ( the BART shooting ) .
“ Nobody feels happy about the guy getting killed , but if they come back to attack me as a black sister I feel very disappointed .
I ’m struggling here too .
And they come and wreck my business . ”
Her brother slept in the shop all night , to protect it from further vandalism she said .
Wednesday , family and friends attended a funeral for Grant , 22 , who was shot to death by former BART police officer Johannes Mehserle , The shooting was caught on cell phone and digital camera videos and replayed on national television .
Also Wednesday , BART announced that Mehserle had resigned .
Beginning around 5 p.m. , police responded to scattered disturbances as hundreds of protesters marched from the Fruitvale BART station to City Hall , overturning trash cans , setting cars and trash containers on fire and taunting police trying to control them .
At one point , protesters rammed a trash container against a police car , bashing in the front and back windows and denting the passenger side .
For several hours , scores of police officers from Oakland , BART and the Housing Authority skirmished with as many as 200 demonstrators who had broken away from the Fruitvale demonstration and who appeared to be doing most of the vandalism .
Officers used tear gas to disperse protesters who moved about downtown streets , breaking the windows of some businesses and setting multiple cars on fire and forcing police to shut down a number of streets .
At a 9:30 p.m. news conference , police said they had arrested 14 adults and one juvenile , with at least one person charged with assaulting a police officer .
Officials were bracing for another protest expected this morning when the BART board meets at its headquarters near Lake Merritt .
Earlier Wednesday , more than 1,000 people turned out at a Hayward church to remember Grant , the 22 - year - old father one worshipper called “ the apple of God ’s eyes . ”
Cell phone videos apparently show Grant lying in a passive pose , then being shot by an officer standing over him .
On the same day , as word spread that Mehserle had quit the force , about 50 protesters met with Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to demand that his office file charges against Mehserle .
BART officials announced Wednesday that Mehserle , 27 , had resigned .
Earlier in the week , the officer ’s attorney postponed a meeting that had been scheduled by BART investigators for Tuesday and sought to defer the meeting until next week , according to a news release from BART .
BART investigators declined the delay and scheduled Wednesday ’s meeting , during which Mehserle ’s attorney and union representative submitted his resignation letter .
The officer was not present , according to the release from BART .
BART officials had urged Mehserle to meet and cooperate with the transit agency ’s investigation into the fatal shooting , which has been playing out online in disturbing videos and eyewitness accounts of the melee that led to the incident .
Officers were called to the station after a report that a fight had broken out on a train .
“ This shooting is a tragic event in every respect for all involved , ” BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said .
“ We recognize that the family and friends of Oscar Grant are in mourning , and we extend our condolences . ”
At the funeral services at Palma Ceia Baptist Church , friends described the young father as a natural leader of other kids in the church ’s Royal Ambassadors program , and some thought he would someday become a pastor himself .
“ I met Oscar when he was young — 6 , 7 , 8 years old .
Oscar always knew so much for a young person , ” Deacon Eugene Carter said during the service .
“ It seemed like he knew as much as some adults . “…
He would ask adult questions . ”
Carter said that from a young age , Grant enjoyed fishing , baseball , chess , dominoes — “ whatever you knew how to do , Oscar already knew how to do it . ”
Church member Donna Smith said Grant “ always wanted to lead his family in prayer .
Oscar had the loudest voice when he sang in the Sunshine Choir . ”
The Rev. Ronald Coleman urged the crowd to “ show how believers handle times like this — the world is watching . ”
He urged church members to respond with prayer and prudence .
“ I can understand that youngsters are upset and angry , ” said Coleman , “ but you have to have trust in God . ”

Elizabeth Butler - Sloss - now retired - became a well - known female judge Some women are deterred from becoming judges by what they see as a culture of " male self - confidence and intellectual posturing " , says a report .
The review , by Prof Dame Hazel Genn of University College London , identified reasons for so few female barristers and solicitors becoming judges .
Last year 15 of the 164 most senior judges in England and Wales were women .
The report said the chief concern was that the male - dominated senior judiciary would be " hostile " to them .
" For some female barristers , the Bench is merely seen as an extension of a male - dominated and conservative Bar , with the same culture of male self - confidence and intellectual posturing but with no respite , and therefore an unattractive prospect as an alternative career , " said the report .
It 's a very jolly life NOT being a judge - getting loads of money , making jokes and doing really interesting work
Female QC
The review - commissioned by the Judicial Executive Board - concludes that these perceptions are likely to continue until there are sufficient women appointed to change the look of the environment .
Other factors which deterred applicants were the relatively low pay of judges compared with the rates earned by top barristers .
In addition , some judges are required to work on the " circuit " - presiding over hearings in towns and cities outside London .
One female QC said : " I 'm married and I like to have dinner with my husband and friends rather than talk to a load of High Court judges " .
Another said : " It 's a very jolly life NOT being a judge .
Getting loads of money , making jokes and doing really interesting work . "

Mike Whitney :
The financial crisis is quickly turning into a political crisis .
Already governments in Iceland and Latvia have collapsed and the global slump is just beginning to accelerate .
Riots and street violence have broken out in Greece , Latvia and Lithuania and worker - led protests have become commonplace throughout the European Union ( EU ) .
As unemployment skyrockets and economic activity stalls , countries are likely to experience greater social instability .
How does one take deep - seated discontent and rage and shape it into a political movement for structural change ?
John Bellamy Foster :
The first thing to recognise is that we are suddenly in a different historical period .
One of my favourite quotes comes from Gillo Pontecorvo ’s 1969 film Burn !
where the main character , William Walker ( played by Marlon Brando ) , states : “ Very often between one historical period and another , ten years suddenly might be enough to reveal the contradictions of an entire century . ”
We are living in such a period , not only because of the Great Financial Crisis and what the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is now calling a depression in the advanced capitalist economies , but also because of the global ecological crisis that during the last decade has accelerated out of control under business as usual , and due to the reappearance of “ naked imperialism ” .
What made sense ten years ago is nonsense now .
New dangers and new possibilities are opening up .
A whole different kind of struggle is emerging .
The sudden fall of the governments in Iceland and Latvia as a result of protests against financial theft is remarkable , as are the widespread revolts in Greece and throughout the EU , with millions in the streets .
The general strikes in Guadeloupe and Martinique ( the French Antilles ) , and the support given to these movements by the France 's New Anti-Capitalist Party is a breakthrough .
In fact much of the world is in ferment .
Latin Americans are engaged in a full - scale revolt against neoliberalism , led by Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution , and the aspiration of a new socialism for the 21st century ( as envisioned also in Bolivia , Ecuador and Cuba ) .
The Nepalese revolution has offered new hope in Asia .
Social struggles on a major scale are occurring in emerging economies such as Brazil , Mexico and India .
China itself is experiencing unrest .
The one place in the world where this world historical ferment appears to not be having telling effect at present is the United States .
This can be traced to two reasons .
First , the United States as the centre of a world empire is a fortress of conservatism .
Second , the election of the Barack Obama administration has confused progressive forces , leading to absurd notions that the Democratic Party under Obama is going to create a New New Deal without renewed pressure arising from a revolt from below .
Meanwhile , under Obama ’s watch , and with the help of his chosen advisers , vast amounts of state funds are being infused into the financial system to benefit private capital .
What is needed in the United States today , we argue in The Great Financial Crisis , is a renewal of the classic concept of political economy ( with its class perspective ) , whereby it comes to be understood that the economy is subject to public control , and should be wrested from the domination of the ruling class .
The bailing out of the system right now is going on with taxpayer funds but without the say of the public .
A revolt to gain popular control of the political economy is therefore necessary .
It is possible to start with the demand for a New New Deal rooted in the best legacy of the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s , most notably the Works Progress Administration .
But as Robert McChesney and I argued in “ A New New Deal Under Obama ? ” in the February 2009 issue of Monthly Review , the struggle has to move quickly beyond that to an expansion of workers ’ rights along socialist principles , breaking with the logic of capital .
For this to occur there has to be a great revolt from below on at least the scale of the industrial unionisation movement of the 1930s that created a new political force in the country ( later destroyed in the McCarthy era ) .
The story of this struggle is told in David Milton ’s classic account , The Politics of U.S. Labor , which also points out that the rising labour movement was led by socialists and radical syndicalists .
It is important , as István Mészáros explained in his Beyond Capital , that the radical politics opened up in this historical moment must not be diverted into attempting to save the existing system , but be directed at transcending it .
As Mészáros wrote : “ To succeed in its original aim , radical politics must transfer at the height of the crisis its aspirations — in the form of effective powers of decision making at all levels and all areas , including the economy — to the social body itself from which subsequent material and political demands would emanate . ”
In the United States a primary goal of any radical politics should be to cut military spending , which is the imperial iron heel holding down the entire world , while corrupting the US body politic and diverting surplus from pressing social needs .
The obvious weak link of the whole political , ideological and economic structure in command in the United States today is that the system has clearly failed to meet peoples ’ real needs .
Rather than addressing these pressing needs in the crisis , the emphasis of the economic overlords is to bailout private capital at virtually any cost .
Between October 2008 and January 2009 the federal government provided about US $ 160 billion in capital and infusions and debt guarantees to the Bank of America , which had a total net worth in late January of only a small fraction of that amount .
The rest had gone down the rat hole .
The robbing of public funds to bailout private capital is now on a scale probably never before seen .
A politicised , organised working class capable of understanding and reacting to that theft , and choosing thereby to restructure society , to meet real social , egalitarian needs is what is now to be hoped for .
The title of a recent cover story Newsweek declared : “ We Are All Socialists Now ” .
As it turned out , Newsweek ’s editors were simply referring to the increase in public spending now taking place — hardly an indication of socialism .
But the fact that this is said at all in the mainstream media points to the fact that we are in a different historical moment in which radical forces have the possibility of moving forward .
MW : As the economy has become more dependent on financialisation for growth , the gap between rich and poor has grown wider and wider .
As you point out in your book , “ In the United States the top 1 percent of wealth holders in 2001 owned more than twice as much as the bottom 80 percent of the population .
If this was simply measured in terms of financial wealth , the top 1 percent owned more than four times the bottom 80 percent ” ( p 130 ) .
How have working - class people managed to keep their heads above water with all this wealth being shifted to the rich ?
JBF : The answer is fairly obvious .
If people cannot maintain their standard of living on the basis of their income , they will borrow against income and against whatever wealth they have .
The result — if their incomes do n’t rise , or if the value of whatever assets they have do not increase — is that they will simply get deeper and deeper in debt in an attempt simply to stand still .
I became concerned about the growth of working - class household debt in 2000 and carried out a study of The Survey of Consumer Finances , which is published every three years by the federal government with a three - year lag in the data .
This is the only major federal government data source that we have on household debt broken down into income groups so that we can determine the debt burden of different classes .
I published an article based on this research in the May 2000 issue of Monthly Review entitled “ Working - Class Households and the Burden of Debt ” .
I then followed this up six years later with an article in the May 2006 Monthly Review on “ The Household Debt Bubble ” , which was to be incorporated into The Great Financial Crisis .
There I wrote that , “ The housing bubble and the strength of consumption in the economy are connected to what might be termed the ‘ household debt bubble ’ , which could easily burst as a result of rising interest rates and the stagnation or decline of housing prices . ”
This is of course what happened , and the reason why this crisis has turned out to be so severe was the destruction over decades of the finances of working - class households , on the back of which financialszation took place .
MW : Will you define “ debt - deflation ” and explain its potential danger to the economy ?
As credit continues to tighten and housing prices sink , are n’t we slipping into a reinforcing deflationary spiral ?
Do you think that fiscal policy will reverse this trend or is the stimulus package too small to stop real estate and equities from continuing to slide ?
JBF : The term “ debt - deflation ” is associated particularly with the work of Irving Fisher during the Great Depression .
Fisher wrote an article for the journal Econometrica in 1933 entitled “ The Debt - Deflation Theory of Great Depressions ” .
Deflation as applied to the general economy is a drop in the general price level , something not seen in the United States since the Great Depression , and catastrophic in the economy of monopoly capital ( and even more so under monopoly finance capital ) .
In the first place , deflation ( or disinflation , i.e. the reduction of inflation to what the US Federal Reserve calls “ below optimal ” levels ) means that the profit margins of corporations are squeezed , even if the cost structure of production and productivity remain the same .
Under these circumstances price competition is reactivated with giant firms actually in a life and death struggle .
This also generates pressure for heavy layoffs and wage reductions , creating all sorts of vicious cycles .
But the real fear of deflation has to do with the enormously bloated financial structure and the huge debt load of the economy .
Under inflation , which is usually assumed to be built into the advanced capitalist economy , debts are paid back with smaller dollars ( that is , worth less over time ) .
In a deflationary economy , however , debt has to be paid back with bigger dollars ( worth more over time ) .
This then creates a debt - deflation spiral , enormously accelerating financial meltdown .
As Fisher put it , “ deflation caused by the debt reacts on the debt .
Each dollar of debt still unpaid becomes a bigger dollar , and if the over - indebtedness with which we started was great enough , the liquidation of debt cannot keep up with the fall of prices which it causes ” .
Stated differently , quoting from The Great Financial Crisis ( p. 116 ) , “ prices fall as debtors sell assets to pay their debts , and as prices fall the remaining debts must be repaid in dollars more valuable than the ones borrowed , causing more defaults , leading to yet lower prices , and thus a deflationary spiral ” .
In order to check this deflationary tendency , the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury have been trying to reflate the economy by printing money ( euphemistically called “ quantitative easing ” ) .
But they have not succeeded and deflationary forces are still very strong , causing President Obama to warn shortly after his election that “ we now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further ” .
It is also worth mentioning the effect that deflation has on investment .
With capital faced with the fact that a few years down the line the price level could be lower than it is now , expected profits on investment in new productive capacity ( given that this takes years to be built and has to paid for in current prices ) are depressed , creating a deeper stagnation of accumulation .
The stimulus package introduced by the Obama administration is far too small to pump up demand and reflate the economy under these circumstances .
It is less than $ 400 billion a year , 40 per cent of which is tax cuts , so that the increased governmental spending is minuscule compared to the size of the hole created by the drastic drop in consumption , investment , and state and local government spending .
It is also dwarfed by the total federal government support programs , primarily to financial institutions , which now amount to more than $ 9.7 trillion in the form of cash infusions , debt guarantees , swaps of Treasuries for financial toxic waste , etc .
MW : Karl Marx seems to have anticipated the financial meltdown we are now facing .
In Capital , he said , “ The superficiality of political economy shows itself in the fact that it views the expansion and contraction of credit as the cause of the periodic alterations of the industrial cycle , while it is a mere symptom of them ” .
Marx appears to agree with your theory that the real problem is deeper — economic stagnation which forces surplus capital to look for more profitable investments .
While the monetarist theories of Milton Friedman are now under withering attack , Keynes and Marx seem to have held up rather well .
What does Marx mean when he talks about “ political economy ” ?
JBF : Marx was an acute analyst of financial crises in his time and described their main features .
However , he saw financial expansions as occurring at the peak of a boom , not as a secular phenomenon .
Financialisation in the sense of a long - term shift in the centre of gravity of the economy toward finance , with financial speculation building over decades , is a completely unprecedented situation .
Marx and Engels did place great emphasis on the growth of joint - stock companies / corporations and the appearance of a market for industrial securities that began to appear near the end of the 19th century .
It was this creation of the modern market for industrial securities that was the real beginning of the emergence of finance as a relatively independent aspect of the monopoly capitalist economy .
There are essentially two pricing structures to the economy : one in the real economy related to the production of goods and services , the other in the financial realm associated with the pricing of assets ( paper claims to wealth ) .
The two are interrelated but can be disassociated from each other for periods of time .
Keynes in the 1930s singled - out the dangers of an economy that was increasingly governed by the speculative pricing of financial assets .
Marx was such an acute observer of capitalism , that even in his time he began to see the contradictions emerging between money ( or fictitious ) capital and real capital .
One thing that Marx did argue in this context is that surges in financial speculation were responses to stagnation and decline in the real economy , as capital desperately sought a way to maintain and expand its surplus .
Thus he wrote that the “ plethora of money capital ” in such periods was due to “ difficulties in employment , through a lack of spheres of investment , i.e. , due to a surplus in the branches of production ” and showed nothing so much as the immanent barriers to capitalist expansion ( quoted in The Great Financial Crisis , p. 39 ) .
Marx remains the strongest foundation for the critique of the capitalist economy , down to our day .
But the real Keynes ( not to be confused with the bastardised Keynesianism of today ) is also important , since he emphasised what he called the “ outstanding faults ” of the capitalist economy : the tendency to high inequality and high unemployment .
He also pointed to the dangers of a system geared to speculative finance .
MW : Is wage stagnation and income inequality a direct result of financialisation ?
JBF : I would put it the other way around .
Wage stagnation and growing income and wealth inequality are components of the underlying stagnation tendency .
Both have shown a tendency to worsen over time , resulting in deepening stagnation tendencies within the overall economy .
Real wages in the United States peaked in 1971 , when Richard Nixon was president , and by 2008 had fallen back to 1967 levels , when Lyndon Johnson was president .
This is in despite of the enormous growth of productivity and expansion of wealth over the intervening decades .
Hence , this is a marker of “ the tendency of surplus to rise ” , as Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy put it , or a rising rate of surplus value , in Marx ’s own terms .
This was accompanied by a massive growth of income and wealth at the top .
As we stated in The Great Financial Crisis ( p. 130 ) , “ From 1990 to 2002 , for each added dollar made by those in the bottom 90 percent [ of income ] those in the uppermost 0.01 percent ( today about 14,000 households ) made an additional $ 18,000 ” .
By 2007 income / wealth inequality in the United States had reached 1929 proportions , i.e. , the level reached just prior to the 1929 Stock Market Crash that led to the Great Depression .
I do think you are right , though , that financialisation made income and wealth inequality worse and contributed to the stagnation of wages .
We can see neoliberalism as basically the ideology of monopoly - finance capital , introduced originally as the ruling class response to stagnation , and then increasingly geared to promoting the financialisation of capital , itself a structural response to stagnation .
Neoliberalism promoted incessant breaking of unions , forcing down wages , cutting state social welfare spending , deregulation , free mobility of capital , development of new financial architecture , etc .
One way to understand this is the enormous need for new cash infusions to feed a financial superstructure that was voracious in its demand for new money capital , which it needed to leverage still more piling up of debt and financial speculation .
Insurance companies , real estate and mutual funds all provided infusions into this financial superstructure , as did the state .
All limits were removed .
Under these circumstances workers were encouraged to use their houses like piggy banks to finance consumption , credit cards were handed out to teenagers , subprime loans were pushed on those with little ability to pay .
Individual retirement packages were shifted toward individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) that were tied into the speculative financial system .
This had all the signs of an addictive system .
In these circumstances too , the real economy , particularly production of goods and manufacturing , was decimated .
In the introduction to The Great Financial Crisis we include a chart covering the period since 1960 showing production of goods as a percentage of GDP in a slow , long - term decline , while debt as a percentage of GDP is skyrocketing over the same period .
All of this meant a massive redistribution away from working people to capital , and to those at the pinnacle of the financial pyramid .
MW : In your book The Great Financial Crisis , you are critical of Paulson ’s capital injections into the banks saying that “ at most they buy the necessary time in which the vast mass of questionable loans can be liquidated in an orderly fashion , restoring solvency but at a far lower rate of economic activity — that of a serious recession or depression . ”
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CNBC that , “ We will preserve the system that is owned and managed by the private sector . ”
This suggests that the treasury secretary might not liquidate the toxic assets at all , but try maintain the appearance that these underwater banks are solvent .
What do you think will happen if Geithner refuses to nationalise the banks ?
JBF : I would not interpret Geithner ’s statement that way .
Rather we are experiencing one of the greatest robberies in history .
I have written on the question of nationalisation for the “ Notes from the Editors ” forthcoming in the March 2009 Monthly Review .
All the attempts to rescue the financial system at this time go in the direction of nationalisation .
The federal government is providing more and more of the capital and assuming financial responsibility for the banks .
However , they are doing everything they can to keep the banks in private hands , resulting in a kind of de facto nationalisation with de jure private control .
Whether the federal government is forced eventually toward full nationalisation ( that is , assuming direct control of the banks ) is a big question .
But even that is unlikely to change the nature of what is going on , which is a classic case of the socialisation of losses of financial institutions while leaving untouched the massive gains still in the hands of those who most profited from the whole extreme period of financial speculation .
To get an idea of what is happening one has to understand that the federal government , as I have already indicated , has committed itself thus far in this crisis $ 9.7 trillion in support programs primarily for financial institutions .
The Federal Reserve ( together with the US Treasury ) now has converted itself into what is called a “ bad bank ” .
It has been swapping treasury certificates for toxic financial waste , such as collateralised debt obligations .
As a result the Federal Reserve has become the banker of last resort for toxic waste with the share of treasuries in the Fed ’s balance sheet dropping from about 90 per cent to about 20 per cent over the course of the crisis , with much of the rest now made up of financial toxic waste .
Obviously , full , straightforward nationalisation would be more rational than this .
But one has also to remember the system of power — both economic and political — that we are dealing with at present .
The classic case of full bank nationalisation was Italian corporatist capitalism of the 1920s and 1930s , and was carried out by the fascist regime .
Without suggesting that we are headed this way now it should be clear from this that nationalisation of banks itself is no panacea .
The fact that Geithner , Obama ’s pick for Treasury Secretary , is overseeing the enormous robbery taking place , probably exceeding any theft in history , with the ordinary taxpayers picking up the tab , should certainly cause one to ask questions about the “ progressive ” nature of the new administration .
MW : Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan has dismissed criticism of his monetary policies saying that no one could have seen the humongous credit bubble developing in housing .
In your book , however , you make this observation : “ It was the reality of economic stagnation beginning in the 1970s ... that led to the emergence of the ‘ new financialized capitalist regime ’s kind of ‘ paradoxical financial Keynesianism ’ whereby demand in the economy was stimulated primarily ‘ thanks to asset bubbles . ’ ” ( p 129 ) The statement suggests that the Fed knew exactly what it was doing when it slashed rates and created a speculative frenzy .
Debt - fueled asset bubbles are a way of shifting wealth from one class to another while avoiding the stagnation of the underlying economy .
Can this problem be fixed through regulation and better oversight or is it something that is intrinsic to capitalism itself ?
JBF : Greenspan is of course trying desperately to salvage his reputation and to remove any sense that he is culpable .
I would agree that the Fed knew what it was doing up to a point , and deliberately promoted an asset bubble in housing — what Stephanie Pomboy called “ The Great Bubble Transfer ” following the bursting of the new economy tech bubble in 2000 .
The view that no one saw the dangers of course is false .
It reminds me of Paul Krugman ’s face - saving claim in his The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 that while some people thought that financial and economic problems of the 1930s might repeat themselves , these were not “ sensible people ” .
According to Krugman , “ sensible people ” like himself ( that is , those who expressed the consensus of those in power ) knew that these things could never happen — but turned out to be wrong .
It is true , as Greenspan says , no one could have foreseen precisely what really happened .
And certainly there were a lot of blinders at the top .
But there were lots of warnings and concerns .
For example , I drafted an article ( “ The Great Fear ” ) for the April 2005 issue of Monthly Review that referred to “ rising interest rates ( threatening a bursting of the housing bubble supporting US consumption ) ” as one of the key “ perils of a stagnating economy ” .
Other close observers of the economy were saying the same thing .
The Federal Reserve Board , indeed , was internally debating in these years whether to adopt a policy of pricking the asset bubbles before they got further out of control .
But Greenspan and his successor Ben Bernanke were both against such a dangerous operation , claiming that this could bring the whole rickety financial structure down .
Since they did n’t know what to do about asset bubbles they simply sat on their hands and tried to talk the market up .
The dominant view was that the Federal Reserve could stop a financial avalanche by putting a rock in the right place the moment there was a sign of trouble .
So Bernanke went ahead , closed his eyes and prayed , raising interest rates to restrict inflation ( an action demanded by the financial elite ) and the rest is history .
At all times it was those at the commanding heights of the financial institutions that called the shots , and the Federla Reserve followed their wishes .
Greenspan himself is no dummy .
He wrote in Challenge Magazine in March - April 1988 of the dangers associated with housing bubbles .
But as a Federal Reserve Board chair he pursued financialisation to the hilt , since there was no other option for the system .
Needless to say , such financialisation was associated with the growing disparities in wealth and income in the country .
Debt itself is an instrument of power and those at the bottom were chained by it , while those at the top were using it to leverage rising fortunes .
The total net worth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans ( an increasing percentage of whom were based in finance ) rose from $ 91.8 billion in 1982 to $ 1.2 trillion in 2006 , while most people in the society were finding it harder and harder to make ends meet .
None of this was an accident .
It was all intrinsic to monopoly - finance capital .

Research teams at Microsoft are currently working on a new and improved browser that has the potential to be far more secure than the existing options .
In the wake of financial problems , layoffs , and legal nightmares , Gazelle -- Microsoft 's new browser - operating system hybrid -- could help the software company recover from its landslide in market shares .
The Gazelle prototype , first unveiled in 2008 under the title " MashupOS " at the Microsoft TechFest Research Fair , incorporates the best of both browser and operating system characteristics in order to provide enhanced security features .
Gazelle 's Design
Technical reports from Microsoft indicate that Gazelle will be constructed as a multi-principal operating system , meaning that it will be able to interface with more than one web principal at a time : just like an operating system with multiple programs running .
( Source : zdnet.com )
Gazelle is loosely based on Internet Explorer , but with a few modifications .
Using about five thousand lines of C code programming language , Gazelle is based upon a " browser kernel " -- a small cluster of code that allows the browser to mimic the functionality of an operating system by basing its performance on " layers " of interaction between components .
By developing Gazelle in this way the Microsoft teams hope to eliminate potential threats that could occur via access to the computer 's main system .
( Source : techworld.com )
Gazelle 's Increased Security
Due to the ability to work with multiple principals , Gazelle will be able to separate elements of a web page , a feature that increases security by enabling the browser to process each element on a case - by - case basis .
Gazelle will be able to prevent " race - condition " attacks in which websites try to encourage users to accidentally click on malicious script in the website .
Gazelle will prevent this by restricting the ability to click on the page for approximately one second ( the length of time necessary for the user to view an overlay screen and verify that they are clicking on an appropriate link ) .
Gazelle will also have unique features for handling plug-ins , which are typically a source of vulnerability .
Microsoft researchers , like many Firefox users , are not content with the current security parameters of Internet Explorer 8 .
Users may browse sites that have untrustworthy content , and traditional browsers like IE8 are unable to cope with threats posed from iframes , ads , and other unverified materials .
( Source : techworld.com )
Since the Gazelle project is still in its infancy , there are a few glitches to work out .
Because of the multi-principal architecture , Gazelle is performing highly complex operations which intrinsically slow it down .
However , with some adjustments and further development , researchers are confident that it will be as elegant and fast as its namesake .

CHICAGO  As Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois continued to defy calls for his resignation on Friday , signing a bill into law and meeting at home with several ministers , the state attorney general , Lisa Madigan , made an emergency request to the State Supreme Court to remove him from power .
Ms. Madigan argued in court papers that “ the pervasive nature and severity ” of a federal corruption case against Mr. Blagojevich had rendered him “ incapable of legitimately exercising his ability as governor . ”
A spokesman for the Supreme Court declined to comment on the request .
Made up of seven elected justices , the court is known to be a cautious body that is not keen on injecting itself into political matters .
The court has discretion over whether to take up the case .
Mr. Blagojevich , a two - term Democrat , and his chief of staff , John Harris , were arrested on Tuesday on charges of conspiracy and soliciting bribes in a sprawling criminal case that involves , among other things , accusations that the two conspired to sell the Senate seat vacated by President - elect Barack Obama .

BURBANK , Calif .
WHEN Zack Snyder became the director of the film adaptation of “ Watchmen , ” the graphic novel about troubled superheroes in a declining age , he knew that he was taking on not only a seminal piece of popular culture but more than 20 years of unfulfilled expectations and competing agendas .
From his encounters with the original comics , written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons , he was well versed in the creators ’ weighty , grown - up ideas about the futility of heroism and knew that they had no enthusiasm for seeing “ Watchmen ” turned into a movie .
He was also aware that many directors before him had been unsuccessful at the same endeavor , and he expected that he would have to fight his studio to make the film he wanted .
( He did not anticipate , however , that one year before its release , a rival studio would sue to prevent his movie from reaching theaters . )
But Mr. Snyder said he believed that his greatest challenge would be satisfying the desires of the book ’s devoted fans , who , like him , regard it as an exemplary work of postmodern storytelling and who would eviscerate him if he strayed too far from the original comics .
And he believed that the only path to satisfying these viewers began by breaking from the source material .
“ Watchmen , ” which opens on March 6 , begins with a scene depicted only in fragments in the comics : a lengthy fight between an unknown assailant and an over - the - hill avenger called the Comedian .
This is followed by an unhurried opening credit sequence , largely of Mr. Snyder ’s invention , that juxtaposes Bob Dylan ’s “ The Times They Are A - Changin ’ ” with a montage of masked do - gooders with names like Dollar Bill and Hooded Justice as they participate in key moments of atomic - age history , like V - J Day and the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
The scenes that follow will be familiar to readers with a panel - by - panel familiarity with the comic : the surreal dream of a costumed vigilante who is plagued by sexual shortcomings and fears of nuclear war ; a man - god created in a scientific accident , strolling the red sands of Mars ; the city of New York partly annihilated by a villain ’s master plan  all connected by a story about heroes who are corrupted by the darkness they cannot expunge from the world .

News websites can be intriguing to examine from a design perspective .
Regardless of what type of news they cover , they all face the challenge of displaying a huge amount of content on the home page , which creates plenty of layout , usability and navigational challenges for the designer .
The lessons that can be learned from examining how news websites address these challenges can be valuable for designers who work with other types of websites , including ones with blog theme designs .

Monetization is also a major factor for news websites , and it ’s interesting to see how they integrate advertisements in the design .
In some cases , the ads are somewhat intrusive or excessive , but most news websites are able to use ads without turning readers away , in part because of the content that ’s available .
For the purposes of this article , the term “ newspaper website ” refers to any news - related website that has the editorial focus of an online periodical .
Many of the websites mentioned here are the online versions of major newspapers , but others are standard news websites and some blur the line between news website and blog .

Award - Winning Newspaper Designs
This post is supposed to provide you with some examples of outstanding newspaper designs which have been rewarded with prestigious awards ( see references at the bottom of this post ) , and demonstrate unusual approaches of newspaper design .
Common Trends of Newspaper Websites 2008
1. Color Schemes
Most news websites use dark text on a white background .
Obviously , these websites contain a huge volume of content , and readability is important .
A few of the websites mentioned later in this article use darker colors for headers or for the body of the page outside the content .
A large percentage of news websites also use blue and red in addition to a dark gray or black for text .
Blue is extremely common for headlines , article titles and links .
Red is often used sparingly as an accent color .
Some news websites also mix in more colors in other places , such as in the navigation .
The L.A. Times website demonstrates a common color scheme :
2. Header and Sidebar Banners
Of course , all of these websites need to produce revenue , and banner ads in headers are a key source of income .
Some websites use banner ads on all pages , and others exclude banners on the home page but display them above the header on other pages .
While blogs commonly use 125 by 125 pixel banners in sidebars , news websites commonly use 300 by 250 banners or tall skyscrapers .
Many of the websites mix in some AdSense or other text link ads .
The Telegraph uses a 730 by 90 pixel banner over its header .
3. Top Navigation
Although there are a few notable exceptions to this trend , most news websites put their primary navigation menu just below the header and above the content .
The New York Times and MSNBC are two of the exceptions , as they both use the left sidebar for the main navigation .
The Times Online uses a two - level navigation menu .
4. Tabbed Content Areas
Many news websites use tabbed content areas that allow visitors to see popular articles , recent articles , most commented articles , etc .
This is sometimes used in the sidebar , and other times in the main content area , such as on Wired .
This allows for more control by users over what content and links they see , and it can save space in the design by making more content accessible in a specific area .
5. Grid-Based Layouts
Newspaper websites are commonly built with grid - based designs .
The grid is a popular choice not only because of the sharp look it creates but because it ’s one of the most effective ways to manage and organize a large amount of content .
The New York Times has one of the more well - known grid - based layouts .
Notable Differences Between News Websites and Blogs
The line between a news website and a blog is a fine one , and the two types are difficult to distinguish sometimes .
For the purpose of this article , “ blog ” refers more to a traditional blog than to a commercialized news blog by a team of writers .
While there are certainly similarities between blogs and news websites , there are also some key differences .
Social Media Integration
Seeing widgets or voting buttons on blogs is extremely common ; in fact , most blogs use them in one form or another .
Most news websites , however , use them more subtly , if at all .
It ’s common to see a “ Share ” section on articles , such as the one shown below from ABC News , but voting buttons are not used in quite the same way as on blogs , where a standard “ Digg This ” button may appear at the top of every post .
A growing number of news websites recognize the impact of social media , but they are still using such tools subtly in their designs .
A few websites shown in more detail below do make more use of social media than others .
The Huffington Post has a section specifically to display stories that are new on Digg , and the website certainly makes plenty of front page appearances .
RSS Feeds
Subscriptions and RSS feeds are a huge part of blogging , and most blogs use large icons or FeedBurner counts to make it easy for visitors to subscribe .
Most news websites , however , do n’t push RSS feeds on readers like a blog would .
Most news websites do offer feeds , often according to category of content , but they ’re not a major part of the design or layout .
In fact , most visitors probably do n’t even notice the small icons or links to feeds .
As RSS feeds become a part of the daily lives of average readers , this will probably change .
The Guardian promotes a link to its feed in the website ’s header , but with much less attention drawn to it than most blog themes .
Reader comments and discussion are a critical element for most blogs , but they ’re not as important to news websites .
Many news websites allow readers to leave comments , but they ’re usually an afterthought in the design and are rarely promoted the same way as they would be on a blog .
For example , many blogs show excerpts of posts on the front page , and almost all will also show a comment count with the excerpt that links to the comment section .
This is used on a few news websites , but it ’s rare .
ABC News is one of the rare news websites that shows a comment count by the post excerpt on the home page .
A Look at 20 Leading Newspaper Websites
The Onion Satirical news website The Onion features a grid - based design ( it ’s been called the funniest grid you ever saw ) that makes excellent use of the screen space that ’s available .
There is a lot going on on the website , which can be both good and bad .
The main navigation separates the content into video , radio , sports , election , etc .
The header includes an ad on each side , and the sidebar has some advertising as well , but nothing too intrusive .
Some parts of the home page are used essentially as advertisements for features that are part of The Onion , such as The Onion Personals and The Onion Store .
New York Times
The website of the New York Times is another well - known grid .
The majority of the website ’s navigation is down the left side of the page , which is not as common as top navigation .
The website does use a tabbed navigation bar at the top with links to such features as “ Today ’s paper , ” “ Video , ” and “ Most popular , ” but all of the content category links , such as World , U.S. , Politics , Business , etc. , are down the side .
The website ’s design includes a nice use of blue and black headers and links , with a touch of red added in a few places , such as the time of an article ’s publication .
Overall , the New York Times presents one of the better newspaper websites .
Chicago Tribune Unlike many of the other websites featured here , the Chicago Tribune uses only one small banner in the header of its home page , although individual article pages use a 730 by 90 banner .
Aside from the header , the rest of the home page is fairly ad - heavy , including text link ads .
The content on the Chicago Tribune website is spaced out a bit more than , for example , the New York Times ’ .
Again , blue is used for headers and links , with a touch of red .
Washington Post The Washington
Post also uses the common colors of blue , black ( or dark gray ) and red on a white background .
The header includes a small 290 by 45 banner , and the top of the sidebar includes a 300 by 250 banner .
The rest of the home page contains only a few other small banner ads .
The layout of content on the home page is focused on providing categorized links to specific content .
An image is included for the lead story , but other headlines above the fold do not have thumbnails .
At the top right , there is a section for the most - viewed articles .
Los Angeles Times The L.A . Times website takes a different approach with its header than some other news websites .
There is relatively little going on there , with plenty of unused space that could be filled with ads , something that most other news sites are doing .
The rest of the home page uses only two 300 by 250 banners and a few text link ads .
Individual article pages use a 730 by 90 banner above the header .
The content of the L.A . Times home page is contained in a grid - based layout , with primary navigation on the left .
Again , blue , black and red are the colors of choice for text , links and headlines .
Tennessean
The Tennessean is n’t one of the largest newspapers in the U.S. , but its website is worth noting .
The Tennessean breaks some of the norms of the other websites that have been examined so far , primarily in terms of color .
A dark orange is used for headlines and links , instead of a more common choice , such as blue .
Additionally , a green background color is used on the sidebar .
There is a 300 by 250 banner in the sidebar and a skyscraper in the left sidebar , with more ads at the very bottom of the page .
Individual article pages include a 730 by 90 banner above the header .
Houston Chronicle
The Houston Chronicle packs a large number of headlines onto the home page , including in the top center of the layout .
This means there are more links to content above the fold , but each of them stands out less than it would on a news website that uses more thumbnails .
The website has no ads in the header of the home page , but has a few banners in the right sidebar and some text link ads at the bottom of the page .
Article pages have a 730 by 90 banner above the header .
USA Today
The USA Today uses more color than many other news websites , particularly in the navigation menu and with links throughout the website .
Category links for feature articles , such as sports , markets , education and people , all use different colors , which help them stand out .
Unlike most news websites , the USA Today shows the number of comments on articles right by the headlines on the home page .
Only a few smaller banners are located on the home page , aside from a 730 by 90 banner at the very bottom of the page .
Individual article pages are much more ad - filled , and at times while navigating through the website you may encounter a full - page ad that you have to skip to get to the content .
Mail Online British news website Mail Online uses a more colorful design than many other news websites .
The headlines and links are a lighter blue than those on the New York Times or Chicago Tribune websites , and they turn red on hover .
The right sidebar includes tons of thumbnails from recent posts and colorful headers and roll - overs .
The website includes AdSense ads in the header and various ads throughout the rest of the layout , including some in the middle column .
The grid layout keeps the content organized and makes use of virtually the whole page , which is incredibly long .
Telegraph Another leading UK news website , the Telegraph , uses a nice , clean grid - based layout .
Above the header is a 730 by 90 banner , and the only other advertising on the home page is a 300 by 250 banner and a skyscraper , both in the right sidebar .
The home page design makes extensive use of thumbnails to go along with article headlines and brief descriptions .
Blue and red are used for headlines and links .
The main navigation is located at the top of the page .
Guardian
The Guardian uses a clean but colorful design .
The main navigation at the top of the page consists of various colored links to different sections of news .
The home page uses little advertising , but individual article pages include a 730 by 90 banner above the header of the page , and 300 by 250 ad at the top of the sidebar .
Headers on the Guardian website are a common blue , but colorful borders are used to add some visual appeal .
Thumbnails are used in several spots on the home page , but most stories have only a headline and brief description or just a headline .
Times Online
The Times Online is one of the few news websites to use a bright color in its logo / branding area , but it does accomplish the goal of distinguishing the website .
Above the header is a 730 by 90 banner .
The home page uses a two - level navigation menu above the content and a fairly typical blue color for headlines .
Several article excerpts on the home page include thumbnails , but there are no large images for featured articles as there are on many news websites .
MSNBC MSNBC stands out among other news websites due to its dark yet colorful header , a look that ’s been imitated by many Photoshop users .
The header includes no advertisements , and in fact there is only one ad visible above the fold .
Text link ads are used in a few places throughout the home page .
Individual article pages do include a 730 by 90 banner above the header at the very top of the page .
Overall MSNBC is a very well - designed website , with an attractive color scheme and a layout that ’s well - structured but not overly cluttered .
Like the New York Times , MSNBC uses the left sidebar for its primary navigation .
ABC News ABC
News features a dark header that helps distinguish the website from other news leaders .
There is relatively little advertising on the home page .
The right sidebar contains a 300 by 250 banner and the only other ads are at the very bottom of the page .
At the top right of the page there are three current videos , plus a link to more video content .
While other news websites include video , most do n’t place videos as high on the page as ABC News does .
Ars Technica
Tech news website Ars Technica has a vastly different design than mainstream general news websites , which should be expected .
Unlike the image - heavy general news websites , Ars Technica does not use thumbnails on its home page .
Additionally , the article pages have very few images in comparison to general news websites .
The website uses tabbed navigation at the top of the page to take visitors to different categories of news , such as Business , IT , Apple , Hardware , etc .
The header includes a 730 by 90 banner , and the top of the right sidebar includes a 300 by 250 banner ad .
Further down the sidebar is a skyscraper banner .
CNET News
Tech news website CNET
News uses a fairly basic design with a dark header , a featured content area , and a long list of headlines with brief excerpts .
Blue and red are used for headlines and links .
The header includes a small text link ad on the right side of the screen and a few 300 by 250 ads in the sidebar .
No additional ads are used on individual articles .
TechRadar UK technology news website TechRadar includes a few items that currently are n’t very common on other news websites .
Just above the content of the page , there is a “ TechRadar Update ” section that scrolls through links to the most recent content .
Additionally , there is a featured content area that rotates through the six leading stories .
Below the featured content area is a grid of the latest news headlines with brief excerpts .
The website header includes a 730 x 90 banner , and the sidebar contains some other banners and text link ads .
The navigation on TechRadar is a bit different as it uses tabs for news , reviews , blogs , and forums .
Wired
The design for Wired is rather unique .
Most notably , thumbnails , headlines and excerpts of featured content reside above the main navigation menu .
Thumbnails are used below for the most recent article in each of seven different categories .
The header includes no banners , just an internal advertisement for WiredBiz .
The sidebar contains a few ads as well as additional monetization through a job board widget that links to recent job postings on the website ’s job board .
The Huffington Post The layout and design of individual pages on The Huffington Post is quite different than that of the home page .
On individual pages you see a small logo / branding area at the top left , with a very long banner on the right that takes up most of the width of the page .
Advertisements throughout the rest of the page are fairly minimal .
On the home page , most of the area above the fold is used for a headline and image from a featured article .
The rest of the home page includes a lot of images and headlines , as well as post excerpts from a variety of writers in the left sidebar .
Sporting News The Sporting News has one of the most outdated designs .
The header is used primarily for displaying scores , but with less space efficiency than other major sports websites .
Above the header is a 730 by 90 banner .
Much of the real estate of the sidebar is used for directing visitors to other sections of the website , such as Sporting News Radio , the Blog Network and community blogs .

Award - Winning Newspaper Designs
This post is supposed to provide you with some examples of outstanding newspaper designs which have been rewarded with prestigious awards ( see references at the bottom of this post ) , and demonstrate unusual approaches of newspaper design .
New vulnerabilities were discovered yesterday in multiple programs using OpenSSL , one of the standard cryptography libraries on Linux and Unix systems .
Due to a common mistake in checking return values from functions checking digital signatures , several programs may be vulnerable to spoofing of digital signatures .
The most important affected program is ISC Bind , which is the most widely used DNS server on the internet .
A flaw in its validation of signatures on DNSSEC replies means that the server may be vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks even where DNSSEC is in use .
Bind have released BIND 9.6.0 - P1 this morning to fix this bug .
The common mistake is in the checking of return values from functions in OpenSSL that check digital signatures .
Programmers have failed to allow for all the possible return values of the EVP_VerifyFinal function , and as a result some cases where the signature has not been successfully checked can be mistakenly treated as successfully verified .
OpenSSL 's developers also made the same mistake in their own code .
OpenSSL 0.9.8 j was released yesterday to fix a number of bugs within the OpenSSL library where signatures could be accepted incorrectly .
According to the OpenSSL advisory , these bugs affect the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL / TLS .
Clients using unpatched versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable to man - in - the - middle attacks when connecting to SSL / HTTPS servers with DSA certificates .
Fortunately , DSA certificates on websites are very rare — we find only 31 third - party - validated DSA certificates in the Netcraft SSL survey .
It is likely that other programs using OpenSSL have made the same mistake .
The advisory identifies a number of other affected programs , including NTP , lasso and Sun Grid Engine — in each case , new versions are or will soon be available fixing the bug .

A commercial Iridium communications satellite collided with a Russian satellite or satellite fragment , on Tuesday , creating a cloud of wreckage in low - Earth orbit , according to CBS News .
A source quoted in the article said U.S. Space Command is tracking about 280 pieces of debris , most of it from a non-operational Russian satellite .
It appears the International Space Station is not currently threatened by the debris , but it ’s not yet clear whether the debris poses a risk to any other satellites in similar orbits .
Iridium operates a constellation of approximately 66 satellites , along with orbital spares , to support satellite telephone operations around the world .
Neither NASA or Iridium Satellite LLC has officially released any information about the collision , and a spokesman for U.S. Space Command was not aware of the incident .
But one NASA manager who asked not to be named , seemed to confirm the collision and said , “ Everybody is saying the risk ( of further collisions ) is minimal to NASA assets . ”
UPDATE : The Spaceflightnow.com article has been updated with quotes from a statement by Iridium and U.S. Strategic Command , that confirm the collision took place .
In an article on Spaceflightnow.com , Nicholas Johnson , NASA ’s chief scientist for orbital debris at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , confirmed the collision .
“ They collided at an altitude of 790 kilometers ( 491 miles ) over northern Siberia Tuesday about noon Washington time , ” said “ The U.S. space surveillance network detected a large number of debris from both objects . ”
The Iridium spacecraft are in orbits tilted 86.4 degrees to the equator at an altitude of about 485 miles while the ISS orbits Earth at an altitude of about 215 miles in an orbit tilted 51.6 degrees to the equator .
Other civilian science satellites operate in polar orbits similar to Iridium ’s and presumably could face an increased risk as a result of the collision .
Johnson said the collision is unprecedented .
“ Nothing to this extent ( has happened before ) , ” he said .
“ We ’ve had three other accidental collisions between what we call catalog objects , but they were all much smaller than this and always a moderate sized objects and a very small object .
And these are two relatively big objects .
So this is a first , unfortunately . ”

The news this morning would be amusing if it were n’t so sad .
The Obama administration is undergoing a battle between its own good instincts with those of its Treasury Secretary .
Away from Treasury , on the side of intelligence , new policies , a clean break from the Paulson / Bush plans — I believe during the campaign , it was called CHANGE — and inevitability , are prepackaged bankruptcies , clean balance sheets , and a fresh start .
This is reflected in the Fed exploration of $ 40 billion in bankruptcy funding for GM .
On the side of more of the same , bad decision making , regulatory capture , worshiping sacred cows , and a hard - to - understand goal of saving the banks rather than the financial system , is the utterly absurd proposal to somehow spend 10X the market cap of Citigroup for a 40 % stake in the apparently insolvent firm .
This is an accounting maneuver , a convertible preferred that greatly dilutes the common shares , and adds no new capital .
Put on paper , it allows the leverage to look less egregious .
One can imagine an incredulous junior Treasury staffer — one who has n’t been captured by the big banks , and is capable of basic arithmetic — saying the following :
“ Explain this to me again : We put in many times the value of this company — we have already given them $ 45 billion dollars , and guaranteed almost $ 300 billion dollars worth of bad paper — and we get less than 50 % ?
WTF ?
How the hell does THAT work ? “
Its apparent that this sleight of hand does n’t work to just about everyone except Tim Geithner ( and a few others ) .
At the same time , an industry that had nothing to do with the current crisis is on the fast track to a healthy pre-packaged bankruptcy .
Moral Hazard aside , the different approaches reflect the relative importance of different sectors .
Banks must be saved at all costs , but GM and Chrysler must go the bankruptcy route .
The only explanation in treating the two industries so radically differently is an overt hostility to Unions on the part of many .
My views are that they ALL need to go to a prepackaged bankruptcy — banks , autos , etc .
Here ’s some excerpts :
The NYT :
Citigroup approached the regulators with a plan that would allow them to convert a large amount of the government ’s $ 45 billion of preferred shares , which is treated as debt , into common stock , this person said .
The government owns a stake of roughly 8 percent , but that could grow to as much as 40 percent .
Converting the preferred shares while also issuing more common shares would bring Citigroup closer to the mix of equity that the government is likely to demand when it introduces the stress test .
But that would severely dilute the value of shares held by existing Citigroup stockholders
WSJ :
Outside advisers to the U.S. Treasury have started lining up the largest bankruptcy loan ever , talking with banks and other lenders about at least $ 40 billion in financing for General Motors Corp . and Chrysler LLC , in case the two auto makers need it , said several people familiar with the matter .
While acknowledging the grimness of the task , administration officials involved in the auto talks said they are trying to find a way to restructure the two companies without resorting to bankruptcy proceedings .
They stressed the latest efforts were “ due diligence ” on the part of the government advisers , and that bankruptcy financing may not be necessary .
Still , people involved in talks with senior Obama administration officials said that the administration believes that the option of Chapter 11 filings by the two auto makers needs to be seriously considered .

Gov. Sarah Palin is being sued in federal court , but the case is n’t about her expensive wardrobe , or any decision that she has made as governor .
Palin is being sued for violating the law by failing to issue the 2007 Juneteenth Proclamation .
While the lawsuit is frivolous , it does raise questions about Palin ’s views on race , and how they may clash with RNC chairman Michael Steele ’s plans to expand the GOP base .
For those of you who do n’t know , which included me before I looked it up , Juneteenth , which I know as Freedom Day , is an official holiday in 29 states , that marks the freeing of the last remaining slaves on June 19 , 1865 .
It became an official holiday in Alaska in 2001 .
The civil rights lawsuit was brought by Jazz musician Gregory Charles Royal who said , “ The focus of this action is to hold Governor Palin accountable and to uphold the integrity of our emancipation holiday .
Can you imagine the dangerous precedent of public officials deciding which legal holidays they choose to observe when carrying out their ministerial duties ? ”
Palin ’s office called this a clerical error , and part of the relief that Royal is seeking is for Palin to apologize and retroactively issue the proclamation .
Royal is also seeking $ 75,000 for losses to individuals and organizations because the holiday did not occur .
Royal also might be looking for payback , because he claims that Palin made a racially disparaging remark about him while he was touring Alaska in 1990 with the Duke Ellington Orchestra .

What I find most troubling is that Palin became the first governor to completely snub the celebration in 2008 .
Palin was the first governor not to participate .
In fact , she did n’t even send anyone to represent her at the celebration .
I believe that this is the exact attitude that Michael Steele is trying to change in the GOP .
Republicans are never going to win over minority voters if their two tactics are to either infuriate them as they have done with Hispanic voters , or ignore them as they have done with African American voters .
Palin and Steele could be heading for a conflict when it comes to reaching out to minority voters , but Palin ’s attitude is the dominant one in the GOP .
Most Republicans are n’t that concerned about reaching out to minority voters .
They still believe that their ideology sells itself .
As far as this lawsuit is concerned , I suspect that Palin will issue an apology , and a retroactive proclamation .
Royal is not going to get the money , but if this thing gathers any serious attention , Palin may have to put in an appearance at this year ’s celebration .

Big bleg : Let ’s help Obama crowdsource - out the pork
The stimulus plan President - Elect Barack Obama has recently described would help jump - start the economy at the same time it renews our country ’s vital infrastructure .
And the president - elect is serious about making smart investments .
Here he is on Meet the Press last Sunday ( emphasis mine ) :
Well , I think we can get a lot of work done fast .
When I met with the governors , all of them have projects that are shovel ready , that are going to require us to get the money out the door , but they ’ve already lined up the projects and they can make them work .
And now , we ’re going to have to prioritize it and do it not in the old traditional politics first wave .
What we need to do is examine what are the projects where we ’re going to get the most bang for the buck , how are we going to make sure taxpayers are protected .
You know , the days of just pork coming out of Congress as a strategy , those days are over .
Well , it ’s not just the governors that have “ shovel - ready ” projects lined up for federal funding , the nation ’s mayors also have plenty of projects at the ready .
You can see what these projects are at the U.S. Conference of Mayors site where they have published a “ MainStreet Economic Recovery Report ” along with a database of the projects , their cost , how many jobs they are expected to create , all sorted by state .
As Reason ’s Robert Poole points out in the Wall Street Journal , however , not all of the 11,391 ready - to - go projects would qualify as smart investments :
What vital infrastructure projects would cash - strapped taxpayers get for their $ 73 billion ?
Here ’s a sampling : – Hercules , Calif. , wants $ 2.5 million in hard - earned taxpayer money for a “ Waterfront Duck Pond Park , ” and another $ 200,000 for a dog park .
– Euless , Texas , wants $ 15 million for the Midway Park Family Life Center , which , you ’ll be glad to note , includes both a senior center and aquatic facility .
– Natchez , Miss. , “ needs ” a new $ 9.5 million sports complex “ which would allow our city to host major regional and national sports tournaments . ” – Henderson , Nev. , is asking for $ 20 million to help “ develop a 60 acre multi-use sports field complex . ” – Brigham City , Utah , wants $ 15 million for a sports park .
– Arlington , Texas , needs $ 4 million to expand its tennis center .
– Miami , Fla. , needs $ 15 million for a “ Moore Park Community Center , Tennis Center and Day Care ” facility .
The city is also desperate for $ 3.6 million to build a covered basketball court and a new tennis court at Robert King High Park .
Then there ’s the $ 94 million Orange Bowl parking garage you are being asked to pay for .
– La Porte , Texas , wants $ 7.6 million for a “ Life Style Center . ”
And Oakland , Calif. , needs $ 1 million for Fruitvale Latino Cultural and Performing Arts Center .
And you thought infrastructure investment meant roads , bridges and schools .
It is clear that any infrastructure stimulus money given to the country ’s mayors will lead to thousands of tennis centers to nowhere .
Here is my bleg : Let ’s help President - Elect Obama do what he is promising .
Let ’s help him “ prioritize ” so the projects so that we “ get the most bang for the buck ” and identify those that are old school “ pork coming out of Congress ” .
We can do this through good clean fun crowdsourcing .
Who can help me take the database on the Conference of Mayors site and turn each project into a wiki - page or other mechanism where local citizens can comment on whether the project is actually needed or whether it ’s a boondoggle ?
How can we create an app that will let citizens separate the wheat from the pork and then sort for Congress and the new administration the project in descending order or relevancy ?
I have some technical chops , but in many ways I would n’t know where to start .
Any takers ?
If there are , my colleagues and I would love to dive into this and we can probably scrounge up some resources .
Who ’s with us ?
Story here Excerpt :
' EDMONTON --
In a bizarre case before the courts , an Edmonton man has been forbidden from going to his own home while his girlfriend - whom he has told to get out - is still living there .
Todd Shandro , 36 , went before a judge yesterday to try to resolve the situation , but he was told there were jurisdictional issues and he has to take the matter to civil court .
" It 's very sick what is happening here , " said a frustrated Shandro .
" I am the sole owner of the house .
The mortgage and title are in my name and she is essentially a squatter . '
North Korea 's missile move comes amid tense ties with Seoul North Korea has announced that it is preparing to launch a rocket carrying a communications satellite .
It did not give a date for the launch , but said it would mark a great step forward for the communist state .
Correspondents say the statement is Pyongyang 's clearest reference yet to what neighbours believe may be the imminent test of a long - range missile .
When it tested the Taepodong - 1 missile in 1998 , it claimed to have put a satellite in orbit .
In July 2006 it test - fired the three - stage long - range Taepodong - 2 , but the missile failed shortly after launch .
North Korea 's move comes amid heightened tensions with South Korea , and with Pyongyang pushing for a top spot on the agenda of the new US administration .
Alaska reach
The announcement came in a statement from the national space agency , carried by the official Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) .
North Korea 's missile programme " Full - scale preparations are under way to launch a rocket Unha - 2 to put communication satellite Kwangmyongsong - 2 into orbit , " it said .
" When this satellite is successfully launched , our space technology will make a great step forward toward becoming an economically strong country . "
The launch is planned from a base in Hwadae in the northeast of the country , the statement said .
Satellite images showed activity at the site , but there was no missile on the launch pad , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported , citing an intelligence official .
The base in Hwadae , called Musudan - ri , was where North Korea test - fired its long - range Taepodong - 2 in 2006 .
There are fears that the missile , with a theoretical range of 6,700 km ( 4,200 miles ) , could be used to target the US state of Alaska .
But when the missile was last tested , it failed within a minute and fell into the sea .
' Threatening act ' North Korea 's move comes with talks on an aid - for - disarmament deal - involving the US , China , Russia , Japan and South Korea - currently stalled .
Relations between the two Koreas are also tense following South President Lee Myung - bak 's decision to link the provision of bilateral aid to progress on denuclearisation .
Pyongyang has recently scrapped several peace agreements with Seoul .
The mooted launch also follows speculation about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il , who is believed to have suffered a stroke in mid-2008 .
On a trip to Asia last week , the new US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned North Korea against any rash moves , saying a test - launch would be " unhelpful " .
South Korean Defence Minister Lee Sang - hee urged North Korea to provide evidence to support its claim of a satellite , rather than missile , launch .
" Whether it is a missile or a satellite , it is similar technology .
In either case , we believe it is a threatening act towards us and we are preparing to deal with it accordingly , " he added .
Japan said it was currently assessing the situation and China said it had taken note of the matter , while calling for stability in the region .
North Korea tested a nuclear weapon in October 2006 .
But experts say it does not yet have the technology to make a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a missile .

REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - Apple will take third - quarter delivery of newly developed 10 - inch touchscreens from Taiwan , a source said on Wednesday , amid talk the U.S. firm is developing a touchscreen PC .
Taiwan touchscreen specialist Wintek already makes small screens for Apple iPhones , and has received orders for the larger ones that are roughly the same size as those used in mini PCs , said the source close to the Taiwan firm .
He asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
He added that he did not know what the final product would be , or who would make it .
Wintek spokesman James Chen confirmed Apple was a major client of his company , but declined to comment on any new product development .
Taiwan media reported this week that Apple , which has brought touchscreens to the forefront with the success of its iPhones , is currently developing a touchscreen PC , as lines begin to blur between sophisticated smartphones and traditional PCs .
Some of those reports have said that Taiwan ’s Quanta Computer , the world ’s top contract laptop PC maker , would manufacture the actual PCs for Apple .
Apple ’s Hong Kong spokeswoman , Jill Tan , said the company did not comment on market speculation , while a Quanta spokeswoman also declined to comment .
Stephen Fry - wit , writer , raconteur , actor and quiz show host - is also a self - confessed dweeb and meistergeek .
As he confesses " If I added up all the hours I 've sat watching a progress bar fill up , I could live another life . "
His feed on the social networking site Twitter is one of the most popular in the world .
He spoke to BBC Radio 4 's Analysis about why he believes the web is such a wondrous thing .
ON TWITTER
At the time of going to press I 've got 103,000 Twitter followers , which means I 'm getting new " Tweets " all the time .
And some of them are very amusing and some of them are rather silly but most of them are entirely charming .
Of course if people are very nice to you you 're probably thinking I do this in order to have my ego massaged .
But people are also very frank and brusque with me , so I hope it 's not entirely that .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
By the time this goes to air , it may be Twitter will be yesterday 's thing , but it happens to be hot at the moment because things reach a tipping point , and Twitter has reached its critical mass .
Enough people are now on it to talk about it so that people go " What is this Twitter ? "
I 'm not someone with press offices and all that kind of thing , but those like me in the public eye who have , have discovered it 's a magnificent way of cutting out the press .
If people want to announce their new this or their new that , they 're going " I 'm not going to do an interview , I 'm not going to sit in the Dorchester for seven days having one interviewer after another come to me , I 'm just going to Tweet it , and point them to my website and forget the press " .
And the press are already struggling enough - God knows they 've already lost their grip on news to some extent .
If they lose their grip on comment and gossip and being a free PR machine as well , they 're really in trouble .
So naturally they 're simultaneously obsessed because they use it ( as it fills up their column inches ) but they 're also very against it .
So you 'll get an increasing number of commentators going " Are n't you just fed up with Twitter ?
Oh , if Stephen Fry tells me what he 's having for breakfast one more time , I think I 'll vomit . "
They really will have a big go at it because it attacks them , it cuts them out .
WHY THE WEB NEEDS A RED LIGHT DISTRICT
This is an early thing I said about the internet at the time things like AOL were still huge .
I said it 's Milton Keynes , that 's the problem with it .
It 's got all these nice , safe cycle paths and child - friendly parks and all the rest of it .
But the internet is a city and , like any great city , it has monumental libraries and theatres and museums and places in which you can learn and pick up information and there are facilities for you that are astounding - specialised museums , not just general ones .
As important as the more traditional cultural institutions ?
But there are also slums and there are red light districts and there are really sleazy areas where you would n't want your children wandering alone .
And you say , " But how do I know which shops are selling good gear in the city and how do I know which are bad ?
How do I know which streets are safe and how do I know which are n't ? "
Well you find out .
What you do n't need is a huge authority or a series of identity cards and police escorts to take you round the city because you can't be trusted to do it yourself or for your children to do it .
And I think people must understand that about the internet - it is a new city , it 's a virtual city and there will be parts of it of course that they dislike , but you do n't pull down London because it 's got a red light district .
HOW TO BE A WEB SNOB
There are very basic elements of class snobbery that apply in the web as they do everywhere else .
For some of us a MySpace page is just pretty low rent .
It 's a pink , sparkly thing that 's very charming for a 14 - year - old girl , but a serious adult with a MySpace page has a problem .
And Facebook is becoming a bit low rent too .

You know that awful thing they say : " What 's so good about Sainsburys ?
It keeps the scum out of Waitrose " .
It 's that awful British snobbery .
In the same way , if someone 's email address is hotmail or AOL , you kind of think " Hmmn , I see , they 're not a real player , are they ? "
I mean please do n't be offended if you 're thinking " How dare you - it's a perfectly respectable address " , of course it 's a respectable address .
It 's ridiculous and , like all class things , absurd , but the web has it .
IN PRAISE OF TXTING ABBRVTNS
You look at a letter written by a 17th or 18th century letter writer , and you 'll see far more abbreviation .
Lord Byron would appreciate the poetic potential of text messages
There 's barely a word that is n't compressed because paper was expensive and ink was expensive , and to get your letter franked cost a lot of money - a Member of Parliament or member of the aristocracy were the only people who could do it .
And so letters were , as they say , crossed .
You 'd look at them writing horizontally and then there 'd be vertical lines all the way down and round the margins .
And ' your ' is ' YR ' , you know just as it is in a text .
It 's exactly the same point - you 're compressing .
And the same quality .
Read Byron 's letters .
Never was a mind more perfectly expressed and yet in this fantastically compressed form .
WHY EMAIL LIBERATES THE VOICE
Suddenly there 's wit , charm , self - deprecation , self - knowledge , understanding - all kinds of qualities .
It 's a literary form in the most basic sense that you 're writing and it 's rather wonderful .
The phone will be seen , I think , as a terrible aberration .
As I talk to you now , and as one talks , especially to strangers , all the terrible problems of class , differences in education , race and gender all have their part to play in the embarrassment of real life conversation , but the moment one 's let loose with a keyboard or a pen you can express yourself properly .
WHY BOOKS AND THE WEB GO TOGETHER
Very often people oddly put books against the internet .
Man 's first communication with man , as far as we know , is obviously through the spoken voice and literature was first an oral thing - poetry sprang from groups of men and women around the fire telling each other stories , telling each other fables and myths and explaining the world in different ways and reporting their hunting incidents .
Books should not be seen as threatened by the rise of the computer
It took a very long time for a technology to arise , making impressions on wax tablets and staining papyrus and so on , and then illuminating manuscripts ; and eventually , thanks to Gutenberg of course , movable type and print was disseminated at great speed .
But it was a technology .
And it seems to me that books are a marvellous and absolutely new way in the human race - I mean they 're only five hundred years old , if that - of telling stories .
And we love them .
I love them .
You do n't throw away your books when you buy a computer .
You keep both .
The beauty of living in the present day is you do n't abandon the past .
The past co-exists .
A RIPOSTE TO WEB - WORRIERS
I doubt you can find any sentence describing how human learning has degraded now that is n't congruent to a similar sentence written at the time of rise of the novel - about how people were no longer reading sermons and classical literature , but were reading novels from subscription libraries instead .
The literature at the time in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , describing the contempt that the learned establishment had for the rise of the novel - and then of course later with the rise of the penny dreadfuls and sensational literature as more and more people came to read it - again there was a great cry of despair at how there would be nothing but illiteracy in the world , or at least a kind of refusal or inability to engage in proper , serious study .
And we hear the cry again .
COMPUTERS AND SPELLING
If you spend all day playing snooker , as you fall asleep you 've got snooker balls clicking in front of your eyes .
Er , where 's the spell checker on this thing ?
And if you 're in front of a computer screen all day , then the images and icons that you 're manipulating are somehow ever present in your mind .
And so you get rather comic moments where if you see a misspelled word in a book when you 're reading a book , you wonder why it has n't got a wavy underline from the spellchecker .
And if you 're writing by hand , you sometimes expect the same thing .
You think oh ' accommodate ' - how many Cs and how many Ms and how many Os ?
Heck , nothing 's helping me .
WHY THE INTERNET TURNS US ALL INTO KINGS
Let's look at the most powerful kings there have ever been ever , the great autocrats or even dictators .
In any sense that counts except the power of life over death , I have more power than Louis XVI .
I have more power for knowledge and understanding at my fingertips , and at yours .
And I do n't even have to be sat at a computer .
I can just carry a device around with me .
He had to summon scholars and ask grave questions .
It 's true of the physical world .
I can go into a shed that contains the bounty of provender and spices of all five continents laid out in front of me , which would have taken him months to get .
So we are immensely empowered .
WHERE THE WEB CAN TAKE YOU
What is wonderful is the idea that you can do a really interesting introduction .
You can have trusted friends .
Imagine if someone like Alan Bennett , for example , who is a prodigious gallery - goer and a great writer occasionally , only tantalisingly occasionally on art - imagine if on your website you just said to these people could you just come in and talk about your favourite painting .
What could you learn from this man ?
It would take them five minutes and you 'd just have a little camera on them - and then similarly talk about a book .
I think you could just have ways of introducing people and taking the fear and discomfort and embarrassment out of art , if that was what you wanted to do , whether it 's literary art or any other kind of art - dance , opera , whatever you wanted to do .
There are opportunities and ways of doing it on the internet that are so much more closed to you even in broadcasting , to be perfectly honest .
The beauty of it is if you had it on the fryuniversity .com , it would be there forever and people would be able to say , " There 's Alan Bennett talking about Whistler 's Mother " or whatever .

American designer Shepard Fairey 's Obama Poster has been awarded the Brit Insurance Design of the Year award at the Design Museum in London .
The Blog Vote was awarded to Magno Wooden Radio , manufactured by locals in Java , Indonesia , and designed by Singgih S. Kartono .
The winners were announced at the Design Museum yesterday , where an exhibition of all the shortlisted designs is on show until 14 June .
Here 's some more information from the Design Museum :
--
Brit Insurance Design Award 2009 Announced
Obama Poster , Shepard Fairey
Iconic poster receives official recognition through prestige of international design award
Shepard Fairey ’s Obama poster has triumphed in a shortlist of 90 other designs to become Brit Insurance Design of the Year 2009 .
Chosen as the most innovative and forward thinking design from the past 12 months , Alan Yentob announced the winning design at a gala awards dinner hosted by Naomi Cleaver at the Design Museum .
The design was chosen from the seven category winners by a panel of judges including Alan Yentob , Paola Antonelli , Karen Blincoe , Peter Cook , Sarah Mower and Yves Béhar .
The panel commented , “ If ever there were to be a ‘ The Poster of the Year ’ , the Obama Poster would be it .
The US election was a watershed in contemporary history and this poster demonstrates the power of communicating ideas and aspirations from grass - root level .
Just as the presidential candidate 's campaign speeches recaptured the lost art of oratory , so this poster breathed new life into a form that had lost its purpose .
Fairey 's poster came not from a marketing campaign , but as a self initiated fund raising campaign .
The poster did its job by becoming a collector 's item .
More than that it ’s encapsulated the mood of its time . ”
The Obama poster was nominated by design expert Patrick Burgoyne for the Graphics category .
As a reputable US street artist famed for his propaganda style artwork and fly postering , Fairey created limited edition works to sell and raise awareness for Obama ’s 2008 Presidential Campaign .
The poster has become a lasting testament of the success of the Obama campaign , as well as an iconic symbol of history .
Patrick Burgoyne said , “ It seems sure to be one of the defining images of the US Presidential campaign [ as well as ] an example of how designers can get involved in political campaigns in a meaningful way – sales of his poster have raised over $ 400,000 . ”
Deyan Sudjic , Director of the Design Museum said : “ The Obama poster is a reminder of how extensively the design world impacts our everyday life .
The poster has become an international emblem of recent history ; I am delighted that it has won this year ’s Brit Insurance Design Award and received rightful recognition . ”
The Blog Vote , which was introduced this year to encourage public participation , generated a different conclusion as to who should win this year .
With 7,312 people voting , the dominant winner was the Magno Wooden Radio in the Product category .
The Obama poster , along with the rest of the shortlist , is currently on show at the Design Museum until 14 June .

That glass window is doing what it does best — keeping the inclement weather out while still permitting light to pass through .
Comstock / Thinkstock
Ever watch a house being built ?
Carpenters first erect the basic skeleton of the structure using two - by - four studs .
Then they nail sheathing , usually plywood , to the studs to make walls .
Most walls include a window opening , which holds a sheet of glass situated within a frame .
Windows make a home feel bright , warm and welcoming because they let light enter .
But why should a glass window be any more transparent than the wood that surrounds it ?
After all , both materials are solid , and both keep out rain , snow and wind .
Yet wood is opaque and blocks light completely , while glass is transparent and lets sunshine stream through unimpeded .
You may have heard some people — even some science textbooks — try to explain this by saying that wood is a true solid and that glass is a highly viscous liquid .
They then go on to argue that the atoms in glass are spread farther apart and that these gaps let light squeeze through .
They may even point to the windows of centuries - old houses , which often look wavy and unevenly thick , as evidence that the windows have " flowed " over the years like the slow crawl of molasses on a cold day .

In reality , glass is n't a liquid at all .
It 's a special kind of solid known as an amorphous solid .
This is a state of matter in which the atoms and molecules are locked into place , but instead of forming neat , orderly crystals , they arrange themselves randomly .
As a result , glasses are mechanically rigid like solids , yet have the disordered arrangement of molecules like liquids .
Amorphous solids form when a solid substance is melted at high temperatures and then cooled rapidly — a process known as quenching .
In many ways , glasses are like ceramics and have all of their properties : durability , strength and brittleness , high electrical and thermal resistance , and lack of chemical reactivity .
Oxide glass , like the commercial glass you find in sheet and plate glass , containers and light bulbs , has another important property :
It 's transparent to a range of wavelengths known as visible light .
To understand why , we must take a closer look at the atomic structure of glass and understand what happens when photons — the smallest particles of light — interact with that structure .
We 'll do that next .
An American teenager sent almost 500 text messages a day last month , leaving her father with a phone bill of 440 pages .
Reina Hardesty , 13 , sent 14,528 text messages in December - about 470 text messages a day , at an average of a message every two minutes if she was awake for 15 hours each day , the New York Post said .
Her father , Greg , said he was shocked to receive a 440 page phone bill last month .
Nearly one - third of US birds are endangered , threatened or in significant decline , according to a government conservation report .
It says the findings are " a warning signal of the failing health of our ecosystems " and reports that birds in Hawaii , the most bird - rich state , are " in crisis " .
The authors say that energy production deriving from wind , ethanol and mountain - top coal mining is contributing to steep drops in bird populations .
The State of the Birds report chronicles a four - decade decline in many of the country 's bird populations and provides many reasons for it , from suburban sprawl to the spread of exotic species to global warming .
In the last 40 years , populations of birds living on prairies , deserts and at sea have declined between 30 - 40 % .
But in almost every case , energy production has also played a role .
Environmentalists and scientists say the report should encourage the Obama administration to act cautiously as it seeks to expand renewable energy production and the electricity grid on public lands , and tries to harness wind energy along the nation 's coastlines .
" We need to go into these energies with our environmental eyes open , " said John Fitzpatrick , the director of the Cornell laboratory of ornithology , which helped draft the report along with non-profit advocacy groups .
" We need to attend to any form of energy development , not just oil and gas . "
Many of the bird groups with the most rapid declines in the last 40 years inhabit areas with the greatest potential for energy development .
Among the energy - bird conflicts cited by the report :
• More than half of the monitored bird species that live on prairies have experienced population losses .
These birds , such as the lesser prairie chicken , are threatened by farmers converting grasslands into corn fields to meet demand for biofuels
• In the Arctic , where two - thirds of all shorebirds are species of concern , melting ice brought about by climate change could open up more areas to oil and gas production .
Studies show that trash near drilling rigs attracts gulls that prey on other species
• Mountain - top coal mining in Appalachia clears patches of forest contributing to the decline of birds like the Cerulean warbler that breeds and lives in treetops
• Hawaii is home to one third of all US listed bird species .
Seventy - one species have gone extinct on the islands since humans colonised them in 300AD and the report states that at least 10 more species may have gone extinct in recent times .
" Proven conservation measures are urgently needed to avert this global tragedy , including increasing investment in protecting remaining forests , eliminating exotic predators and captive breeding , " the report says
The report , released by the interior secretary Ken Salazar on Tuesday , was requested in October 2007 by the then president , George W Bush .
The report did not indicate which form of energy production was the most detrimental .

( CNN ) -- Bank of America CEO and Chairman Kenneth Lewis has been issued a subpoena by the New York State Attorney General 's Office , which is investigating whether the bank violated state law by withholding information from investors , a source familiar with the investigation told CNN .
Kenneth Lewis is the CEO and chairman of Bank of America , the nation 's largest bank .
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been highly critical of Wall Street firms in general and Merrill Lynch in particular for the way they have conducted themselves in the midst of a financial crisis .
Last week , he accused Merrill Lynch , which was acquired by Bank of America late last year , of secretly doling out big bonuses before reporting a huge quarterly loss .
" Merrill Lynch 's decision to secretly and prematurely award approximately $ 3.6 billion in bonuses , and Bank of America 's apparent complicity in it , raise serious and disturbing questions , " Cuomo wrote in a letter to Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services .
In his letter to Frank , Cuomo said Merrill gave bonuses of at least $ 1 million each to 696 employees , with a combined $ 121 million going to the top four recipients .
The next four recipients were awarded a total of $ 62 million , and the next six received $ 66 million , he said .
In all , the bonuses for 2008 totaled $ 3.6 billion .
" While more than 39,000 Merrill employees received bonuses from the pool , the vast majority of these funds were disproportionately distributed to a small number of individuals , " Cuomo wrote .
" Indeed , Merrill chose to make millionaires out of a select group of 700 employees . "
The attorney general said Merrill " awarded an even smaller group of top executives what can only be described as gigantic bonuses . "
Do n't Miss Stimulus package puts tough limits on executive pay
Cuomo also claimed Merrill handed out the bonuses ahead of its federally funded acquisition by Bank of America , which was announced in mid-September and closed by year 's end .
It " appears that , instead of disclosing their bonus plans in a transparent way as requested by my office , Merrill Lynch secretly moved up the planned date to allocate bonuses and then richly rewarded their failed executives , " Cuomo wrote .
Bank of America has received $ 45 billion in federal bailout money , including $ 20 billion to support its takeover of Merrill .
Bank of America reported a net loss of $ 1.79 billion for the fourth quarter .
Merrill reported a net loss of $ 15.31 billion for the fourth quarter .
Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri that Merrill was " an independent company " when the bonuses were awarded .
" Bank of America did urge the bonuses be reduced , including those at the high end , " Silvestri wrote .
" Although we had a right of consultation , it was their ultimate decision to make . "
Silvestri said the top executives for Bank of America " took no incentive compensation for 2008 , " with an 80 percent reduction for the " next level " of executives .
Top executives from Bank of America -- as well as Bank of New York Mellon , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , State Street and Wells Fargo -- appeared before the Financial Services Committee last week to explain how they spent the $ 165 billion they received from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
In the testimony , Lewis said he received no bonus for 2008 and was paid a salary of $ 1.5 million .
Bank of America 's stock , which traded higher than $ 40 a share in the past year , closed at a fresh 52 - week low of $ 3.93 a share Thursday .
It 's the largest bank in terms of assets in the United States and is headquartered in Charlotte , North Carolina .

( CNN ) --
The Catholic bishop of South Bend , Indiana , will not attend graduation ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame because he disagrees with the stem - cell research and abortion views of the commencement speaker -- President Obama .
The University of Notre Dame says its invitation does n't mean the university agrees with all of Obama 's positions .
Bishop John D'Arcy , whose diocese includes Fort Wayne , Indiana , as well as the university town , said Tuesday in a written statement that " after much prayer " he has decided not to attend the ceremony .
" President Obama has recently reaffirmed , and has now placed in public policy , his long - stated unwillingness to hold human life as sacred , " D'Arcy said .
" While claiming to separate politics from science , he has in fact separated science from ethics and has brought the American government , for the first time in history , into supporting direct destruction of innocent human life . "
Earlier this month , Obama reversed a federal ban on embryonic stem - cell research .
Many scientists say the research could lead to advances in treating conditions like Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease , while some abortion opponents believe destroying embryos in the research amounts to ending a human life .
Watch Obama called " premier promoter of baby - killing " »
In January , Obama lifted a Bush administration restriction on funding for organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas .
D'Arcy 's announcement comes as anti-abortion groups have launched campaigns attempting to persuade the Catholic university to rescind Obama 's invitation .
In a letter to Notre Dame , Anthony J. Lauinger , National Right to Life Committee vice president , called Obama " the abortion president " and said his invitation " is a betrayal of the university 's mission and an affront to all who believe in the sanctity and dignity of human life . "
The conservative Cardinal Newman Society has launched a Web site -- notredamescandal.com -- that , according to the site , has drawn 50,000 signatures to a petition opposing Obama 's appearance at the May 17 ceremony , at which Obama also is to receive an honorary degree .
A White House statement released Tuesday said Obama is honored to be speaking at the university and welcomes the exchange of ideas on the hot - button topics .
" While he is honored to have the support of millions of people of all faiths , including Catholics with their rich tradition of recognizing the dignity of people , he does not govern with the expectation that everyone sees eye to eye with him on every position , " the White House said .
" [ T ] he spirit of debate and healthy disagreement on important issues is part of what he loves about this country . "
Obama will become the ninth sitting president to give the commencement speech at Notre Dame .
Most recently , presidents Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have spoken there .
In a written statement on Tuesday , Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins noted that the university has been host to Democratic and Republican presidents and said the invitation does not mean the university agrees with all of Obama 's positions .
" We will honor Mr. Obama as an inspiring leader who faces many challenges -- the economy , two wars , and health care , immigration and education reform -- and is addressing them with intelligence , courage and honesty , " he said .
" It is of special significance that we will hear from our first African - American president , a person who has spoken eloquently and movingly about race in this nation .
" Racial prejudice has been a deep wound in America , and Mr. Obama has been a healer . "
On abortion and stem - cell research , Jenkins said he views the invitation as " a basis for further positive engagement . "

There is a tradeoff between economic growth and consumption
Economic growth is made possible by forgoing current consumption .
For example , consider the case of a teenager considering whether to save money for his future .
If he spends his salary on toys and trinkets , he will never accumulate any savings .
If , on the other hand , he minimizes expenses and saves money for college , he will forgo current consumption and invest in capital improvements .
The same tradeoff applies to all consumers and producers : capital improvements require a sacrifice in current consumption to invest resources needed to expand future production .
Production , not consumption drives economic growth
The lack of a consumer culture is not an impediment to economic growth , as resources that are not consumed are invested into new markets and production capital .
If a consumer forfeits a new car now to buy a better car at some point in the future , his savings are not lost .
Instead of being directed into present consumption , his savings become the investment capital for new factories and R&D into cheaper and better cars .
This is why such high economic growth is possible in “ Asian tigers ” such as Hong Kong and South Korea – high rates of savings support rapid technological progress and investment into industry at the cost of a much more frugal lifestyle than in the West .
Capital has structure
Politicians and the media treat GDP as a single number , but it is crucial to understand that producers face a choice between producing consumer goods and investing in intermediate goods used to create consumer goods .
Those goods differ as well : a factory owner can invest in merely maintaining his factory , building a similar factory to expand production , or engaging in a long - term research and development program in a new product or production process .
Thus , the goods produced by an economy can be one , two , or more level removed from consumer goods .
Capital investments require savings and stability
Economic and technological progress requires that entrepreneurs make long - term investments in intermediate production goods many levels removed from the consumer .
In order for this to happen , two things are necessary : that consumers forgo current consumption to invest in future production , and that reliable long term predictions can be made about future savings rates and demand patterns .
Monetary policy disrupts economic growth
Governments control over the currency allows them to use monetary policy to achieve short - term economic goals , such as increasing GDP .
But the consequences of artificially manipulating interest rates are disastrous .
By expanding the money supply through manipulation of interest rates or ( as is happening now ) sending money directly from the printing presses to banks and other corporations , the government is devaluing savings and redirecting them into increased consumer spending .
This improves the economic statistics in the short run at the cost of wiping out the resources set aside for long - term capital improvements .
Furthermore , the arbitrary nature of government intervention in the economy makes long - term predictions about future savings and demand impossible .
Let the market direct savings and investment or face financial ruin
There is no single right answer to the tradeoff between current consumption and the savings available to invest in future production and increased economic growth .
Every individual must choose for himself how to balance present spending with investments in his future .
In a free market , the sum of individual savings rates becomes the real interest rate .
For the last few decades , America ’s spending binge has been funded by foreign investment and rapid technological innovation , but ultimately , unless we drastically cut our consumption , and direct our income into savings and repaying our debts , we will find our money increasingly worthless both here and internationally .
The dire consequences of hyperinflation can be seen in Zimbawbe , where life expectancy has declined from 60 to 37/34 years , unemployment is at 80 % , and as much as half the surviving population has left the country .

People voluntarily pick what information they store in short - term memory .
Now , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , researchers can see just what information people are holding in memory based only on patterns of activity in the brain .
Psychologists from the University of Oregon and the University of California , San Diego , reported their findings in the February issue of Psychological Science .
By analyzing blood - flow activity , they were able to identify the specific color or orientation of an object that was intentionally stored by the observer .
The experiments , in which subjects viewed a stimulus for one second and held a specific aspect of the object in mind after the stimulus disappeared , were conducted in the UO 's Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for Neuroimaging .
In 10 - second delays after each exposure , researchers recorded brain activity during memory selection and storage processing in the visual cortex , a brain region that they hypothesized would support the maintenance of visual details in short - term memory .
University of Oregon doctoral student Edward Ester points to computer screen where activity in the brain 's visual cortex is displayed .

" Another interesting thing was that if subjects were remembering orientation , then that pattern of activity during the delay period had no information about color , even though they were staring at a colored - oriented stimulus , " said Edward Awh , a UO professor of psychology .
" Likewise , if they chose to remember color we were able to decode which color they remembered , but orientation information was completely missing . "
Researchers used machine - learning algorithms to examine spatial patterns of activation in the early visual cortex that are associated with remembering different stimuli , said John T. Serences , professor of psychology at UC - San Diego .
" This algorithm , " he said , " can then be used to predict exactly what someone is remembering based on these activation patterns . "
Increases in blood flow , as seen with fMRI , are measured in voxels -- small units displayed in a 3 - D grid .
Different vectors of the grid , corresponding to neurons , respond as subjects view and store their chosen memories .
Based on patterns of activity in an individual 's visual cortex , located at the rear of the brain , researchers can pinpoint what is being stored and where , Awh said .
The study is similar to one published this month in Nature and led by Vanderbilt University neuroscientist Frank Tong and colleagues , who were able to predict with 80 - percent - plus accuracy which patterns individuals held in memory 11 seconds after seeing a stimulus .
" Their paper makes a very similar point to ours , " Awh said , " though they did not vary which ' dimension ' of the stimulus people chose to remember , and they did not compare the pattern of activity during sensory processing and during memory .
They showed that they could look at brain activity to classify which orientation was being stored in memory . "
What Awh and colleagues found was that the sensory area of the brain had a pattern of activity that represented only an individual 's intentionally stored aspect of the stimulus .
This voluntary control in memory selection , Awh said , falls in line with previous research , including that done by Awh and co-author Edward K. Vogel , also of the UO , that there is limited capacity for what can be stored at one time .
People choose what is important and relevant to them , Awh said .
" Basically , our study shows that information about the precise feature a person is remembering is represented in the visual cortex , " Serences said , " This is important because it demonstrates that people recruit the same neural machinery during memory as they do when they see a stimulus . "
That demonstration , Awh said , supports the sensory recruitment hypothesis , which suggests the same parts of the brain are involved in perception of a stimulus and memory storage .
A fourth co-author with Awh , Serences and Vogel was Edward F. Ester , a UO doctoral student .
Serences was with the University of California , Irvine , when the project began .
The research was primarily funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health to Awh , and by support from the UO 's Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for Neuroimaging .

Who will be next to take on the keys to the Tardis ?
The name of the actor who will replace David Tennant in Doctor Who will be announced on Saturday .
Tennant said in October that he would stand down from the show after filming four special episodes in 2009 .
His replacement - the 11th Doctor of the TV series - will be revealed in a Doctor Who Confidential programme on BBC One at 1735 on 3 January .
The casting was confirmed over Christmas and filming for the 2010 series begins in the summer .
Tennant is due to begin shooting the first of his four specials this month , just weeks after surgery on his back .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The last of these episodes is expected to run in early 2010 .
' Nail - biting Christmas '
The casting decision has been a priority for the show 's new creative team , led by executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger .
The BBC said that in Saturday 's Doctor Who special " the actor playing the new Doctor will be giving his or her initial reaction " to becoming TV 's most famous time traveller .
Wenger , head of drama at BBC Wales , said : " We believe the actor is going to bring something very special to the role and will make it absolutely their own .
THE 10 DOCTORS 1 . William Hartnell 2 . Patrick Troughton 3 . Jon Pertwee 4 . Tom Baker ( pictured ) 5 . Peter Davison 6 . Colin Baker 7 . Sylvester McCoy 8 . Paul McGann 9 . Christopher Eccleston 10 .
David Tennant 11 . ???
" I just can't wait to tell everyone who it is - it has been a nail - biting Christmas trying to keep this under wraps ! "
Shortly after Tennant 's announcement , bookmakers were tipping several well - known names as the next actor ( or actress ) to step into the Tardis .
Murphy 's Law and Cold Feet star James Nesbitt emerged as one of the favourites , along with Paterson Joseph , John Simm and David Morrissey - who appeared in the 2008 Christmas special .
Paterson Joseph , who recently starred in Survivors and appeared in two Doctor Who episodes in 2005 , has said " any actor would love the challenge " of playing the Time Lord .
Bookmakers made him an early favourite - offering odds of 3 - 1 on him becoming the first black Doctor .
Comedian Jennifer Saunders , former Doctor
Who assistant Billie Piper and film star Catherine Zeta Jones have also been mentioned in connection with the role .
The show 's outgoing executive producer Russell T Davies said last month : " Whoever becomes the Doctor has got to take on a whole life .
It 's not just becoming a part of a TV show . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
It would be nice to see an older wiser Dr arrive on the scene .
Less cheeky chap and more brilliant eccentric professor .
K. , Bristol
In October , when Tennant was asked who he thought should replace him , he joked : " Well , I 've always been a big supporter of Wee Jimmy Krankie ! "
Doctor
Who began in 1963 , and seven actors played the Doctor before the show was dropped in 1989 .
After a TV movie in 1996 - starring Paul McGann - the TV series returned in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role .
Tennant took over the role the same year .

Many detainees locked up at Guantanamo were innocent men swept up by U.S. forces unable to distinguish enemies from noncombatants , a former Bush administration official said Thursday .
" There are still innocent people there , " Lawrence Wilkerson , a Republican who was chief of staff to then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , told the Associated Press .
" Some have been there six or seven years . "
Wilkerson , who first made the assertions in an Internet posting Tuesday , told the AP he learned from briefings and by communicating with military commanders that the United States soon realized many Guantanamo detainees were innocent but nevertheless held them in hopes they could provide information for a " mosaic " of intelligence .
" It did not matter if a detainee were innocent .
Indeed , because he lived in Afghanistan and was captured on or near the battle area , he must know something of importance , " Wilkerson wrote in the blog .
He said intelligence analysts hoped to gather " sufficient information about a village , a region , or a group of individuals , that dots could be connected and terrorists or their plots could be identified . "
Wilkerson , a retired Army colonel , said vetting on the battlefield during the early stages of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan was incompetent with no meaningful attempt to discriminate " who we were transporting to Cuba for detention and interrogation . "
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman , declined to comment on Wilkerson 's specific allegations but noted that the military has consistently said that dealing with foreign fighters from a wide variety of countries in a wartime setting was a complex process .
The military has insisted that those held at Guantanamo were enemy combatants and posed a threat to the United States .
In his posting for the Washington Note blog , Wilkerson wrote that " U.S. leadership became aware of this lack of proper vetting very early on and , thus , of the reality that many of the detainees were innocent of any substantial wrongdoing , had little intelligence value , and should be immediately released . "
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney fought efforts to address the situation , Wilkerson said , because " to have admitted this reality would have been a black mark on their leadership . "
Wilkerson told the AP in a telephone interview that many detainees " clearly had no connection to al Qaeda and the Taliban and were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Pakistanis turned many over for $ 5,000 a head . "
Some 800 men have been held at Guantanamo since the prison opened in January 2002 , and 240 remain .
Wilkerson said two dozen are terrorists , including confessed Sept. 11 plotter Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who was transferred to Guantanamo from CIA custody in September 2006 .
England has slumped to an embarrassing defeat by an innings and 23 runs after being skittled for 51 by West Indies on the fourth day of the first Test in Jamaica .
Jerome Taylor ripped the heart out of England , a superb spell of pace bowling earning figures of 5 for 11 at Sabina Park , while spinner Sulieman Benn took 4 for 31 .
Andrew Flintoff was the only batsman to make double figures , hitting 24 as the visitors were routed for their third lowest total .
West Indies had not beaten England in their last 16 meetings going back to a victory at Edgbaston in 2000 .
" We were entirely outplayed , " admitted England skipper Andrew Strauss .
" We have n't done ourselves justice .
I thought the bowlers stuck to their task pretty well .
" We batted pretty poorly today and we paid the price .
" All credit to Jerome Taylor , he bowled pretty straight and fast but we did n't react well . "
West Indies captain Chris Gayle , who hit a century in his team 's innings , looked forward to repeating the win in the second Test in Antigua and praised Taylor as well as Benn , who took eight wickets in the match .
" Benn , with the ball , was tremendous picking up eight wickets , Jerome Taylor picking up five wickets was very good , " Gayle said .
After the home team was bowled out for 392 , securing a lead of 74 runs , England slid to 2 for 11 at lunch with Alastair Cook and Ian Bell the men out .
Taylor , watched by triple Olympic champion and 100 metres world record holder Usain Bolt of Jamaica , produced a ' Lightning Bolt ' of his own by removing Kevin Pietersen for 1 with a classic delivery .
The fast bowler produced late outswing to bowl Pietersen as he attempted to hit the ball through mid-wicket .
Next to go was Strauss , who edged another excellent delivery from Taylor to keeper Denesh Ramdin .
With the crowd anticipating a famous victory , on - fire Taylor also bowled Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior to leave England reeling .
Slow left armer Benn , who had earlier dismissed Bell , took his second wicket when Broad was caught by Xavier Marshall at short leg .
Benn then trapped Ryan Sidebottom lbw before Flintoff , who had provided some sort of resistance , was clean bowled by Fidel Edwards .
Spinner Benn , who also took four wickets in the first innings , finished England off when he bowled Steve Harmison to prompt wild celebrations from the Jamaican crowd .
It was sweet revenge for West Indies , who was bowled out for 47 by England the last time the teams met at this venue .
Strauss 's men have plenty to think about ahead of next week 's second Test in Antigua .

Firstly believed to be a joke on ' Questionable Content ' , a popular Indy Rock web - comic , but soon found to be a genre , to include ' Hobo Metal ' which was revolutionised by a band known as ' Trashcan of Deception ' in late 2005 .
Their music focus was based around any excuse to insult the emokid population of the world with their vulgar , poorly recorded music , as a means of using the hobo image .
Surprisingly this Hobocore music took off , and people were soon downloading and playing these songs to their friends , for their comedic and satirical value - definately not musical .
This band was all about wittily poking fun at everything the emokid trend represented , thus angering angsty teens worldwide who think it's ' cooler ' to show little appreciation for life .
Hobos have something to complain about , spoilt rich teenagers do n't .
Take out the emokid population , are you Hobocore enough ?
Emo : omg lyke u guys r soo meen Emo Hobocore :
Yeah , screw you buddy , I 've been brushing my teeth with rat blood for 7 years !
Emo : O.. sorri dood .
Emo Hobocore : Yeah that 's right , fuck you .

" It has previously not been known that hobos burn emokids within their faithful fires .
This is revenge , against the spoiled brats who think they have it bad as opposed to those who live in the streets eating rats and pigeons .

American intelligence agencies recently looked into their crystal balls and forecast a challenging and , in some cases , scary world in 2025 .
Most of the news headlines emanating from the report have focused on nuclear weapons and the decline of American dominance , but there is plenty of sobering analysis about other subjects to keep one up nights as well .
Take , for instance , the competition for dwindling energy resources .
Many leaders and activists in America and elsewhere advocate cuts in fossil fuel use as a way to arrest the growing dangers of climate change and fights over scarcity .
But the intelligence community ’s report , called Global Trends 2025 , warns that forcibly reducing fossil fuel use before energy substitutes are widely available could threaten continued economic development in countries like China , where industry has not yet achieve high levels of energy efficiency .
As now projected , new energy technologies “ probably will not be commercially viable and widespread by 2025 , ” the report said .
The report , which draws on scores of interviews and discussion groups on five continents , seems well vetted .
But as we said in an editorial about it , the conclusions are not inevitable .
An American president and Congress that choose to treat issues of this kind as a priority could have an impact , maybe even a significant impact , on what happens .
Among the reports other findings :
— If there is greater integration and cooperation among Asian nations , Asia could set the energy terms for the rest of the world .
That ’s because two - thirds of Mideast oil exports go to Asia and 70 percent of Asian imports are from the Middle East .
If , however , such cooperation does not evolve , competition for oil supplies could lead to a naval arms race among China , India and Japan .
— There will be a growing concentration of oil and gas deposits , with Russia and Iran emerging as “ the energy kingpins . ”
Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , the UAE , Iraq ( potentially ) , and Russia are projected to account for 39 percent of total world oil production .
— Natural gas use is likely to grow steadily in absolute terms .
But coal may be the fastest growing energy source .
It ’s dirty , but as energy prices rise , coal will be attractive because it is cheap , abundant and close to markets .
The United States , China , India , and Russia possess the four largest coal reserves .
— Use of civilian nuclear power will expand , but the increase will not be sufficient to fill the growing demand for electricity .
If you ’re sleeping too well now , you can read the intelligence agencies ’ prognosis for 2025 here .

An iPod repairman from Michigan who managed to score more than 9000 iPod shuffles from Apple is facing fraud and money laundering charges .
The Boston Globe reports that Nicholas Woodhams , 23 , essentially guessed serial numbers for the scaled - back iPods and entered them into Apple 's system , claiming they were replacements for faulty devices .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He made his employees enter serial numbers and have the MP3 player replacements sent to a UPS post box .
When Apple did n't receive a defective iPod in return , it would charge the replacement to a credit card .
Woodhams used cards that rejected the transactions , the Globe said .
The computer giant sent out more than 9000 shuffles which Woodhams sold for US $ 49 each .
The US Government , which filed charges in Grand Rapids last week , wants to seize Woodhams ' real estate , Apple computers , two vehicles and a motorbike , plus over half a million dollars - allegedly the proceeds of his shuffle fraud .

The courthouse at the corner of Scheelegatan and Fleminggatan is hardly what you 'd call a marvel of modern Swedish design .
Red - brick , nondescript , it 's also the last place in Stockholm you 'd go looking for a party .
But if you had been there a fortnight ago , that 's exactly what you 'd have found .
For the last two weeks of February , room nine of the city 's district court played host to the trial of The Pirate Bay , a Swedish website that compiles links to BitTorrent files – a particularly efficient form of file - sharing – from across the internet .
As the world 's largest BitTorrent " tracker " site ( and the 108th most popular site on the web ) , The Pirate Bay boasts almost 3.5 million registered users , a further 21.5 million unregistered users , and a billion page views per month .
But many of the files the six - year - old site tracks and indexes are illicit versions of copyrighted material , and the film and music industries brought the site to court in the hope of making it an example to pirates everywhere .
However , proceedings did not go quite to plan .
Instead of coming quietly , the three mischievous young men who run The Pirate Bay turned their trial into a sell - out show .
Their friends from the anti-copyright think - tank Piratbyran ( " The Pirate Bureau " ) turned up every day in a brightly painted campaign bus .
Student bands played for supporters outside the court and , at the end of the trial 's first week , the defendants threw a party at a nightclub in central Stockholm , offering free champagne to every guest .

So confident are the trio that they set up another website to cover the trial independently of the mainstream media .
They named it Spectrial , a combination of " trial " and " spectacle " .
Tickets for half a day in the courtroom changed hands for € 60 ( £ 55 ) each on the black market , more than most rock concerts .
The trial concluded last week , and both sides now await the verdict of the judging panel , due in April .
But , to their fellow file - sharers , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi and Fredrik Neij are already folk heroes .

Meanwhile , on the other side of Stockholm , a new internet company has turned this demand for free media into a viable business model that the music industry seems willing to stomach .
Spotify , launched in October last year , is a piece of music software that looks not unlike iTunes , yet allows you to listen to a vast , growing catalogue of streamed tracks for free – as long as you are prepared to endure around a minute of advertising per hour .
A premium version , costing £ 9.99 per month , suppresses the ads and offers exclusive content .
Listeners can exchange their favourite playlists with one another online .
This internet jukebox 's global user numbers reached a million this week and are increasing by 20,000 a day , while its catalogue of tracks grows at a similar rate .
At least 250,000 Spotify users are in the UK , where the service recently became freely available for download .
And , in February , it executed its first big industry coup , giving users the chance to hear U2's new album a week before its physical release .
Spotify has harnessed a voracious appetite for sharing free culture online to create a legitimate alternative to online piracy .
But it 's a model that would never have been embraced by the entertainment industry without the likes of The Pirate Bay forcing labels and studios to confront the future .
Both sites are part of an ever - fertile technology community in Sweden 's melting pot of expertise , experience and innovation ; Stockholm is , in attitude and actuality , the capital of a new virtual world .
Spotify 's Stockholm HQ is just what you 'd expect of a flourishing internet start - up .
In one corner of the open - plan office is a heap of bean - bags .
There 's a pool table , a foosball table and an air hockey table .
Hip , youthful employees drink coffee from a Nespresso machine ; developers brainstorm in an alcove where the bright wooden floor gives way to faux grass and pot plants , which match the bright green styling of the Spotify logo in the lobby .
Already the Spotify staff – whose numbers have ballooned from 15 to about 70 – are looking for bigger premises .
Daniel Ek , a cerebral - seeming 25 - year - old in a designer sweater , is Spotify 's founder .
A serial CEO , he started his first company in 1997 at the age of 14 .
His last venture was Stardoll , a social network for young girls that now has 26 million members worldwide .
He was once CEO of uTorrent , the developers of a popular – and legal – BitTorrent file - sharing platform that doubtless accounts for a lot of The Pirate Bay 's traffic ( uTorrent was created by Ludvig Strideus , currently a Spotify employee ) .
Ek estimates that one - third of Stockholm 's inhabitants now use Spotify regularly .
" I 've created things that millions of people have used before , " he says , " but this is the first time people have started to recognise me in the street . "
Tech companies litter Stockholm 's centre , and Ek is the latest in a line of stellar Swedish web entrepreneurs .
There 's Martin Lorentzon , Spotify 's co-founder and creator of the marketing site TradeDoubler .
There 's Peter Alvarsson , who in 2006 set up Headweb , a legal film - download site that puts BitTorrent technology to legitimate use .
In 2001 , Niklas Zennstrom founded Kazaa , a peer - to - peer file - sharing network that frequently faced lawsuits from the record industry .
He went on to establish Skype , the internet telephone service , and Joost , a legal peer - to - peer video distribution platform .
Way back in 1995 , Jonas Svensson set up Spray , a web - page design site that became the biggest such service in the world .
Perhaps the most important was Jonas Birgersson , who made millions when he floated his internet consultancy Framfab in 1999 .
Birgersson , then 29 , used his fortune to establish a broadband service , Bredbandsbolaget , which by 2001 had delivered high - speed broadband to half a million Swedish homes .
At the same time , a government drive was under way to get not only the internet , but also a tax - free desktop computer , into every household .
Sweden 's population of nine million soon became the most wired in the world .
" Bredbandsbolaget connected a lot of Swedes , " Ek says .
" In 1997 , I was one of the top 1 per cent of people in Europe , with broadband access of 10 Mb in both directions [ upload and download ] .
That was over a decade ago , and most of the UK still does n't have that sort of access . "
Rick Falkvinge is the leader of Sweden 's most plugged - in political group , The Pirate Party .
" In the rest of Europe , " he says , " the internet roll - out was done by telecommunications companies , who had an incentive to delay it for as long as possible because it shattered their existing business model .
When you put disruptive technology into everyone 's hands , it changes public perceptions of what you can , and should , do with it . "
It did n't take the internet to give the Swedes an international outlook .
Thanks to linguistic isolation and high - quality free education , almost everyone in Stockholm speaks flawless English .
The state prizes its science and engineering teaching , and the country has always punched above its weight as an exporter , with telecoms brands like Ericsson , but also with Volvo , Saab , Tetrapak , Ikea and H&M .
Free music schools are often cited as the cause of Sweden 's chart success ; the country is the third - largest exporter of pop music after the US and the UK .
Sweden was exporting free media before the tech revolution .
The free newspaper Metro was established in Stockholm in 1995 before spreading to more than 100 cities worldwide .
Swedes are voracious consumers of news , and every small town still has a local rag .
But , says the Metro CEO Andreas Ohlson : " Younger audiences prefer our free papers to paid subscription ones .
Our typical reader is 27 years old , urban , active and likes to travel .
They 're the same people who use Spotify and The Pirate Bay . "
Sweden has felt the effects of the recession as strongly as anywhere – Saab is on the brink of bankruptcy – but that did n't stop two Scandinavian investment companies pumping € 15 m into Spotify last year .
Ek and Lorentzen had already invested £ 7 m .
Ek is convinced that the collapse in ad revenues will not affect his company 's growth , as he can offer advertisers a powerful form of targeted advertising .
" Unlike old radio advertising , which has to rely on listener surveys , we can tell brands that we are reaching , say , 35,000 males in London between the ages of 25 and 35 , and right now they 're listening to cheerful music .
If you 're a brand that wants to be upbeat , you can associate yourself with that audience .
We want to facilitate brand partnerships with record companies and individual artists , too . "
Spotify has been negotiating with the record labels since the site was conceived in autumn 2006 , but now that a buzz has built up , new music partners are coming on board every day .
In early February , independent distributor CD Baby signed up , with the promise of almost a million new tracks .
With U2 in the tank , Ek believes he can attract the few big acts still holding out , such as Metallica , AC / DC and Prince .
" The other day Johnny Greenwood [ of Radiohead ] posted a Spotify playlist on his blog , so hopefully we can have a discussion with Radiohead about getting their catalogue . "
And it 's not just stadium bands .
" Spotify could be a tool for breaking new artists , " Ek says .
" Glasvegas are big in the UK but no one thought about getting them to Scandinavia .
We had them on Spotify , the radio picked it up , their label took them to iTunes , and now their Stockholm shows sell out in 30 minutes .
Their LP was n't even supposed to be released here . "
This was no top - down marketing drive .
" Our homepage is algorithmic , " Ek says .
" If Glasvegas got there , it 's because it was relevant to a Swedish audience , not because anyone in the company chose it .
Record companies need to think about the way they break artists internationally .
Why not just make the music free everywhere and see where it gets picked up ?
Who knows what will be huge in Sweden or Japan or Ukraine ? "
Ek acknowledges that , without the far - reaching effects of The Pirate Bay and its ilk , Spotify could never have come to fruition .
" There is a big file - sharing community here in Sweden , " he says .
" It 's how people want to consume content .
They do n't want to be illegal , but they want to have everything at their fingertips instantly , which is what The Pirate Bay facilitated .
The best way to compete with that is to come up with a better product .
Spotify exists because of piracy . "

Technology must be in the Swedish genes ; in 1900 , Stockholm had more telephones than London or Berlin .
When Crown Princess Victoria announced her engagement last week , she did so via a video on the royal website .
The weekend 's biggest film opening was an adaptation of novelist Stieg Larsson 's thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo .
The heroine of the title is a young computer hacker with a flexible attitude to the law .
It 's easy to elicit sympathy for such a character when some two million Swedes use The Pirate Bay .
Hence , perhaps , the support its creators received during their trial .
Warg , Sunde and Neij ( and Carl Lundstrom , a major donor to the site ) are accused of being accessories to copyright infringement .
They face a fine of 120 m kronor ( £ 9.6 m ) and up to two years in prison if they lose .
However , The Pirate Bay does n't actually host any illegal copies of films or music ; it merely points users towards file - sharing sources elsewhere on the web .
For all their former pro-piracy bluster , The Pirate Bay 's line of defence has been awfully prosaic .
Lawyers acting on behalf of the entertainment industries must prove that the defendants have profited handsomely from the site 's success .
The trio insist that the few advertisements featured on the site fund only its ( not inconsiderable ) running costs .
On the trial 's second day , the prosecution was forced to drop half the charges after it became clear that they had misunderstood the nature of BitTorrent technology ; evidence they thought implicated The Pirate Bay did nothing of the sort .
They also found it difficult to grasp the notion that the site is run as a collective rather than a hierarchical organisation .
Indeed , if the Spectrial narrative ( as written by the pirates ) is to be believed , the film studios , record labels et al simply can't comprehend any project that operates outside the confines of a conventional business .
The Pirate Bay was set up by Piratbyran in 2003 as a way for the think tank – which opposes current intellectual property laws – to partake of a powerful new file - sharing method .
The BitTorrent system works by sharing files not simply between two individual users , but among a swarm of downloaders , making sharing faster and more communal .
" It was more effective than the previous technologies , so we wanted it to grow , " say Tobias Andersson of Piratbyran , who gave evidence at the trial .
" But we never imagined how much it would grow .
By mid-2004 , it was taking too much time and energy , so we handed it over to some friends who were dedicated tech guys – Peter , Fredrik and Gottfried . "
Piratbyran and The Pirate Bay befriended one another online , from cities across Sweden .
" We all came from the Swedish hacker scene , " Andersson says .
" It took three years for me to meet all the guys I work with .
We just hung out online . "
The advent of broadband in even the most northerly Swedish cities made such endeavours possible , but it also opened up a generation gap between the two sides of the online revolution , which has been thrown into relief by the trial .
" We have some older supporters in court , " Andersson says , " but last week was [ half - term ] , and it seemed like every 14 - year - old in Stockholm came down to the courthouse to see their idols ! "
Rick Falkvinge says membership of his Pirate Party – which is unaffiliated with Piratbyran , but shares its ideology – peaks among 18 - year - olds , and that he has met brilliant , tech - savvy activists as young as 13 .
The youth sections of the country 's eight main political parties , unlike their elders , have all declared themselves in favour of free file - sharing .
One of the few artists to have condemned The Pirate Bay in public is Bjorn Ulvaeus of Abba .
In court , Sunde , 30 , the public face of the site , delighted in teasing his opponents .
During one exchange , the prosecutor tried to speak his language , asking when he had first met his colleagues " IRL " – in real life .
" We do n't use the expression IRL , " Sunde retorted .
" We use AFK – away from keyboard . "
It 's difficult to imagine any of the defendants being AFK for long .
Sunde ( who dropped out of high school , despite supposedly speaking seven languages and being four years ahead of his grade in maths ) even " Twittered " live from the courtroom under his pseudonym " brokep " .
" We had some pizza after today 's [ proceedings ] , " read one whimsical tweet .
" Met the opposing side and asked if they could pick up the check .
They refused . "
" This trial is about the establishment 's fight to retake control of communication , " says Falkvinge , " but even the monopoly on reporting from the trial is shattered by 20 or more live bloggers giving second - by - second updates ; and even by the defendants themselves , who have their laptops in the courtroom .
The establishment waits until the next morning to publish its thoughts , by which time it 's old news . "
Three leading Swedish media groups were banned from a pre-trial press conference .
" We 've done our best to turn it into a circus , " Andersson says .
" We do n't take it that seriously ; whatever happens , there will be an appeal and the case will go to a higher court .
This trial is just good PR . "
Regardless of the verdict , The Pirate Bay is likely to live on .
Not only does the site have servers outside Sweden , but Warg and Neij now live in Cambodia and Laos respectively .
One other thing is certain ; piracy and file - sharing will become an election issue in Sweden .
In early 2006 , the Pirate Party was a fledgling group of fewer than 1,000 members ; few media outlets took it seriously .
Then , on 31 May that year , Swedish police raided the headquarters of The Pirate Bay , briefly confiscating the site 's servers and beginning the legal process that led to the trial .
" Suddenly , " says Falkvinge , " we were handing out press releases like candy , everybody started calling us , and my face was on every newscast . "
Today , the Pirate Party has a membership of 11,000 – more than two of the parties in parliament .
Though it failed to win any seats in the 2006 general election , Falkvinge is confident his organisation can win a place in the European Parliament on 20 May .
Courtesy of the internet 's connective power , the Swedish Pirate Party already has international franchises on six continents .
Falkvinge , a red - haired , occasionally fiery 37 - year - old , was formerly a project leader for Microsoft in Stockholm .
He carries a netbook mini-laptop with him to show off his " pretty pictures " – graphs that demonstrate the growth in support for the Pirate Party , which , he claims , is a civil liberties movement .
" Whichever way the trial goes , it will escalate the conflict , " he says .
" If they 're acquitted , the [ entertainment industry ] lobby will scream for harsher laws .
If they 're convicted , there will be public outcry .
Either way , it will end up in the political arena , just ahead of the European elections .
That 's where we come in . "
Falkvinge enjoys discussing history – of the printing press , of copyright law , of Swedish politics .
The popularity of his party helped to persuade both prime ministerial candidates in the last general election to state publicly that filesharing should remain legal .
The country 's advanced technological infrastructure and the activity – legal or illegal – that it generated have already changed the political conversation in Sweden .
Soon the chatter will spread .

Ola Sars is a Harvard business graduate with a hipster sensibility .
With three fellow thirtysomething Stockholmers , he set up a company called Tonium in 2006 to create the Pacemaker , a palm - sized MP3 mixing desk .
The DJ mixes made by its users can be uploaded and shared .
" Within three years , everything is going to be accessible , on your laptop , cellphone , wherever , " Sars says .
" The most important thing is a filter , and we think the human being is the most interesting and effective filter , better than any algorithm .
When it comes to music , the DJ is the natural example of that . "
The idea behind the Pacemaker , he explains , was to democratise DJ culture .
" We want to encourage taste - sharing in our community .
We work with superstar DJs , but the Pacemaker is n't for them , it 's for regular boys and girls . "
Sweden has long been held up as a model of social democracy .
So is there something in the mindset that predisposes the Swedes to the provision of free , communal culture online ?
" There 's a law [ Allemansratten ] that I think is unique to Sweden , about common spaces , " says Andersson .
" You can go out camping in nature anywhere in Sweden without asking the landowner 's permission .
That sort of attitude predominates here . "
It is perhaps not surprising , then , that many of the most successful Swedish internet exports have been social tools , such as Skype , Kazaa and Spotify .
" To my knowledge , there 's at least 40 sites already built for sharing Spotify playlists , independent of us , " Ek says .
One of the most popular is the Swedish site Spotylist.com .
Another Swedish developer has built a software application that turns Nokia cellphones into Spotify remote controls .
" The Swedish mindset wants to provide a social security system , " Sars says .
" We want the national economy to balance out and allow everyone an equal life .
Our big companies are capitalistic in their growth , but they stay and pay their taxes in Sweden .
We 've always bragged about having free hospitals , universities , and so on .
Everything goes towards supporting that bigger cause .
Corporate leaders in Sweden talk about the fact that they are doing business in order to employ people and support the welfare system .
It 's a naive idea , but a nice one , and it keeps driving the quest to find the next Swedish success . "

" You want to eat local food ? " said Annetta Fernandes , who runs the beautiful Siolim House , where I recently stayed .
" Yes , please .
I want to eat where you eat . "
" Ok ... Around the corner there is a place , " she said sheepishly , " it 's called the Hotel Jack Inn .
You can try there -- they have very good sausage ... "
In India , restaurants have a strange habit of calling themselves hotels when they 're not .
I 'm not really sure why , I should probably look into that .
Anyway , the Hotel Jack Inn is a small , five - table spot just opposite the Cathedral in Siolim , Goa ( those were my vague directions , and now they are yours ) .
This village is close enough to the beaches that you frequently see the naked red skin of well - fed , elderly tourists whizzing by on Enfield motorcycles .
That , and the peculiar tribe of people who , regardless of gender , all seem to have dreadlocks , sleeve tattoos , linen Sinbad pants , and ride the economical scooter .
While walking to the Hotel Jack Inn , I saw an inebriated , cycle- riding Russian smack into an Indian man 's parked motorbike , pushing it about 15 feet down the street .
" How much do you want , baba ? " he slurred , displaying his considerable cultural insight before offering him 200 rupees ( that 's $ 4 ) .
Ah , the joys of Western tourism .
Bob Bibleman has had bad luck with technology lately .
The last time a robot cooked for him he found himself involved in some sort of quasi-military intrigue , and his robot lawnmower sure seems like it 's up to something .
But when ol '
Bob ran across a report in the Times ( UK ) that a venerable Italian gentleman named Claudio Torghele had invented " Let 's Pizza " -- a machine that makes pizza from scratch , in three minutes -- he decided to give technology one more chance .
The device sports a glass window through which you can watch the machine mix and knead the dough , spin it into shape , add the sauce and toppings , and cook it to perfection .
A pie will run you about € 3.50 ( or just under five bucks ) , and the machine is due to hit the streets sometime this summer .
Now that Mr. Bibleman has that sorted out , maybe he 'll be brave enough to let technology help him with other areas of his life -- we hear that JDate 's really something [ Via The Raw Feed

An international action plan is to be drawn up to save the polar bear , now threatened with extinction because climate change is melting its Arctic sea ice habitat .
The five countries with polar bear populations , the US , Canada , Russia , Norway and Greenland , agreed in principle yesterday on a circumpolar scheme to protect the animal 's dwindling living space all around its range .
The plan , to be drawn up by a team of polar bear experts , is likely to call for protected areas for denning in winter and no hunting in summer in Arctic territory of each of the five nations – where future industrial activity would be limited .
It would also seek to establish reserves in those areas of sea ice likely to be the last to melt as global warming takes hold : the High Arctic regions of north - west Greenland and the Canadian archipelago .
At the moment this is an area of heavy ice and the bears prefer the edge of the ice to hunt – but this may be where the edge of the ice is located in future .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The plan is also likely to deal with the issue of hunting , or " harvesting " , the bears by Arctic native peoples ( and in Canada also by sports hunters ) , which , as highlighted in The Independent on Monday , kills about 700 polar bears a year out of a global population of approximately 22,000 .
The government of Norway convened the meeting and set high expectations .
" It would be an amazing crime against future generations if we did not save the polar bear , " said the Norwegian Environment Minister , Erik Solheim .
The action plan is likely to take account of the threat of climate change in setting sustainable hunting quotas .
Although nothing has yet been decided , this might mean a reduction in hunting in some areas , although hunting as a practice is likely to continue for some time .
The circumpolar plan was agreed at the end of a three - day summit on polar bear conservation in the Norwegian Arctic city of Tromso .
The closing statement called for action on climate change in strong terms , clearly aimed at the meeting in Bonn in 10 days , where negotiators from all UN member states will begin trying to construct a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol .
Geoff York , polar bear co-ordinator for the Arctic Programme of the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , said : " Ultimately , if the sea ice goes completely in the summer time , and we have n't done anything conclusive to try to turn that around , we 're likely to have no polar bears at all in the long run .
No sea ice – no seals – no bears . "
Has the bear market come to an end ?
It is certainly hard to say .
In January , I called for 10 % down in U.S. equities , which is basically where we are now ( 7900 on the Dow vs. the present 7776 ) .
My view has been that we would break through 2002 and 1998 lows to the down side before this was over and we have done so .
But are we going lower still ?
In thinking about that question , a historical parallel from 1914 - 1929 might make for an interesting comparison .
Take a look at the graphs below for the Dow from 1914 - 1929 vs. 1982-1999 .
The two charts are very similar .
From 1914 , the Dow rose from 55 to over 380 , almost 7 times .
From 1982 to 1999 , the rise was even greater , from 800 to nearly 12,000 , more than 14 times !
Given the fact that the Dow collapsed by 90 % after 1929 , one would have thought that trouble was in store after 1999 .
However , looking at the charts below , one can see that the markets have held up rather well in comparison to the Great Depression .
In both cases , in 1937 and again in 2007 , the markets collapsed again by 50 % after the chart period graphed .
However , clearly , the market action in the 1930s was of a different class , 1929 - 1932 having been much more severe .
In my view , the secular bear market began in 1999 for large cap stocks making 1999 analogous to 1929 and 2007 analogous to 1937 as opposed to 1929 .
The Dow reached the 1937 peak again only in 1945 .

I spent some of my weekend with the ladies of the Mom 2.0 Summit , a new conference targeted at women who do business online .
All indications are that the event , organized by my good friends Carrie Pacini and Marla Trevino of opmom.com as well as some other awesome local women , was a smashing success and will likely become an annual event .
Among the products and services showcased , Eye - Fi caught my eye in particular .
As a geek who is also married to a geek , gadgets , cameras and other toys are fixtures in my house , and while I have read about the availability of memory cards with built - in Wi-Fi capability for a while , I had not yet played with one .
Obviously , a girl like me will gravitate toward the person in the room with the coolest toys , so I struck up a conversation with Ziv Gillat of Eye - Fi .
I had witnessed the wonders of Eye - Fi the night before at the big Mom 2.0 conference party where he captured me in a moment of stealthy iPhone photography , and yes I did have a Burger King bag on my head and a pink feather boa .
It 's how I roll .
The party photos were instantly uploaded to Flickr , and projected on the wall , which is a pretty cute party trick .
When I ran into him the following day and could properly interrogate him about his product after a nights ' rest , I asked him how it all worked .
The story got pretty good when he told me stories of all the cool Linux geeks working behind the scenes over at Eye - Fi , but sort of took a turn for the worse when I found out the SD cards require a software client that only runs on Mac or Windows .
When asked the obvious question of " Why not offer a Linux client ? " the answer was sadly , " No one uses Linux . "
But ... but ... I do !
I understand where companies like Eye - Fi are coming from .
There is a long tradition of knee - jerk answers of " That 's not our target market " or " our people do n't use Linux . "
Life on Antarctica moved by warming GLOBAL WARMING
Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Life on Antarctica moved by warming 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Scientists monitoring the effects of global warming in Antarctica report that rising temperatures have triggered a chain reaction that is rapidly altering the climate and the lives of plants and animals there .
Marine life is moving from one region to another along West Antarctica 's Palmer Peninsula as winds blow harder than they have in 30 years , cloud cover increases and the sea 's surface mixes more strongly with deeper water layers .
The sea changes are disrupting the lives and range of microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton , and the tiny animals called krill that feed on those plants are moving , too .
And because the krill are moving , the penguins that depend on the krill for food are also moving - and other species are replacing them along parts of the peninsula .
These effects on the food chain are being reported today in the journal Science by a team of oceanographers headed by Martin Montes - Hugo of Rutgers University in New Jersey .
" We 're seeing how the entire ecosystem down there is responding to the increasing temperatures , " said Sharon Stammerjohn , a UC Santa Cruz oceanographer and member of the team who had just returned from a 54 - day scientific cruise along the coasts of Antarctica 's Bellinghausen and Amundsen seas .
Data gathered from satellites , from the team 's own cruises aboard National Science Foundation icebreakers and from scientists from more than 20 other nations are telling the same story , said Montes - Hugo .
" The evidence tells us there 's been a big change in the food web over the last 30 years , and it 's happening all along the peninsula , " he said .
The long , curving Palmer Peninsula has long been a major focus of oceanography research - and even more so now that major ice shelves there are collapsing , sea ice is disappearing and ecological changes are becoming more evident .
The seas around the peninsula have been warming nearly five times faster than world - wide average temperature over the past 50 years and more rapidly than at any time during the past 500 years , the data show .
While the population of phytoplankton - the basis of the ocean 's food web - has decreased along the peninsula 's northern shores , its concentrations have increased in what the researchers call the southern " sub- regions , and other living organisms have followed the plankton .
This changing life could be a " harbinger of rapid change " for many other parts of the world , said Andrew Monaghan , a polar expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , who is not connected with the research team .
In a phone interview , Monaghan called the report " really important because it ties all the implications of global warming together in a biological chain of events - kind of like the canaries in a coal mine . "
A direct cause - and - effect relationship of the team 's findings is still unproven , Montes - Hugo said , but it 's clear that the changes in phytoplankton , krill and penguin distribution do resemble a chain reaction - much more so than what scientists often describe as a cascade of unrelated events , he said in an interview .
The changes are most marked in the waters of the Amundsen and Bellinghausen seas , where sea ice cover has been diminishing sharply , according to observations from the NASA satellite Sea Star , which has been in orbit surveying the world 's oceans for nearly a dozen years .
The shifting populations of penguin species over the past 50 years are linked closely to shifts in the distribution of phytoplankton and krill , the team reports .
Adelie penguin colonies , for example , depend primarily on krill for their food and have moved to where the krill has moved .
Meanwhile , Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins , whose diets favor small fish , squid and shrimp but do n't require krill , appear to be replacing the Adelie species habitats , according to the scientists ' data .
Montes - Hugo said his team is already gathering additional data for another detailed report seeking to understand more clearly each link in the chain of events , which is clearly triggered by what the group calls " a transition from a cold - dry polar - type climate to a warm - humid sub - Antarctic - type climate . "
With some exceptions , our public corporations are increasingly unable to compete globally , they pay excessive compensation to top brass and they are generally unaccountable to shareholders .
The best hope to change this situation is to allow shareholders the power to move the state of incorporation of public companies from one state to another .
For example , North Dakota passed a law in 2007 that , among other things , provides for proxy access and for the reimbursement of expenses to a shareholder who runs a successful proxy fight .
A move to North Dakota would greatly advance shareholder rights for any company .
But under current state law shareholders can elect to move their company to another jurisdiction only if the existing board of directors approves such a move  and those incumbent boards will want to stay in the management - friendly states they already inhabit .
Federal legislation could correct this absurdity and permit shareholders to move the corporations they own to another state by a simple majority vote .
Such legislation would override the restrictions of state laws that prevent such a change of jurisdiction unless approved by the board of directors .
Most important , it would encourage the states , which profit from the tax revenues that flow from corporations , to compete with one another by reorienting their laws on corporate governance to benefit shareholders .
The legal landscape is filled with devices designed by state legislators and courts to prevent shareholders from influencing how companies are run and so allow management free rein .
Legal mechanisms known as poison pills , permitted under the laws of most states , effectively prohibit shareholders from accumulating a large position in a company or working with other large shareholders to influence the company .
Furthermore , public corporations may legally adopt a staggered board , whereby board members are grouped into classes , with each one representing about a third of the total number of directors , so that only one class comes up for election in a year .
This means that seriously shaking up a board would require at least two very expensive proxy contests over two years .
And current state laws permit incumbent board members access to the corporate treasury , allowing them to spend millions of dollars , to hire lawyers and public relations firms , run ads and mail materials to prevent shareholders from adding their designees to the board of directors .
The problem of disenfranchised shareholders can be found at the root of today ’s financial crisis .
A.I.G. , for example , sowed the seeds of its own near - destruction by making a wholesale rush into risky derivative transactions without adequate collateral .
Its board of directors was either unaware of it or did not stop it .
If shareholders had enhanced legal rights to elect qualified and responsible board members , it would help our public corporations avoid the kinds of meltdowns we are now experiencing .
We can hope that the government ’s experience with A.I.G. will demonstrate to Congress how little power shareholders actually have , and how important corporate governance reform is .
It is time to remove the many devices that managements use to entrench their power , and give shareholders real power .
The “ ownership ” rights that the government , as a shareholder , is now talking about are the same ones that activist shareholders have been demanding for years .
A judge sides with the ACLU demanding the CIA produce an in camera review of all redacted documents relating to the destruction of evidence of torture .
Just a simple question : why do you thnk the government destroyed tapes that show its allegedly non-torture of terror suspects ?
The same reason they were appalled when the Abu Ghraib photos leaked .
If the public realized that Bush 's official policy was as bad as and even worse than what we saw at Abu Ghraib , he might have to face the fact of his war crimes .

The Serious Fraud Office has started a " preliminary inquiry " into American insurance firm AIG 's London operation , founded by Joseph Cassano who spearheaded the group 's ill - fated move into complex debt derivatives .
The insurer , now in effect 80 % owned by the US government , became one of the biggest casualties of the credit crunch last September when it was forced to seek an $ 85 bn ( £ 59 bn ) emergency credit facility from the Federal Reserve .
Democratic congressman John Sarbanes later said of Cassano : " It seems he single - handedly brought AIG to its knees . "
The SFO said it was focused on AIG Financial Products , a Connecticut - headquartered business which did much of its business out of offices based in Mayfair , London 's hedge fund district .
The AIG - FP division , along with investment bank JP Morgan , was one of the pioneers of " credit default swaps " ( CDSs ) — in effect writing insurance against loan defaults .
Set up by Cassano , who ran it until he left in March , AIG - FP wrote billions of dollars of CDSs , largely insuring against potential default rates on parcels of corporate debt and home loans known as " collateralised debt obligations " ( CDOs ) .
Between 2004 and 2007 the notional value of CDS contracts across the global markets ballooned from $ 8.4tr to $ 62tr .
London was a major hub for the trade .
AIG - FP reportedly paid staff $ 3.56 bn in the last seven years .
The unit had 377 people .
AIG -FP is understood to have frequently booked income from CDS contracts as soon as it was received , believing the prospect of default rates rising dramatically to be extremely remote .
In August 2007 Cassano said : " It is hard for us , without being flippant , to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions . "
But soaring default rates within CDOs caused by the subprime mortgage crisis brought about a dramatic financial meltdown at AIG .
After his departure Cassano was retained by AIG as a consultant and paid $ 1 m a month .
The SFO 's inquiries are being conducted in co-operation with the Financial Services Authority and with US authorities , which are probing the same business .
In November AIG told shareholders " certain public disclosures , transactions and practices of AIG and its subsidiaries " were being reviewed by the SEC and the Department of Justice .
Investors were told attention has been focused on " AIG 's valuation of and disclosures relating to the AIG - FP super senior credit default swap portfolio " .
The SEC has given written notice to some AIG employees telling them they are the subject of an investigation and could face censure .
The insurer has made clear it believes similar notices could be sent out to more staff and former staff .
SFO director Richard Alderman said : " It is right for us to look into the UK operations … to determine if there has been criminal conduct .
We will use our full range of powers to seek information , to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company 's operations . "
It is the second time in as many months that the SFO has made public its early - stage inquiries into the actions of companies where there is offered co-operation with US and other overseas prosecutors on a private basis .
Alderman has made clear he intends to use these requests for help as a platform to raise the SFO 's profile .
AIG said it would co-operate fully with the SFO .
It understands the inquiry is not related to AIG 's foreign or domestic insurance businesses .
In a statement , it said : " As previously disclosed , AIG began the process of unwinding certain of AIG - FP's and its subsidiaries ' businesses and portfolios , including those in the UK , late last year . "

So I did mention something about health and / or diet food in my last post , and while this recipe is the latter , it is most certainly not to be confused with the former .
I posted about my rainbow cake here , and it got a lot of traffic on over to my livejournal , and everyone wanted the “ recipe . ”
The cool thing is that if you ’re making something so distractingly colourful , people will think it ’s delicious no matter what .
This presents me with the option to use an old Weight Watchers trick — the one - point cupcake .
Except I ’m making a cake and I created my own frosting .
Kinda .
I ’ve seen it done before , but I swear I made it up first !
This cake is suitable for many occasions :
A child ’s birthday
Your mom ’s birthday
Coming out to your conservative parents
If you ’re a lesbian , they ’ll be thrilled that you wo n’t be forgoing your feminine kitchen duties .
If you ’re the kind of gay dude who makes cakes for your parents , they were probably on to you anyway .
Coming out to your conservative parents on your mother ’s birthday
Your friend ’s jam band CD release party
. . . so I ’m sure you ’ll find a use for this recipe soon .
And of course , you can use any white cake recipe you ’d like .
This is just how I make it because I have delusions of wearing size 2 someday .
Oh yes , and do me a favour : DOUBLE THE RECIPE AS PHOTOGRAPHED HERE !!
The recipe at the bottom is accurate , but this made for a really REALLY small cake , and there was not nearly enough frosting , especially considering its lightness .
Okay , on with the ingredients .
That ’s all .
Notice the lack of fat in here ?
Mmmmmm . . . chemicals .
Though I do n’t need to defend my method thanks to the double - dub ( WW ) aspect , even when I make a “ real ” cake I usually use box mix because let ’s face it :
Betty ’s been doing it way longer than I have , and has pretty much perfected the art .
Pour a can of soda ( 12 oz ) 2 - 12 oz cans of soda into the cake mix two boxes of cake mix .
No eggs , no oil , no water , no sweat .
The action shots were n’t too thrilling .
Now we measure it .
I ’m going to round to 30 oz 60 oz because I have six colours and is n’t that just too convenient ?
It worked out to 3/4 c 1.5 c per colour , measurementwise .
So I divvied that up and used my gel colours .
( the gel colours , while not as good as pigment dye , are much bolder than the very liquidy food colouring you probably grew up with )
The first colour you drop into the pan , use about 2/3 of the mix for that colour .
Otherwise , the top ( last ) colour will really dominate .
I used a heaping 1/4 c 1 cup of each colour .
Drop the colours , one by one , into the middle of the pan , in neat concentric - ish gobs .
Remember the cake is going to be sliced in the side there , so mixing it around on top is n’t going to make your slices any more psychedelic ( trust me , I did the three - dimensional thinking for you already ) .
When you ’re three colours in , start doing the reverse with the other pan .
Since I ’m going in rainbow order : red , orange , yellow , green , blue , purple , I got from red to yellow in the first pan , then purple , blue , green in the second .
This is so that your two pans are equal if your measurements are n’t exact ( and they ’re not likely to be ) .
Now finish up .
Follow the box ’s baking instructions and do your dishes .
Such lovely dishes !
Now for the frosting : 1 box 2 boxes of fat free sugar free pudding mix , and 8 oz 16 oz ( two of the 8 oz tubs pictured ) of fat - free whipped topping .
Or sugar - free .
Or light .
Or regular .
They ’re all pretty much the same .
But that ’s it .
Holy shit , the cake ’s done !
Toothpick clean and everything !
Get that shit out of the oven !!!
The purple top kind of made a little turkey silhouette .
The frosting will be a little tough to spread , so treat it like a buttercream ( I guess , I ’ve never frosted a cake with buttercream ) .
Putting gobs all over , then smoothing in worked well for me .
And look at that thing !
It ’s so pretty - lookin .
Here ’s what this particular cake looked like .
See how it ’s tiny and too rounded and it kind of is n’t all that great ?
That ’s because I did n’t double the recipe .
It ’s a mistake I ’ll only make once .
Here ’s what that really should look like : same process , twice the batter .
Mmmmm .
Sunny Day Rainbow Cake
2 boxes white cake mix
24 oz of clear diet soda ( 2 cans , ginger ale and sprite work well )
gel food colouring
16 oz whipped topping
2 oz instant fat - free sugar - free pudding mix ( 2 smallish boxes )
The Dieting
Mix the cake mix with the soda according to regular instructions on box .
It will be lumpy afterward .
Again , you can use any white cake recipe you want , this is just how I do it .
The Rainbowing
Measure the total volume ( by my estimate , 64 oz ) , then divide by 6 and measure into separate bowls .
There are 8 oz in a cup , so 64/6 = 10 to 11 oz , or 1 cup + 2 tbsp .
Stir colour into each bowl with its own spoon .
For the first colour into the pan , measure out 2/3 to 3 / 4 of your mix ( in this case about 1 c ) as close to the middle as you can .
Drop in your first three colours , then work on the other pan with the last three colours .
So if you ’re doing rainbow order , the first pan should have red , then orange , then yellow , and now the purple , blue and green go into the second pan .
As a recap , this is so both layers are roughly the same size .
Bake the cake for however long the box tells you to bake it .
Check it when the box says to , but usually it ’ll need an extra 5 or 10 minutes or maybe more because of the density of the soda method .
Just keep baking , checking back every 5 minutes or so until a toothpick to the center comes out clean .
Let cool completely before moving to a wire rack .
The Frostinging
Meanwhile , make your frosting .
Just mix the pudding mix in with the whipped topping for a few minutes .
Dye if you ’re into that .
Frost your fat - free cake with your fat - free whipped frosting .
Eat .
Edit 1 ( one week later )
People seemed to miss the point that I am a 25 - year - old woman on a diet with no kids .
Since kids do n’t really need fat - free anything , there ’s no need to use the soda recipe if you do n’t like the idea , and if you do n’t like dye , do n’t make this for dinner for them every night for a month .
Okay , folks , thanks for the allowance to disclaim .
Edit 2 ( two weeks later )
WW has long advertised 1/12 of a cake mix with diet soda to be a “ one point cupcake . ”
I have no idea why they insist this is the case when according to the “ as packaged ” nutrition information , this much cupcake has 170 calories , 3g fat and no fiber . . . by my calculation , that ’s 4 points .
That said , 1/12 of this recipe , ( 2 box mixes + 16 oz whipped topping + 2 oz or so pudding mix ) works out to 10 points a slice .
Not bad considering that a comparable cake would be 14 points .

( CNN ) --
Two key senators Tuesday announced a plan to impose a hefty tax on retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money or in which the United States has an equity interest .
Sens .
Max Baucus , left , and Chuck Grassley , announced a plan to tax bonuses for executives that received bailouts .
Sens .
Max Baucus , D - Montana , and Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa -- the chairman and top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee -- said companies would not be allowed to restructure the payments to those executives through deferred compensation to avoid the tax .
The senators plan comes after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that this year , after receiving federal bailout money , AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $ 1 million each .
Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company .
The largest bonus paid was $ 6.4 million ; seven other people also received more than $ 4 million each .
AIG is under fire for awarding the bonuses while being kept afloat by more than $ 170 billion from the U.S. government 's financial bailout .
Watch congressional reaction to AIG bonuses »
In a letter to congressional leaders Tuesday , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said administration lawyers agreed the government could not force AIG to stop the bonuses .
But , he said , the government would contractually require AIG to repay Treasury the $ 165 million in bonuses it paid out .
Grassley and Baucus said all retention bonuses would be subject to a 35 percent excise tax for excessive compensation to be paid by the company and an additional 35 percent tax to be paid by the individual .
" Millions of Americans are losing their jobs -- millions .
And to some degree they 're losing their jobs because of actions taken by some of these firms , " Baucus said .
" At the same time , they 're giving themselves bonuses .
I mean , give me a break .
What are these people thinking ?
That 's part of the problem .
They 're not thinking . "
All other nonretention bonuses more than $ 50,000 would be subject to the same tax , the senators said .
" We 're trying to address what I think taxpayers would say is salt in their wounds , " Grassley said .
" The taxpayers are bearing a great deal to get this economy going , help get these corporations turned around , and I think taxpayers are willing to help .
" But when they see the lack of sensitivity on the part of corporate directors -- by giving these bonuses and doing other outrageous things -- there 's just so much that the taxpayers of this country are going to stand for . "
The provisions would apply to bonuses paid out after January 1 , 2009 , so it would affect the AIG bonuses in question .

" We should not be here .
We should not be in this position , " Baucus said .
" AIG should not have promised those payments to retain those employees and the Treasury should have blocked the issuance of the checks .
It did not .
And employees themselves should not have cashed them in .
We should not be here , but unfortunately we are . "
Senior Finance Committee aides said the senators had not yet worked out whether individuals would pay income tax on the bonuses as well as the proposed excise tax , or if a combination of the two would be used .

" You 'll have to wait to see when we introduce the legislation , " one of the aides said .
" If our bosses had made a decision we'd tell you what it was , " said another .

On Monday President Obama said he planned to attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG , payments he described as an " outrage . "
Obama said he asked Geithner to " pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . "
Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again .

The president spared Liddy from criticism , saying he got the job " after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . "
But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics .
" It 's about our fundamental values , " he said .

Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or " retention payments " -- by at least 30 percent .
That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan , however .
In the House , Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses .
They 're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses , a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday .
The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses , which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September , according to the committee aide .
Who 's insured by AIG ? »
Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses .
Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets .

All About Timothy Geithner • American International Group Inc .
… is an irreparable setback for Venezuela ’s economic development .
It took President Hugo Chavez and his corrupt , incompetent gang of Bolivarian “ revolutionaries ” less than a decade to ruin two generations of extraordinary industrial growth in Bolivar state .
The first time Caracas Gringo visited Ciudad Guayana in 1978 , the Matanzas Industrial District where the basic steel and aluminum industries are located was the largest contiguous cluster of industrial construction projects then under way anywhere in Latin America , and perhaps the world .
The total combined capital expenditure on these projects was about $ 25 billion in 1978 prices .
Sidor ’s Plan IV steel expansion was under way in 1978 .
Ferrominera was expanding its iron mining operations and adding pelletization capacity in Puerto Ordaz .
Venalum ’s aluminum smelter was being built in 1978 as were Interalumina and Carbonorca .
Alcasa was completing an expansion , and making new plans to install Line V in the early 1980s .
Edelca was in the final stage of the Guri Dam ’s construction .
Several hundred privately - owned metalmechanics companies were setting up operations in the region .
The Guayana region was also rich in reserves of gold and other rare metals , topped only by South Africa and Russia .
International market intelligence firms that follow the ferrous , non-ferrous and precious / rare metals industries worldwide singled out Venezuela in the 1980s - 1990s as an emerging world - class exporter of iron , steel , aluminum , gold and other metals .
Ciudad Guayana –consisting of the Puerto Ordaz - San Felix twin cities – was a boom town in 1978 .
Today Ciudad Guayana is a vast rusting junkyard of wasted opportunities and lost dreams .
After ten years of Chavez ’s interminable Bolivarian destructiveness , all of the state - owned basic industries in Ciudad Guayana are collapsing , without a single exception .
All of Ciudad Guayana ’s essential public services have collapsed , including electricity , education , health care and law enforcement .
The residents of San Felix suffer more frequent and longer lasting power blackouts than practically any other city in Venezuela , yet the Guri Dam is less than 100 km away .
San Felix was a small , poor community at the confluence of the Orinoco and Caroni rivers in the 1960s when the development of Guayana was launched by Romulo Betancourt ( who actually carried forward a series of projects already begun with foreign investment during the military regime of Marcos Perez Jimenez ) .
San Felix grew apace with the expansion of the basic industries in Puerto Ordaz – the CVG Group of power , iron / steel and aluminum producers which were marketed by successive Ad and Copei governments as a vital cornerstone of Venezuela ’s long - term plans to diversify its export base away from mostly petroleum .
But the CVG is now in the process of being chopped to pieces by Chavez , who before moving in 2008 to dismember the CVG deliberately neglected for a decade to maintain the basic ( i.e. strategic ) industrial capacity that existed when he came to power – and now San Felix is also falling apart as a result .
Chavez already moved hydropower utility Edelca last year from the CVG group over to Corpoelec , which in turn reports directly to the energy minister .
Chavez also plans to move Sidor ( nationalized last year ) and Ferrominera from CVG over to the newly created Socialist Steel Corporation ( CorpoAcero ) .
Reportedly , Venalum , Bauxilum and Carbonorca will be moved in coming weeks from CVG to the newly created Socialist Aluminum Corporation ( CorpoAluminio ) .
It ’s unclear what moving these companies over to CorpoAluminio will accomplish , since Bauxilum and carbonorca are operating at less than 50 % of capacity due to little / no maintenance spending
But Alcasa apparently is beyond salvation .
There are persistent but unconfirmed reports that Chavez plans to break up Alcasa into three or four components restructured as Empresas de Production Social ( i.e. worker cooperatives without a hope of ever breaking even ) .
However , chopping up Alcasa wo n’t be cheap .
The company owes its local and foreign suppliers , plus Bauxilum , Carbonorca and Edelca close to $ 1.5 billion .
Moreover , since the parts of Alcasa the government reportedly wants to “ rescue ” need at most only 500 workers , which means some 2,500 workers must be fired .
Alcasa ’s current president , Cesar Aguilar , says Venezuela ’s oldest smelter can be saved with an injection of $ 1.5 billion .
But Aguilar ’s optimism requires a caveat : he does n’t know anything about the aluminum business , and likely could n’t even find aluminum foil in a supermarket without asking a grocery clerk for directions as to which aisle the foil is in .
However , Aguilar is adamant about one thing : he is a proven revolutionary .
Basic Industries and Mining Minister Rodolfo
Sanz says the government has a rescue plan almost ready , any day now it will be announced .
What ’s the bottom line ?
Sanz says the plan will require “ everyone … to make sacrifices . ”
A guesstimate of the “ sacrifices ” the regime will impose : ( a ) Suppliers / creditors will be required to slash 30 - 50 % off their bills , and ( b ) workers will be required to abandon claims for payment of past - due debts owed by the government , accept steep pay / benefits cuts .
It ’s likely that several thousands of CVG workers also will be fired from their jobs … by the very revolution which guaranteed lifetime employment for the Bolivarian faithful .
By the time the labor purge is over , the traditional unions will be broken , their ranks decimated , and new chavista unions will be “ recognized ” by the Labor Ministry .
There was plenty of talk about the risks of President Obama appearing on the Tonight Show .
One simple mistake could dominate the conversation the next morning .
The last thing President Obama needed was a gaffe .
He made one .
Special Olympics
In a lighthearted conversation , President Obama told Jay Leno that he recently bowled a 129 at the White House bowling alley .
" Very good , " Leno said sarcastically .
“ It was like Special Olympics or something , ” Obama replied .
Realizing the potential magnitude of the mistake , the White House addressed the president 's remark to reporters aboard Air Force One .
" The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics , " Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton told reporters .
" He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world . "

Apple is , according to a " Korean Mole " , readying OLED - screened iPhones to be sold this year .
The rumor comes via Reg Hardware , which points out that :
It ’s worth noting that the source of the rumour is Korea , because Korean firm LG last year signed a $ 500 m agreement with Apple last year to supply it with unspecified types of displays until 2013 .
Normally such small rumors would be filed for later use , but with the recent announcement of the 3.0 iPhone OS and the summer fast approaching ( The next iPhone – if Apple follows the pattern of recent years – should be announced at the end of June ) , we ’ve been wondering just what Apple might add to the next iteration of the hardware .
Last year , it was obvious .
The iPhone lacked both a 3G radio and GPS .
Those were added , along with a slimmer body .
This year , there is no clear upgrade path .
Perhaps a better camera with a few more pixels ( but please , not too many ) and maybe video capability .
Otherwise , what is there to add ?
An OLED screen would make sense .
It uses less power , looks better and runs brighter , so this rumor has a ring of the truth about it .
Otherwise , we expect little more than some re-styling , a faster processor and more memory .
Think about it .
The iPhone and the iPod Touch are more of a computing platform than phones or iPods .
Apple only offers major redesigns of its computers every few years , with incremental , internal upgrades in between .
We ’d say the iPhone will go the same way .

IE 8 still does not resize text sized in pixels
As most accessibility and usability aware web professionals know , Internet Explorer does not by default allow the user to increase the size of text whose size has been specified in CSS pixels .
Some believe that is in fact the correct behaviour , while others ( me included ) think IE should do what all other browsers do – give the end user complete control over text size without having to change obscure browser settings .
Almost two years ago I posted IE 7 does not resize text sized in pixels .
I was hoping that IE 8 would change that , but apparently not – not even in “ super standards mode ” .
Yes , there is full page zoom ( which works much better in IE 8 than in IE 7 ) , but the controls for resizing text only are still there , and they still do not work when pixels or an absolute unit has been used .
Text resizing that only works on some websites has to be very confusing for end users , so I really do n’t understand why Microsoft does n’t either remove the text resize functionality completely or make it work regardless of which unit has been used to specify text size .
Obama ’s signature initiatives won major funding in the compromise stimulus package Congress passed Friday .
Obama proposals mostly intact in bill
Most of President Obama ’s signature initiatives won major funding in the compromise stimulus package Congress passed Friday , further tying the legislation to the president in a way that could benefit him if the economy recovers — and hurt him if it does n’t .
In a compromise hammered out between House and Senate negotiators , some of Obama ’s proposals did take a haircut , but mostly a trim .

The “ Making Work Pay ” tax cut , a central plank of Obama ’s campaign platform , was scaled back by about 20 percent .
Obama saw his proposals for tax rollbacks of $ 500 per individual and $ 1000 per couple slimmed down to $ 400 and $ 800 respectively in the final version .
In a visit to the Energy Department last week , Obama touted his plan to convert the federal fleet to hybrid vehicles .
“ It will not only save the government significant money over time , it will not only create manufacturing jobs for folks who are making these cars , it will set a standard for private industry to match , ” he said .
The president was indignant towards Republicans who portrayed the program as pork .
“ Are these folks serious ?
Is it any wonder that we have n't had a real energy policy in this country ? ”
In the end , the $ 600 million the House set aside for the project was halved to $ 300 million , as the Senate proposed .
But that loss was more the exception than the rule .
“ In my mind , Obama basically did n’t have to compromise at all .
The only substantial tax cut in it is an Obama tax cut .
It is n’t even a Republican tax cut , ” Chris Edwards , a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute said .
Asked about the changes Senate moderates insisted on , many of which were watered down in the conference , Edwards , said , “ I think that ’s small - potatoes type of stuff . ”
Asked if the final bill has Obama ’s imprint on it , Will Straw of the liberal Center for American Progress said , “ Absolutely , it ’s in his visions … .
Its all there in rough proportions . ”
Straw said the Senate did n’t manage to make major changes to the House plan , which was closest to Obama ’s plan .
“ The original House plan had a third of the cost in tax measures .
The conference plan is 35 percent tax measures , in that ball park , ” Straw said .
Still , some advocates for programs Obama has touted were bitter over with the final results .
Advocates for classroom technology were disturbed that the $ 1 billion set aside for that purpose in both the House and Senate bills was slashed by more than a third in the final legislation .
“ This essentially takes the investment in leadership for change in classrooms below even a reasonable down payment on leadership for change , ” said Don Knezek of the International Society for Technology in Education .
“ $ 650 million is sufficient to establish digital age learning environments in fewer than 8 percent of the… high economic need classrooms in this country , ” he said .
Here ’s a list of items frequently touted by Obama and how they fared in the recent negotiations :

Can money make us happy if we spend it on the right purchases ?
A new psychology study suggests that buying life experiences rather than material possessions leads to greater happiness for both the consumer and those around them .
The findings will be presented at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology annual meeting on Feb .
7 .
The study demonstrates that experiential purchases , such as a meal out or theater tickets , result in increased well - being because they satisfy higher order needs , specifically the need for social connectedness and vitality -- a feeling of being alive .
" These findings support an extension of basic need theory , where purchases that increase psychological need satisfaction will produce the greatest well - being , " said Ryan Howell , assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University .
Participants in the study were asked to write reflections and answer questions about their recent purchases .
Participants indicated that experiential purchases represented money better spent and greater happiness for both themselves and others .
The results also indicate that experiences produce more happiness regardless of the amount spent or the income of the consumer .
Experiences also lead to longer - term satisfaction .
" Purchased experiences provide memory capital , " Howell said .
" We do n't tend to get bored of happy memories like we do with a material object .
" People still believe that more money will make them happy , even though 35 years of research has suggested the opposite , " Howell said .
" Maybe this belief has held because money is making some people happy some of the time , at least when they spend it on life experiences . "
" The mediators of experiential purchases : Determining the impact of psychological need satisfaction " was conducted by Ryan Howell , assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and SF State graduate Graham Hill .

After a long hiatus from Classes and Careers , I am back !
Somewhere in India or Connecticut , my fan club of three people is celebrating alone at their computers .
Seriously , it ’s nice to be back in blogging .
But let ’s get to the real reason the other 99.99999998 percent of you are here .
I started talking recession a year ago , back when all of the talking heads on Fox , CNN , and MSNBC were telling the American public things should be on the upswing by now .
They predicted that it would never descend into a full - blown recession , just a little dip was all .
I just want to take this opportunity to point out : I was right !
That ’s all .
Ego satisfiedâ€ ¦
By now , most of us are asking :
What will become of my job ?
What will happen to our economy ?
The nation ’s economists , even the more conservative ones , are prophesying a lot of gloom and doom for the next three years .
With unemployment rising above 7 percent , this is a good time to think about back - up plans .
We need to face the fact that traditional employment ( 9 to 5 , punch in , punch out , get paycheck , get benefits ) may no longer be sufficient .
The paychecks and benefits may be shrinking ; your bills will certainly be rising .
Meaning : you need supplemental income .
Luckily , opportunities abound for freelance work .
Whether you have a secret life as a writer , a programmer , a graphic artist , an accountant , a carpenter , or a typist , now is the time to put those extra skills to work .
As the economy declines and more companies look to cut costs , freelancers will begin to look a lot more attractive than full - time employees , who cost more in benefits , overhead , and down time .
In fact , many economists are predicting a huge rise in demand for freelance work .
Get ahead of that wave now while everyone else is reeling .
Find work you can do on the side and start to build your client base .
If you do lose your job , you will at least have a cushion of extra income ; at best , you will have created a new full - time opportunity for yourself , one where you control your schedule and workload .
Good luck to you , recession fighters !

In the hundreds of emails I ’ve received over the issue of intellectual property , the number one most common objection to doing without goes like this .
We ca n’t subject the matters to free market competition .
Some innovations are too easy to copy .
Just one look or listen and the producer ’s idea is taken from .
Then another company that had nothing to do with bearing the costs of innovation will be able to reap the rewards .
We have to have a period of monopoly if only to inspire people to innovate and bring things to market .
Now , consider first what a central - planning apparatus this entails .
A vibrant and enterprising economy will consist of hundreds if not millions of innovations per day .
Our work lives , no matter what field we are in , are all about doing things better , bringing better products to the world , stepping forward into a future in which ever better stuff is ever more affordable .
That requires unrelenting innovation .
If you are to establish a government office to keep tabs on this activity , that alone is going to require massive bureaucracy .
If the bureaucracy is charged with granting monopolies for all these things , the business of enterprise is going to find itself in an amazing tangle .
If we find that society works at all , it is precisely due to the absence of such tangles .
Consider also what the above critic presumes about how markets work in a world without intellectual monopolies .
Consumers all sit around wanting something and wanting to pay for it .
It could be a new song or a cool painting or something as simple as a q-tip .
Entrepreneurs all over the country know that consumers want these things but they refuse to bring them to market for fear of being copied by the next guy .
As a result , everyone just sits around doing nothing .
Is this really a realistic scenario ?
All experience suggests that in a vibrant economy , entrepreneurs go looking for unmet demands .
This is what they live for .
IP is not necessary to bring about this result , else there would not have been any economic growth in the entire world until recent years when IP began to its march to ubiquity .
All these arguments really come to down to yet another market failure argument , the idea that unless the government comes to the rescue , market players will just sit around confused while the economy goes down the drain .
All market failure arguments have the appearance of plausibility about them .
Let ’s say you have a poorly managed apartment unit with a porchlight that is out .
Everyone would benefit from having the bulb changed .
But if one person benefits , so does everyone .
All dwellers enjoy the light and only one pays .
That ’s not going to work , is it ?
No one would act .
Except that at some point , someone comes along and befuddles the failure theorists by changing the lightbulb .
So it is with markets and innovation .
It is just a plain fact that many products come to us every day that are not patented .
Look at a Kleenex , I mean , a facial tissue .
Any paper manufacturer can make one .
The Kleenex company was first to make the big time , and it has stayed on top through relentless innovation in design .
So we have fancy boxes of every shape and size , tissues with oil in them , tissues with smells , and various colors and things .
The company is still on top .
Boldrin and Levine give the example of TravelPro , the suitcase with wheels .
Every company can replicate it .
But TravelPro stays on top through new design and marketing .
Everyone has to marvel at how Arm and Hammer stays on top of the baking soda market .
Talk about easy to replicate .
And yet the company practically has a market monopoly , and has held it for many decades .
The innovation here too is relentless : toothpaste , deodorant , cleaning products , you name it .
You can try this at home .
Think of any company that has an open - source product that continues to make money and stay up top : Tupperware , Red Hat , Band Aid , Firefox , Tylenol , Bayer , Hershey .
It is a long list , nearly infinite .
The competition is fierce .
How do they deal with it ?
The model is always the same .
Get there first .
Stay on top through marketing .
Count on brand loyalty .
Innovate .
Explain your superiority .
Never rest on your laurels .
Move forward and watch the competition carefully .
It is interesting because another market failure argument posits even that there is a reverse problem than the one used to defend IP .
It suggests that the market has a “ path dependence ” problem , that once people get stuck on one technology or brand name , they have too high a hump to get over in order to move to one that is otherwise obviously superior .
Both ca n’t be true .
The defenses of IP share a trait in common with all claims that the free market can’t work .
Hayek called it a kind of constructivism .
We ca n’t imagine how a market might solve a particular problem so we conclude that the market must fail in this instance .
It ’s good to look outside the window and observe how the market solves the problem every day in ways we do n’t expect .
There are a thousand possibilities for how producers deal with being copied even in digital media .
If we open the market up to competition , we will see more innovation in book publishing and movie making , as ever more goodies are piled on the consumer to earn loyalty and a range of options are made available .
Consumers win , competitive producers win , and all without government privilege .

The Best of Jeffrey Tucker
When I was a little kid growing up in Cleveland all I needed to enjoy myself was candy and sunshine .
If I could be outside on a clear day shoving handfuls of Skittles down my gullet then all was right with the world .
Now that I ’m grown up I realize that at times life can be a complete and utter beatdown .
But , frankly , I ’m sick of thinking that everyone is stupid and that everything blows .
So in the spirit of the New Year I ’ve decided that I will no longer bitch about … well … everything .
Life is too short and 2008 was too shitty .
So I ’ve decided to lobotomize myself and enjoy all the crappiness in the world .
You can find goodness in everything …if you just self - medicate yourself enough .
So from now on here are the new things that will make me happy : AMERCAN IDOL – those kids are just singing their hearts out , doggone it !
AUTO VOX – it ’s cool that every song on the radio sounds robotic !
THE HILLS – it sure looks real to me !
TWILIGHT – a vampire movie with no sex and no violence ?
Ca n’t wait for the sequel !
US WEEKLY – I must know what my favorite celebrities really look like when they buy coffee !
RED BULL AND VODKA – trendy drinks that cost ten bucks at a bar ?
Yum !
TWITTER –
It ’s awesome knowing what everyone ’s doing at all times of the day !
BRITNEY SPEARS ’ COMEBACK – I was worried that she was fading .
Thank God she ’s back !
SKINNY JEANS – they ’re not any worse than acid wash !
IPHONES – I ’m glad people can buy it at Walmart for $ 200 less than I bought it .
That ’s democracy in action !
FOX NEWS – they really do care about truth in journalism !
Just ask them !
MILF PORN – seeing old broads get plowed is really hot !
Okay , who , the fuck am I bullshitting ?
All of the above blows a bag of donkey dicks .
Quick , who ’s got an extra- large , family - size bag of Skittles !?
Although it had a long gestation period , through a series of aboriginal settlements and the construction of a French fort here in 1720 , Toronto was officially born 175 years ago today .
That 's when a small community , known as the Town of York , was formally incorporated as the City of Toronto .
Much has changed since March 6 , 1834 .
A municipality of fewer than 10,000 people , mainly from the British Isles , has blossomed into a city of more than 2.5 million , with residents from virtually every country on the planet .
Today and over the weekend , Toronto celebrates that transformation though songs , poetry , film screenings , photography displays , theatrical performances , a book festival , historical exhibits , re-enactments and more .
Entry to all eight of the city 's historic museums will be free this weekend .
And a new commemorative book about Toronto is being launched at City Hall .
In something of a time warp , Mayor David Miller is to debate Toronto 's radical first mayor , William Lyon Mackenzie , played by actor Eric Peterson , better known as Oscar Leroy on television 's Corner Gas .
( One wonders if Peterson will manage to resist deploying Oscar 's favourite term for detractors : " Jackass . " )
In another re-enactment , the Queen 's Own Rifles are to demonstrate a 19th century military skirmish using Nathan Phillips Square as a battlefield .
This all serves as a useful reminder of the abundant history that lies quite literally in our own backyard .
And there 's more to come .
Three years from now , in 2012 , Toronto will have an opportunity to mark the 175th anniversary of the Rebellion of 1837 , when an armed mob led by former mayor Mackenzie charged down Yonge St. in a doomed effort to topple the provincial government .
An even more important anniversary will be marked in three years : the bicentennial of the War of 1812 , in which an American invasion was repelled .
Had the invasion succeeded , we would now all be Americans .
That conflict saw the destruction of Fort York and the looting of this municipality ( in retaliation for which the White House was burned in Washington ) .
Two decades after the end of the War of 1812 , and fully recovered from its ravages , Toronto was incorporated as the first city in the colony of Upper Canada .
Its boundaries were marked by the shore of Lake Ontario , Bathurst St. on the west , Dundas St. on the north , and Parliament St. on the east .
Today the city encompasses a territory more than 100 times that size , and it serves as the hub of one of the biggest and most dynamic urban regions in North America – the Greater Toronto Area .
Residents seldom stand still to consider how much and how quickly Toronto has changed over the 175 years .
That 's understandable amid the many more immediate cares and concerns of everyday life .
But commemorating historical events like Toronto 's 175th anniversary provides an opportunity for us to gather and stand where others stood before us .
Remembering the past is a useful step toward moving forward together .
Proof Microsoft could 've done whatever it wanted with Windows 7 and people would 've swallowed it , as long as it's pretty : People told a demo of KDE 4 was Windows 7 were amazed .

Take 5 minutes to enjoy this satirical ride with Grey Lens Man as he takes you through the very real challenge he faced bringing new technology into a large company .
He starts with " You see , I have a small problem - 3 million lines of RPG and COBOL , 5,500 logical and physical files on a few AS400s " and it has got to be replaced .
He reveals the magnitude of the beast and explains how the group set about slaying it ; the heresy of using Scala ; how Java programmers came to like it .
And an in - the - face reminder that " he who dares wins " .
You will see the solution to a current problem , but much more valuable , the insight and tools he plans to use for solving the next ones too .
And it 's just plain fun !
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Welcome to the new Mother Jones .
With any luck , you wo n’t have much more of a reaction at this point than “ Oh , that ’s nice . ”
You , dear user , are blissfully oblivious to the hand - wringing , bitch - slapping , hair - pulling , and general angst that goes into a redesign .
But perhaps you ’ll find it mildly amusing to learn why we decided to do what we did — and how you might get a better user experience out of it .
Why did we relaunch ?
The first answer is obvious — the look and feel of the site had worn out its welcome .
We were sick of it , and we ’re pretty sure you were , too .
At a deeper level , its constraints did n’t match the extra reporting and blogging firepower we ’ve built up over the past two years as we ’ve dramatically expanded our in - house investigative team , including an eight - person Washington bureau .
What you ’re looking at now is cleaner , less cluttered , and , we hope , far more inviting — a much better vehicle for the volume of fresh content we publish every day .
It also has a more efficient software back end , which means that people here can spend more time on journalism and less on clunky code .
We also built it open source — in Drupal , specifically — which means that the basic code that runs Mother Jones is available to anyone , anywhere ; we ’ll also put some of our custom work back into the public domain so other people can use it to build their own projects .
That ’s a cool thing , and we think Mary Harris Jones would have liked it .
( And if any of you Drupal coders wanna build an app for MoJo , that ’d be beyond awesome . )
But we ’ve gone beyond design and code improvements and tried to imagine a whole new way of using our journalism .
Our aha moment came a year and a half ago , when we ran a story called “ School of Shock , ” an exposé of an “ educational ” institution for children with mental and behavioral problems that uses painful electric shocks as punishment .
As it happened , we ’d just added very rudimentary comments functionality to our articles .
Undeterred by the hideous interface ( no threading , no paragraph breaks even ) , hundreds of readers registered outrage .
You dug deep into the primary documents we ’d posted , pulling out details from page 63 of some obscure court brief .
Some of you defended the school ; many more wanted to find a way to shut it down .
And then you did something we ’d never seen at a news site :
You began to use the comments to post ideas about what to do , about how and where to take action .
With no prompting or assistance , you organized .
Before we knew it , investigations were launched in three states .
That ’s when the lightbulb went on .
Whenever we ’ve done surveys , one thing has always jumped out of the data about our reader demographics ( you ’re a little more gender balanced than audiences of other political magazines ) and lifestyle habits ( you love wine and cats ) .
And that is that you get involved — at a level that ’s far above average , whether by volunteering for community organizations or by actively participating in national politics .
We ’ve shied away from playing to this trait directly — first , because that ’s really not the role of journalism , and second , because we believe you do n’t want to be told what to do ; you want the information , and you ’ll take it from there .
But “ School of Shock ” showed us another option .
How about giving you the possibility of doing something about the stories we report on , not by hectoring or preaching , but simply by making the tools available ?
The result is our new community system .
It ’s a 2009 - worthy commenting system — the ability to thread responses , to vote comments up ( but not down , haters ) , to trick out your profile with an image / avatar as well as MoJo “ flair ” ( want to brag about being a subscriber ?
We thought you would ) — but with a truly unique twist :
You can tag a comment as a “ solution ” or a “ result . ”
So , for example , if you think state regulators should investigate the School of Shock , you can let others know via the “ solution ” tag ; if you ’ve contacted the attorney general and gotten a response , you can post that as a “ result . ”
This will help readers separate action items from opinionating , and , in addition , we ’ll report on the suggestions you make and the results you get .
In the future , we ’ll be offering more options and privileges the more you interact with the site and other users .
This is a group experiment , and how we build it out will depend on how you use what ’s there now and what you ask of us .
Want social networking tools ?
The ability to chat ?
To add bookmarks or baby photos to your user profile ?
To aggregate the comments in some way we have n’t thought of ?
Let us know .
This is your tool .
We ca n’t wait to see what you do with it .
Okay , so that ’s probably as much as you need to get going .
But for those of you who love to know the ins and outs of design decisions , now , as the consultants say , we get granular :
The crisp look of the site is the creation of Steve Lyons , a San Francisco - based designer who teaches at the California College of the Arts .
He came up with the pencil logo at the top left ( is n’t a pencil kind of retro , you say ?
Yes , that ’s why we liked it ) and picked the typefaces throughout :
The nav bar and section headers are done in Relay , the body in Verdana , the headline in Georgia .
Steve also coded the CSS ( cascading style sheets ) throughout the front end of the site .
The back end , as well as the comments functionality , was built by EchoDitto , a Drupal - loving DC - based development shop that was started by a bunch of folks who helped put together Howard Dean ’s seminal Web operation in 2003 - 2004 .
Our in - house Web team — multimedia editor Laura McClure , developer and Drupal diva Céline Nadeau , webmaster Robert Wise , and producer Young Kim — was led by our media architect , Nick Aster , who was the CTO at TreeHugger and prior to that worked for Gawker Inc .
It was Nick who spearheaded the project and found the outside designers and developers , and whose vision for how journalism can become solution - oriented drove the project .
Together , we took inspiration from a lot of other news sites —
The New Yorker ‘s crisp and gorgeous design , Slate ‘s useful architecture , NPR ’s and the New York Times ‘ clean presentation of massive amounts of content , as well as many blogs and aggregators .
We asked whip - smart illustrator Harry Campbell to do the header illustrations for our blogs .
We built a wide top story box that can accommodate the gorgeous illustration and photography we like to assign , as well as a new layout for our signature photo essays .
If you look at the top nav bar , you ’ll notice our three main news sections — Politics & Current Affairs , Environment & Health , and Media & Culture — are each associated with a color , and those colors are used throughout the site to show which “ channel ” you ’re on .
On the home page , we ’ve built sections to highlight individual contributors , in - depth investigations , interviews , and multimedia content .
On the right side of each page — and this gets back to our news - you - can - interact - with model — is a module called “ Re:action , ” where you can see what other users are interested in — the most visited and most commented - on stories — take part in a featured conversation , sign up for our ( awesome ! free ! ) newsletter updates , and support Mother Jones ‘ mission of nonprofit investigative journalism .
Because , in the end , that ’s what this site is really about .
Journalism that you support .
Stories that you want to take action on .
How that happens is what you ’re about to show us .

There 's calamity in Cloudland this morning as Gmail fell over rather majorly .
Problems started at about 10.30 UK time affecting both individual and corporate Gmail accounts as well as some apps .
Dark clouds over Gmail , which fell over this morning .
Photograph : laffy4k / Flickr / Some rights reserved
There 's not a peep about the problems on the Official Google Gmail blog , but then that is run from the US .
The communications team in London were unable to send out statements on what went wrong ... because their email was down .
A spokesman said : " A number of users are having difficulty accessing Gmail and we 're working to resolve the problem .
We know how important Gmail is to users so we are taking this very seriously and we apologise for any inconvenience caused .
" We encourage anyone having technical difficulties to visit the Gmail help centre at mail.google.com /support . "
The Gmail problem was flagged up immediately on Twitter , with many users , though not all , saying they had Imap access running as normal .
So anyone being clever and running Gmail through Imap on a desktop email client or through their iPhone app may well be fine .
It is inevitable that this will happen from time to time .
What it does prove is that the more data we entrust to the cloud , the more important it is that we have reliable backups in place .
A similar crisis occurred when Amazon Web Services went down almost exactly a year ago ; thousands of web - based businesses rely on Amazon for their storage services and after two hours of downtime , users were observing that cloud computing can't become mainstream , certainly for businesses , until it becomes almost infallible .
Within minutes of the Gmail downtime unfolding , I was sent a very pertinent message on Twitter speculating on the cost of the problem :
" Let 's count the cost : 25 m users , 33 % affected ; average of $ 50 per hour lost productivity = $ 415 m per hour economic cost ... "
• Update : Two hours later , we 're back up .
I was asked to do a captcha as my request " looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus of spyware application " - which could well be a clue to the culprit .
If someone out there did manage to hack the mighty Google , they will be feeling very chuffed with themselves , regardless of how much disruption they have caused .
Now back to work ...
An outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium has spread to 42 states in the US , with almost 400 people infected by the bacteria and up to 20 % of the victims requiring hospitalization .[ social_buttons ]
The CDC , in conjunction with the USDA , the FDA and the Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) , is investigating the multi-state outbreak .
The illnesses were said to have begun between September 3 and December 29 , 2008 , with most illnesses beginning after October 1 .
Those infected with salmonella experience fever , diarrhea , and abdominal cramping about 12 to 72 hours after infection .
The illness usually lasts anywhere from four to seven days .
The list of states and possible foods involved have not yet been released .
According to the FDA , “ Most types of Salmonella live in the intestinal tracts of animals and birds and are transmitted to humans by contaminated foods of animal origin .
Salmonella can silently infect the ovaries of healthy - appearing hens and contaminate the eggs before the shells are formed .
Because an outbreak from a widely distributed product causes illnesses across the nation , the identification of the source of the contamination is often difficult .
It typically takes weeks and is not always successful .
Only after a source is identified will public health officials then advise the public to avoid it , and conduct recalls when appropriate .
CDC officials recommend protecting yourself from a salmonella infection with frequent handwashing , especially when handling meat or eggs , and thoroughly cooking your food .

Serge Klarsfeld does not look like someone who would put a gun to a man 's head .
This avuncular 73 - year - old is the epitome of politeness in his large office , with a photocopier whirring in the corner , brightly coloured document folders stuffed in many shelves , and cats tiptoeing over papers and desks .
But once , in 1973 , Mr Klarsfeld , brandished a pistol in the street at a former World War II Nazi - Kurt Lischka , wartime Gestapo chief for Jewish affairs in France , who was living comfortably in Cologne .
This was just one of many dramatic moments in the life of Mr Klarsfeld and his wife Beate , who have carried out a battle over almost 40 years to seek justice for the Nazis ' victims in France .
All my troubles in the past started when Madame Klarsfeld came to Bolivia
Klaus Barbie , convicted Nazi
This battle is now over , because either all those linked to the crimes are dead , or , the Klarsfelds say , there is not enough evidence to prove their guilt in court .
Mr and Mrs Klarsfeld had already failed in a previous attempt to kidnap Lischka , who was instrumental in planning the deportation and subsequent murder of thousands of French Jews and other " enemies " of the Third Reich .
Mr Klarsfeld 's ploy with the gun was designed to persuade the West German government , which had been refusing all calls to prosecute Lischka , to think again .
" I went to Cologne and approached Lischka in the street .
I put a gun to his forehead - he had a gun himself , but he just threw up his hands .
The eyes of a man are terrible when he thinks he 's going to die .
PURSUED BY THE KLARSFELDS Kurt Lischka : Responsible for deportations to concentration camps , jailed for 10 years Klaus Barbie : ' Butcher of Lyon ' , sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity Maurice Papon : Sentenced to 10 years in jail for helping send more than 1,600 French Jews to die in concentration camps Paul Touvier : Former aide to Klaus Barbie , executed seven Jews , convicted of crimes against humanity and jailed for life Alois Brunner :
Sent tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths , convicted in absentia in 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment , last seen in Syria and considered likely to be dead " I did n't shoot , and escaped , and then wrote to the West German government to say that if they did not deal with this man , then we could .
We told them to do their duty and apply the law . "
That did not happen right away , and instead a warrant was issued for both the Klarsfelds ' arrest .
But Lischka was eventually tried and convicted , in Cologne in 1980 , receiving a 10 - year prison sentence .
Mr Klarsfeld 's wife Beate , 70 , explains there were not actually any bullets in her husband 's revolver .
The daughter of a German soldier , she left Germany in 1960 and married Serge in Paris in 1963 , becoming a famed pursuer of Nazis in her own right .
Confronting the past
The couple 's comfortable offices , in Paris 's eighth arrondissement , are covered with documents and books on the Holocaust - they are piled on chairs , tables and floors .
Mr Klarsfeld explains that they began to realise in the 1960s that former Nazis were leading respectable lives in German society , as judges , politicians and businessmen .
" This was something that we could not stand , " he said .
Beate and Serge Klarsfeld have dedicated their lives to pursuing Nazis
And so the couple dedicated their lives to the pursuit and the prosecution of former Nazis , by what they describe as both " legal and illegal " measures , forcing French people to confront the truth of their compatriots ' widespread complicity in Nazi crimes .
Mrs Klarsfeld said the couple were not Nazi hunters , " because we did n't have to hunt them , we knew where they were , living openly " .
A lack of political will meant prosecutions of Nazis had dried up .
" In France we changed the memory of the Vichy government , showed up the crimes of the Vichy , like deporting children from France , " he said .
" We did it by providing information and research on how the Vichy co-operated with the Nazis .
We were involved in the prosecutions of collaborators like Maurice Papon and Paul Touvier .
" The French population forgot what had happened .
In 1970 the French public thought those who were arrested in our country were arrested by the Germans , but we showed that most often it was by those in French uniforms . "
Making history
Most famously , Mrs Klarsfeld , a German from a Christian background , publicly slapped the West German Chancellor Kurt - George Kiesinger in 1968 , because of his former role as director of Nazi propaganda broadcasting , a blow that resonated around Europe and that helped bring about Kiesinger 's fall from power .
That slap is still discussed in German schools today , such was its significance .
Mrs Klarsfeld in particular has carried out protests over former Nazis and anti-Semitism in countries such as the former West Germany , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Chile and Syria , mostly leading to arrests and frequently deportation .
You have to have documentary evidence that you can use in court , and there no longer is any such evidence available on anyone still alive , in France at least
Serge Klarsfeld
" I knew I had to go wherever the people were suffering , " Mrs Klarsfeld said .
" Sure , it could be dangerous .
But if you really want to do something with your life , you have to do more than just speak . "
The couple also tracked down the infamous Nazi Klaus Barbie , member of the Gestapo and known as the Butcher of Lyon .
There is evidence Barbie personally tortured prisoners and was blamed for 4,000 deaths and a further 7,500 deportations during the war .
The Klarsfelds found Barbie in Bolivia and helped organise his extradition in 1983 , after first conspiring to kidnap him .
Mr Klarsfeld legally represented more than 120 of Barbie 's torture victims .
Barbie was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity in 1987 , and died in prison in 1991 .
On his first court appearance he said : " All my troubles in the past started when Madame Klarsfeld came to Bolivia . "
The Klarsfelds stopped looking for Nazis themselves after a trial in absentia of Alois Brunner in 2001 in Paris , which they had pressed for and in which they presented evidence .
Brunner was sentenced to life imprisonment .
Brunner is the former head of an Austrian SS anti-Jewish team , and the man whose orders led to Mr Klarsfeld 's father being gassed in Auschwitz in 1943 .
Although Brunner could still be alive - he was once sighted in Syria - he would be almost 97 and both the Klarsfelds believe that he is long dead .
" He was ill and had been sent two letter bombs , which blinded him in one eye and took off most of his fingers on one hand - he undoubtedly died a long time ago , " Mr Klarsfeld said .
Nor do the Klarsfelds expect to be dealing with any further cases of Nazi war criminals .
" You have to have documentary evidence that you can use in court , and there no longer is any such evidence available on anyone still alive , in France at least , " Mr Klarsfeld said .
' People like us '
He says he always kept an emotional distance from the people he was pursuing .
He did n't hate them .
" After all , they were people like us .
We spoke with some of them .
They like animals , we like animals , for example .
" But we never met anyone who had changed , never met a former Nazi who showed remorse .
They were only interested in their own situation and that of their family .
The Klarsfelds tracked Klaus Barbie down to Bolivia " I never felt frustrated if a Nazi died before we could bring him to trial .
I cannot wish these people a long life . "
Mrs Klarsfeld , however , takes a different view .
" You can hate them .
If you look at the documents , look at what they 've done , and how they 've never show remorse .
Awful , awful . "
These days the Klarsfelds are busy with many projects - Mr Klarsfeld runs an organisation called the Sons and Daughters of Jews Deported from France , and has published several volumes of a book which catalogues the names , ages and addresses of French children deported in the war .
As a result of their efforts , the Klarsfelds themselves have been arrested , deported , beaten , had two attempts made on their lives and even been put on trial , but they have also been showered with international honours .
Among many other awards , both were given the Legion of Honour by France in 1984 .
Mr Klarsfeld has also been awarded full Israeli citizenship .
" Having left Germany when I was young , I could n't have dreamed one day to be what I am today , " Mrs Klarsfeld said .
" We tried to do quite a lot .
We acted very often illegally , but our illegality is nothing compared with the people we had in front of us . "

" Titanic " ( 1997 ) : We 're still convinced that a 13 - year - old girl somehow hacked into the Price Waterhouse computer .
( If they even have a computer ... )
Runner - up : " Shakespeare in Love " ( 1998 )
Best actor
Al Pacino in " Scent of a Woman " ( 1992 ) : Pacino considered this award an affirmation of his overacting and has played the same character in every movie since .
Hoo -wah !
Runner - up : Roberto Benigni in " Life Is Beautiful " ( 1997 )
Best actress
Gwyneth Paltrow in " Shakespeare in Love " ( 1998 ) :
No one even remembers this movie , much less Paltrow 's bland performance .
Cate Blanchett should have won for " Elizabeth . "
Runner - up : Julia Roberts in " Erin Brockovich " ( 2000 ) ; Helen Hunt in " As Good as It Gets " ( 1997 )
Best supporting actress
Whoopi Goldberg in " Ghost " ( 1990 ) : Why not just hand out an award to Jennifer Grey for " Dirty Dancing " ?
Or to Lori Petty for " Point Break " ?
At least Kathy Bates won for " Misery " in the same year .
Runner-ups : Anna Paquin in " The Piano " ( 1993 )
Best animated film
" Happy Feet " ( 2006 ) : This mediocre and gratuitously scary ( what the hell was up with the leopard seal ? ) animated penguin movie had the good fortune to come out during an off year for Pixar , which released the so - so " Cars " in 2006 .
Best song
" You 'll Be in My Heart " from " Tarzan " ( 1999 ) : I 'm guessing that even Phil Collins would admit this song is horrible .
More proof that the world is topsy - turvy :
The superior Collins single " Against All Odds " lost in 1985 to Stevie Wonder 's " I Just Called to Say I Love You " which is almost as bad as the " Tarzan " song .
Apple has released a massive patch that fixes more than 50 security flaws in different versions of the Mac operating system as well as bundled software .
There are a number of flaw fixes for Mac OS X's implementation of Sun Microsystem 's Java as well as a problem with the web browser Safari .
The other products affected are Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 , Mac OS X Server , AirPort , iPhone , iPhoto , iPod Touch and QuickTime 7 .
The Safari vulnerability was possibly the most serious of the flaws , as it could have allowed a website to run malicious Javascript on a user 's system if they subscribed to a RSS feed which included a malicious link .
One of the researchers who discovered that flaw , open source developer Brian Mastenbrook , was n't happy with how Apple reacted when he reported the problem back in July of last year .
On his blog he claimed that six months passed without a fix before he decided to post a warning on his blog last month .
He said : " So why did it take seven months for Apple to deliver a fix ?
What does this say about Apple 's commitment to protecting the security of these users ?
Neither I nor anyone else who is not at Apple can answer these questions for certain . "
This week 's liberty central civil liberties hero of the week award goes to Paul Saville , the 23 - year - old student arrested for writing the following protest in chalk on a pavement : " Liberty .
The right to question it .
The right to ask : " Are we free ? "
As Henry Porter points out , it is rather ironic that Saville has been charged with criminal damage by the police for protesting at the " loss of civil liberties " in Britain .
Saville said : " The whole reason I was writing in chalk was because I wanted to get my message across without causing lasting damage . "
Nominate your civil liberties hero of the week in the comments below .
Scientists have uncovered the underlying biological reason why locusts form migrating swarms .
Their findings , reported in today 's edition of Science , could be used in the future to prevent the plagues which devastate crops ( notably in developing countries ) , affecting the livelihood of one in ten people across the globe .
A collaboration between a team of scientists in Cambridge and Oxford , UK and Sydney , Australia has identified an increase in the chemical serotonin in specific parts of the insects ' nervous system as initiating the key changes in behaviour that cause them to swarm .
Desert Locusts are one of the most devastating insect pests , affecting 20 % of the world 's land surface .
Vast swarms containing billions of locusts stretching over many square kilometres periodically devastated parts of the USA at the time of the settlement of the West , and continue to inflict severe economic hardship on parts of Africa and China .
In November 2008 swarms six kilometres ( 3.7 miles ) long plagued Australia .
Locusts belong to the grasshopper family but unlike their harmless relatives they have the unusual ability to live in either a solitary or a gregarious state , with the genetic instructions for both packaged within a single genome .
Locusts originate from barren regions that see only occasional transient rainfalls .
While unforgiving conditions prevail , locusts eke out a living as solitary individuals with a strong aversion to mingling with other locusts .
When the rains come , the amount and quality of vegetation expands and the locusts can breed in large numbers .
In deserts , however , the rains are not sustained and food soon becomes more and more sparse .
Thus large numbers of locusts are funnelled into dwindling patches of remaining vegetation where they are forced into close contact with each other .
This crowding triggers a dramatic and rapid change in the locusts ' behaviour : they become very mobile and they actively seek the company of other locusts .
This new behaviour keeps the crowd together while the insects acquire distinctly different colours and large muscles that equip them for prolonged flights in swarms .

As Steve Rogers from Cambridge University emphasises : " The gregarious phase is a strategy born of desperation and driven by hunger , and swarming is a response to find pastures new " .
Solitary and gregarious locusts are so different in looks and behaviour that they were thought to be separate species until 1921 .
But the realisation that crowding triggers swarming posed a new problem : how can the mere presence of other locusts have such a dramatic effect ?
The new research , which was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Royal Society , solved this 90 year old question by identifying an increase in the chemical serotonin in specific parts of the locust 's nervous system as launching the fundamental changes in behaviour that lead to the gregarious phase .
In the laboratory , solitary locusts can be turned into gregarious ones in just two hours simply by tickling their hind legs to simulate the jostling that locusts experience in a crowd .
This period coincides with a threefold but transient ( less than 24 hours ) increase in the amount of serotonin in the thoracic region of the nervous system .
Experiments were then designed to show that serotonin is indeed the causal link between the experience of being in a crowd and the change in behaviour .
First , locusts were injected with specific chemicals that block the action of serotonin on its receptors : when these locusts were exposed to the same gregarizing stimuli , they did not become gregarious .
Second , chemicals that block the production of serotonin had the same effect .
Third , when injected with serotonin or chemicals that mimic serotonin , locusts turned gregarious even in the absence of other locusts .
Finally , chemicals that increased the natural synthesis of serotonin enhanced gregarization when locusts were exposed to the tickling stimuli .
This indicates that it is the synthesis of serotonin that is driven by these specific stimuli and in turn changes the behaviour .
Dr Michael Anstey , an author of the paper from the University of Oxford , said : " Up until now , whilst we knew the stimuli that cause locusts ' amazing ' Jekyll and Hyde ' - style transformation , nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms .
The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years , now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer . "
Dr Swidbert Ott , from Cambridge University , one of the co-authors of the article , said : " Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact , so to find that the same chemical in the brain is what causes a normally shy antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing . "
Professor Malcolm Burrows , also from Cambridge University : " We hope that this greater understanding of the mechanisms causing such a big change in behaviour will help in the control of this pest , and more broadly help in understanding the widespread changes in behavioural traits of animals . "
Professor Steve Simpson of Oxford and Sydney Universities said : " No other biological system is understood from nerve cells to populations in such detail or to such effect : locusts offer an exemplar of the how to span molecules to ecosystems – one of the greatest challenges in modern science . "
Locust Facts :
" At the end of the day , they ( American Apparel ) definitely screwed up , " said a planning commissioner .
And shortly after , the commission voted unanimously against allowing cool kids chain American Apparel into 988 Valencia St. , citing both the company 's failure to connect with the community and the Mission 's collective smackdown of the store .
There 's never been a flood of emails and speakers quite like this one , and the commission heard the village loud and clear .
Missionites , for the most part , left their pitchforks at home , and often even spoke brightly of their affinity for the brand — just not in their " delicate flower " of a neighborhood , where coffee roasters and struggling artists work , hands clasped together , to " bring to fruition their dreams . "
And just before a round of kumbaya broke out — one commissioner seemed to almost choke up over talk of gentrification on Valencia — everyone agreed that American Apparel was quite the stand - up company , but they 'd rather BART to Union Square to get their tees , thx .
And the crowd went wild .

Hopefully Joe is about to learn that actions have consequences :
Bolstered by a newly expanded majority , Harry Reid met with Joe Lieberman on Thursday to sketch out the conditions by which the Connecticut independent could continue to caucus with Senate Democrats .
But Lieberman did not accept Reid ’s initial offers , leaving his future in the caucus uncertain , and potentially setting off a campaign to pressure the Democratic steering committee to decide Lieberman ’s fate .
Reid offered Lieberman a deal to step down as chairman of the homeland security committee but take over the reins of another subcommittee , likely overseeing economic or small business issues officials said .
Immediately after his meeting with Reid , Lieberman told reporters that he had not made a decision about his future in the caucus , and appeared to launch his first public appeal to members of the Democratic steering committee , whose members decide committee chair assignments .
“ I completely agree with President - elect Obama that we must now unite to get our economy going again and to keep the American people safe .
that is exactly what I intend to do with my colleagues here in the Senate in support of our new president , and those are the standards I will use in considering the options that I have before me , ” Lieberman told reporters .
Joe The Warmonger seems to think that he ’s got some kind of negotiating leverage here , but I ca n’t for the life of me figure out what it is .
The Democrats already have a very comfortable majority , so they do n’t need him at all for control of the Senate .
It ’s possible that if all the remaining unsettled Senate races break Democratic , that Lieberman would represent the 60th vote for busting Republican filibusters … except that he ’s already declared himself in favor of them .
( Which is ironic considering that he voted against the Alito filibuster , but we ’ll just pretend we ’ve forgotten about that . )
I just do n’t understand what a guy who habitually betrays his party when they need him the most can offer that the Democratic leadership could find compelling .
What ’s he going to do , threaten to vote with the Republicans ?
Personally , I think Reid is letting him off easy if he just strips him of his homeland security chair – he should kick him completely off all committees ( if that ’s even possible ) and let him go crawling to see what he can get from Mitch .
Why should a Republican vote count towards a committee ’s Democratic total ?

We 've heard of a number of other Monday ( or other ) Evening Clubs built around the concept of a dinner , presentation and discussion .
Presumably there was a common impetus for this , but we have n't yet discovered what it was .
Among the clubs we 've run into are :
The Monday Evening Club of Newburyport , Mass .
( Founded shortly after World War I ) .
Despite its name , the Newburyport club meets on Wednesday evenings from October to June .
Newburyport is also home to the Fortnightly Club , founded in the 1870s , and the Tuesday Night Club , founded around 1910 .
( We are indebted to William Plante , Jr. , of the Newburyport Monday Evening Club , for this information . )
The Monday Evening Club of Haverhill , Mass .
( Founded 1860 )
( Founded 1869 ; Mark Twain was a member ; papers are archived at Trinity College . )
The Whiting Club , founded in Lynn , Massachusetts in 1903 .
It currently has 35 members from throughout the North Shore , and launched its website in 2014 ( website expired as of 2019 ) .
The Thirteen , a Salem , Massachusetts club launched in the early 1900s , which apparently was one of a number of " thirteen clubs " founded in that era — one aim being to dispel superstitions by traditionally having just 13 members , meeting on the 13th , and so on .
( Thanks to Charlie Newhall , historian of the Whiting Club and member of both the Whiting and The Thirteen , for information on both clubs . )

Dogbert stands at the counter in a drug store .
He says to the clerk , " Hello .
Do you remember selling some hair growth formula to a big guy named Dilbert ? "
The man replies , " Um . . . "
Dogbert continues , " Well , I 'M Dilbert , and apparently there are some unusual side effects ! "
The clerk looks shocked .
Dogbert continues , " I took time out from my thriving law practice to come talk to you about it . "
Dogbert walks home humming .
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock .
Dilbert says , " Thanks , Dogbert , but I only asked you to get my prescription refill . . .
Not the deed to the pharmacy . "
Dogbert replies , " In the long run this is more cost - effective . "
Visa Inc. , the credit card company , said Wednesday that its first - quarter profit rose 35 percent as consumers continued their shift away from cash toward electronic payments .
The results beat Wall Street expectations .
Visa also reiterated its earnings outlook for the year , despite expectations of tougher economic conditions in coming months .
Visa , the world ’s largest electronic payment network , reported net income of $ 574 million , or 74 cents a share , for the three months that ended Dec. 31 .
That was up from $ 424 million a year earlier , when Visa was privately held before its initial public offering last March .
Excluding one - time charges and gains , Visa earned $ 599 million , or 78 cents a share , in the latest quarter .
Hamilton police will examine an initiative where it can demolish homes used for marijuana grow operations .
The initiative , practised in British Columbia and Niagara Falls , follows Councillor Terry Whitehead telling the police services board about a home in an affluent part of his west Mountain ward that sat vacant and boarded up after being used as for a marijuana grow op a few years ago .
“ It ’s a blight in the community and it stays there an indefinite time , ” he said yesterday .
Whitehead said that in some cases , the homes ca n’t be sold and are owned by banks .
He said banks might like a mechanism where the building can be demolished .
Police and the Ontario government have used the Civil Remedies
Act to seize properties connected to grow ops or drug activity , such as the Sandbar Tavern in 2006 .
Deputy Chief Ken Leendertse said , since the start of this year , police have already raided seven homes and seized $ 1.7 million worth of pot .
He supported Whitehead ’s suggestion , saying it might make banks and landlords more careful about who they deal with in selling or leasing properties .
“ The idea of demolition , it sends out a message to the criminal element , but it also makes other people pay attention , ” Leendertse said .
In a report , Police Chief Brian Mullan said grow ops in the city have become more sophisticated , using more technological advancements , and often are being operated by organized criminal networks .
He estimated there are hundreds of grow houses operating in the city .
The majority come to light either through anonymous tips to the police from neighbours , landlords or concerned citizens .
Others are uncovered by police investigating a break - in or a fire .
Between 2005 and 2008 , police executed search warrants at 225 homes and seized more than 71,000 pot plants .

Hey everyone !
I am extremely happy to announce that I have successfully completed my GSoC project !
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the community for this wonderful learning experience .
It has really helped me to add a new dimension to my knowledge while at the same time introducing me to the world of open - source projects .
Most importantly , I would like to thank my mentor Reini Urban ( rurban ) for the tremendous help he offered me , ever since my first contact with the community .
As a matter of fact , without his ideas and invaluable guidance , completing the project would have been an impossible task .
I would also like to thank my co-mentor Bruce Gray ( Util ) for guiding us throughout the project and providing us with valuable inputs to overcome the many hurdles we faced .
In this blog , I will attempt to summarize the work I have completed through my project .
After a long , hard shift New York City 's waiters like to eat , drink , and be merry like everybody else .
But Gotham 's servers are n't going to eat just anywhere .
Because they work in some of the world 's most famous and expensive restaurants , they develop discriminating foie gras tastes that , sadly , they 're unable to afford on their liverwurst budgets .
Therefore , when they go out after work , Big Apple waiters patronise establishments that offer excellent food , good service , and outstanding value for their hard - earned dollar .
If you 're visiting NYC from the UK and want to avoid the multitude of culinary tourist traps trying to suck those devaluing British pounds out of your wallet , your best bet is to ask a server where to eat .
As the blogger of waiterrant .net and the author of Waiter Rant : Behind the Scenes of Dining Out , I 've decided to give my friends " across the pond " a list of exceptional and affordable Manhattan eateries and bars popular with the New York " waiter mafia " .

Sparsely appointed atmosphere with backless bar stools and menu that changes daily .
Frequented by restaurant staff from the very beginning , owner David Chang credits the growth and success of the Noodle Bar to the early support he received from the server community .

So my British friends , those are my recommendations .
Just remember , waiters are n't paid a salary in the United States .
Tip between 15 - 20 % and no - one will get hurt .
Richard Massey ’s suburban Anaheim home was valued at $ 700,000 two years ago when the bills for his cancer surgery came due and he had to tap the equity to pay them .
The cosmetics company executive had lost his job and health insurance just before getting ill -- the start of a run of bad luck that accelerated with the real estate meltdown and has left the 50 - year - old and his disabled wife facing eviction from their foreclosed home .
Long comfortably ensconced in the proud community of the self - reliant , Massey was unaware that free or low - cost legal help is available for the mounting middle - class casualties of the recession .
Had he known about the online guidance , legal self - help centers or community lawyers offering their services at group rates , he might have avoided being scammed by a fraudulent foreclosure rescue business that took his last borrowed money .

As millions of Americans live through their own nightmare versions of “ Trading Places , ” they are being confronted with legal problems compounding their fallen fortunes .
An estimated 60 % of Americans find themselves in the gap between those poor enough to qualify for publicly funded Legal Aid and those wealthy enough to afford an uptown lawyer .
Fortunately for the newly downgraded , the access - to - justice movement has advanced in recent years from Skid Row to Main Street .
At storefront law offices like Santa Monica ’s LegalGrind , a cafe - legal clearinghouse , those facing court dates to deal with divorce , custody matters , driving offenses and debt can find out for $ 45 how best to tackle their problems without plunking down a $ 5,000 retainer and $ 400 an hour for a lawyer .
Bar associations in California and a dozen other states , meanwhile , have whittled away at the ethics rules and industry mind - set that used to discourage attorneys from taking clients on a “ limited scope ” basis .
This involves representing them on specific aspects without taking responsibility -- and charging fees -- for the client ’s full range of legal problems .

In every county of California , court documents and tutorials for completing them are available online .
If citizens prepare their paperwork properly , overwhelmed judges can keep their daily crush of cases flowing more smoothly .
Efforts to marry do - it - yourself legal software and free or low - cost guidebooks with just the right degree of paid counsel are being spearheaded nationwide by the American Bar Assn . and fitted to local needs by lawyers and professional groups stepping up to meet the exploding demand .
“ Most of the middle class is a paycheck away from going into the lower class .
Nothing has highlighted that more than the current foreclosure crisis , ” said Luz Herrera , president of Community Lawyers Inc. , a Compton start - up .
Civic - minded lawyers , many having worked for publicly funded Legal Aid services to the indigent , slash costs to the consumer by drawing together neighbors with common legal problems in group therapy - like sessions and sharing the lawyer ’s bill among them .
The clinics give clients direction for $ 75 , $ 100 , maybe $ 200 a head .

The unmet legal needs of the middle class and the increasing numbers tumbling into poverty coincide with the worst funding crisis ever to confront Legal Services Corp. , the federal entity that administers Legal Aid funds for the poor .
Still , Internet - based programs designed to spread the limited public funding across a wider range of the needy are now available to people of all income levels , said Crystal Sims , an attorney with Legal Aid Society of Orange County .
Massey did n’t turn to Sims at first because he assumed he did n’t qualify for help from a service set up for the indigent .

Although the funds available for rescuing the distressed middle class are woefully short , the solution is n’t necessarily more public money to pay more lawyers , says Deborah L. Rhode , head of Stanford Law School ’s new Center on the Legal Profession , who estimates that at least three - fifths of the population falls through the cracks of the legal establishment .
She suggests continued expansion of Internet delivery of legal guidance to the masses ; incentives for new law school grads to work off their student loan debt in community practice ; and a tax on legal services bought by those who can afford “ big law ” representation .
“ Help should be available for those who ca n’t realistically afford it and have more to lose , ” Rhode said of the recently unemployed , the underwater mortgage holders and the strapped families that have run up credit - card debts trying to make ends meet .
The dearth of affordable legal representation is the reason most parents fighting for custody of their children attempt to do it on their own , disproportionately losing their cases because of poor preparation or unfamiliarity with a court ’s workings , said Laura K. Abel of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University .

“ This affects family life at the most basic level , ” Abel said .
The mix - and - match components of navigating the courts have emerged in the wake of states ’ embrace of limited - scope representation , or “ unbundling , ” which for years was frowned on by lawyers worried that it could lead to unlicensed law practice .
“ What unbundling does is allow an attorney to come in and handle those parts of the case where assistance is most needed and coach clients on the simpler aspects , ” said Sue Talia , a Bay Area private family law judge and pioneer unbundling advocate .
“ Lawyers have always been afraid they will get sued if they say they ’re going to do this piece of the case but something goes wrong in another part , ” said Talia , author of “ How to Avoid the Divorce from Hell . ”

LegalGrind founder Jeff Hughes has been dispensing coffee and counsel from his shop in Santa Monica for 13 years .
Even with abundant free or affordable help online , at courthouses and in bookstores , sometimes a client needs “ a warm - blooded lawyer to connect the dots , ” he said .
Family law consultations allow walk - in clients on Wednesday nights to get direction and an affordable plan for pursuing their cases .
On Saturdays , the focus is on personal finances .
“ Oftentimes clients come in with a problem that is n’t really a legal matter .
A lot of the work feels more like psychology than law , ” said William J. Rose , a veteran Legal Aid lawyer now in solo practice in Santa Monica who spends every other Saturday on community outreach consultations .
Rose did n’t even charge the $ 45 fee of Marie Kovin , an out - of - work philosophy professor , when she asked what she could do to stop her credit card companies from reducing her limits because she needs to charge her day - to - day expenses .

He advised Kovin , 53 , that living on credit will compound her problems .
Kovin added : “ He told me to get a job . ”

New battery technology developed at MIT has made a big media splash today , supposedly offering Li-ion energy storage which could charge up fully " in seconds " .
However , no such capability has been demonstrated : in fact the kit does n't seem very important .
The ink storm results from the usual advance notices attendant on a letter written by Byoungwoo Kang and Gerbrand Ceder of MIT , describing their work on enhancing lithium iron phosphate electrodes .
The letter is published in Nature this week , which should mean it is of some importance .
According to the Nature free publicity channel , Kang and Ceder have " have developed battery cells that can charge up in less time than it takes to read the first two sentences of this article " .
This line has been picked up by the mainstream media and some big guns online .
In outline , it appears that the two boffins have enhanced the properties of lithium iron phosphate cathodes with a thin coating of lithium - phosphate glass , helping the electrode achieve much more of it potential as a carrier of lithium ions .
If more ions can move , more electricity flows .
Charge and discharge rates should be much better - indeed , nine - second charge - ups are claimed .
With li-ion batteries normally taking some hours to fill up , this could be big stuff .
The famous Tesla Roadster electric supercar runs on li-ion , for instance : and its biggest Achilles heel is the lengthy time required to get juiced up again after running the battery pack flat .
Fast - charging for phones or gadgets is mildly attractive , but only mildly .
Normally it would be much cheaper to buy a spare battery and a battery charger as one already can in most cases - so allowing an instant swap once a device runs flat - than to get kit which could charge up your phone in nine seconds .
( The power level involved would be similar to an oven : even if it somehow could be made to work without melting the phone , special domestic wiring would probably be required and the charger would be large and expensive . )
Still , fast - charging electric cars is big news , right ?
Well , no actually - li-titanate batteries , offering electrocars which can top off in a few minutes , have been around for a while and such vehicles are nearing the market .
In any case , Ceder and Kang - while apparently happy to speak to journalists of fast - charging , unless that was made up by the scribes - do n't yet claim fast charging for their kit among their scientific peers .
They have only proven fast discharging , as one finds when looking at their actual letter ( abstract here : subscription required for the whole thing ) .
MIT Tech Review , one of the few publications to bother looking properly , merely says " the fast - discharging materials may also recharge quickly " .
Fast discharge is mildly interesting : it could offer a rival to ultracapacitors in the field of rapid acceleration for hybrid cars , especially those recouping some of the kinetic energy lost during braking and then seeking to give it back fast in the form of decent acceleration .
F1 racing cars will soon be doing this sort of thing , for instance .
All in all , though , this technology really does n't seem to be worthy of the attention it 's getting - particularly compared to other more mature kit like li-titanate .
One might say : who cares about a load of silly hacks and what they write ?
Unfortunately , this kind of thing too often affects investment and development decisions : in other words , affects the movement of money .
MIT claims that Kang and Ceder 's kit has already been licensed by two companies . ®
The folks at Hubble just released this fantastic image !
OK , duh , that 's Saturn .
But you can see four moons crossing its face at the same time !
Such an event is pretty rare , and very cool .
The moons are ( from left to right ) Enceladus , Dione , Titan , and Mimas .
You can also see the shadows of Enceladus and Dione on the planet 's cloudtops , too .
Whoa .
Saturn , like the Earth , is tilted with respect to its orbit around the Sun .
Our tilt is about 24 degrees , and Saturn 's is about 27 .
This means that twice every Saturn year ( which are roughly 30 Earth years in length ) we see Saturn 's rings edge - on .
They can get so thin they practically disappear !
That happens in September of this year , and as you can see from the image above image , our viewing angle of the rings is currently very shallow .
The icy particles in the rings orbits over Saturn 's equator , just as the moons do .
That means that if we 're seeing the rings nearly edge - on , the orbits of the moons are that way as well .
This makes transits -- moons moving across the face of the planet -- more common .
So on February 24 of this year , Hubble was able to snap a spectacular series of images of four of Saturn 's moons projected on Saturn 's visage .
You can see how the moons moved in the image below , showing the time - sequence Hubble took of the event .
Besides the relative rarity of this event , what strikes me the most is how seriously frakkin ' big Titan is : if Titan were orbiting the Sun , there 's be no question is would be a planet ; it 's easily bigger than Mercury !
This also shows just how monstrous Saturn is ; over 800 Earths could fit inside it .
Saturn 's gravity is so powerful in can hold all those moons in sway , keeping them in their clockwork orbits for billions of years .
I 'll add that I went out to look at Saturn a few days ago ; it 's up when the Sun sets , easily visible in the constellation of Leo .
I could n't help but notice how faint it looked compared to last year , and I realized with a start that this was because the rings appear so thin right now .
They reflect so much light from the Sun that when we see them edge - on , Saturn is visibly dimmer !
It really brought home to me that Saturn is not just a wandering point of light in the sky , but a world in and of itself , and in fact a system of worlds which interact with each other .
And they dance around each other , as they have danced for eons , and will for eons to come .

Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economist at Princeton .
In my previous blog post , I showed that America suffers from “ excess spending ” in its health care system .
Here I will discuss one factor that drives up that spending : indefensibly high administrative costs .
To review : “ Excess health spending ” in this context refers to the difference between what a country spends per person on health care , and what the country ’s gross domestic product per person should predict that that country would spend .
( The prediction is based on trends in other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . )
The word “ excess ” here should not be taken as “ excessive ” unless one could demonstrate that what the other O.E.C.D. nations spend is appropriate and what we spend is ipso facto wasteful .
The United States spends nearly 40 percent more on health care per capita than its G.D.P. per capita would predict .
Given the sheer magnitude of the estimated excess spending , it is fair to ask American health care providers what extra benefits the American people receive in return for this enormous extra spending .
After all , translated into total dollar spending per year , this excess spending amounted to $ 570 billion in 2006 and about $ 650 billion in 2008 .
The latter figure is over five times the estimated $ 125 billion or so in additional health spending that would be needed to attain truly universal health insurance coverage in this country .
One thing Americans do buy with this extra spending is an administrative overhead load that is huge by international standards .
The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that excess spending on “ health administration and insurance ” accounted for as much as 21 percent of the estimated total excess spending ( $ 477 billion in 2003 ) .
Brought forward , that 21 percent of excess spending on administration would amount to about $ 120 billion in 2006 and about $ 150 billion in 2008 .
It would have been more than enough to finance universal health insurance this year .
The McKinsey team estimated that about 85 percent of this excess administrative overhead can be attributed to the highly complex private health insurance system in the United States .
Product design , underwriting and marketing account for about two - thirds of that total .
The remaining 15 percent was attributed to public payers that are not saddled with the high cost of product design , medical underwriting and marketing , and that therefore spend a far smaller fraction of their total spending on administration .
Two studies using more detailed bilateral comparisons of two countries illustrate even more sharply the magnitude of our administrative burden relative to that in other developed countries .
One of these is an earlier McKinsey study explaining the difference in 1990 health spending in West Germany and in the United States .
The researchers found that in 1990 Americans received $ 390 per capita less in actual health care but spent $ 360 more per capita on administration .
A second , more recent study of administrative costs in the American and Canadian health systems was published in 2003 by Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2003 .
The study used a measure of administrative costs that includes not only the insurer ’s costs , but also the costs borne by employers , health - care providers and governments – but not the value of the time patients spent claiming reimbursement .
These authors estimated that in 1999 , Americans spent $ 1,059 per capita on administration compared with only $ 307 in purchasing power parity dollars ( PPP $ ) spent in Canada .
More and more Americans are being priced out of health care as we know it .
The question is how long American health policy makers , and particularly the leaders of our private health insurance , can justify this enormous and costly administrative burden to the American people and to the harried providers of health care .

Females judge prospective mates by the colour of their feathers
Female Gouldian finches " decide " to have more male chicks if they are less compatible with their mate .
The birds , which have either red or black heads , prefer to mate with males with the same head colouring , as this signifies a better genetic match .
Chicks from a mismatched mating - particularly the females - are weaker and more likely to die very early .
A report in the journal Science says that the birds compensate for this by having more male chicks in their brood .
Broods are more gender balanced when the parents are the same colour Colourful Gouldian finches can judge if a mate is genetically compatible just by looking at its head .
A female that mates with a male with the same colouring lays eggs that hatch much healthier chicks .
This new study has found that , when the female finches mate with a male that has a different head colour , they select the sex of their offspring - giving their chicks a better chance of survival .
Parental control
In birds , the sex of an egg is already determined before it is fertilised by the male .
Sarah Pryke , a biologist from Macquarie University in Sydney , led this study .
She found that when female finches mate with mismatched males , 70 % of their chicks are male .
Females really do n't want to mate with a male with a different head colour
Sarah Pryke
Macquarie University
This is beneficial for the birds , because male chicks from genetically mismatched parents are more likely to survive than females .
" It is pretty amazing to think that the female herself has so much control - subconsciously of course - over this basic physiology , " said Dr Pryke .
The results were particularly striking because colour - matched matings , which result in much healthier broods , always produce roughly equal numbers of male and female chicks .
" Females really do n't want to mate with a male with a different head colour .
" But there simply are n't enough compatible males , so later in the mating season they seem to use this control to make the best of a bad situation . "
Birds of a feather Dr Pryke 's team disguised some of the male finches to show that this " sex bias " is entirely controlled by the females .
They blackened the head feathers of red males , using a non -toxic dye , and paired them to both red and black females to allow them to breed .
" It 's actually quite hard to tell the experimentally blackened birds apart from natural black males , " explained Dr Pryke .
The birds were fooled , and the team found that black females that mated with the " disguised " red males produced an equal ratio of male and female chicks .
" This is the clearest and perhaps most extreme example of sex biasing that has been found , " said Dr Pryke .
" It 's really black and white - or in this case black and red . "
She said that exactly how the birds select the sex of their eggs is still a " big mystery " .
" We have an idea that hormones may play a role - but that 's a working hypothesis we 're looking to test . "
Dr Ruedi Nager , a biologist from Glasgow University who specialises in avian reproduction described this as an " excellent experiment " .
" It 's now clear that the control is driven by the females , " he told BBC News .
" Somehow the female recognises the sex of the follicle [ or egg cell ] and selects it based on how much she likes the male .
" Hopefully , this will reinvigorate the debate about how this works . "

They had a huge impact on the whole world .
Some companies - including Apple and Dell - evolved revised corperate logos during the economic crisis .
Dont take it seriously .
Its just a joke .
Keep on beeing creative .

Part 1 : Making new life
Part 2 : The search for shadow life
Gallery :
What might shadow life be like ?
WHEN the Nobel prizewinning physicist Richard Feynman died in 1988 , his blackboard carried the inscription , “ What I can not create , I do not understand . ”
By that measure , biologists still have a lot to learn , because no one has yet succeeded in turning a chemical soup into a living , reproducing , evolving life form .
We ’re still stuck with Life 1.0 , the stuff that first quickened at least 3.5 billion years ago .
There ’s been nothing new under the sun since then , as far as we know .
That looks likely to change .
Around the world , several labs are drawing close to the threshold of a second genesis , an achievement that some would call one of the most profound scientific breakthroughs of all time .
David Deamer , a biochemist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , has been saying that scientists would create synthetic life in “ five or 10 years ” for three decades , but finally he might actually be right .
“ The momentum is building , ” he says .
“ We ’re knocking at the door . ”
Meanwhile , a no-less profound search is on for a “ shadow biosphere ” – life forms that are unrelated to the life we know because they are descendants of an independent origin of life .
We know for sure that life got going on Earth once , so why could n’t it have happened twice ?
Many scientists argue that there is no reason why a second genesis might not have taken …
Tech news from the Guardian
Today the Guardian announced something pretty cool for us geeky peeps .
They ’ve created an API so that companies and individuals can access and interact with all their content and information .
And I think that ’s awesome !
Let me first of all say that I am biased – Unchained is a content partner of the Guardian .
I like most of the stuff they do .
But I ’m really looking forward to what comes out of this .
When other newspapers are foolishly thinking about making a return to the paid subscription model , the Guardian is instead opening up everything they have and giving it away freely for people to do with as they please .
They ’ve got it right – that ’s the way the internet works as far as I ’m aware !
And because they ’re doing this , their content will go further , their brand will appear in more places , individuals will do really creative stuff that ’s attached to the Guardian brand and they will engage deeper with audiences .
Pretty simple really .
Their only challenge is to attach a revenue model to it somehow .
And that revenue model is probably based on attracting a more international audience .
I ’m just really looking forward to seeing what creative things people do with the content .
Here ’s some stuff I ’d like to see :
A Jonathan Harris style app that graphically shows how good or bad any day in history is according to the main news stories of that day .
An application to test Nostradamus ’s prophesies – that maps them against the stories they allegedly foretold .
A Visual Thesaurus kind of application that lets you browse related articles .
A sweary news application that just adds expletives into a story to add more emotional depth .
A game that picks out 3 headlines from any day in history and you have to guess what day it was .
What would you do with it ?
Put you ideas here and we ’ll maybe see if there are any developers who fancy building them .
She is , in the eyes of the law , America 's most dangerous eco-terrorist : a self - confessed serial arsonist who resorted to fire and destruction to register her opposition to the fur industry and genetically modified crops .
But to those who know her and to some legal experts , the 22 - year jail term handed to Marie Mason , 47 , is a consequence of America 's preoccupation with terrorism in the post - 9/11 world .
She is serving the longest sentence of any convicted animal rights or environmental militant , including several activists responsible for greater destruction .
" It is obvious the government is trying to send a message – to have a chilling effect , not only on my action , which of course transgressed the laws , but also on 30 years of above - ground actions in the environmental rights spheres , " Mason told the Guardian in her first interview since she was sentenced last month .
Mason was convicted on the evidence of her fellow arsonist and ex-husband , Frank Ambrose .
He was jailed for nine years .
" It 's very , very sad .
These are karmic things that Frank will have to deal with on his own , " she said .
The explosive fire Mason and Ambrose set at Michigan State University on 31 December 1999 caused nearly $ 1 m ( £ 680,000 ) of damage to buildings and equipment , but no death or injuries .
The target was the office of the director of a genetically modified crop research programme into moth - resistant food crops for Africa , funded by the US Agency for International Development and the biotechnology company Monsanto .
Professor Daniel Clay , who worked at the institute in 1999 and is now the director , said the attack had a severe impact on the staff .
" It really was a shock , " he said .
" It was a very difficult period for all of us .
People were frightened and we asked ourselves how close did this come to physically harming someone . "
However , Mason 's lawyer , John Minock , who filed an appeal against the sentence last week , argues that 22 years is excessively harsh .
Mason got a much longer sentence than several militants recently convicted of setting fire to logging camps and vehicles in Oregon and Washington states – including Stanislas Meyerhoff who received 13 years for setting 11 fires and causing $ 30 m in damage .
" Giving her a 22 - year sentence is like using a cannon to shoot a mouse , " Minock said .
" She is a 47 - year - old , mild - mannered woman with no previous criminal record other than trespassing . "
The FBI had singled out militant environmentalists and animal rights activists as domestic security threats even before the 9/11 attacks .
Since then , the courts have used domestic terrorism laws to stiffen the punishment for politically inspired violence .
Mason is a prime example .
" We are definitely seeing more severe sentences post - 9/11 , no doubt about it , " said Heidi Boghosian , the director of the National Lawyers Guild .
" We have seen a trend of using the terrorist label and federalising a lot of criminal activities that would have gotten a far less stringent sentence before . "
Lauren Regan , an Oregon lawyer who defends environmental militants , calls it the " green scare " .
To those in Mason 's home city of Detroit who know her , her elevation to the ranks of America 's most dangerous criminals came as a shock .
A fixture in activist circles , she was bright and charming , but unfocused – a woman who had an advanced degree in chemistry but lived near the poverty line .
They saw her as a doting mother to her adult son and teenage daughter , a soft touch who took in stray dogs and named them after revolutionary heroines , an amateur folk singer and a passionate supporter of various causes .
But not , they say , the organiser of a series of attacks .
" She is one of those people that , whenever there would be a demonstration , she would be there , " said Peter Werbe , a Detroit broadcaster who has known Mason for 20 years .
" I do n't think she ever rose to prominence as a figure in the city . "
A long - time acquaintance said : " If you look at the court documents , Frank is always the one lighting the fire , she is always the one spray - painting the wall .
That , in a nutshell , is who she is .
Marie is always the support staff . "
Mason met the man who was to become her third husband in 1998 .
Ambrose , now 34 , was well - known among forestry activists in the mid-west and was leading a workshop for activists .
Mason says there was an instant attraction .
The two were soon living together and married , although the relationship was troubled .
At about 9 pm on New Year 's Eve 1999 , the couple entered an office in the Institute of International Agriculture at Michigan State University and doused it with petrol .
The arson , by Mason 's own account , was botched .
A fireball set her hair on fire , forcing the couple to run before she even managed to write her slogan , " No GMO " .
The next day , the pair set fire to a logging camp .
She has also admitted to burning boats belonging to the owner of a mink farm .
When asked whether the fires might have terrified staff and students at the university , she said : " It was intended as an enlightenment moment that people would see what is going on beneath the surface . "
Clay argues his institute 's research was aimed at creating a more sustainable agriculture , an ambition he believes should be shared by environmentalists .
" It was most important to us that the perpetrators were caught and that justice was served , " he said .
The couple nearly got away with it but were caught in March 2007 .
By then , the two had split up .
Ambrose , who was cleaning out his possessions , left gas masks , fuses , maps and explosives in a rubbish dump .
The material was discovered by a man who called the authorities .
Eventually , the gas masks led the FBI to Ambrose , who agreed to turn informer .
He wore a wire and gave Mason a mobile phone , to help the FBI monitor her conversations .
Mason , in her jail cell , has often thought about those talks .
" I did think that some of our conversations were very strained and strange but I attributed that to the fact that Frank was a very nervous person and he was under a lot of pressure , " she said .
" I was the last to know that Frank was unreliable . "

A Darwin man has been fined $ 2,000 for filming himself masturbating while speeding along the Stuart Highway .
The man is already in jail until August after pleading guilty to carrying cannabis in the car boot and two plants on the back seat .
Brenton Alan Erhardt , 39 , pleaded guilty in the Darwin Magistrates Court to dangerous driving .
He was pulled over by police on the Stuart Highway in July speeding at 147 kilometres per hour , south of Daly Waters .
He admitted to officers he filmed himself masturbating while driving from Adelaide to Darwin .
He also pleaded guilty to driving unlicensed , carrying two cannabis smoking pipes , administering the drug and carrying a loaded rifle .
Magistrate Sue Oliver says the driving was bizarre to say the least and conduct she expects of someone much younger .
After its rapturous reception in Britain and America , knives are being sharpened for Slumdog Millionaire .
" Vile , " is how Alice Miles described the movie in The Times .
" Slumdog Millionaire is poverty porn " that invites the viewer to enjoy the miseries it depicts , she adds .
Even that old iconic Bollywood blusterer , Amitabh Bachchan , has thrown his empty - headed two rupees ' worth into the mix .
" If Slumdog Millionaire projects India as a third - world , dirty , underbelly developing nation and causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots , let it be known that a murky underbelly exists and thrives even in the most developed nations , " he bellowed .
" It 's just that the Slumdog Millionaire idea , authored by an Indian and conceived and cinematically put together by a westerner , gets creative global recognition , " he added .
Bachchan is no doubt riled , as many other Bollwood no -talents will be , about the fact that the best film to be made about India in recent times has been made by a white man , Danny Boyle .
Just as Spike Lee got hissy with Quentin Tarantino after he proved he could make hipper films about black people than Lee could ( Lee ostentatiously criticised Tarantino 's use of the word " nigger " while littering his own films with the same language ) , so many Indians will be upset about a westerner having a better understanding of their country than they do .
Bachchan gave one of the worst English - language performances in cinematic history with his embarrassingly stupid portrayal of an ageing thespian in The Last Lear .
Having failed miserably at cultivating a western audience , it must hurt him to be so monumentally upstaged by white folk on his home turf .
The bitter truth is , Slumdog Millionaire could only have been made by westerners .
The talent exists in India for such movies : much of it , like the brilliant actor Irrfan Khan , contributed to this film .
But Bollywood producers , fixated with making flimsy films about the lives of the middle class , will never throw their weight behind such projects .
Like Bachchan , they are too blind to what India really is to deal with it .
Poor Indians , like those in Slumdog , do not constitute India 's " murky underbelly " as Bachchan moronically describes them .
They , in fact , are the nation .
Over 80 % of Indians live on less than $ 2.50 ( £ 1.70 ) a day ; 40 % on less than $ 1.25 .
A third of the world 's poorest people are Indian , as are 40 % of all malnourished children .
In Mumbai alone , 2.6 million children live on the street or in slums , and 400,000 work in prostitution .
But these people are absent from mainstream Bollywood cinema .
Bachchan 's blinkered comments prove how hopelessly blind he and most of Bollywood are to the reality of India and how wholly incapable they are of making films that can address it .
Instead , they produce worthless trash like Jaane Tu , Rock On !! and Love Story 2050 , full of affluent young Indians desperately , and mostly idiotically , trying to look cool and modern .
Slumdog Millionaire is based on the novel , Q&A , by Vikas Swarup .
I know Vikas – an Indian diplomat , he loves his country as much as anyone and did it the service of telling its truth with great warmth and humanity .
And Danny Boyle 's film continues in precisely the same vein .
His innovative brilliance , fresh perspective and foreign money was vital .
As an outsider , he saw the truth that middle - class Indians are too often inured to : that countless people exist in conditions close to hell yet maintain a breath - taking exuberance , dignity and decency .
These people embody the tremendous spirit and strength of India and its civilisation .
They deserve the attention of its film - makers .
I have no doubt that Slumdog Millionaire will encourage many more honest films to be produced in India .
But they should be ashamed that it took a white man to show India how to do it .

Tork says he hopes to play a planned June gig with his new band Peter Tork , a former member of 1960s group The Monkees , has a rare form of head and neck cancer , he has revealed .
He disclosed the news on his website on Tuesday but has said that it has not spread to other parts of his body .
Tork , 67 , had surgery in New York on Wednesday which his spokeswoman said had gone well .
He will begin radiation treatment after a recovery period .
The Monkees ' TV show first appeared on NBC in 1966 , while their hits included chart - topper I'm A Believer .
June gig

The movie " Wahed Sifr , " or “ One - Zero , ” has not yet been released .
However , all this fuss erupted after movie star Elham Shahin , who plays the lead , spoke to the media about the project .
Although most of the cast is Muslim , the screenwriter is a Christian woman .
Gobriel , who claimed that nine other lawyers , including two Muslims , had supported his complaint , accused the filmmakers of downgrading the teachings of the Bible .
“ Marriage is one of the secrets of the church , and no divorce can be concluded unless in cases of adultery .
The movie wants to change the Bible .
Actually , it is an act of rebellion against the Bible . ”
Christian lawyer Nabil Gobriel has filed a legal complaint and called on the Egyptian prime minister to ban the movie .
“ Freedom is not absolute , it must have limits , it should not infringe on religious fundamentals , ” Gobriel told The Times in a phone interview .
A soon - to - be - released movie featuring a divorced Coptic woman struggling with the church to receive a religious permit to remarry has triggered the outrage of many Copts , who criticized the film as an attack on one of the fundamentals of the Christian faith .
The spokesman for the Coptic Church had reportedly said the church should screen the movie before it comes out .
“ The church is with creativity , ” Coptic Bishop Marcos said .
“ However , when an artist tackles clerical religious thought , he should refer back to the church . ”
Neither the crew nor the production company seems threatened by Gobriel ’s move .
“ The movie is coming out next month . …
Who would listen to a lawyer ? ” wondered Shahin in a defiant tone in an in interview with a local magazine this week .
“ These [ lawyers ] are seeking fame , and they are making up a fuss about something they have not seen yet .
“ I am presenting a movie that touches the lives of thousands of Christian women whom I see around me .
I know about their suffering and their inability to enjoy their right to get a permit from the church to remarry , ” Shahin added .
“ It is as if we are calling on these women to turn into nuns .
Why this ban [ on remarriage permits ] then ?
It is as if we are punishing them or driving them to commit vice . ”
Several Copts have been struggling to convince the Coptic Church to ease the restrictions imposed on divorce and remarriage .
However , since his ordination as pope in the 1970s , Patriarch Shenouda III has tightened restrictions on divorce , which , according to some observers , drove many Christian women to change their denomination in order to get divorced and remarry .
Others resort to civil courts to get divorced ; however , the church refuses to grant them a permit for a second marriage .
According to Naguib Mekhail , a Coptic human rights activist , there are several thousand Coptic women who face the same dilemma discussed in the movie .
Yet Mekhail believes that the church ’s position emanates from its duty to safeguard the faith .
“ There are religious texts in the Bible that the church abides by ; these texts say that no divorce can be concluded unless a spouse commits adultery or converts to another religion . "

Having touched on this subject before , and recieving lots of mail regarind it I have decided to add an update to this subject for your enjoyment * and mine *
BDSM is a lifestyle that more and more are enjoying , whether they live it 24/ 7 or just once a month when they meet with someone to partake in a scene or even if they dabble in it within their normal everyday sexual or daily life .
– to be honest there are thousands of people who add a bit of this life into thier sex lives daily and they really are unaware of it !
One of my favorite parts of BDSM is bondage , * note I said one * and this can add to other parts of this life in so many different ways , just think , a bound sub / slave is at your mercy , you control the play and how much or how little pleasure that person recieves , be it a male or female , they are at your mercy , this in itself takes an infinate amount of trust but once you have that total trust the rewards are endless for all concerned .
I personally love to bind my slaves tits , this is something that heightens their sensitivity , so the slightest flick of a crop or paddle adds that bit more bite , add some clothes pegs to her nipples or the fleshy underside of the breast and for the more experienced a ‘ zipper ’ effect and the initial pain felt is soon outweughed by the pleasure recieved
Remember always be aware of the person you are with , and watch for their body language , some do not take to certain things as well as others so slowly introducing different things into your playtime is often the best way , afer all this is supposed to be fun for ALL concerned
Eugene F. Lally – Ahead of his Time
The year is 1961 .
JFK has just been sworn in as the 35th US President , The Beatles have made their debut at the Cavern Club in Liverpool , and Eugene F. Lally is sitting in the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
Bored of designing rockets and other things that help rockets go faster , Lally has an idea .
Instead of just sending people up into space , how about giving them a camera for taking pictures of the planets and stars to send back to earth , helping identify the astronauts ’ location ?
A few diagrams and a good number of hours thinking and writing later , Lally had produced a paper , entitled ‘ Mosaic Guidance for Interplanetary Travel ’ , the blueprint for the very first digital camera .
Unfortunately for Lally , he was approximately 14 years ahead of his time , and the technology was just not available to bring his blueprint to life .
Still , the foundations had been laid , and digital photography was not far away !
The First Prototype Digital Camera
Fourteen years after Lally ’s blueprint , Steve Sasson of Kodak took a few spare camera parts , and old jet engine and his grandma ’s broken black and white television into his shed and emerged a few months later with what is now recognised as the world ’s first digital camera .
Although we lied about the bit about the jet engine and the television , he did actually use parts found in a bin from a Kodak Super 8 assembly line to construct his masterpiece , and the result was a 100 line black and white image recorded to a cassette tape , which needed a rather cumbersome micro computer to view the image on a television screen .
Sasson ’s camera was surprisingly deemed impractical , with Kodak simply not having access to the funds , time , or enough geeks to pursue Sasson ’s prototype .
However , Sasson had done what no one had done before him , and the digital camera was here to stay .
The First Commercially Available Digital Camera
Finally , in 1987 , digital photography hit the mainstream , used for commercial purposes for the first time .
The camera ?
Surprisingly it was n’t manufactured by one of the big players - not Fuji , Kodak or Canon , but MegaVision , a self proclaimed ‘ small employee - owned company ’ who first cornered the market with their ‘ Tessera ’ system .
Based around a high - resolution 2000 - line tube camera , the Tessera produced high resolution colour images , ideal for model shoots or taking photos of multi-coloured things .
Still alive and well today , MegaVision labels itself as ‘ The First Name in Digital Photography ’ , and while this may be a little unfair to Mr. Lally of the aforementioned NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , few could dispute that MegaVision made every day digital photography use a reality .
And as MegaVision are also based in California , Mr Lally was consoled by the fact that his lawyers did n’t have very far to travel !
The First Consumer Digital Camera
As far as technology is concerned , the Japanese are rarely outdone .
And when they are , they do n’t take to it very kindly .
News of MegaVision ’s first commercial digital camera must have travelled across the Pacific quickly , because it took Fuji less than a year to release the world ’s first fully digital consumer camera , the DS - 1P .
Also the world ’s first camera to use removable flash card media , pioneering the SRAM flash card the DS - 1P paved the way for portable digital cameras , as well as being remarkably cheap .
Yes , depending on the lens size , you could have picked up a DS - 1P for as little as $ 10,000 , the top of the range version only setting you back a measly $ 40,000 .
Not bad , considering the DS - 1P even had a built in battery – it ’s a wonder how anyone resisted .
Introducing the Camera Phone
After having been pipped to the post by MegaVision ’s first commercial digital camera , the Japanese were desperate to find something innovative to make their own .
Therefore it came as no surprise when , in 2001 , Sharp Corporation produced the J - SH04 , the world ’s very first commercial camera phone .
Whether the technology behind it is that innovative is questionable , as some critics have argued they simply put a camera and a mobile phone in a technological blender and produced a camera phone , however Sharp ’s product did what no other had done before it and what pretty much everyone else proceeded to do in the years that followed .
And we now all know who to blame for the exponential rise in pub quiz cheating .
The Hubble ACS – Stargazing !
The Digital Photography revolution continued , and continued so fast that it actually outgrew the earth itself , proving extremely useful for a wide number of astronomical adventures .
In 2002 , the famous Hubble Telescope added another weapon to its already impressive technological armoury – the Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The ACS is no run of the mill digital camera however .
The ACS , in the words of the Hubble website , ‘ helps map the distribution of dark matter , detects the most distant objects in the universe , searches for massive planets , and studies the evolution of clusters of galaxies ’ .
To summarise , the ACS is on a one camera mission to answer every question any enquiring astronomical mind has ever thought to ask .
Eugene Lally would be so proud !
The Mars Global Surveyor
Although The Hubble ACS may get the headlines for the sheer size and difficulty of its task alone , there were numerous space travelling digital cameras before it .
They just made less noise .
Take for example the Mars Global Surveyor , which returned home to earth in November 2006 after a monumental 9 years in orbit of the Red Planet .
Using a system of three cameras ( a narrow angled camera to produce high resolution black and white images as well as red and blue wide angle cameras for context and daily global imaging ) , the Mars Orbiter Camera experiment returned an incredible 240,000 images , including the very first pictures of Earth from Mars .
For some people , this represented an enormous technological and astronomical breakthrough .
For the rest us , it represents the chance for some pretty cool desktop backgrounds .
Pan-STARRS – Earth ’s Defence Against Asteroids
Forget over - complicated technological advances – sometimes it ’s just about making your camera bigger and louder than everyone else ’s .
Unless you ’re a spy camera manufacturer of course , in which case this is exactly the opposite of what you ’re being paid to do .
Everyone else , look to the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System ( Pan - STARRS ) project .
Scheduled to be launched in 2010 , Pan-STARRS will orbit the earth and scan the skies for asteroids or other possible threats to Earth .
A bit like having a giant digital bodyguard , the project consists of four telescopes , the first of which , the PS1 in Hawaii , was fitted with a camera back in 2007 boasting an unprecedented 1.4 billion pixels which will provide ridiculously high resolution images .
Which means if we are hit by an asteroid , at least we ’ll get some really good pictures of it as it enters our atmosphere .

A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York states that Americans hold $ 8.88 trillion of mortgage debt .
It is reported that it is the biggest type of household debt in the country .
If you are among the millions of people in this debt , you may be wondering whether you should pay early or not .
At What Age Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage ?
While some experts say that you should pay your mortgage at about the age of 45 , some other experts do not agree .
They say that are some drawbacks associated with paying off mortgages early and ignoring some other investments that are potentially lucrative such as bonds and stocks .
So if you are wondering what you should do about your mortgage , this guide will put you through and weigh the ups and downs , so that you can decide .
Why You Should Not Pay Off Your Mortgage Early
You still have other debts to take care of
In most cases the last debt you pay should be the mortgage .
If you have other debts hanging , tackle them first .
Typical debts are ;
1. Car Loans
Almost all car loans come with interest rates that are more than mortgages at current rates .
The interest on a car loan is not tax deductible .
2. School Loans
There is n’t really any advantage paying off your mortgage early especially if you have refinanced your school loans or taken advantage of some repayment plans .
Rates are higher than a mortgage even with refinanced loans and the term of the loan is shorter .
Due to this , it ’s better to pay off your school loans before you pay of your mortgage .
3. Home Equity Lines of Credit
The interest rates on second mortgages are higher than the mortgages even though they are tax deductible .
4. Credit Card Debt
Paying off your credit card debt is a top priority .
Whether you take advantage of 0 % transfer offers or not , these introductory rates do n’t last beyond 18 months .
A lot of debts can carry zero percent , for at least a time .
These zero percent deals are usually either temporary or apply to relatively short term loans .
So , paying the loans is a top priority .
You Do n’t Have A 12 - Month Emergency Fund
The best thing is to have money that is enough and kept in taxable accounts .
This money will take care of all your expenses for a year before you apply for more money to mortgage .
While you are paying off your debt and working to maximize your retirement accounts , then a 12 month emergency fund is too much .
However , when you meet these goals and you decide to pay off your mortgage early , 12 months do n’t sound bad .
You should always consider liquidity .
You need a lot of cash to pay off the mortgage early .
While you may think it is reasonable , you should n’t pay off the mortgage in a way that will take all of your cash .
You Are n’t Saving At Least 20 % Of Gross Income
You do n’t have to divert money to the mortgage until you are saving a significant portion of your income .
You should save a minimum of 20 % of your gross income .
This is important before you apply for more money cash to the mortgage .
Part of these savings may include retirement savings to IRA and 401k accounts , and also savings to taxable accounts .
You Are Still Saving Up For Bigger Things
You also need to have future cash needs addressed .
You have to plan to cover insignificant purchases for five years ( at least ) .
10 years is preferable .
The big purchases might include ;
Child ’s Education
Home remodeling
Car Purchase
Vacations
Wedding
You really do n’t have to pay off the mortgage only to go find yourself in more debt for large purchase .
You Are Investing The Extra Cash In A Smart Way
Once you have paid all your debt , ensure that have a solid emergency money saved
somewhere , and you are saving a 20 % minimum of your income and you ’ve had your cash needs taken care for at least five years , using extra cash to pay the mortgage makes sense .
Why You Should Consider Paying Off Your Mortgage Early
A common method of paying off your mortgage loan early is a bi-weekly payment plan .
This plan involves making half of the standard mortgage payment even two weeks , as opposed to paying once monthly .
Paying bi-weekly means that homeowners pay what ’s equal to the 13 monthly payments in a year rather than that of 12 .
This lets them pay the mortgage loan more quickly .
Interest Rate .
It makes more sense to pay of your mortgage early when the mortgage has a high interest rate .
However , homeowners should also know that the interest on a mortgage is usually tax deductible .
This reduces the net cost of borrowing such that a loan that has an interest rate of 4 % may have just a net cost of 3 % once the benefit of the tax is considered .
Also , an early payment plan has a lot of benefits at the start of the loan ’s term because a homeowner is paying off principal when the term ends .
Other Investment Options
You should really consider the fact that there are other investment opportunities that may come and even offer a better return – a much more better choice that offers more benefits over paying off your mortgage early .
You will also be required to pay taxes on any fund you withdraw from an investment portfolio .
This makes low - interest sources like savings account an excellent choice for getting the necessary funds .
Retirement accounts that use pretax money are also recommended .
Need for Liquidity
You should also think about the need for assets that you can easily convert into cash before you pay off your mortgage loan .
Monthly expenses that are unexpected or emergencies may call for the need of liquid assets like an investment account or savings account .
If you have less job security , you should also consider maintaining a bugger liquidity cushion .
Early payment plans that come with extra payments every month are actually more flexible than just making a whole payment .
You may also want to repay the mortgage and use the equity to obtain a line of credit of you expect the interest rates to reduce over the term of the loan .
Peace of Mind
A lot of homeowners had a sense of security when they became the real owners of their home .
It is a good feeling when you know you do n’t have any debt as you are entering retirement .
Also the reduced monthly expenses will give you more flexibility in paying off your mortgage .
The fact , however , is that this strategy is only good for people who plan to live in that house for a longer period of time .
How Much Of Your Budget Should Go Toward Mortgage Payments ?
Almost every financial institution say that one should n’t spend over 30 percent of their budget for mortgage payments , heating , and municipal taxes .
It is classic ratio ; mortgage to total debt .
You need to consider other debts , such as balances , car loans , and balances on credit cards .
You can talk to mortgage counsellors to help you make the right choice .
The time it would take you to pay off the mortgage has a direct influence on the amount that you spend on your regular payments .
What To Do When You Finally Pay Off Your Mortgage
First , celebrate because it is worth celebrating .
There is n’t so much for you to do .
Just continue paying all your property taxes .
You should also make sure your lender does not forget to take off the lien that was placed against your house the first time you got the loan .
If the taxes on your real estate property were a part payment of the loan and paid with an escrow , ensure that you begin to receive the tax bill directly as the lender will stop paying the bill on your behalf now that you are n’t making any monthly payments .
Good news ; the lender probably stashed away some extra funds that is more than the actual amount you owed in taxes .
In the future , you would likely get the reserve back in the form of a check from the lender .
Make sure you contact your lender if you have n’t received the funds four weeks after you have paid off the loan .
Bad news ?
You will need to stash away some money for your homeowner ’s insurance policy as well as your property tax payment .
You can open a bank account and deposit the same amount as your mortgage every month until you have enough to pay for the insurance .
That is if you ca n’t pay a big sum twice a year .
Once you have paid your final amount to your lender , you have paid the loan in full .
Your lender will then prepare a release deed or release of lien .
This is done to clear the title of the property you paid for .
Once the release has been recorded , you automatically notify the whole world that your loan has been paid off and that the lien attached to the property by your lender is no longer valid and you are now a homeowner .
You should also get a feedback from the lender , sending you the canceled original note as well as the canceled original mortgage that you signed when you first took the loan .
Make sure you keep records of everything you do so that no one will claim you did n’t pay off your loan in full .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory in New Mexico is missing 67 computers , including 13 that were lost or stolen in the past year .
Officials say no classified information has been lost .
The watchdog group Project on Government Oversight on Wednesday released a memo dated Feb. 3 from the Energy Department 's National Nuclear Security Administration outlining the loss of the computers .
Kevin Roark , a spokesman for Los Alamos , on Wednesday confirmed the computers were missing and said the lab was initiating a month - long inventory to account for every computer .
He said the computers were a cybersecurity issue because they may contain personal information like names and addresses , but they did not contain any classified information .
Thirteen of the missing computers were lost or stolen in the past 12 months , including three computers that were taken from a scientist 's home in Santa Fe , on Jan. 16 , and a Blackberry belonging to another employee was lost " in a sensitive foreign country , " according to the memo and an e-mail from a senior lab manager .
The e-mail was also released by the watchdog group .
The theft of the three computers in January triggered the inventory and a review of the lab 's policies regarding home use of government computers , Roark said .
Only one of the three computers stolen from the employee 's home was authorized for home use , which raised concerns " as to whether we were fully complying with our own policies for offsite computer usage , " he said .
Roark said computers with classified information are " kept completely separate from unclassified computing . "
" None of these systems constitute a breach of a classified system , " he said .
The e-mail from Los Alamos senior manager Stephen Blair to lab co-workers said the missing computers and Blackberry were " garnering a great deal of attention with senior management as well as ( nuclear security administration ) representatives . "
The security administration memo said the " magnitude of exposure and risk to the laboratory is at best unclear as little data on these losses has been collected or pursued given their treatment as property management issues . "
The lab , located in Los Alamos , N.M. , employs about 10,000 people .

Look what happened when Congress actually started acting in the interests of the American people .
The approval rating increased .
From Gallup :
Americans ’ job approval rating of Congress is up an additional 8 points this month , after a 12 - point increase last month , and now stands at 39 % — the most positive assessment of Congress since February 2005 .
Here ’s how the approval rating has looked ( click on the picture for a larger image )
Here ’s part of the analysis from Gallup :
The latest increase suggests the reason for the improved ratings of Congress in 2009 may go beyond simply the change from split control to one - party control of the federal government , to include an assessment of the work Congress has been doing with the new president on the economy and other issues .
Such an explanation seems plausible given that a majority of Democrats now approve of the job Congress is doing , and that the gap between Democratic and Republican approval of Congress is growing , as Congress passes and President Obama signs laws to deal with the economy and other issues that largely follow a Democratic philosophy of governing .
Even though the Democratic Party had majority control of both houses of Congress in 2007 - 2008 , it was able to achieve little of its legislative agenda while Republican Bush remained in the White House .
This lack of results may have soured Democrats ’ opinions of Congress .
So , Congress , keep doing what you ’re doing .
And , this should serve as a heads up to all of the Democrats who want to block the Obama agenda .
Obstructionism and the failure to address serious issues is what makes people hate Congress .
Do n’t sour people on Congress again .
The American people want change , not the same old tired games on Capitol Hill .
We expect that from the Republicans .
Do n’t let the Blue Dogs and conservatives in the Democratic Party be the roadblock to change .
We 've seen , in recent weeks , an outpouring of public outrage over the mega millions that keep flowing – despite the escalating economic meltdown – into the pockets of America 's top bankers and corporate executives .
" I'm angry , " Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D ) of Missouri told her Senate colleagues late last month , as she introduced a bill to cap pay for bailed - out CEOs at $ 400,000 a year .
" Wall Street [ is ] kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer . "
" I will not tolerate it , " President Obama added a few days later , as he announced a $ 500,000 executive pay cap at firms getting substantial bailout dollars .
The amount of money that goes into executive pockets is staggering .
So is the amount that comes out of those pockets in taxes : precious little .
America 's super - rich are paying far less of their incomes in taxes than average Americans who punch time clocks .
This is grossly unfair .
The good news : Under Mr. Obama 's new plan to cut the deficit in half , the very richest Americans will start paying something closer to their fair tax share .
It 's been a while since they 've done that .
As recent IRS data show , these elites are paying less in taxes – much less – than their deep - pocket counterparts used to pay .
In 2006 , the 400 highest - income Americans together reported $ 105 billion in income , an average of $ 263 million each .
Having trouble visualizing that ?
To pocket $ 263 million a year , you would have to take home over $ 60,000 an hour – and work 12 hours a day , seven days a week , for an entire 12 months .
Sounds tiring , does n't it ?
But most of the top 400 make their fortunes buying and selling assets , everything from stocks and bonds to the exotic paper that helped inflate the housing bubble .
Uncle Sam taxes income from those assets – whether that income be capital gains or dividends – at a much lower rate than income from work .
The current top tax rate on " ordinary " work income sits at 35 percent .
But dividends and capital gains from the buying and selling of most assets face only a 15 percent top rate .
That 's why in 2006 , America 's top 400 paid just 17.2 percent of their $ 263 million average incomes in federal tax .
Millions of middle - class American families , once you tally income and payroll taxes , pay far more of their incomes in tax .
One particularly striking example from billionaire investor Warren Buffett :
In 2006 , he paid 17.7 percent of his income in total taxes .
His secretary , who made $ 60,000 , paid 30 percent of hers .
How did we end up with this sorry state of affairs ?
Lawmakers in Congress have spent the past several decades systematically slicing the tax rates on America 's top income brackets .
Their rationale ?
Lower taxes on the top , free up capital for investment , and boost productivity .
In actual economic practice , those lower taxes have served instead to fuel speculation and increase budget deficits .
For the ultrarich themselves , the tax savings have been nothing short of breathtaking .
Back in 1955 , America 's top 400 paid more than 50 percent of their incomes in federal tax , almost triple the rate of today 's top 400 .
We can fix this .
Obama just announced his plan to end the Bush administration 's high - income tax cuts .
This is an important step .
We can insist , also , that lawmakers end the preferential treatment of dividends and capital gains .
And we can raise the tax rate that kicks in when taxpayers start collecting more than $ 10 million and $ 20 million a year .
Steps like these would help get our future in order .
But what about the past – and all those windfalls the super - rich have been pocketing as our economy veered into the ditch ?
Are we going to have to watch these billions multiply , generation after generation , into a new American aristocracy of wealth ?
Not if we save the estate tax , the only federal levy on grand accumulations of private wealth .
The rich and their retainers have been trying to repeal the estate tax for 20 years now .
They have n't succeeded , but they have slashed the tax rate on the fortunes the ultrawealthy leave their heirs .
Congress is about to begin debating legislation that would freeze the estate tax at the current bargain - basement rate set by President Bush .
We can't let that happen .
More than ever , America needs its ultrarich to chip in more .

In recent days the European Parliament has again caused " outrage " in the British press after publishing a pamphlet asking staff to refrain from using the titles Miss or Mrs. " Ludicrous " , one Tory MEP told the Daily Mail .
" Political correctness gone mad " , he continued .
Another , in the Daily Telegraph , branded it a " waste of taxpayers ' money " .
It is more than 30 years since Ms began to gain ground among a US feminist movement keen to find a title which did not denote a woman 's marital status .
Decades later - while being a
Ms might be seen in Brussels as simple as being , well , a Mr - many elsewhere are less keen to catch on .
' Very unhelpful ' Being a Ms is , frankly , unheard - of in some quarters .
" I do n't think it 's very helpful , " said Charles Kidd , editor of Debretts Peerage and Baronetage - the guide to aristocracy .
" I was brought up to address a married woman as Mrs John Smith , for example . "
Being a
Ms is n't always plain sailing - with the most mundane tasks often turned into an exhausting battle of principle .
For example , attempting to take out insurance , this conversation is likely to follow : " Name ? " , " Jane Smith " .
I can't see the point of Ms and I do n't see it as an issue
( Miss ) Ann Widdecombe MP
Send your comments " Marital status ? " , " married " .
" Address Mrs Smith ? " .
" Actually I'm a Ms , Mrs Smith is my mother . "
Momentary silence .
Then : " I 'm sorry , if you 're married you can only be a Mrs .
The system wo n't allow another title . "
For married TV producer ( Ms ) Eve Kay - whose recent projects include Channel 4's Jamie 's Ministry of Food - it is a familiar tale .
For example , the time she tried to fill out a criminal records check for a TV series she was producing involving children .
" I was naturally asked for my title .
As always , I typed in ' Ms ' .
At the end of the first page , though , I hit a roadblock .
" The program kept asking what my surname at birth was - annoying , since , despite getting married in 1994 , I 've had the same surname all my life .
" In their minds Ms is a title that means you have been divorced . "
Again , her dealings with insurers have also had their moments .
" I found that married women were given a different premium to unmarried women .
Yet , because men are Mr and so they could n't tell their marital status , there was no change . "
Not everyone is hampered by titles showing their marital status .
Bureaucrats , she says , have " lost sight of the fact that we do n't want to be denoted by our relationship to men " .
Having said that she does n't agree with the European Parliament 's ban of Miss and Mrs .
" You can't impose liberation on people ; it has to come from understanding .
" It would be far better if women understood that being a Mrs or Miss is trivialising their independent status . "
A title which indicated a woman 's relationship to a man was simply " archaic " , she said , " a hangover from the past " .
Her own straw poll of the office on the issue found : " Women with children do get it and do n't much want to be seen as married and over - the - hill or a spinster .
" They can see that marital status being known at work is by no means helpful .
" Whereas young women could n't see what I was on about , because they had n't experienced any negative attitudes . "
' No point '
Some though , just can't see the point .
Says Miss Ann Widdecombe MP : " I 've grown up with that title and it's a perfectly good title .
I can't see the point of Ms and I do n't see it as an issue .
" It 's absolutely ridiculous .
These titles have been around for a very long time . "
And it need n't be confusing : " I 'm not confused .
It 's everyone else who is .
" I use Ms as a form of convenience if I do n't know what they call themselves .
But if they mention in a letter that they are married then I 'll use Mrs . "
Referring to the European Parliament , she said : " They want to make everything unisex .
They do n't even want to say ' man - made '
But man -made is an all - embracing term , " she said .
It means women too .
For Charles Kidd , of Debrett's : " It 's important to get someone 's title right .
If someone does want to be called Ms then that 's fine . "
But , he added , he had never been asked to change somebody 's title of address from Mrs to Ms. " I 've just never heard of it , " he said .

Politically , Mr. Obama enjoys a strong foundation of support as he enters what is surely to be a tough and challenging period , working with Congress to swiftly pass a huge and complicated economic package .
His favorable rating , at 60 percent , is the highest it has been since the Times / CBS News poll began asking about him .
Overwhelming majorities say they think that Mr. Obama will be a good president , that he will bring real change to Washington , and that he will make the right decisions on the economy , Iraq , dealing with the war in the Middle East and protecting the country from terrorist attacks .
Over 70 percent said they approved of his cabinet selections .
What is more , Mr. Obama ’s effort to use this interregnum between Election Day and Inauguration Day to present himself as a political moderate ( he might use the word “ pragmatist ” ) appears to be working .
In this latest poll , 40 percent described the president - elect ’s ideology as liberal , a 17 - point drop from just before the election .
“ I think those of us who voted for McCain are going to be a lot happier with Obama than the people who voted for him , ” Valerie Schlink , 46 , a Republican from Valparaiso , Ind. , said in an interview after participating in the poll .
“ A lot of the things he said he would do , like pulling out the troops in 16 months and giving tax cuts to those who make under $ 200,000 , I think he now sees are going to be a lot tougher than he thought and that the proper thing to do is stay more towards the middle and ease our way into whatever has to be done .
“ It ca n’t all be accomplished immediately . ”
While the public seems prepared to give Mr. Obama time , Americans clearly expect the country to be a different place when he finishes his term at the end of 2012 .
The poll found that 75 percent expected the economy to be stronger in four years than it is today , and 75 percent said Mr. Obama would succeed in creating a significant number of jobs , while 59 percent said he would cut taxes for the middle class .
The survey found that 61 percent of respondents said things would be better in five years ; last April , just 39 percent expressed a similar sentiment .

Gaza is the world 's largest open - air prison .
1.5 million residents are packed into an area 45 kilometres long x 10 kilometres wide , while Israel controls Gaza 's air space and borders .
Over 80 % of the population are refugees denied their legal Right to Return to the homes and lands from which they were expelled in 1948 .
Israel also illegally restricts Palestinian freedom of movement into and out of Gaza .
For example , in August 2008 , Israel denied three Gazan Fulbright Scholars their basic right to education by having their US entry visas revoked .
Gaza has been under complete siege since June 2007 , during which time the 1.5 million people of Gaza have been cut off from sufficient fuel , food and medicine .
Two weeks ago , the UN reported that Gazans were living without power for up to 16 hours each day ; half of Gaza 's population was receiving water only once a week for a few hours ; 80 % of the water in Gaza did not meet World Health Organization standards for drinking ; the unemployment rate had risen to almost 50 % ; only 23 of 3900 industrial enterprises were operational ; more than 79 % were living below the poverty line ; more than 56 % were food insecure ; and patients with chronic illnesses such as cancer or diabetes could not be adequately treated or cared for .
( See http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_gaza_situation_report_2008_12_17_english.pdf )
Since 2001 , fewer than 20 Israelis have been killed by Qassam rockets [ fired from outside by guerillas ] .
In three days , nearly 400 Gazans have been killed by Israeli state violence .
This is a ratio of 20 Gazan lives for each Israeli life , with the death toll in Gaza certain to increase .
In January 2008 , UN Special Rapporteur John Dugard stated , " a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless terror , such as acts committed by Al Qaeda , and acts committed in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism , apartheid or military occupation .
While such acts cannot be justified , they must be understood as being a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism , apartheid or occupation . "
Israeli government and Palestinian violence can in no way be viewed as symmetrical -- individual Palestinians have chosen to resist their occupiers with largely inneffective home - made rockets , while the Israeli state , which boasts the fourth most powerful military in the world , has responded by collectively punishing the captive population that it illegally occupies .
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention , collective punishment is a war crime .
As the occupier , the burden is on Israel to end its state violence .
Israel is an apartheid state .
South Africa [ and other states ] must sever diplomatic ties with Israel and implement sanctions against it until Israel complies with international law .
UN General Assembly President Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann recently called for a campaign of Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions against Israel , similar to the one that ended apartheid in South Africa .

Porn star may challenge senator linked to DC madam scandal David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Monday February 9 , 2009
Print This Email This ' The Storm's A Brewin , ' Draft Stormy says A website has launched a petition in an effort to draft adult entertainer Stormy Daniels to run against Louisiana Republican Sen.
David Vitter -- and the would - be challenger granted her first interview at an Arizona hotel , where she was performing at a strip club .
" While traveling through Arizona last week , I learned that Daniels would be performing at a Phoenix strip club , " muckraking reporter Max Blumenthal wrote Monday .
" I tracked the adult - video starlet down at her hotel and filmed the first interview with her since the Draft Stormy initiative began .
During our exclusive interview , Daniels homed in on what she called Vitter 's hypocrisy , declaring her intention to make his contradictory behavior the centerpiece of her campaign . "
" Originally the focus was n't even about making me as a candidate , " Daniels said .
" I think it was about bringing attention to the Senate race in general and then the response was overwhelmingly positive and , you know , I think everyone is just running with it . "
Vitter 's phone number was found in the records of the D.C. madam who apparently committed suicide last year and may have led to the resignation of CIA director Porter Goss .
Now he could get a sampling of what he may have already sampled : an eyebrow - raising woman who 's paid to perform .
Only this time , it could be at the ballot box .
" A Storm 's A Brewin ... " the Draft Stormy website says .
" A Storm that ï¿½s gonna sweep Louisiana clean of corrupt politicians once and for all !
And that Stormï¿½s name is Stormy .
Stormy Daniels .
" Honesty , passion and strength of character , " the site adds .
" These are the traits Louisiana needs in a Senator at this crucial time .
And honesty , passion and strength is what is this Storm is all about . "
Blumenthal says Vitter is positioning himself to the right of center as the midterm elections approach .
" With 2010 midterm elections approaching , Louisiana Republican Sen .
David Vitter is positioning himself as a leading conservative stalwart , " Blumenthal writes .
" In July 2008 , Vitter joined accused bathroom - stall sex solicitor Sen. Larry Craig in co-sponsoring the anti-gay - marriage Marriage Protection Amendment , then addressed a massive antiabortion rally on the National Mall three days after Barack Obama 's inauguration .
Vitter was also the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 's lone vote against sending Hillary Clinton 's secretary of State nomination to the Senate floor . "
Vitter also recently mocked the inclusion of anti-sexually transmitted diseases measures in the recent stimulus bill on the Senate floor .
Eager for a challenger that could mock if not unseat Vitter , an ad appeared on Craigslist recently seeking " a female in some aspect of the adult - entertainment industry " to run against Vitter , Blumenthal notes .
" Part publicity stunt , part political psy- ops tactic , the Draft Stormy initiative has already forced Vitter 's scandalous past back into the limelight , " Blumenthal writes .
" The Louisiana Democratic Party denied any involvement in creating the website , but it is not complaining about Daniels ' involvement in the race .
" I personally have no issues with his sexual activities or his sexual preferences or whatever it is that he wants to do .
My issues with him -- who am I to judge , right ?
My issue with him is that he is a hypocrite and call me what you will but you can't call me a hypocrite , " Daniels told Blumenthal

Blumenthal 's interview on the Daily Beast follows below .

Chinese Wrestler Bites Opponent During Match
Is there any kind of cheating that is n’t tolerated in China ?
You can lie about your age , you can cut in line , you can pirate what you want , and now , you can apparently bite whoever you want .
During a Chinese national wrestling tournament , one wrestler named Alibieke bit his opponent , Yeerlanbieke Katai , while the two grappled .
According to spectators , “ Katai let out a bloodcurdling cry and protested to the referee that he had been bitten . ”
Presumably , his bloodcurdling cry sounded something like “ ALIBIEKE ! ”
After the match , Katai said , “ If it was n’t for that , I would have definitely finished that attack and taken the set . ”
Despite his protest , and despite sporting a bite mark on his elbow , the match continued with Alibieke only receiving a warning for his “ unintentional ” bite .
“ Wrestling is an intense sport …
Athletes , it can be said , are exerting their all and sometimes are not able to control themselves very well , ” said Dong Shenghui , wrestling director within China ’s General Administration of Sports .
Mike Tyson wishes Dong Shenghui had chosen to be a boxing director here in the United States instead .

Businessman , entrepreneur , and certainly a man who loved sports , Larry H. Miller , has died .
He passed away Friday afternoon from complications related to type 2 diabetes .
He was 64 years old .
Miller had been in poor health for some time , suffering a heart attack and kidney failure in June and then having both of his legs amputated just below the knee a couple of weeks ago .
On Thursday , Feb. 12 , Miller received news that he was suffering from calciphylaxis , a rare condition where calcium gets deposited in blood vessels , keeping tissue from getting oxygen , which leads to tissue death .
It is usually found in patients suffering from kidney disease and parathyroid problems .
At that point , doctors told him he had a matter of days to live .
At a press conference , his physician , Dr. Bill Dunson said , " He had the most incredible health challenges over the last 6 months .
I think a lot of that , over the last 30 years of having diabetes , built up until finally , over the last 6 months , the physical part of him finally just gave out .
I do n't think the mental or the spiritual part ever gave out of Larry Miller . "
Prior to learning of this condition , his family says Miller fully expected to recover from his recent health problems and move on .
In fact , they say he decided to have his legs amputated in order to improve his quality of life .
Dunson also said Miller has been close to death on multiple occasions over the last 6 months .
The last time Miller was seen in public was when he was inducted into the Utah Auto Dealer 's Hall of Fame .
Miller is survived by his wife , Karen Gail Saxton Miller , their four sons and one daughter , 21 grandchildren , and one great grandchild .
He valued his family as his greatest accomplishment .
Of his death , Miller 's son Steve said , " Just like everything else he 's done , he scripted it perfectly , and the outcome is as beautiful as it could be .
He is in a better place .
We are grateful for the time that we 've had with him . "
Miller was born in Salt Lake City in 1944 and went on to become one of Utah 's most successful and influential entrepreneurs .
Over the years , he amassed more than 80 businesses and properties .
A public service will be held for Miller , though details of when and where have not been decided at this time .
Sports legacy
Miller loved racing cars and was an outstanding fast - pitch softball player .
From the early 60s to the mid-80s he was active in both .
He turned his attention to his love for cars and racing when he built Miller Motorsports Park in Tooele .
Miller also purchased the Salt Lake Bees baseball team , and he is credited for saving the Jazz from leaving Utah back in the mid 1980s .
In 1985 , he bought a 50 percent share of the Jazz for $ 8 million ; a year later , he purchased the remaining 50 percent for $ 14 million .
He later built the Delta Center , now EnergySolutions Arena .
Friday night the flag outside the arena was lowered to half - staff .
Larry H. Miller Group of businesses
Miller has had an impact in Utah more than most people realize , not only in the sports world , but in many aspects in the community -- from his 39 car dealerships , to restaurants , to movie theaters .
In 1966 , he became a parts manager for a Utah auto dealer .
He moved to Denver in 1970 and for the next 9 years he managed as many as 5 Toyota dealerships .
In 1979 , he came back to Salt Lake and opened Larry H. Miller Toyota .
He would eventually acquire 39 dealerships in several western states .
A press release from the Larry Miller Group said , " Leaving behind a profound professional and personal legacy , the entities Miller created have had a significant and lasting impact on the communities in which he did business , and the more than 7,000 individuals he employed . "
His wife Gail said , " It 's interesting to look at the strength he had , the vision he had , the character he had , the desire to just do good things .
And he wore himself out doing it . "
His family has said they do n't want things to change in the way Miller 's businesses are run .
Gail said , " We hope it wo n't change .
We 're dedicated to carrying out his legacy .
I was just thinking , one of my favorite things about Larry is there were no barriers .
He treated everyone the same .
He did n't see color , he did n't see race , he did n't see rich , he did n't see poor .
He loved people and that was a hallmark of his character .
And I think that will live on . "
Contribution to the community
Miller 's son Greg says his father did n't want his legacy to be about his commercial ventures , but rather in the things he did to create opportunities for others .
" He felt that both of those things [ job opportunities and higher education ] would create opportunities for people , once they went into those experiences , to reach out and hopefully have their turn to make life better for others , " he said .
Miller coined the phrase " Go about doing good until there is too much good in the world . "
He established the Larry H. Miller Charities , which was funded by fundraising events and through contributions from his various businesses and from employees .
Through that cause , Miller donated millions of dollars to the community .
Miller and his wife Gail have given out 300 college scholarships a year .
" Larry and Gail have always stressed the importance of giving back to the communities in which we do business .
Our customers have supported us and it is important that we show our appreciation by helping those in need , " said Greg Miller , eldest son and CEO of the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies .
" Larry felt that his legacy is n't in business as much as it was in creating opportunities for good jobs and higher education , " he said .
According to a press release issued by the Larry H. Miller Group , he and his wife donated millions of dollars to Utah - based colleges and universities for campus improvements such as the state - of - the - art softball and baseball complexes at BYU .
The Larry H. Miller Campus of the Salt Lake Community College , was completed in fall 2001 and includes the Larry H. Miller Entrepreneurship Training Center and The Larry and Gail Miller Public Safety Education & Training Center .
His commercials included the tag line , " After all , you know this guy . "
And with his larger - than - life public persona , many Utahns felt as if that were true .
Hundreds of Utahns , both those who knew him personally and those who knew him only as a public figure , are leaving their condolences on KSL.com .
Timeline of health failings
June 10 Miller was hospitalized with " complications from diabetes . "
We later learned he had suffered a heart attack and kidney failure .
July 16 , Miller stepped down as CEO of the Larry H. Miller group of companies , turning those responsibilities over to his son , Greg .
January 23 , he had his legs amputated below the knee
February 12 , Miller received news that he was suffering from calciphylaxis and had just days to live .

Surely it 's time to rethink this resistance to government acting as an agent of the common good .
And maybe it 's time for a little humility on the part of a financial elite that long has enjoyed such deference while turning out to be so spectacularly inept .

Let 's imagine , for a moment , how different the public debate would be today if it had been unions that had caused the current economic turmoil .
In other words , try to imagine a scenario in which union leaders - not financial managers - were the ones whose reckless behaviour had driven a number of Wall Street firms into bankruptcy and in the process triggered a worldwide recession .
Needless to say , it 's hard to imagine a labour leader being appointed to oversee a bailout of unions the way former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson was put in charge of supervising the $ 700 billion bailout of his former Wall Street colleagues .
My point is simply to note how odd it is that the financial community has emerged so unscathed , despite its central role in the collapse that has brought havoc to the world economy .
Of course , not all members of the financial community were involved in Wall Street 's wildly irresponsible practices of bundling mortgages into securities and trading credit default swaps .
But the financial community as a whole , on both sides of the border , certainly pushed hard to put in place an agenda of small government , in which financial markets largely regulated themselves and citizens ( particularly high - income investors ) would be spared the burden of paying much tax .
The agenda advanced much further in the U.S. , but had an impact in Canada , particularly on the tax front .
One would think that those who pushed this agenda so enthusiastically would , at the very least , be a tad embarrassed today .
But so influential are those in the financial elite - and their hangers - on in think - tanks and economics departments - that they continue to appear on our TV screens , confidently providing us with economic advice , as if they 'd played no role whatsoever in shaping our economic system for the past quarter century .
Of course , we 're told there 's been a major change in their thinking , in that many of them are now willing to accept large deficits in today 's federal budget , in the name of stimulating the economy .
While this does seem like a sharp departure from the deficit hysteria of the 1990s , a closer look reveals the change may not be that significant .
In fact , financial types have always accepted deficits - when they liked the cause .
Hence their lack of protest over George W. Bush 's enormous deficits , which were caused by his large tax cuts for the rich and his extravagant foreign wars .
What they do n't like is governments going into deficit to help ordinary citizens - either by creating jobs or providing much unemployment relief .
So the Canadian financial community has been urging that the stimulus package consist mostly of income tax cuts - even though direct government spending would provide much more stimulus and do more to help the neediest .
If the Harper government follows the financial community 's advice , we will simply move further along with the small government revolution launched by Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s .
Of course , tax cuts are not the same as financial deregulation .
But they are twin prongs of a bundled package aimed at reducing the power of government to operate in the public interest .

OAKLAND , CALIF .
— When Jack Jenkins - Stark was offered the job of chief financial officer two years ago at BrightSource Energy , a newly formed solar power start - up based here , he hesitated .
" I came at it with a very cynical view , " says Jenkins - Stark , 58 , who had spent more than 20 years at Pacific Gas & Electric , the northern California utility company , before settling into a comfortable job as CFO of Silicon Valley Bank .
There was no doubt , he thought , that BrightSource 's technology was promising .
Founded by the same technical team that built some of the earliest solar power facilities in the California desert in the 1980s , the company had plans to build a series of sprawling new solar power plants across Southern California .
Instead of relying on photovoltaic panels to generate energy or using the sun 's rays to heat oil - filled pipes , as the early solar power projects had done , BrightSource was testing a next - generation solar array with thousands of small mirrors installed in a circle around a central tower holding a water - filled boiler .
The reflected sunlight heated the water into steam , which turned a turbine .
Voilà , sun-powered , utility - scale electricity , all at a price , according to the company , comparable to burning fossil fuels .
It was n't the technology that made Jenkins - Stark nervous .
And it was n't the looming recession , either , though the slowing economy and the disappearance of credit would soon put the nascent solar industry 's very survival at risk .
No , for Jenkins - Stark , the problem was political .
" I 'd seen this movie before , " he says .
" I 've seen everybody up in arms about oil prices ; I 've seen everybody up in arms over security of supply . "
And he'd seen the early attempts at building solar power in the California desert falter when the crisis passed and renewables could n't compete with the falling price of natural gas .
But something about BrightSource 's idea and the promise of a head - to - head race with fossil fuels won him over .
That and the fast - changing political climate , in which presidential candidates from both parties were publicly throwing their support behind renewable energy .
" This time , I really believed it was different , " says Jenkins - Stark .
" I jumped in with both feet . "
As recently as last summer , when solar and wind projects were being feted by policymakers and investors alike , there was no question he had made a good decision .
Jenkins - Stark joined a company and an industry that appeared to be on the march .
Nearly $ 5 billion in venture funds poured into clean tech in 2008 .
And BrightSource , in particular , after raising $ 160 million from investors ranging from Google to Chevron , seemed to be in all the right places at all the right times .
The company found its first customer in PG&E , which , like all California utilities , is required by law to purchase at least 20 percent of its power from renewable - energy producers by next year .
The utility agreed to buy 900 megawatts from BrightSource , about one fourth of its total renewable - energy portfolio .
Some outsiders questioned the move , claiming solar technology could n't produce hot - enough steam at a low - enough cost to compete with fossil fuels .
But last summer , BrightSource opened a demonstration facility in Israel that showcased its technology .
Verified by an independent engineer , it was proof positive utility - scale solar worked .
On the verge .
BrightSource seemed to be poised to take the next step .
It was only a year away from construction on its first 400 - megawatt solar plant , called Ivanpah , near the Nevada border .
The new facility would provide enough electricity to power 140,000 homes , nearly doubling the capacity of utility - scale solar power production in the United States .
Then , suddenly , the economy ground to a halt .
Lehman Brothers went under , the gears of the financial system locked up , and for much of the solar industry the music stopped .
For months , Jenkins - Stark watched investors veer away from his industry , leery of the hefty price tag on new power plants .
After years of trying to convince skeptics that their technology was legitimate , start - ups like BrightSource discovered that finding funding now trumped all other concerns .
" In September , I would have said it looked like a good tropical storm , where we could ride it out and be fine , " says Jenkins - Stark .
" Now , it looks like it was a hurricane followed by another hurricane . "
Sitting in his company 's offices overlooking the Oakland shipyards , BrightSource 's CEO , John Woolard , still uses the word fortunate to describe his start - up 's predicament .
" I ca n't say I predicted anything that 's happened , " he says .
But the company 's luck , as the market disintegrated around it , appeared to hold .
BrightSource still had plenty of cash in the bank , and the Ivanpah project , scheduled to begin construction this fall , would n't need any major infusion of capital until this summer .
" I have good friends in the wind business who were in the middle of financing plants [ when the market collapsed ] , " says Woolard .
" All project financing just stopped .
Nothing happened in the industry .
It was a complete freeze for months . "
Holding fast .
The lack of credit began to inflict casualties across renewable energy .
One of BrightSource 's major competitors , Ausra , a well - funded Silicon Valley start - up that had been touted as a leader in the race to build the next generation of solar power plants , decided the market simply would n't allow it , opting to become an equipment supplier instead .
Start - ups began letting employees go , hoping to stay solvent until more funding appeared .
BrightSource , with 30 employees in Oakland and nearly 100 in Israel , held fast .
Outside analysts were busy trying to gauge who would survive and who would not .
" These companies are all in a tricky spot , " says Reese Tisdale , research director for solar power at Emerging Energy Research in Cambridge , Mass .
" They 've raised the capital to start their projects , but the next step is to cross the valley of death to get to commercial delivery .
Some of them should be able to get through this , but there 's a lot of shuffling going on . "
The biggest hurdle for companies like BrightSource is the amount of money a start - up in the energy industry eventually requires .
" Power plants are costly things , " says Alan Salzman , CEO of VantagePoint Venture Partners , one of BrightSource 's original investors .
" This is n't three guys with a couple of servers who can scale by buying a few used Dells . "
Outside analysts believe the Ivanpah facility alone will cost over $ 1 billion , more than 20 percent of the total investment venture capitalists made across all of clean tech last year .
And it could be just the first of dozens of solar power plants that might pop up in the Southwest over the next decade .
" Venture capital is small dollars , " says Woolard .
" Power plants are big dollars . "
With the banks in deep freeze , though , exactly where the big dollars would come from was a mystery .
Through the first few months of this year , BrightSource turned its attention , instead , to what it could control .
One team worked on permits for the Ivanpah site ; another made preparations to link the plant to nearby power lines .
Others were scouting new locations for future plants .
BrightSource announced a few more deals , including a contract with Siemens to build its first solar - powered steam generator , which will be the largest machine of its kind ever built .
The company also found another customer : Southern California Edison , the utility that supplies electricity to Los Angeles , agreed to purchase 1,300 megawatts from BrightSource — enough energy to power 850,000 homes .
The mood in the solar industry may have been somber , but Woolard and Jenkins - Stark were keeping their chins up .
" This is one of those things where I went from thinking it was a 10,000 - foot mountain to climb and realizing it was 29,000 feet , " says Woolard .
Still , he felt his company was in good shape , so long as the credit markets opened up again .
" You can get up Everest , " he insists , " if you prepare , you plan , you think , and you do it right . "
Especially , it turns out , if the federal government offers a helping hand .
When the $ 787 billion stimulus bill was signed in February , there were more than a few sighs of relief at BrightSource .
The bill showered renewable energy with new funds , including $ 60 billion in loan guarantees for companies building wind and solar plants .
BrightSource was among a small group of start - ups that had already been selected for Department of Energy loans , but the stimulus vastly increased the funds available .
It also loosened rules governing tax credits , greatly expanding the pool of potential investors .
After months of wondering where to turn for funding , BrightSource had been given a reprieve .
" Now , all of a sudden , " says Jenkins - Stark , " I have a very different worry proposition for half the capital of our project . "
While BrightSource may have found a way to build its first plant without government backing , analysts say , the stimulus will certainly help .
" The financing just was n't there in this climate , " says Brian Fan , director of research at the Cleantech Group , a San Francisco research firm .
" But now , existing projects in the pipeline , especially renewable - generation projects that have good strong companies behind them like BrightSource , will be considered very favorably . "
BrightSource execs recognize that they can't get ahead of themselves .
They have yet to break ground at Ivanpah , and the plant , even if it goes up on schedule , wo n't begin operations until at least 2011 .
Still , as he leaves what he hopes will be the worst of the company 's financial problems behind , Jenkins - Stark is willing to talk about solar energy 's big dreams once again .
" I think we have the ingredients to be the largest solar technology developer and owner of solar assets in the world , " he says .
" I 've seen this movie before , but this time , it 's real . "
IronPython opens up the world of .NET to Python programmers .
It ’s not as good yet at opening up the world of Python to .NET programmers .
It is easy to write .NET applications in IronPython .
I typed in some sample code within a few minutes of installing IronPython and made a very simple Windows application .
But I was also interested in going the other way around .
I was hoping to use IronPython to expose Python library functionality ( specifically SciPy ) to C# .
This may be possible , but it ’s swimming upstream .
There are two issues .
First , calling Python from C# is more complicated than I ’d expected .
In hindsight it makes sense that it should be easier to call statically - typed languages from dynamically - typed languages than the other way around .
I would n’t be surprised if IronRuby has an analogous problem .
Second , even if you ’re only using IronPython , not calling it from another language , there are problems calling some Python modules .
I asked a question about SciPy and IronPython on StackOverflow and got two excellent answers .
First , “ NXC ” explained that modules written in pure Python will work with IronPython , but modules written in C will not work directly .
Anything with components written in C ( for example NumPy , which is a component of SciPy ) will not work on IronPython as the external language interface works differently .
Any C language component will probably not work unless it has been explicitly ported to work with IronPython .
That ’s disappointing , but it makes sense .
Second , “ wilberforce ” pointed out an open source project , Ironclad , that might fill in the gap .
Some of my workmates are working on Ironclad , a project that will make extension modules for CPython work in IronPython .
It ’s still in development , but parts of numpy , scipy and some other modules already work .
You should try it out to see whether the parts of scipy you need are supported .

The ease of Python , SQLite , and Storm
I began learning Python this spring , and I must say , the more I program in it the more I like it .
I chose the language because of the libraries that are available for it .
There is a library for everything . :)
Also , there are tools for Natural Language Processing that are a great help , but that ’s for another time and another post .
I was originally thinking about using Postgres , and it would probably give me better speed and scalability .
But then , I began to think if I really needed a full RDBMS for my application .
After all , I ’m not expecting the project to get too large , and being able to easily move it from one computer to another by just moving a single files sounds very convenient .
SQLite has a great page to see if it ’s right for you .
I ended up settling on SQLite , and so far am happy with the decision .
Installing SQLite was a breeze .
I just opened the package manager in openSuSE and installed the packages .
I also installed the python Storm package .
There is no daemon process , as there is with Postgres , because you ’re just accessing one file on your filesystem .
There is a great tool for setting up a SQLite database called SQLite Manager .
It will let you create tables , view your data , and run queries .
The fact that it ’s available as a firefox extention makes it easy to install on many platforms .
Now is when the real fun begins .
Enter Storm .
Storm is an object relation mapping ( ORM ) tool for Python .
It allows you to manipulate the database through the manipulation of Python objects .
After you map your python objects to database tables , you manipulate them , and your changes will show up in the database for you .
I ’ve used other ORM tools in the past ( Hibernate for Java ) , but I was amazed at the simplicity of the setup / configuration step when using Storm .
It takes two lines to connect to your sqlite database :
DATABASE = create_database ( ' sqlite : db_name ' ) # or simply create_database ( ' sqlite : ' ) for in - memory STORE = Store ( DATABASE ) DATABASE = create_database ( ' sqlite : db_name ' ) # or simply create_database ( ' sqlite : ' ) for in - memory STORE = Store ( DATABASE )
Mapping a class to a table can be done with ease .
Here is an example of one of my classes :
class Sentence ( object ) : __storm_table__ = " TABLE_SENT " sent_id = Int ( primary = True ) loc_id = Int ( ) location = Reference ( loc_id , Location .
loc_id ) sentence = Unicode ( ) def __init__ ( self , sent , loc = None ) : if loc : self .
location = loc # sent cannot be None if not isinstance ( sent , unicode ) : self .
sentence = unicode ( sent , " utf - 8 " ) else : self .
sentence = sent class Sentence ( object ) : __storm_table__ = " TABLE_SENT " sent_id = Int( primary = True ) loc_id = Int ( ) location = Reference ( loc_id , Location.loc_id ) sentence = Unicode ( ) def __init__ ( self , sent , loc = None ) : if loc : self.location = loc # sent cannot be None if not isinstance ( sent , unicode ) : self . sentence = unicode ( sent , " utf - 8 " ) else : self . sentence = sent
If you access loc_id , it will give you the database id .
If you access the variable without location through a Reference , it will hand you the corresponding database object .
Now , I set this up in about 45 minutes from start to finish , so it might need some more fiddling , but overall it seems to work pretty well .
I needed to set something up in one night to keep moving on other parts of the project , and this allowed me to .
It ca n’t all be sunshine and rainbows , there was one thing that tripped me up a bit .
Being new to Python , I was n’t aware of the u” String ” for unicode .
It was used in their examples , and after I got an error assumed that ’s what it was for , but it tripped me up .
As you can see in my constructor , I added some code to handle the case when a string that is n’t unicode is passed in .
As I get into the more advanced aspects of SQLite / Storm , I hope I continue to be impressed .
Forget the Mayans and their silly 2012 doomsday scenario .

From the Chicago Fed : Index shows economic activity remained low in January ( ht Misha )
The Chicago Fed National Activity Index was – 3.45 in January , up slightly from – 3.65 in December .
All four broad categories of indicators made negative contributions to the index in January .
The three - month moving average , CFNAI - MA3 , decreased to – 3.41 in January from – 2.70 in the previous month , reaching its lowest level since 1975 .
...
The production and income category of indicators made a large negative contribution of – 1.35 to the index in January after contributing – 1.53 in December .
Total industrial production decreased 1.8 percent in January after declining 2.4 percent in the previous month .
In particular , manufacturing production of durable goods declined 4.8 percent in January , marking its largest one - month decline since December 1974 .

UBS ’s offshore private banking business once employed some 60 private bankers in Lugano , Zurich and Geneva .
Prosecutors claimed UBS referred clients to lawyers and accountants who set up secret offshore entities to conceal assets from the I.R.S .
UBS urged some American clients to destroy records and to stash watches , jewelry and artwork that they had bought with money hidden offshore in safe deposit boxes in Switzerland .
The bank also encouraged them to use Swiss credit cards so the I.R.S. could not track purchases .
In a statement on Wednesday , Peter Kurer , the chairman of UBS , said that “ UBS sincerely regrets the compliance failures in its U.S. cross -border business that have been identified by the various government investigations in Switzerland and the U.S. , as well as our own internal review .
We accept full responsibility for these improper activities . ”
Marcel Rohner , the group chief executive of UBS , said in a statement that “ it is apparent that as an organization we made mistakes and that our control systems were inadequate . ”
In January a senior UBS executive , Raoul Weil , was declared a fugitive , two months after being indicted by a federal judge in connection with the investigation of the bank .
Mr. Weil , a Swiss citizen , oversaw the cross - border private banking operations from 2002 to 2007 .
UBS had fiercely resisted turning over the names , even after some executives were indicted and implicated in the offshore private banking business .
Swiss law distinguishes broadly between tax avoidance , tax evasion and tax fraud .
Unlike in the United States , tax evasion is not a criminal offense under Swiss law .
The move by UBS to settle the case , on the eve of a Senate subcommittee hearing next Tuesday on the matter , signals how close the bank came to being indicted for not cooperating with prosecutors .
Indictment is a near - certain death knell for corporations .
Of the $ 780 million that UBS will pay , $ 380 million represents disgorgement of profits from its cross - border business .
The remainder represents United States taxes that UBS failed to withhold on the accounts .
The figures include interest , penalties and restitution for unpaid taxes

Draft sequence opens window on human relatives .
The entire genome of a 38,000 - year - old Neanderthal has been sequenced by a team of scientists in Germany .
The group is already extracting DNA from other ancient Neanderthal bones and hopes that the genomes will allow an unprecedented comparison between modern humans and their closest evolutionary relative .
The three - year project , which cost about € 5 million ( US $ 6.4 million ) , was carried out at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig .
Project leader Svante Pääbo will announce the results of the preliminary genomic analysis at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Chicago , Illinois , which starts on 12 February .
" We are working like crazy at the moment , " says Pääbo , adding that his Max Planck colleague , computational biologist Richard Green , is coordinating the analysis of the genome 's 3 billion base pairs .
Comparisons with the human genome may uncover evidence of interbreeding between Neanderthals and humans , the genomes of which overlap by more than 99 % .
They certainly had enough time for fraternization —
Homo sapiens emerged as a separate species by about 400,000 years ago , and Neanderthals became extinct just 30,000 years ago .
Their last common ancestor lived about 660,000 years ago , give or take 140,000 years .
The genome may also deliver more details about how these species developed their different physical traits , adapted to their environment and evolved to fight disease .
Despite previous reports that the German group 's Neanderthal samples may have been contaminated with DNA from modern humans1 , an analysis of a Neanderthal mitochondrial genome2 has allowed the researchers to largely rule out such contamination .
" I have every reason to believe this is going to be authentic Neanderthal sequence , " says Edward Rubin , director of the US Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek , California , which is also sequencing Neanderthal DNA and has collaborated with the German group in the past3 .
Almost all of the Neanderthal genome to be unveiled in Chicago comes from DNA extracted from a single bone originally discovered in a cave near Vindija in Croatia .
The age of the sample means that its DNA has degraded into fragments typically only about 50 – 60 base pairs long .
But the German group used new sequencing technology , developed by 454 Life Sciences of Branford , Connecticut , that can analyse segments of this length .
The German team has recently extracted DNA from the bones of five other Neanderthals — and so is well on the way to creating a library of Neanderthal genomes that would allow stronger comparisons with modern humans .

Rubin 's group is also sequencing Neanderthal DNA from the Croatian bone , and is trying to find other specimens to work on ; as are other teams in France and Spain .
Pääbo says that his group will publish a first draft of the entire Neanderthal genome later this year , as a single read of all base pairs .
However , some published human genomes had all their base pairs read eight to ten times before publication .
The team says that its single - read of the Neanderthal genome is sufficient for publication because the technique used does not rely on the same DNA reassembly process used in conventional ' shotgun ' sequencing .
In the finest traditions of his calling , the Barclays whistleblower has lobbed a sizeable hand grenade into his own place of work , no doubt sending both his bosses and colleagues diving for cover .
In doing so , he has shed some fascinating light upon the bank 's highly secretive , enormously lucrative and – we should stress – entirely legal tax - dodging operation .
But he has done much more than this .
He also provided a 3,200 - word covering letter that offers a vivid picture of life at the heart of this anxiety - ridden and testosterone - powered enterprise .
Along with the documentation that Vince Cable , the recipient of the letter , felt compelled to pass on to HM Revenue & Customs , the whistleblower has given us Fear and Loathing in Canary Wharf .
" Hidden away on the top floor of 5 The North Colonnade sit the formidable Barcap SCM ( Structured Capital Markets ) team , " he writes .
" A team of some 110 people with the sole purpose of structuring tax - aggressive transactions to avoid tax not only for Barclays but also for banks and companies across the world .
Once upon a time the story was about the avoidance of UK tax , this rapidly expanded into the avoidance of US tax too but now the business has grown to encompass Europe , Brazil , the Middle East , South Africa and other emerging markets .
" It is true to say no other tax arbitrage team has the financial resources or the senior management support from the very top that the SCM team enjoys at Barclays .
Indeed many joke within SCM that they are the tax structuring market , thinking up all the ideas in all the major jurisdictions , sourcing the counterparties , instructing counsel ( for themselves as well as for the counterparty ) and executing the trade for both sides .
Indeed all the counterparty need do is turn up , sign some documents and collect a large sum of money from the fiscal authorities .
" Where the world sees turmoil and destruction , the leaders of SCM see opportunities arising from tax loss exploitation and corporate restructurings throwing up all sorts of new and juicy areas of the tax code which can be profitably exploited .
For the last 10 years the SCM team has generated a formidable amount of profit peaking in the last few years at circa £ 1bn per annum . "
( Barclays disputes this figure . )
The whistleblower could not be more scathing about the organisation 's managers .
One , he declares , " rules over all in his world through fear " , a second has an intimidating manner and " resembles a stock cube " , and a third metaphorically clubs members of his team in a manner " similar to that of the clubbing of baby seals " .
There is one individual with " a fearsome reputation of extracting revenge on employees for the mildest of errors , " he writes .
" It was widely known that if you even looked at ( this man ) the wrong way in the lift you would that afternoon receive a call to attend a meeting in the Plaza room of 5 The North Colonnade where the unlucky SCMer would be met by a HR member and a crisp P45 .
( This man ) likes to make sure this process is well known to all as it does wonders . "
Not that these people are to be confused with interesting folk , he cautions .
" Normally a man who has made the study of the taxes act and the accounting legislation a priority above all other things in life would be looked upon with some surprise .
But within SCM these men are Masters of the Universe commanding multimillion pound bonuses and publicly humiliating those of lesser knowledge .
These men are not the types who will light up a party and tend only to be able to communicate through snorts and grunts whilst thumbing the pages of Tolley 's Yellow Tax Handbook .
Hand - picked from the major accountancy firms ... ( they ) craft structures spanning the globe of such complexity that one wonders whether they ever have the time or the interest to do anything else in their life other than draw countless boxes on paper . "
The organisation is expanding in the US , he writes .
In New York , he says , the 15 - strong team has been " swelled by the numbers from the Lehman acquisition , to establish a US business aimed at destroying rivals and taking the new administration in Washington head on .
Indeed , with a new administration burdened with two wars , economic meltdown and the choice of new drapes for the White House , SCM management is banking on the administration taking their eye off the ball . "
The whistleblower concludes by explaining to Cable why he has sent him the documents .
" The last year has seen the global taxpayer having to rescue the global financial system .
The taxpayer has already had a gun put to their head and been told to pay up or to watch the financial system and life as we know it disappear into a black hole .
It is increasingly difficult to accept that an unintended consequence of saving the financial system is that teams such as SCM will grow more aggressively to reduce tax globally whilst their competitors wilt under increased government scrutiny ( as a result of the UK and US governments taking stakes in these banks ) .
Banks should now be encouraged to pay a fair tax ( and restrict the sizes of their SCM teams ) on their profits given the service provided by society to banks thereby easing the pain taxpayers all face today . "
He writes that the way in which SCM reduces tax " has made many in the industry feel uncomfortable especially when this means less hospitals and less schools being built " during a recession .
" It is a commonly held view that no agency in the US or the UK ( and least of all the European agencies ) has the resources or the commitment to challenge SCM .
SCM has a huge amount of resources , the best minds rewarded with millions of pounds .
Compare this with HMRC recently advertising for a tax and accounting expert with the pay at £ 45,000 .
The Revenue will always be behind the curve .
Indeed even the recent much - trumpeted disclosure regime has no impact on SCM as through the use of lawyers and client confidentiality SCM regularly circumvent these rules , just one example of why HMRC will never , in its current state , be up to the job of combating this business . "
And with a flourish , the poacher - turned - gamekeeper makes his final point : " An open debate on the future of banks promoting aggressive tax trades is necessary , especially now given the role of public money in saving the global financial system . "
This becomes obvious when looking at the pages of certain washed - up celebrities , and the results are equal parts hilarious and sad .

It 's almost as if the author desperately needs us to know that Feldman has indeed accomplished something with his adult life ( hint : he has n't ) .
Perhaps the best thing about Corey Feldman 's Wikipedia article is that contained within its murky bowels is an almost supernaturally shameless plug for his latest ( and most ambitious ! ) crappy album .

FOR a nation seeking unity , a recipe has swept the Internet that seems to unite conservatives and liberals , gun owners and foodies , carnivores and ... well , not vegetarians and health fanatics .
Certainly not the vegetarians and health fanatics .
This recipe is the Bacon Explosion , modestly called by its inventors “ the BBQ Sausage Recipe of all Recipes . ”
The instructions for constructing this massive torpedo - shaped amalgamation of two pounds of bacon woven through and around two pounds of sausage and slathered in barbecue sauce first appeared last month on the Web site of a team of Kansas City competition barbecuers .
They say a diverse collection of well over 16,000
Web sites have linked to the recipe , celebrating , or sometimes scolding , its excessiveness .
A fresh audience could be ready to discover it on Super Bowl Sunday .
Where once homegrown recipes were disseminated in Ann Landers columns or Junior League cookbooks , new media have changed — and greatly accelerated — the path to popularity .
Few recipes have cruised down this path as fast or as far as the Bacon Explosion , and this turns out to be no accident .
One of its inventors works as an Internet marketer , and had a sophisticated understanding of how the latest tools of promotion could be applied to a four - pound roll of pork .
The Bacon Explosion was born shortly before Christmas in Roeland Park , Kan. , in Jason Day ’s kitchen .
He and Aaron Chronister , who anchor a barbecue team called Burnt Finger BBQ , were discussing a challenge from a bacon lover they received on their Twitter text - messaging service :
What could the barbecuers do with bacon ?
Research led by the University of Warwick has found a way to use doughnut shaped by - products of quantum dots to slow and even freeze light , opening up a wide range of possibilities from reliable and effective light based computing to the possibility of " slow glass " .
The key to this new research is the “ exciton ” .
This describes the pairing of an electron that has been kicked into a higher energy state by a photon , with a hole or gap it ( or another electron ) leaves within the shell or orbit around the nucleus of an atom .
Despite its new high energy state the electron remains paired with one of the holes or positions that has been vacated by electrons moving to a higher energy state .
When an electron ’s high energy state decays again it is drawn back to the hole it is linked to and a photon is once again emitted .
That cycle usually happens very quickly but if one could find a way to freeze or hold an exciton in place for any length of time one could delay the reemitting of a photon and effectively slow or even freeze light .
The researchers , led by PhD researcher Andrea Fischer and Dr. Rudolf A. Roemer from the University of Warwick ’s Department of Physics , looked at the possibilities presented by some tiny rings of matter accidentally made during the manufacture quantum dots .
When creating these very small quantum dots of a few 10 - 100 nm in size physicists some times cause the material to splash when depositing it onto a surface leaving , not a useful dot , but a doughnut shaped ring of material .
Though originally created by accident these “ Aharonov - Bohm nano rings ” are now a source of study in their own right and in this case seemed just the right size for enclosing an exciton .
However simply being this useful size does not , in itself , allow them to contain or hold an exciton for any length of time .
However remarkably the Warwick led research team have found that if a combination of magnetic and electric fields is applied to these nano - rings they can actually then simply tune the electric field to freeze an exciton in place or let it collapse and re-emit a photon .
While other researchers have used varying exotic states of matter to dramatically slow the progress of light this is the first time a technique has been devised to completely freeze and release individual photons at will .
Dr Roemer said :
“ This has significant implications for the development of light based computing which would require an effective and reliable mechanism such as this to manipulate light . “
The technique could also be used to develop a “ buffer ” of incoming photons which could re-release them in sequence at a later date thus creating an effect not unlike the concept of “ Slow Glass ” first suggested by science fiction author Bob Shaw several decades ago .
The new research paper is entitled “ Exciton storage in a nanoscale Aharonov - Bohm ring with electric field tuning " by University of Warwick PhD student Andrea M. Fischer , Dr Rudolf Roemer ( University of Warwick ) Vivaldo L. Campo Jr. ( Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos - UFSCar , Brazil ) , and Mikhail E. Portnoi ( University of Exeter ) , and has just been published in Physical Review Letters ( PRL )

“ If the situation progresses , we will be just like India ... They are busy building public fountains when we do n’t have water in the sink . ”
- Abdulalah F. Alafar , director of the Maryam Establishment for Children charity in Baghdad .
The American invasion of Iraq has left quite a legacy .
We 've lost billions of dollars in cash meant for Iraq 's reconstruction , while the women left widows by our bombing sell themselves for enough money to survive :
Among Iraqi women aged 15 to 80 , 1 in 11 are estimated to be widows , though officials admit that figure is hardly more than a guess , given the continuing violence and the displacement of millions of people .
A United Nations report estimated that during the height of sectarian violence here in 2006 , 90 to 100 women were widowed each day .
In large cities like Baghdad , the presence of war widows is difficult to ignore .
Cloaked in black abayas , they wade through columns of cars idling at security checkpoints , asking for money or food .
They wait in line outside mosques for free blankets , or sift through mounds of garbage piled along the street .
Some live with their children in public parks or inside gas station restrooms .
Officials at social service agencies tell of widows coerced into “ temporary marriages ” — relationships sanctioned by Shiite tradition , often based on sex , which can last from an hour to years — to get financial help from government , religious or tribal leaders .
Other war widows have become prostitutes , and some have joined the insurgency in exchange for steady pay .
The Iraqi military estimates that the number of widows who have become suicide bombers may be in the dozens .
In the past several weeks , even as the government has formed commissions to study the problem , it has begun a campaign to arrest beggars and the homeless , including war widows .
[...]
Efforts to increase the government stipend for widows — currently about $ 50 a month and an additional $ 12 per child — have stalled .
By comparison , the price of a five - liter container of gasoline , used for cars as well as home generators , is about $ 4 .
Still , only about 120,000 widows — roughly one in six — receive any state aid , according to government figures .
Widows and their advocates say that to receive benefits they must either have political connections or agree to temporary marriages with the powerful men who control the distribution of government funds .
“ It is blackmail , ” said Samira al - Mosawi , chairwoman of the women ’s affairs committee in Parliament .
“ We have no law to treat this point .
Widows do n’t need temporary support , but a permanent solution . ”
The latest plan , proposed by Mazin al - Shihan , director of the Baghdad Displacement Committee , a city agency , is to pay men to marry widows .
“ There is no serious effort by the national government to fix this problem , so I presented my own program , ” he said .
When asked why the money should not go directly to the women , Mr. Shihan laughed .
“ If we give the money to the widows , they will spend it unwisely because they are uneducated and they do n’t know about budgeting , ” he said .
“ But if we find her a husband , there will be a person in charge of her and her children for the rest of their lives .
This is according to our tradition and our laws . ”
From the outside , I appear to be a set in my ways and highly structured .
Every Tuesday night you will find our family dining at Atlanta Bread and afterwards letting our girls run wild at Barnes & Noble .
Like clockwork , Saturday mornings means pulling the trifecta of bagels , Target and Costco .
Sadly , or should I say pathetically , numerous evenings are centered on when the television shows I ca n’t miss are playing .
If heaven forbid there is a rerun , I am beside myself as to what to do .
The insanity of being a man who ‘ likes what he likes . ’ even trickles down to what I eat .
My drink of choice is caffeine free Diet Coke .
Only one flavor of ice cream will do : chocolate chip cookie dough .
I might get a bad case of the Outback ’s after every time I dine there , but the fact remains I do n’t have to open my menu knowing I ’ll get the Outback Special with Aussie Cheese Fries every time .
Since I was 14 years old , Santa has always left Hot Tamales and Slim Jim ’s in my stockings , along with gym socks for some odd reason .
There will be some who think I am taking creative liberties and stretching the truth to serve my own purpose of making a point .
However , I invite those individuals to join me for lunch at the Subway in downtown Wilmington , NC and watch what happens when I walk in the door .
I can guarantee you that the lady behind the counter will instinctively prepare the ‘ usual ’ , which is a turkey and pepper jack cheese on honey oat bread .
The predictability of my life shows up in other ways .
Turn on my ‘ in town ’ car and sports talk will be playing on the radio .
When I hop behind the wheel you could blindfold me and not be scared to ride shotgun .
I ’ll take the routes I know without ever veering off course .
After work I ’ll drive by Auto Wholesale and lust after cars that are way out of my price range .
The madness of the mundane continues even further .
Some believe the information you can find off websites goes on forever , but after checking Facebook , Twitter , ESPN and my fantasy sports team , I feel like I have finally reached the end of the Internet .
Ask me to help with a task at work and you can be guaranteed your typical “ yes ” man will oblige .
When I ’ve mentioned to family and friends that for the month of March I am focusing on dealing with my indecisiveness , almost always a puzzled look comes across their face .
You indecisive they say as they scratch their heads .
I have to fight the urge not to crack a smile .
It looks like my diabolical scheme has worked flawlessly .
My routine life has masked my indecisiveness .
I am a magician of the mundane .
In a way , I ’ve distracted them through sure boredom .

Backdrop for a 1907 Bailout
With its Renaissance furnishings and Circassian walnut doors , J.P. Morgan 's private study was once deemed America ’s most beautiful room .
It was also where he gathered the nation ’s top financial figures to rescue the economy during the Panic of 1907 .

“ Has anyone else noticed that the current crisis sheds light on one of the great controversies of economic history ? ”
Paul Krugman asked his readers back in Novermber last year .
In fact on reading this I felt immediately filled with the urge to stand on my chair and shout out loud across the Atlantic to him “ Hi Prof , yes me ” , since – to plagiarise a phrase from Robert Lucas – scarcely a day has passed since the 9 August 2007 ( the day PNB Paribas found themselves short of $ 2 billion dollars to “ close ” their books ) when I have not been thinking about this .
In fact , despite the many bad things that can obviously be said about the present crisis , it does have one saving virtue – it enables many of us economists to get “ close up and personal ” and take a ringside seat and really see for ourselves , and at first hand , just how things may actually have worked back then .
In this sense I would like to extend my profound thanks and deep gratitude to each and everyone of the 45 million Spanish men and women and the 140 million odd Russians who are idling away their time at the moment running round and round the treadmill , all in the cause of helping me triangulate , and sort out a few nagging questions that have been haunting me ever since my late adolesence .
Monetary Policy On The Zero Bound
The controversy to which Krugman refers relates to the role of monetary policy in what we could call “ extreme situations ” .
For present purposes we could describe an extreme situation as one in which either ( or both ) a severe credit crunch and a liquidity trap are present .
The liquidity trap would normally be associated with the presence of general consumer price deflation , while former may ( or may not ) be , but if it is , then this certainly complicates things a lot .
But before I go any further , what do we really mean by a credit crunch , and what is a liquidity trap ?
Crunch , Crunch , Crunch
One of the things which central bankers have historically spent most time lying awake at night thinking about ( since it tends to produce a severe loss of effectiveness in conventional monetary policy ) is the arrival of what we nowadays call a “ credit crunch ” .
Such a credit crunch normally consists of a sharp contraction in the supply of bank credit as a result of a massive loss of inter - bank trust which is produced by the accumulation of a large quantity of nonperforming loans and semi- worthless assets inside the financial system .
There will be close to no growth in lending by Spanish banks in 2009 as the economy contracts , the head of Spanish bank Sabadell said on Tuesday .
“ Credit this year is going to grow by zero or nearly zero due to the steep adjustment in the economy as it undergoes deleveraging , ” Sabadell ’s Chief Executive Officer Jaime Guardiola told a press breakfast .
Such a crunch would normally have two components ; a ) a decline in bank capital due to the accumulation of bad loans held by the banking sector with a resulting fall in the capital asset ratio large financial institutions .
The banks normally respond to such a situation by reducing the amount of loans they are prepared to supply and ; b ) the emergence of a cautious lending attitude on the part of banks following their experience with a combination of bankruptcies , nonperforming loans , and recession .
Such circumstances make firms and households less desirable potential borrowers than they used to be , and they also have the self - reinforcing effect of tightening credit conditions and worsening the developing recession , which is , of course , itself partly a by - product of the initial credit crunch .
Thus when the thing locks tight , you need more than some 3 in 1 rapid - ease to unlock it .
Credit crunches are thus normally characterised by the fact that – despite the presence of a low interest rate environment – a sharp tightening of credit conditions occurs .
The “ lending attitudes ” of financial institutions , at least from the borrower ’s perspective , suddenly become much more stringent .
A credit crunch implies that injections of liquidity ( expansions in base and narrow money ) do not increase private credit and aggregate lending .
This is exactly what we have seen happening in Japan from the mid 1990s onwards .
Base and narrow money increased at a robust pace , but the broader money aggregates most directly related to corporate investment and consumer spending only grew modestly , as can be seen in the chart below , which comes from Gauti Eggertsson and Jonathan D. Ostry , Does Excess Liquidity Pose a Threat in Japan ?
( IMF Working Paper , April 2005 – please click on image for better viewing ) .
At the same time aggregate bank lending to the private sector decreased sharply , directly producing a tightening of credit conditions as faced by Japanese enterprises , while government borrowing increased substantially , in a pattern we are now getting used to seeing in the United States and Western Europe .
In addition Krugman has now drawn our attention to some of the growing evidence that this pattern may well be repeating itself in the United States at the present time .
As he says , the Federal Reserve has been spectacularly aggressive about expanding the monetary base ( see chart below ) , yet bank lending has remained pretty much stationary .
Running On Empty Aka The Liquidity Trap
The other type of extreme situation which needs to be kept in mind is danger of a liquidity trap .
Discussion of liquidity traps ( or the danger they represent ) came back into vogue in the late 1990s following a renewed focus on the problem by Krugman himself in the Japanese context .
In fact most of recent discussion of the liquidity trap problem has been focused on Japan , for the simple reason that Japan was the first major industrial economy to face serious and ongoing price deflation since the 1930s episodes .
It was , of course , during the 1930s that Keynes first drew serious attention to the liquidity trap explanation for why monetary policy might be ineffective when interest rates come up against what we now call the “ zero bound ” .
Basically the risk of entering a liquidity trap is heightened when interest rates are at or near zero , and domestic demand contracts with sufficient force to produce a substantial and ongoing fall in prices , since the implicit rate of return on simply holding cash is not that different from that obtained by holding short term government bonds , especially when transaction costs are taken into account .
( If prices drop at a 2 % annual rate , for example , this gives you an implicit rate of return of 2 % on bank notes ) .
Now we need to be careful here , since while monetary policy in one economy after another is gradually coming to rest around the zero bound , by and large price inflation has not ( yet ) fallen below zero ( or not for a sufficient length of time ) , and while it is evident that a number of countries face the imminent risk of this happening ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , the UK , Japan and the United States most notably ) we are not there yet , and the central banks are working furiously ( well I ’m not too sure about the ECB ) to unblock the credit crunch before the associated contraction in economic activity produces the sort of price deflation which increases the risk of one country after another getting stuck in some kind of liquidity trap .
The simplest explanation for why it is that an increase in the monetary base may have only limited effects on inflationary expectations and real macroeconomic variables goes back to Keynes .
Keynes argued that monetary policy ran the risk of becoming impotent in stimulating demand and raising spending since interest rates were already at their lowest possible level .
Essentially he argued that increasing the monetary base by buying short - term government bonds is irrelevant at zero interest rates since money and short - term government bonds become effectively perfect substitutes .
This ( monetary policy impotence ) argument has been challenged to some extent of late , most notably by Ben Bernanke , who argues that while the central bank may lose policy leverage over short term interest rates , by buying longer term instruments ( 10 or 30 year bonds ) the bank may influence rates further up the yield curve .
But there was another dimension to Keynes thinking here , and this was associated with the causal chain between the monetary base ( which the central bank evidently controls ) and the level of output and prices ( which it apparently does n’t ) .
Keynes suggested that the relation between monetary base and the level of output was not a linear one , and indeed in a credit driven economy the causal chain might just as easily run from sentiment to credit availability to the output level to broad money ( rather than the other way round ) , meaning the central bank was certainly free to move the level of base money around at will , but remained effectively impotent when it came to influencing the level of bank lending and output .
This seems very plausible as it sounds horribly reminiscent of the actual situation we are seeing around us at the present time .
This is why the name of Keynes has become so closely associated with the idea of government spending , since given that the central bank has only limited ability to regulate the output level by using monetary policy , he considered direct demand management by via fiscal injections to be much more effective .
Indeed in one of his last interviews Milton Freidman himself implicitly conceded the point , declaring that “ The use of the quantity of money as a target has not been a success ” .
The core of Krugman ’s analysis is the idea that the equilibrium real interest rate – that is , the real rate that would match saving and investment – and thus bring output back up towards its capacity level – turns negative in a liquidity trap .
Thus we can have an economy which is struggling to find its equilibrium point but which is unable to do so since it effectively cannot generate the rate of interest which would make this possible .
But how can the equilibrium real interest rate be and remain negative ?
Because , argues Krugman , poor long - run growth prospects ( a debt deflationary environment ) make investment demand so low that a negative short - term real interest rate would be needed to match saving and investment .
Given a nominal interest rate floor of zero a positive expected rate of inflation becomes necessary to generate negative real interest rates , which will stimulate aggregate demand and restore full employment .
Equally importantly , injections of liquidity by the central bank which raise base money ( or bank reserves ) turn out to be pretty ineffective in raising the growth rate of broader money aggregates .
Krugman shows that Japan ’s monetary base grew 25 % from 1994 to 1997 , but that the broader monetary aggregate ( M2 + Certificates of Deposit ) grew only 11 % , and bank credit did n’t grow at all .
And more recent statistics indicated that “ money hoarding ” continued to be evident in 1998 - 1999 , as an expansion of the monetary base in the range of 8 % to 10 % resulted in only about a 3 % growth in M2 + CDs .
Posterior Bank of Japan data show that between March 2001 and May 2004 while Japanese bank reserves grew by 800 % the monetary base ( which is bank reserves plus cash in circulation ) only increased by 67 % .
Now , as I say , there little evidence at the present time that we are already in a liquidity trap , but the danger that some countries ( including Japan , yet one more time ) may fall into one , is certainly real , and non-negligible .
Economics Is Giving Me A Depression
So what has all this got to do with the Great Depression debate ?
Well quite a lot actually .
As Krugman argues , a central theme of Keynesâ€™s General Theory was the impotence of monetary policy in depression - type conditions .
But Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz , in their seminal monetary history of the United States , claimed that the Federal Reserve could have prevented the Great Depression â€ ” a claim that in later , popular writings , including those of Friedman himself , was transmuted into the claim that the Federal Reserve “ caused ” the Depression .
â€ œLet me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve .
I would like to say to Milton and Anna : Regarding the Great Depression .
Youâ€ ™re right , we did it .
Weâ€ ™re very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wonâ€™t do it again.â€ 
Ben Bernanke , On Milton Friedman ’s Ninetieth Birthday
( As we have seen , what the Fed really controlled was the monetary base â€ ” currency plus bank reserves .
As the chart displayed below – which comes from Krugman – shows , the base actually rose during the great slump , which is why itâ€™s hard to make the case that the Fed caused the Depression .
Although arguably had the Fed acted more aggressively earlier – eg if it had expanded the monetary base faster and done more to rescue banks in trouble – the blow might have been softened , even though as we are seeing at the present time , there are no guarantees , this will always and forever have to remain a huge “ what if ” ) .
Underlying the whole Friedman & Schwartz view of The Great Depression is the assumption that ( in both the short and the long term ) the “ velocity ” of money reflects the “ money holding propensities of the community ” ( p679 ) .
Under the normal ceteris paribus convention , tastes are taken to remain unchanged .
Thus , the authors feel themselves authorised to write as though a movement in the monetary aggregate in and of itself exerted a simple and direct influence on real output .
This idea that velocity remains constant has been repeatedly question by critics of the Monetary History , citing most notably Irving Fisher who argued in a now famous Econometrica paper that debt liquidation leads to distress selling , which in turn leads to a contraction in current deposits plus currency as bank loans are paid off , and thus to a slowing down of velocity of circulation .
This contraction of deposits and of the slowdown in the velocity of circulation , aggravated by distress selling , causes a general fall in the level of prices .
Sound familiar ?
Friedman & Schwartz for the most part take a pretty simple view of the cause of the monetary contraction in The Great Depression :
the monetary authorities could have prevented the decline in the stock of money – indeed could have produced almost any desired increase in the stock of money .
( P.301 : note the almost ] .
The monetary decline from 1929 to 1933 was not an inevitable consequence of what had gone before .
It was the result of policies followed during those years ( p.699 ) .
On the question of how the authorities could have controlled the money stock , they answer , in words quite evocative of things we have been hearing of late , by conducting “ extensive open market purchases ” to increase bank reserves :
What they say of the first year of the depression expresses their view reasonably clearly :
It has been contended with respect to later years ( particularly during the years after 1934 …. ) that increases in high - powered money , through expansion of Federal Reserve credit or other means , would simply have added to bank reserves and would not have been used to increase the money stock ….
we shall argue later that the contention is invalid , even for the later period .
It is clearly not relevant to the period from August 1929 to October 1930 .
During that period , additional reserves would almost certainly have been put to use promptly .
Hence the decline in the stock of money is not only arithmetically attributable to the decline in federal Reserve credit outstanding : it is economically a direct result of that decline .
( pp341-2 )
Basically Friedman & Schwartz never really seriously consider the possibility that bank lending was held back by factors other than their reserve position .
This is because they seem to pay practically no attention to the asset side of banks ’ balance sheets .
Their ( then ) view of the world would seem to allow a limited space for the banks ’ role as financial intermediaries who live by striking a balance between the needs of two types of client : depositors ( the public as asset owners ) and borrowers ( the public as investors and debtors ) .
Nor does it allow for the fact that banks as intermediaries operate in a world of uncertainty , that banks ’ assessment of their client ’s creditworthiness varies , and that in the short term their lending determines the size of the money stock .
If these effects are accepted as important , the stock of money has to be seen as determined at least in large part by the business situation , and this is exactly what we are seeing now .
It thus becomes more and more plausible that the scale of bank lending during the Great Depression was significantly restrained by the state of the bank loan book , and by their increased caution in lending to customers whose profit expectations had deteriorated drastically , as well as by the capital adequacy position and it was these considerations , and not the size of their reserves , that imposed a limit on the size of the money stock .
The government is losing its patience with the banks , â€ Spanish Industry Ministry Miguel Sebastian said just hours after the labour ministry said the number of people out of work in Spain rose to over 3.3 million as of the end of January , a 12 - year high , â€ œI will tell them , with all my power and conviction , that this is not the time for large profits .
Itâ€™s the time to support credit and financing for families and companies in this country , â€ 
Spain ’s largest union , the CCOO , went a step further and said banks had to start dolling out credit , or face state efforts to control lending .
The demands , and word the Bank of Spain Governor and other bank sector leaders would address Congress in coming weeks , raised talk the government could create a state bank or take stakes in private banks to influence their credit policy .
“ We should n’t rule out the government taking a stake ( in a private bank ) and , in an extreme case , creating a public bank , ” said Paloma Lopez , CCOO employment secretary general .
“ If they do n’t free up financing , if the banks keep putting up objections , the government has to go a step further . ”
The point is that one must believe that the fall in income had a major effect on personal consumption , and the great fall in output a major influence on business investment , and the interaction of the two ( once the process started ) a dominating influence .
At most , then , monetary influences could have initiated the depression , or worsened it when it started , but they could not have been the sole dominating influence through its course .
The parallel fall in the money stock cannot then be taken as evidence of the latter ’s causal significance .
Banco Popular followed the lead of other Spanish banks on Friday , opting to sacrifice 2008 profits to increase provisions against bad loans amid the deepening economic slowdown .
Popular posted a 16.8 percent drop in net profit for 2008 on to 1.05 billion euros ( $ 1.4 billion ) , below analysts ’ forecasts , as loan loss provisions increased .
Popular has one of the highest exposures to Spain ’s property sector , currently in a steep downturn after a decade - long boom .
Many property developers are defaulting .
Popular is expected to post an around 8 percent rise in net interest revenue in 2009 .
Loans grew 6.1 percent , with 44 percent to small and medium - sized businesses , and client deposits grew 21.1 percent .
Higueras said he sees , at best , low digit loan growth in 2009 , but stressed that Popular would continue to lend money to businesses and private individuals .
“ We are not giving up on lending ….
We will come through this crisis however long it lasts , ” he said .
Conclusions
Finally , ( below ) some more charts on Japan , prepared by the Japanese economist Richard Koo .
In the first chart the thick blue line ( please click over chart if you ca n’t see adequately ) shows the perception of large businesses of the willingness of banks to lend to them , as surveyed by the Bank of Japan for the Tankan index .
You will note the line plunges twice , and it is the second plunge , or “ credit crunch ” , which interests me at the moment .
This was the crunch that finally drove Japan decisively off into deflation , and produced that now famed “ liquidity trap ” .
Basically the first credit crunch was resolved via large scale government contruction spending , the guaranteeing of bank deposits , and the swallowing by the banks of a large number of non-performing loans .
Does all this sound familiar ?
It should .
But then Japan reached a point were the financial system could struggle forward no further .
So the crunch broke out again , and this time the only way to resolve the problem was with two massive injections of capital into the banking system .
The problem is that these injections – as can be seen below – served to push the Japan government debt to GDP ratio sharply upwards , and it is this part of the story that I feel we will see repeating itself now in countries like the United States and Spain .
The problem is that the US economy became , as I am sure everyone is now only too aware , very highly leveraged with total ( private and public ) debt to GDP ratios of around 350 % of GDP .
This is now unsustainable .
The government is basically – via the various bailout processes – trying to reduce the part of this ratio which is held by the private sector and hence reduce the degree of leveraging to within a range that will allow bank lending to function again .
The problem is that as these bailouts take effect US GDP is itself contracting , and at the same time prices are pushing the frontier between price increases and price decreases .
It is really very important to not allow systematic price falls to set in , and doubly important not to allow expectations for inflation to turn negative .
After congressional leaders reached compromise on a 789 billion dollar economic stimulus package that includes investment for smart grid and broadband infrastructure , there were lots of smiling faces around Mountain View , Cali. , the headquarters of Google Inc .
President Obama ’s stated desire to invest in smart grid and broadband infrastructures syncs quite nicely with Google ’s obvious desire to improve the nation ’s broadband infrastructure but it also will benefit the company ’s recent incursion into smart metering .
While the specifics of Wednesday ’s compromise have yet to be released , the Senate version of the stimulus slated $ 7 billion for broadband and $ 20 billion for smart grid investment , with final figures likely to be smaller .
[ update : CNET reports that smart grid investment was pared down in the final package to $ 11 billion ]
After a meeting with President Obama at the White House last week , Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was pleased with the proposed cash injection into the demand side of the economic equation , particularly with money being targeted for broadband and grid improvements , saying “ that ’s a good down payment on the future of America . ”
John Timmer at ArsTechnica points out that Google may have even announced the private beta release of their smart metering software a bit early to coincide with the boost provided by the stimulus package and establishing itself as a presence in the smart grid sector .
Doing so , Timmer argues , helps Google stake a claim for the “ mountains of data ” that will result from an increase of demand - side energy management .
Google is n’t the only tech company that stands to gain from injections into broadband and grid upgrades , GE , IBM , Microsoft , have all been vocal supporters of the investment and have been active in the beltway in support of it .
Charlie Savage and David Kirkpatrick of the New York Times write :
“ To many on K Street , the stimulus bill was the clearest guide to the new administration ’s closest friends in the business world .
What oil was to President Bush , some say , clean energy and technology are to the Obama White House . ”
With the apparent agreement on an economic stimulus package , the cleantech sector — which includes Google more and more every day — is looking to enjoy the fruits of their newfound acceptance at the White House .

Now as a side note , I would like to present this article for discussion also , lets call it # 12 shall we ?
This one I need to look into as I do not quite follow this as I should even though I took Introductory Geology .
I am really having trouble with any scientific explanation for this one .
I know I posted more than I should but most will not follow the link , maybe this way they will actually READ it before responding .
A story about two friends from day one .
(( Scientific Facts Proving Charles Darwin 's Theory of Evolution is Wrong , False and Impossible ) ) The body and soul of Charles Darwin 's Theory of Evolution was his idea that evolution was made possible through natural selection .
This concept is based on the suggestion that those members of a species that are a little stronger , a little larger , or run a little faster will live longer to procreate offspring with these superior adaptations .
Darwin's theory suggests that millions of generations later the changes will result in new species .
These adaptations are called links or intermediates .
Help !
I can't fly .
My head is too big , and my wings are too small .
The idea of natural selection sounds great when considering deer .
The deer that can sense danger the quickest and run the fastest are able to escape the predator on a more consistent basis .
However , other examples on the evolutionary tree have many laughable flaws .
One of the best is the thought that a bird began to evolve a wing .
Why this would occur is not answered by evolutionists .
The wing stub did not make the bird more adaptable in his environment .
The wing was much too small for the bird to fly .
Why would a bird evolve a wing that was useless ?
This is backwards from the evolutionary natural selection concept that birds adapt and change in order to survive better in their environment .
The bird with a half - size wing is placed at a disadvantage in its environment .
Why would the bird continue for millions of generations improving a wing that was useless ?
The theory of evolution is based on natural selection of the most adaptable member of a species .
A bird with a useless wing is at a severe disadvantage and the opposite from natural selection .
According to natural selection the members of the bird species with the smallest useless wing would be the most adaptable and most likely to survive in the largest numbers .
According to the theory of natural selection birds could never evolve to fly .
Evolution is simply nonsense .
This is so funny .
We are then led to believe that some birds got tired of carrying around a worthless half - size wing so they grew fingers on the end to help climb trees .
The wings became arms and a new species was developed .
Evolutionists actually believe this nonsense .
The evolutionist will claim that the presence of many individual species proves evolution .
This shallow statement is devoid of reason , logic and scientific proof .
Evolutionists line up pictures of similar looking species and claim they evolved one to another .
Humans are a great example .
There are hundreds of species of extinct monkeys and apes .
Petrified skulls and bones exist from these creatures .
Evolutionists line up the most promising choices to present a gradual progression from monkey to modern man .
They simply fill in the big gaps with make - believe creatures to fit the picture .
This procedure can be done with humans only because there are many extinct monkey and ape species .
They never do this with giraffes and elephants .
These pictures are placed in all evolutionists ' text books to teach kids this nonsense .
The picture is simply a grouping of individual species that does not prove evolution .
Scientists a century ago believed the smallest single living cell was a simple life form .
The theory developed that perhaps lightning struck a pond of water causing several molecules to combine in a random way which by chance resulted in a living cell .
The cell then divided and evolved into higher life forms .
This view is now proven to be immature to the degree of being ridiculous .
The most modern laboratory is unable to create a living cell .
In fact , scientists have been unable to create a single left - hand protein molecule as found in all animals .
The evolutionist ignores the problem surrounding the human female egg and the male sperm in the evolutionary theory .
The female egg contains the X - chromosome and the male sperm contains either an X - chromosome for the reproduction of a male or a Y - chromosome for the reproduction of a female .
The female eggs all develop within the ovaries while she is a baby ( fetus ) within her mother 's womb .
Evolutionists claim environmental factors cause small changes in the offspring in the evolutionary chain .
However , the environmental experience of the female cannot change the chromosomes within her eggs and cannot have any effect upon her offspring .
Her body cannot go into the eggs contained within her ovaries at her birth to make an intelligent change .
Females cannot be a part of the evolutionary theory for these reasons .
The scientific fact that DNA replication includes a built - in error checking method and a DNA repair process proves the evolutionary theory is wrong .
The fact is that any attempt by the DNA to change is stopped and reversed .
The second law of thermodynamics proves that organization cannot flow from chaos .
Complex live organisms cannot rearrange themselves into an organism of a higher form as claimed by evolutionists .
This is scientifically backwards according to the second law of thermodynamics that has never been proven wrong .
Scientists cannot have it both ways .
The second law of thermodynamics is proven to be correct .
Evolution lacks any scientific proof .
Evolution is simply an empty theory .
There is no scientific evidence that a species can change the number of chromosomes within the DNA .
The chromosome count within each species is fixed .
This is the reason a male from one species cannot mate successfully with a female of another species .
Man could not evolve from a monkey .
Each species is locked into its chromosome count that cannot change .
If an animal developed an extra chromosome or lost a chromosome because of some deformity , it could not successfully mate .
The defect could not be passed along to the next generation .
Evolving a new species is scientifically impossible .
Evolutionists prove that getting a college education does not impart wisdom .
Evolutionists just throw up their hands at the question of the origin of matter because they know something cannot evolve from nothing .
They stick their heads in the sand and ignore the problem .
The fact that matter exists in outrageously large quantities simply proves evolution is wrong .
The " Big Bang " theory does n't solve the problem either .
Matter and energy have to come from somewhere .
Two NASA two land rovers named Spirit and Opportunity explored Mars during 2004 .
The topography shows obvious signs of past liquid rivers flowing in numerous places .
The rovers have proven that water was once abundant on the surface of Mars , but they have not been able to find any signs of life or any signs of past life on the planet .
Mars has a proven history of flowing water on the surface and an atmosphere suitable to support life forms .
The planet has had all of the conditions necessary to provide the " spark " of life according to the evolutionary theory , yet there is no life on Mars .
The river beds and river banks show no signs of vegetation or trees .
The ground has no fossils and no organisms .
The place is absolutely sterile .
Mars is not the only place that shows no signs of life .
The entire universe lacks any sign of life .
There are no radio signals that can be related to intelligent life forms .
None of the billions of galaxies has been found to emit any intelligent radio signals .
Scientists have been pointing every type of radio telescope possible into space for several decades in hopes of finding an intelligent signal .
No signs of life beyond Earth have been found .
We are alone .
Absolute Scientific Proof the Evolutionary Theory is DeadOnce upon a time there was a Polonium 218 element of the family of radioactive isotopes .
Nuclear chemists classify Polonium 218 as radioactive because the nuclei of the atom continually emit alpha , beta and gamma radiation .
This radiation loss causes the atom to disintegrate or decay into a smaller atom .
Eventually the material will become lead , which we commonly use for fishing weights and lead - acid batteries in our cars .
Polonium 218 would be classified in elementary school as being " hyperactive . "
It ca n't sit still very long .
In only three minutes , half of the atoms decay into a lighter element , and in only one day it is all changed .
Polonium 218 can be created by the decay of a parent atom such as Uranium 238 or some other element below Uranium 238 in the chain .
It can also be created as the parent without having come from the decay of a heavier atom .
This is very important , so remember this fact .
Once upon a time there was granite rock .
Granite is a very unique rock but at the same time is very common and plentiful .
It can easily be found in mountain areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado .
Granite is easily identified by its hard crystalline structure and light color .
The crystals are large enough to be easily seen with the eye .
It has an interesting structure with a mixture of light - colored quartz and feldspar crystals , and darker crystals of mica and hornblende .
Granite is solid and hard without cracks or seams , and it is very strong .
Granite has another very unique property in that it cannot be created by scientists .
It is considered to be an " original " material in the Earth .
When melted and allowed to harden , it does not return to the original granite crystalline structure .
The new smaller crystalline material is called rhyolite .
Granite cannot be made by cooling the initial molten materials .
This is very important , so remember this fact .
Granite never contains fossils such as are found in sedimentary rocks .
All of these properties have led many scientists to refer to granite as a creation rock , since it could not have solidified from molten material according to the evolutionary theory .
Evolution cannot explain the presence of granite in its present structure .
And where is this granite ?
Everywhere .
Granite is the bedrock shell which encloses the entire Earth .
Its exact thickness is unknown , but scientists have speculated that it forms a layer about 4.35 miles ( 7 km ) thick , and in some areas possibly 20 miles ( 32 km ) thick .
It occurs on every continent .
These are the two friends from day one .
We know they were friends because they lived together .
The Polonium 218 lived only a very short time ( 3 minutes ) , but he left his mark on his friend , granite , in that short time .
Polonium emitted alpha particles which left a very distinct mark in the granite .
These marks are called Polonium halos .
These halos are tiny colored concentric circles which must be viewed with a microscope .
The concentric circles are actually concentric spherical marks which appear as circles after the rock is cut open .
" How many halos are there ? " you may ask .
One trillion times 10 billion are present on every continent around the world .
They are everywhere .
The Polonium 218 was the parent radioactive isotope because other distinct halos which are created by other isotopes are not present .
The Polonium halos are not accompanied by Uranium 238 halos .
One minute there was nothing .
The next minute there were parent Polonium 218 radioactive atoms locked in the center of solid granite .
The granite rock could not have formed from cooling molten rock .
Granite will not form that way .
In fact , scientists cannot make granite by any method .
They can make diamonds but not granite .
Granite is solid .
The Polonium could not penetrate existing granite because it is not porous or cracked .
This was day one .
These friends are absolute scientific proof that evolution is dead .
First , the granite could not have been produced by evolutionary theories , the Earth cooling , etc. Second , the Polonium locks the entire time period into an instantaneous event proven by nuclear chemistry .
The time is not " millions and millions and millions " of years .
The granite was produced as a solid with the Polonium parent elements inside at that instant .
Within the first three minutes , half of the Polonium had decayed into a lower element .
The Earth , granite and Polonium were created by God together in an instant .

Jade Goody 's secret donation helps save India 's railway children
Stricken reality TV star Jade Goody has been revealed as the mystery benefactor whose donation helped 126 children in India escape a life of poverty .
Just like the kids in Slumdog Millionaire the youngsters spent days begging by the railway tracks and nights sleeping rough in the city of Itarsi in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh .
All that changed , though , after Jade paid for them to be fed , clothed and cared for at a children 's shelter .
The 27 - year - old TV star made the secret donation in 2007 after a she visited the country following her high profile falling out with Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother .
Moved by the children 's plight on a trip to a Dehli project run by the British charity Railway Children , she felt motivated to help .
In her biography Catch A Falling Star Jade told how she donated £ 100,000 to charities in the country , a large chunk of which was used to help the children .
" I wanted to give them the things that my kids take for granted , " she said .
" None of them had even had a birthday party .
I so wished I could just go over and throw a huge celebration for them . "
The youngsters from Itarsi sent messages of thanks to Jade .
" You have helped us so much and made us very happy .
We will pray for you every day , " said one of the boys .
Jade , who 's security has recently been stepped up after an intruder broke in to her hospital room to pray over her , is expected to return home in the next couple of days to be cared for by her family and a team of nurses .

Advertisement The Home Secretary 's husband has said sorry for embarrassing his wife after two adult films were viewed at their home , then claimed for on expenses .
Richard Timney , who is also Jacqui Smith 's parliamentary aide , said he understood why people might be angry .
Ms Smith said she " mistakenly " claimed for a TV package when billing for a web connection and would repay the cash .
Downing Street said she had done the " right thing " by quickly rectifying the " inadvertent mistake " .
BBC political correspondent Reeta Chakrabarti said there were rumours " whizzing round Labour 's circles " that there may be a Tory mole in the House of Commons fees office , following several leaks .
This is the office which processes MPs ' allowances claims .
The Home Secretary is already under investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over her use of the second homes allowance .
Jacqui Smith was reportedly " livid and shocked " at the discovery Mr Timney said outside the couple 's home in Redditch , Worcestershire : " I 'm really sorry for any embarrassment I have caused Jacqui .
" I can fully understand why people might be angry and offended by this .
" Quite obviously a claim should never have been made for these films , and as you know that money is being paid back . "
MPs can claim for subscription television services but they have to be used wholly , exclusively and necessarily to perform their duties .
BBC political correspondent , Gary O'Donoghue , said a source told him Ms Smith was " livid and shocked " when she found out about the films .
He said he was told Ms Smith was not at home when they were viewed and said she had no intention of resigning over the matter .
Mr O'Donoghue said he was told Ms Smith had given her husband a " real ear - bashing " .
All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full
Jacqui Smith , Home Secretary
What can MPs claim for ?
MP standards rules ' need updating '
The Sunday Express reported that two films , which cost £ 5 each , were viewed on 6 and 8 April 2008 at Jacqui Smith 's constituency home in Redditch .
The claim was also said to include two viewings of the film Ocean 's 13 - at £ 3.75 each - and an additional £ 3.50 to watch the film Surf 's Up . A Downing Street spokesman said Ms Smith was doing a great job as Home Secretary and would not let the expenses issue detract from her determination to protect the public .
The Committee on Standards in Public Life has announced a wide - ranging review of MPs ' pay and allowances , starting later this year .
It came after Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to the committee calling for a full review into " outside interests " and second jobs .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the BBC's Andrew Marr show : " Jacqui Smith is doing an outstanding job as Home Secretary ... what I know is that the system has to be much , much clearer than it was in the past .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" That 's the purpose of the reforms that are being put into place .
" The system has to be clear , above all in the interests of the public , so they can have trust and confidence . "
Jacqui Smith said in a statement : " I 'm sorry that in claiming for my internet connection , I mistakenly claimed for a television package alongside it .
" As soon as the matter was brought to my attention , I took immediate steps to contact the relevant parliamentary authorities and rectify the situation .
" All money claimed for the television package will be paid back in full . "
Last month Ms Smith was criticised for claiming taxpayer - funded allowances for a second home while living with her sister .
But she insisted she had " fully abided " by the rules because she had designated her sibling 's house as her " main " residence .
That allowed her to claim payments on the Redditch constituency home she shares with her husband and children .
She says it 's all within the rules , which I 'm sure is right ... but the reality is it's not within the spirit of the rules
Mark Field , Conservative MP Conservative MP Mark Field told the BBC : " I 'm obviously glad Jacqui Smith has decided to act quickly and repay , I 'd also like her to act as quickly and repay the second home allowances that she 's also taken .
" She says it 's all within the rules , which I 'm sure is right ... but the reality is it 's not within the spirit of the rules .
" If she does n't recognise that I think she 's really a bit too stupid to be Home Secretary . "
He added there were a number of Tory MPs also abusing the system , which he said undermined parliament 's reputation .
Meanwhile , parliament 's standards commissioner John Lyon is investigating a complaint about Labour minister Tony McNulty 's second home expenses .
The work minister has claimed £ 60,000 since 2002 for the house in his Harrow constituency - 11 miles from the Commons - where his parents live .
He has said he did not break any rules .

The Republican attack machine is in full swing .
Former Bush chief of staff , Andy Card , blasted Obama this week for wearing a dress shirt and tie , but no jacket , in a recent photo in the Oval Office .
Card did n’t bother mentioning that his own boss , George W. Bush , went jacketless in the Oval Office as well .
So did Carter , and Ford , and Reagan , and Kennedy , and Clinton .
This is what Republicans do .
They lie .
And the media dutifully repeats their lies until repetition breeds truth .
( WMD ’s in Iraq , anyone ? )
At some point , the media needs to stop acting like they were quite literally born yesterday .
But more importantly , when will Andy Card be apologizing to Barack Obama , and the American media , for lying ?
Social workers inspected the home of octuplets mother Nadya Suleman and decided her babies should remain at a Bellflower hospital for several more days , Suleman said today .
In an interview with Radar Online , Suleman said workers from Kaiser Permanente Medical Center went to her new home in La Habra and said it was shaping up well to house all 14 of her children .
But for reasons she did not disclose , Suleman said the hospital is not going to release the first two of her eight babies for several more days .
" I am not disappointed , " she said .
" I appreciate what they are doing . "
Suleman told a Radar interview that the social workers were disappointed that she was not at the La Habra home for the inspection , adding she did n't know she was supposed to be there .
She said she 's been spending the last few days preparing for the move from her Whittier home to the larger space in La Habra .
" There is so much I need to do to prepare , " she said .
Last summer Google invested $ 2.75 million into Aptera Motors in an attempt to create a revolutionary , eco-friendly car ( see Panda Ju's post ) .
Fast forward a year and the Aptera 2e , an all - electric car that the company calls an “ aerodynamic marvel , ” has reached pre-production and is scheduled to start being manufactured in October of this year .
The fuel efficiency of 300mpg ( 0.78L/100 km ) , when plugged in every 120 miles ( 190 km ) , would make it one of the most fuel - efficient cars in the world .
This means you can drive the three - wheeled vehicle 100 miles on a single charge and then fully recharge the vehicle through a standard outlet ( 110v ) in less than 8 hours .
In regard to speed , the Aptera 2e can go from zero to 60 in under 10 seconds , and has a top speed of 90 mph .
Right now , California is the only place to buy and drive one .
4,000 people have put down a $ 500 deposit on the 2e , however deposits are not guaranteed sales .
Aptera has yet to put a firm price on the vehicle , but has given a rather wide range of $ 25,000 to $ 45,000 .
The company website indicates the commitment is to build 100,000 units by 2015 .

Catalysis
Making Hydrogen Peroxide Directly
Acid treatment of catalyst support could simplify production of chemical
PRETREATING THE SUPPORT for a gold - palladium catalyst used to produce hydrogen peroxide from H 2 and O 2 could provide a simpler , more direct method than that now used to prepare the commodity chemical , reports a research group led by Graham J. Hutchings , a professor of chemistry at Cardiff University , in Wales ( Science 2009 , 323 , 1037 ) .
Graham Hutchings / Cardiff U Direct Conversion Au - Pd nanoparticles , typically smaller than 10 nm in diameter , on an acid- treated activated carbon support can hydrogenate O 2 into H 2 O 2 while producing little H 2 O. Carbon support is gray , Au is yellow , Pd is blue , O is red , and H is white .
H 2 O 2 is used commercially for disinfection and bleaching ; the global market for the chemical is expected to reach 3.8 million tons this year , according to a 2008 report by Global Industry Analysts .
The current method to produce H 2 O 2 is an indirect process that involves sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of an anthraquinone .
Direct methods tend not just to hydrogenate O 2 into H 2 O 2 but also to convert H 2 O 2 into water .
Hutchings and colleagues , however , have now found that pretreating an activated carbon support with either nitric or acetic acid , then drying the support before adding gold and palladium , results in a reusable catalyst that produces H 2 O 2 with minimal conversion to H 2 O .
Drawing from a combination of hydrogenation experiments and scanning transmission electron microscopy of prepared catalysts , the researchers propose that acid pretreatment of the catalyst support leads to smaller and better dispersed Au - Pd nanoparticles .
The improved nanoparticle dispersion somehow shuts down sites that would convert H 2 O 2 into water , they suggest .
More work needs to be done to evaluate the effect of acid pretreatment for H 2 O 2 synthesis under conditions that more closely mimic a manufacturing setting , Hutchings says .
Nevertheless , " these are intriguing results showing that hydrogen peroxide can be made with high selectivity via a direct process , " says D. Wayne Goodman , a chemistry professor at Texas A&M University .
" This disclosure will no doubt promote an active search to identify the underlying cause or causes for this spectacular yet poorly understood effect . "
