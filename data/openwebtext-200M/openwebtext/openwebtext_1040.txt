The extreme volatility that has gripped oil markets for the last 18 months has shown no signs of slowing down , with oil prices more than doubling since the beginning of the year despite an exceptionally weak economy .
The instability of oil and gas prices is puzzling government officials and policy analysts , who fear it could jeopardize a global recovery .
It is also hobbling businesses and consumers , who are already facing the effects of a stinging recession , as they try in vain to guess where prices will be a year from now  or even next month .
A wild run on the oil markets has occurred in the last 12 months .
Last summer , prices surged to a record high above $ 145 a barrel , driving up gasoline prices to well over $ 4 a gallon .
As the global economy faltered , oil tumbled to $ 33 a barrel in December .
But oil has risen 55 percent since the beginning of the year , to $ 70 a barrel , pushing gas prices up again to $ 2.60 a gallon , according to AAA , the automobile club .
“ To call this extreme volatility might be an understatement , ” said Laura Wright , the chief financial officer at Southwest Airlines , a company that has sought to insure itself against volatile prices by buying long - term oil contracts .
“ Over the past 15 to 18 months , this has been unprecedented .
I do n’t think it can be easily rationalized . ”

This is the dramatic moment when a construction worker suspended from a crane pulls a drowning woman to safety from the raging waters at the foot of a dam .
She had fallen into the Des Moines river in Iowa when the boat she was crewing with her husband capsized .
Kept afloat by her life jacket , she spent nearly 30 minutes fighting the torrent until a group of building workers spotted her .
One , Jason Oglesbee , was lowered in a makeshift harness suspended from a crane and managed to grab the unnamed woman .
The crane driver was then able to drag the pair to calmer water where a rescue boat was waiting to take her on board .
Her husband was dead when he was pulled from the water .

The word “ conscious ” is bandied about quite a bit these days .
As a culture , it seems many of us are reaching toward greater awareness , trying to “ wake up ” and , if not transform , at least be aware of where we are in relation to where we want to be .
I Googled “ conscious parenting ” just for the fun of it , and aside from the giddiness of finding our site second on the list ( thanks , Colin ! ) , I was interested to see so many people using the phrase .
I thought of how so many of my friends are , or have been in therapy .
The main issues I hear people dealing with are their pasts , especially their relationships with their parents , and how those past events impact the present :
People say things to me like , “ My dad never really listened to me ; ” or “ My mom imposed her will on me so much , I never learned who I was ; ” “ No one ever asked me how I was doing ; ” “ My parents divorced , and I never found out what really happened ; ” “ One of my parents drank , the other tried to cover it up ; ” Or in extreme cases , “ I was hit / neglected / abandoned / sexually abused . ”
Whether mild or extreme , we probably all know someone who had things happen to them in the past that they do n’t want to repeat in the present .
One of my favorite quotes is from Pam Leo , who said , “ Let ’s raise children who wo n’t have to recover from their childhood [ s ] . ”
But aside from managing not to repeat some our parents ’ biggest mistakes , how do we know we ’re getting where we want to go ?
Here are what I see as some of the keys of Conscious Parenting , things we can keep in mind when we wonder if we ’re on the right track :
1. A sense of overall forward motion .
I may not be better at this today than yesterday , but six months from now , you ’ll see a general upward trend in the graph of my parenting skill .
Sometimes I might need to step back from the moment to see this .
2 . The occasional pause to reflect .
Rather than just keep moving , I actually stop and reflect , with compassion , on what ’s happening .
3 . An open mind and heart .
I may have said or done thirty - seven things today I wish would have been different , and , I will listen to how this has affected others , and acknowledge those messages .
I am human ; I am doing my best ; I am open to hearing how I have impacted those around me .
4 . Doing what we can , ceasing to stress about what ’s beyond our control .
This insight is at the heart of much stress management thinking , and is also the message of the serenity prayer that is the credo of Alcoholics Anonymous .
If we focus on what ’s possible , and let go of what ’s out of our reach , suddenly everything seems more manageable , more peaceful and less stressful .
Try it !
5 . Appreciate ourselves , our children , and everyone who contributed in any way to making us who we are .
I appreciate myself as a parent , recognize no one can do this job perfectly , and choose to hold myself in a positive light , just as I strive to do with my children .
Gratitude , when we remember and choose to feel it , has a way of putting everything else into a more calm and manageable perspective .
Full disclosure :
This post may really be a message to myself .
Four days ago , my son ’s dad moved out .
Because I had so much time to prepare , and because we lived together for a year and half after we ended our marriage , the transition has been just about as smooth as it can be .
I feel surprisingly light .
The family I made did n’t turn out as I planned , and I still feel some sadness about that .
I also feel grateful for how we ’re arranging ourselves in the aftermath .
Yes , there were many things I could n’t control .
But I am no longer “ going through a divorce . ” I am on the other side .
I am embracing a new phase .
And so is Cainan — he ’s beside himself with joy that his new brother is finally in the same city .
Like so many children ( consciously or not ) he wants to bring everyone together — and he does !
When I stay focused on appreciating everyone , including myself , in this new phase , life looks pretty darn bright .
It took a lot to get here , and I embrace that , too .
Today , anyway .
How about you , what helps stay conscious about being the kind of parent you want to be ?
Please share your thoughts below .
Warmly ,
Jill
Radio
Most teenagers nowadays are not regular listeners to radio .
They may occasionally tune in , but they do not try to listen to a program specifically .
The main reason teenagers listen to the radio is for music , but now with online sites streaming music for free they do not bother , as services such as last .
fm do this advert free , and users can choose the songs they want instead of listening to what the radio presenter / DJ chooses .
Television
Most teenagers watch television , but usually there are points in the year where they watch more than average .
This is due to programs coming on in seasons , so they will watch a particular show at a certain time for a number of weeks ( as long as it lasts ) but then they may watch no television for weeks after the program has ended .
Teenage boys ( generally ) watch more TV when it is the football season , often watching two games and related shows a week ( totalling about 5 hours of viewing ) .
A portion of teenagers watches programs that are regular ( such as soap operas ) at least five times a week for half an hour or so but this portion is shrinking , as it is hard to find the time each day .
Teenagers are also watching less television because of services such as BBC iPlayer , which allows them to watch shows when they want .
Whilst watching TV , adverts come on quite regularly ( 18 minutes of every hour ) and teenagers do not want to watch these , so they switch to another channel , or do something else whilst the adverts run .
The majority of teenagers I speak to have Virgin Media as their provider , citing lower costs but similar content of Sky .
A fraction of teenagers have Freeview but these people are light users of TV ( they watch about 1 ½ hours per week ) so they do not require the hundreds of channels that other providers offer .
Newspapers
No teenager that I know of regularly reads a newspaper , as most do not have the time and cannot be bothered to read pages and pages of text while they could watch the news summarised on the internet or on TV .
The only newspapers that are read are tabloids and freesheets ( Metro , London Lite … ) mainly because of cost ; teenagers are very reluctant to pay for a newspaper ( hence the popularity of freesheets such as the Metro ) .
Over the last few weeks , the Sun has decreased in cost to 20 p , so I have seen more and more copies read by teenagers .
Another reason why mainly tabloids are read is that their compact size allows them to be read easily , on a bus or train .
This is especially true for The Metro , as it is distributed on buses and trains .
Gaming
Whilst the stereotypical view of gamers is teenage boys , the emergence of the Wii onto the market has created a plethora of girl gamers and younger ( 6+ ) gamers .
The most common console is the Wii , then the Xbox 360 followed by the PS3 .
Most teenagers with a games console tend to game not in short bursts , but in long stints ( upwards of an hour ) .
As consoles are now able to connect to the internet , voice chat is possible between users , which has had an impact on phone usage ; one can speak for free over the console and so a teenager would be unwilling to pay to use a phone .
PC gaming has little or no place in the teenage market .
This may be because usually games are released across all platforms , and whilst one can be sure a game will play on a console PC games require expensive set ups to ensure a game will play smoothly .
In addition , PC games are relatively easy to pirate and download for free , so many teenagers would do this rather than buy a game .
In contrast , it is near impossible to obtain a console game for free .
Internet
Every teenager has some access to the internet , be it at school or home .
Home use is mainly used for fun ( such as social
networking ) whilst school ( or library ) use is for work .
Most teenagers are heavily active on a combination of social networking sites .
Facebook is the most common , with nearly everyone with an internet connection registered and visiting > 4 times a week .
Facebook is popular as one can interact with friends on a wide scale .
On the other hand , teenagers do not use twitter .
Most have signed up to the service , but then just leave it as they realise that they are not going to update it ( mostly because texting twitter uses up credit , and they would rather text friends with that credit ) .
In addition , they realise that no one is viewing their profile , so their ' tweets ' are pointless .
Outside of social networking , the internet is used primarily as a source of information for a variety of topics .
For searching the web , Google is the dominant figure , simply because it is well known and easy to use .
Some teenagers make purchases on the internet ( on sites like eBay ) but this is only used by a small percentage , as a credit card is required and most teenagers do not have credit cards .
Many teenagers use YouTube to watch videos ( usually anime which cannot be watched anywhere else ) and some use it as a music player by having a video with the music they want to listen to playing in the background .
Directories
Teenagers never use real directories ( hard copy catalogues such as yellow pages ) .
This is because real directories contain listings for builders and florists , which are services that teenagers do not require .
They also do not use services such as 118 118 because it is quite expensive and they can get the information for free on the internet , simply by typing it into Google .
Viral / Outdoor Marketing
Outdoor advertising usually does not trigger a reaction in teenagers , but sometimes they will oppose it ( the Benetton baby adverts ) .
Most teenagers ignore conventional outside advertising ( billboards etc ) because they have seen outside adverts since they first stepped outside and usually it is not targeted at them ( unless it 's for a film ) .
However , campaigns such as the GTA : IV characters painted on the side of buildings generate interest because they are different and cause people to stop and think about the advert , maybe leading to further research .
Music
Teenagers listen to a lot of music , mostly whilst doing something else ( like travelling or using a computer ) .
This makes it hard to get an idea of the proportion of their time that is spent listening to music .
They are very reluctant to pay for it ( most never having bought a CD ) and a large majority ( 8/10 ) downloading it illegally from file sharing sites .
Legal ways to get free music that teenagers use are to listen to the radio , watch music TV channels ( not very popular , as these usually play music at certain times , which is not always when teenagers are watching ) and use music streaming websites ( as I mentioned previously ) .
Almost all teenagers like to have a ' hard copy ' of the song ( a file of the song that they can keep on their computer and use at will ) so that they can transfer it to portable music players and share it with friends .
How teenagers play their music while on the go varies , and usually dependent on wealth –with teenagers from higher income families using iPods and those from lower income families using mobile phones .
Some teenagers use both to listen to music , and there are always exceptions to the rule .
A number of people use the music service iTunes ( usually in conjunction with iPods ) to acquire their music ( legally ) but again this is unpopular with many teenagers because of the ' high price ' ( 79 p per song ) .
Some teenagers use a combination of sources to obtain music , because sometimes the sound quality is better on streaming sites but they cannot use these sites whilst offline , so they would download a song then listen to it on music streaming sites ( separate from the file ) .
Cinema
Teenagers visit the cinema quite often , regardless of what is on .
Usually they will target a film first , and set out to see that , but sometimes they will just go and choose when they get there .
This is because going to the cinema is not usually about the film , but the experience –and getting together with friends .
Teenagers visit the cinema more often when they are in the lower end of teendom ( 13 and 14 ) but as they approach 15 they go to the cinema a lot less .
This is due to the pricing ; at 15 they have to pay the adult price , which is often double the child price .
Also , it is possible to buy a pirated DVD of the film at the time of release , and these cost much less than a cinema ticket so teenagers often choose this instead of going to the cinema .
Some teenagers choose to download the films off the internet , but this is not favourable as the films are usually bad quality , have to be watched on a small computer screen and there is a chance that they will be malicious files and install a virus .
Devices
Mobile Phones
Features such as video messaging or video calling are not used – because they are expensive , ( you can get four regular texts for the price of one video message ) .
Services such as instant messaging are used , but not by everyone .
It usually depends whether the phone is Wi-Fi compatible , because otherwise it is very expensive to get internet off the phone network .
As most teenagers ' phones have Bluetooth support , and Bluetooth is free , they utilise this feature often .
It is used to send songs and videos ( even though it is illegal ) and is another way teenagers gain songs for free .
Teenagers never use the ringtone and picture selling services , which gained popularity in the early 00s .
This is because of the negative press that these services have attracted ( where the charge £ 20 a week with no easy way to cancel the service ) and the fact that they can get pictures and music on a computer –then transfer it to their phones at no cost .
Mobile email is not used as teenagers have no need ; they do not need to be connected to their inbox all the time as they do n't receive important emails .
Teenagers do not use the internet features on their mobiles as it costs too much , and generally , if they waited an hour they could use their home internet and they are willing to wait as they do n't usually have anything urgent to do .
Teenagers do not upgrade their phone very often , with most upgrading every two years .
They usually upgrade on their birthday when their parents will buy them a new phone , as they do not normally have enough money to do it themselves .
Televisions
Most teenagers own a TV , with more and more upgrading to HD ready flat screens .
However , many are not utilising this HD functionality , as HD channels are expensive extras which many families cannot justify the added expenditure .
Many of them do n't want to sign up to HD broadcasting services , as adverts are shown on standard definition broadcasts , so they can't see the difference .
Most people have Virgin Media as a TV provider .
Some have Sky and some have Freeview but very few only have the first five channels ( BBC One , BBC Two , ITV , Channel Four and Channel Five ) .
Computers
Every teenager has access to a basic computer with internet , but most teenagers computers are systems capable of only everyday tasks .
Nearly all teenagers ' computers have Microsoft office installed , as it allows them to do school work at home .
Most ( 9/10 ) computers owned by teenagers are PCs , because they are much cheaper than Macs and school computers run Windows , so if a Mac is used at home compatibility issues arise .
Games Consoles
Close to a third of teenagers have a new ( < 2 ½ years old ) games console , 50 % having a Wii , 40 % with an Xbox 360 and 10 % with a PS3 .
The PS3 has such a low figure because of its high price ( £ 300 ) and similar features and games to an Xbox 360 , which costs less ( £ 160 ) .
The Wii's dominance is due to younger brothers and sisters , they have a Wii and parents are not willing to pay for another console .
What is hot ?
• Mobile phones with large capacities for music .
• Portable devices that can connect to the internet ( iPhones )
• Really big tellies
What is not ?
• Phones with black and white screens
• Clunky ' brick ' phones
• Devices with less than ten - hour battery life
This is kind of amazing :
This is complicated stuff ( for people with no financial background , like me , it ’s nightmarish ) and I have a longer thing about this coming out later .
But the essence of this story is that Tyler Durden over at Zero Hedge has , for months , been complaining that Goldman has been manipulating the NYSE , in particular manipulating program trading in somewhat the same way ( although perhaps not to the same extent ) that they manipulated the commodities markets .
In order to make his case — and his theory has gained a lot of acceptance , to the point where Goldman had to respond to the allegations publicly — he has been analyzing data the NYSE releases on program trading every week .
So what happened this week ?
The NYSE announced that it will no longer be releasing its weekly program trading data .
This is quite obviously a move designed to make it even more impossible to track what ’s going on in the NYSE and shield , in particular , Goldman Sachs .
Let ’s hope there ’s a public uproar about this ; Zero Hedge posted contact info for NYSE officials , and has urged readers to petition the exchange to restore the old rules in the name of transparency .
Remember those " HD " Wii videos ?
This is just like them !
Only , it 's Mario Galaxy , not Smash Bros .
And they 're lovely big screenshots , not blurry little internet videos .

To refresh , these games are displaying in what is essentially high definition , as they 're being run through a Wii emulator on a PC .
So if the Wii could manage high definition ( which it can 't ) , this is probably what Mario would look like .
Nice , no ?

U.S. Supreme Court
Dowling v. United States
No . 84-589
Argued April 17 , 1985
Decided June 28 , 1985
473 U.S. 207
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
Syllabus
Title 18 U.S.C. § 2314 provides criminal penalties for any person who
" transports in interstate or foreign commerce any goods , wares , merchandise , securities or money , of the value of $ 5,000 or more , knowing the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
Petitioner was convicted in Federal District Court of violating , inter alia , § 2314 , arising from the interstate transportation of " bootleg " phonorecords that were manufactured and distributed without the consent of the copyright owners of the musical compositions performed on the records .
The Court of Appeals affirmed .
Held : Section 2314 does not reach petitioner 's conduct .
Pp. 473 U. S. 213-229 .
(a) The language of § 2314 does not " plainly and unmistakably " cover such conduct .
The phonorecords in question were not " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " for purposes of § 2314 .
The section 's language clearly contemplates a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported , and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods .
Since the statutorily defined property rights of a copyright holder have a character distinct from the possessory interest of the owner of simple " goods , wares , [ or ] merchandise , " interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft , conversion , or fraud .
The infringer of a copyright does not assume physical control over the copyright , nor wholly deprive its owner of its use .
Infringement implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run -of - the - mill theft , conversion , or fraud .
Pp. 473 U. S. 214-218 .
( b) The purpose of § 2314 to fill with federal action an enforcement gap created by limited state jurisdiction over interstate transportation of stolen property does not apply to petitioner 's conduct .
No such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed with respect to copyright infringement , since Congress has the power under the Constitution to legislate directly in this area .
Pp. 473 U. S. 218-221 .
( c) The history of the criminal infringement provisions of the Copyright Act indicates that Congress had no intention to reach copyright infringement when it enacted § 2314 .
Pp. 473 U. S. 221-226 .
(d) To apply § 2314 to petitioner 's conduct would support its extension to significant areas , such as interstate transportation of patent
Page 473 U. S. 208
infringing goods , that Congress has evidenced no intention to enter by way of criminal sanction .
Pp. 473 U. S. 226-227 .
739 F.2d 1445 , reversed .

JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court .
The National Stolen Property
Act provides for the imposition of criminal penalties upon any person who
" transports in interstate or foreign commerce any goods , wares , merchandise , securities or money , of the value of $ 5,000 or more , knowing the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
18 U.S.C. § 2314 .
In this case , we must determine whether the statute reaches the interstate transportation of " bootleg " phonorecords , " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " only in the sense that they were manufactured and distributed without the consent of the copyright owners of the musical compositions performed on the records .
I
After a bench trial in the United States District Court for the Central District of California conducted largely on the basis of a stipulated record , petitioner Paul Edmond Dowling was convicted of one count of conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce , in violation of 18 U.S.C .
Page 473 U. S. 209
§ 371 ; eight counts of interstate transportation of stolen property , in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 ; nine counts of copyright infringement , in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 506 ( a ) ; and three counts of mail fraud , in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 . [ Footnote 1 ]
The offenses stemmed from an extensive bootleg record operation involving the manufacture and distribution by mail of recordings of vocal performances by Elvis Presley .
[ Footnote 2 ]
The
Page 473 U. S. 210
evidence demonstrated that , sometime around 1976 , Dowling , to that time an avid collector of Presley recordings , began in conjunction with codefendant William Samuel Theaker to manufacture phonorecords of unreleased Presley recordings .
They used material from a variety of sources , including studio out - takes , acetates , soundtracks from Presley motion pictures , and tapes of Presley concerts and television appearances .
[ Footnote 3 ]
Until early 1980 , Dowling and Theaker had the records manufactured at a record - pressing company in Burbank ,
Page 473 U. S. 211
Cal .
When that company later refused to take their orders , they sought out other record - pressing companies in Los Angeles and , through codefendant Richard Minor , in Miami , Fla .
The bootleg entrepreneurs never obtained authorization from or paid royalties to the owners of the copyrights in the musical compositions .
[ Footnote 4 ]
In the beginning , Dowling , who resided near Baltimore , handled the " artistic " end of the operation , contributing his knowledge of the Presley subculture , seeking out and selecting the musical material , designing the covers and labels , and writing the liner notes , while Theaker , who lived in Los Angeles and had some familiarity with the music industry , took care of the business end , arranging for the record pressings , distributing catalogs , and filling orders .
In early 1979 , however , having come to suspect that the FBI was investigating the west coast operation , Theaker began making shipments by commercial trucking companies of large quantities of the albums to Dowling in Maryland .
Throughout 1979 and 1980 , the venturers did their marketing through Send Service , a labeling and addressing entity , which distributed at least 50,000 copies of their catalog and advertising flyers to addresses on mailing lists provided by Theaker and Dowling .
Theaker would collect customers ' orders from post office
Page 473 U. S. 212
boxes in Glendale , Cal. , and mail them to Dowling in Maryland , who would fill the orders .
The two did a substantial business : the stipulated testimony establishes that , throughout this period , Dowling mailed several hundred packages per week and regularly spent $ 1,000 per week in postage .
The men also had occasion to make large shipments from Los Angeles to Minor in Miami , who purchased quantities of their albums for resale through his own channels .
The eight § 2314 counts on which Dowling was convicted arose out of six shipments of bootleg phonorecords from Los Angeles to Baltimore and two shipments from Los Angeles to Miami .
See n 1 , supra .
The evidence established that each shipment included thousands of albums , that each album contained performances of copyrighted musical compositions for the use of which no licenses had been obtained nor royalties paid , and that the value of each shipment attributable to copyrighted material exceeded the statutory minimum .
Dowling appealed from all the convictions save those for copyright infringement , and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in all respects .
739 F.2d 1445 ( 1984 ) .
As to the charges under § 2314 , the court relied on its decision in United States v. Belmont , 715 F.2d 459 ( 1983 ) , cert .
denied , 465 U.S. 1022 ( 1984 ) , where it had held that interstate transportation of videotape cassettes containing unauthorized copies of copyrighted motion pictures involved stolen goods within the meaning of the statute .
[ Footnote 5 ]
As in Belmont , the court reasoned that the rights of copyright owners in their protected property were indistinguishable from ownership interests in other types of property , and were equally deserving of protection under the statute .
739 F.2d at 1450 , quoting 715 F.2d at 461-462 .
Page 473 U. S. 213
We granted certiorari to resolve an apparent conflict among the Circuits [ Footnote 6 ] concerning the application of the statute to interstate shipments of bootleg and pirated sound recordings and motion pictures whose unauthorized distribution infringed valid copyrights .
469 U.S. 1157 ( 1985 ) .

Federal crimes , of course , " are solely creatures of statute . "
Liparota v. United States , 471 U. S. 419 , 471 U. S. 424 ( 1985 ) , citing United States v. Hudson , 7 Cranch 32 ( 1812 ) .
Accordingly , when assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute , we must pay close heed to language , legislative history , and purpose in order strictly to determine the scope of the conduct the enactment forbids .
Due respect for the prerogatives of Congress in defining federal crimes prompts restraint in this area , where we typically find a " narrow interpretation " appropriate .
See Williams v. United States , 458 U. S. 279 , 458 U. S. 290 ( 1982 ) .
Chief Justice Marshall early observed :
" The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly is perhaps not much less old than construction itself .
It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of
Page 473 U. S. 214
individuals , and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative , not in the judicial department .
It is the legislature , not the Court , which is to define a crime and ordain its punishment . "
United States v. Wiltberger , 5 Wheat . 76 , 18 U. S. 95 ( 1820 ) .
Thus , the Court has stressed repeatedly that
" " when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime , it is appropriate , before we choose the harsher alternative , to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite . ' " "
Williams v. United States , 458 U.S. at 458 U. S. 290 , quoting United States v. Bass , 404 U. S. 336 , 404 U. S. 347 ( 1971 ) , which in turn quotes United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. , 344 U. S. 218 , 344 U. S. 221-222 ( 1952 ) .
A
Applying that prudent rule of construction here , we examine at the outset the statutory language .
Section 2314 requires , first , that the defendant have transported " goods , wares , [ or ] merchandise " in interstate or foreign commerce ; second , that those goods have a value of " $ 5,000 or more " ; and , third , that the defendant " kno[w ] the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
Dowling does not contest that he caused the shipment of goods in interstate commerce , or that the shipments had sufficient value to meet the monetary requirement .
He argues , instead , that the goods shipped were not " stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
In response , the Government does not suggest that Dowling wrongfully came by the phonorecords actually shipped or the physical materials from which they were made ; nor does it contend that the objects that Dowling caused to be shipped , the bootleg phonorecords , were " the same " as the copyrights in the musical compositions that he infringed by unauthorized distribution of Presley performances of those compositions .
The Government argues , however , that the shipments come within the reach of § 2314 because the phonorecords physically
Page 473 U. S. 215
embodied performances of musical compositions that Dowling had no legal right to distribute .
According to the Government , the unauthorized use of the musical compositions rendered the phonorecords " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " within the meaning of the statute .

must determine , therefore , whether phonorecords that include the performance of copyrighted musical compositions for the use of which no authorization has been sought nor royalties paid are consequently " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " for purposes of § 2314 .
We conclude that they are not .
The courts interpreting § 2314 have never required , of course , that the items stolen and transported remain in entirely unaltered form .
See , e.g. , United States v. Moore , 571 F.2d 154 , 158 ( CA3 ) ( counterfeit printed Ticketron tickets " the same " as stolen blanks from which they were printed ) , cert .
denied , 435 U.S. 956 ( 1978 ) .
Nor does it matter that the item owes a major portion of its value to an intangible component .
See , e.g. , United States v. Seagraves , 265 F.2d 876 ( CA3 1959 ) ( geophysical maps identifying possible oil deposits ) ; United States v. Greenwald , 479 F.2d 320 ( CA6 ) ( documents bearing secret chemical formulae ) , cert .
denied , 414 U.S. 854 ( 1973 ) .
But these cases and others prosecuted under § 2314 have always involved physical " goods , wares , [ or ] merchandise " that have themselves been " stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
This basic element comports with the common - sense meaning of the statutory language : by requiring that the " goods , wares , [ or ] merchandise " be " the same " as those " stolen , converted or taken by fraud , " the provision seems clearly to contemplate a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported , and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods .
In contrast , the Government 's theory here would make theft , conversion , or fraud equivalent to wrongful appropriation of statutorily protected rights in copyright .
The copyright owner , however , holds no ordinary chattel .
A copyright , like other intellectual property , comprises a series of carefully defined and carefully delimited interests to which the law affords correspondingly exact protections .
" Section 106 of the Copyright Act confers a bundle of exclusive rights
Page 473 U. S. 217
to the owner of the copyright , " which include the rights " to publish , copy , and distribute the author 's work . "
Harper & Row , Publishers , Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U. S. 539 , 471 U. S. 546-547 ( 1985 ) .
See 17 U.S.C. § 106 .
However , " [t ] his protection has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work . "
Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios , Inc. , 464 U. S. 417 , 464 U. S. 432 ( 1984 ) ; id. at 464 U. S. 462-463 ( dissenting opinion ) .
For example , § 107 of the Copyright Act " codifies the traditional privilege of other authors to make fair use ' of an earlier writer 's work . "
Harper & Row , supra , at 471 U. S. 547 .
Likewise , § 115 grants compulsory licenses in nondramatic musical works .
Thus , the property rights of a copyright holder have a character distinct from the possessory interest of the owner of simple " goods , wares , [ or ] merchandise , " for the copyright holder 's dominion is subjected to precisely defined limits .
It follows that interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft , conversion , or fraud .
The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright :
" ' Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner , ' that is , anyone who trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted work in one of the five ways set forth in the statute , 'is an infringer of the copyright . ' [ 17 U.S.C. ] § 501 ( a ) . "
Sony Corp. , supra , at 464 U. S. 433 .
There is no dispute in this case that Dowling 's unauthorized inclusion on his bootleg albums of performances of copyrighted compositions constituted infringement of those copyrights .
It is less clear , however , that the taking that occurs when an infringer arrogates the use of another 's protected work comfortably fits the terms associated with physical removal employed by § 2314 .
The infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone .
But he does not assume physical control over the copyright ; nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use .
While one may colloquially link infringement with some general notion of wrongful
Page 473 U. S. 218
appropriation , infringement plainly implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run -of - the - mill theft , conversion , or fraud .
As a result , it fits but awkwardly with the language Congress chose -- " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " -- to describe the sorts of goods whose interstate shipment § 2314 makes criminal .
[ Footnote 8 ]
" And , when interpreting a criminal statute that does not explicitly reach the conduct in question , we are reluctant to base an expansive reading on inferences drawn from subjective and variable ' understandings . ' "
Wllliams v. United States , 458 U.S. at 458 U. S. 286 .
B
In light of the ill - fitting language , we turn to consider whether the history and purpose of § 2314 evince a plain congressional intention to reach interstate shipments of goods infringing copyrights .
Our examination of the background of the provision makes more acute our reluctance to read § 2314 to encompass merchandise whose contraband character derives from copyright infringement .
Congress enacted § 2314 as an extension of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act , ch. 89 , 41 Stat. 324 , currently codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2312 .
Passed in 1919 , the earlier
Page 473 U. S. 219
Act was an attempt to supplement the efforts of the States to combat automobile thefts .
Particularly in areas close to state lines , [ Footnote 9 ] state law enforcement authorities were seriously hampered by car thieves ' ability to transport stolen vehicles beyond the jurisdiction in which the theft occurred .
[ Footnote 10 ]
Legislating pursuant to its commerce power , [ Footnote 11 ]
Congress made unlawful the interstate transportation of stolen vehicles , thereby filling in the enforcement gap by " strik[ing ] down State lines which serve as barriers to protect [ these interstate criminals ] from justice . "
58 Cong.Rec. 5476 ( 1919 ) ( statement of Rep. Newton ) .
[ Footnote 12 ]
Congress acted to fill an identical enforcement gap when in 1934 it " extend[ed ] the provisions of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act to other stolen property " by means of the National Stolen Property Act.
Act of May 22 , 1934 , 48
Page 473 U. S. 220
Stat. 794 . See S.Rep. No. 538 , 73d Cong. , 2d Sess. , 1 ( 1934 ) ; H.R. Rep. No. 1462 , 73d Cong. , 2d Sess. , 1 ( 1934 ) ; H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1599 , 73d Cong. , 2d Sess. , 1 , 3 ( 1934 ) .
Again , Congress acted under its commerce power to assist the States ' efforts to foil the " roving criminal , " whose movement across state lines stymied local law enforcement officials .
78 Cong.Rec. 2947 ( 1934 ) ( statement of Attorney General Cummings ) .
[ Footnote 13 ]
As with its progenitor , Congress responded in the National Stolen Property
Act to " the need for federal action " in an area that normally would have been left to state law .
United States v. Turley , 352 U. S. 407 , 352 U. S. 417 ( 1957 ) .
No such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed , however , with respect to copyright infringement , for the obvious reason that Congress always has had the bestowed authority to legislate directly in this area .
Article I , § 8 , cl. 8 , of the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power
" To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . "
By virtue of the explicit constitutional grant , Congress has the unquestioned authority to penalize directly the distribution of goods that infringe copyright , whether or not those goods affect interstate commerce .
Given that power , it is
Page 473 U. S. 221
implausible to suppose that Congress intended to combat the problem of copyright infringement by the circuitous route hypothesized by the Government .
See United States v. Smith , 686 F.2d 234 , 246 ( CA5 1982 ) .
Of course , the enactment of criminal penalties for copyright infringement would not prevent Congress from choosing as well to criminalize the interstate shipment of infringing goods .
But in dealing with the distribution of such goods , Congress has never thought it necessary to distinguish between intrastate and interstate activity .
Nor does any good reason to do so occur to us .
In sum , the premise of § 2314 -- the need to fill with federal action an enforcement chasm created by limited state jurisdiction -- simply does not apply to the conduct the Government seeks to reach here .
C
The history of copyright infringement provisions affords additional reason to hesitate before extending § 2314 to cover the interstate shipments in this case .
Not only has Congress chiefly relied on an array of civil remedies to provide copyright holders protection against infringement , see 17 U.S.C. §§ 502-505 , but in exercising its power to render criminal certain forms of copyright infringement , it has acted with exceeding caution .
The first full - fledged criminal provisions appeared in the Copyright Act of 1909 , and specified that misdemeanor penalties of up to one year in jail or a fine between $ 100 and $ 1,000 , or both , be imposed upon " any person who willfully and for profit " infringed a protected copyright .
[ Footnote 14 ]
This provision
Page 473 U. S. 222
was little used .
In 1974 , however , Congress amended the section , by then 17 U.S.C. § 104 ( 1976 ed. ) , by the 1947 revision , [ Footnote 15 ] substantially to increase penalties for record piracy .
[ Footnote 16 ]
The new version retained the existing language , but supplemented it with a new subsection ( b ) , which provided that one who " willfully and for profit " infringed a copyright in sound recordings would be subject to a fine of up to $ 25,000 or imprisonment for up to one year , or both .
17 U.S.C. § 104 ( b ) ( 1976 ed. ) .
[ Footnote 17 ]
The legislative history demonstrates that , in increasing the penalties available for this category of infringement , Congress carefully calibrated the penalty to the problem : it had come to recognize that " record piracy is so profitable that ordinary penalties fail to deter prospective offenders . "
H.R. Rep. No. 93-1581 , p. 4 ( 1974 ) .
Even so , because it considered record piracy primarily an economic offense , Congress , after serious consideration , rejected a proposal to increase the available term of imprisonment to three years for a first offense and seven years for a subsequent offense .
Ibid .
Page 473 U. S. 223
When , in 1976 , after more than 20 years of study , Congress adopted a comprehensive revision of the Copyright Act , see Mills Music , Inc. v. Snyder , 469 U. S. 153 , 469 U. S. 159-161 ( 1985 ) ; Sony Corp. , 464 U.S. at 464 U. S. 462-463 , n. 9 ( dissenting opinion ) , it again altered the scope of the criminal infringement actions , albeit cautiously .
Section 101 of the new Act provided :
" Any person who infringes a copyright willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain shall be fined not more than $ 10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year , or both : Provided , however , That any person who infringes willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain the copyright in a sound recording afforded by subsections ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) of section 106 or the copyright in a motion picture afforded by subsections ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , or ( 4 ) of section 106 shall be fined not more than $ 25,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year , or both , for the first such offense and shall be fined not more than $ 50,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years , or both , for any subsequent offense . "
17 U.S.C. § 506 ( a ) ( 1976 ed. , Supp. V ) .
Two features of this provision are noteworthy : first , Congress extended to motion pictures the enhanced penalties applicable by virtue of prior § 104 to infringement of rights in sound recordings ; and , second , Congress recited the infringing uses giving rise to liability .
It is also noteworthy that , despite the urging of representatives of the film industry , see Copyright Law Revision : Hearings on H.R. 2223 before the Subcommittee on Courts , Civil Liberties , and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary , 94th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 716 ( 1975 ) ( statement of Jack Valenti , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , Inc. ) , and the initial inclination of the Senate ,
Page 473 U. S. 224
see S.Rep. No. 94-473 , p. 146 ( 1975 ) , Congress declined once again to provide felony penalties for copyright infringement involving sound recordings and motion pictures .
Finally , by the Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1982 , Pub.L. 97-180 , 96 Stat.
91 , Congress chose to address the problem of bootlegging and piracy of records , tapes , and films by imposing felony penalties on such activities .
Section 5 of the 1982 Act revised 17 U.S.C. § 506 ( a ) to provide that
" [ a ] ny person who infringes a copyright willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain shall be punished as provided in section 2319 of title 18 . "
Section 2319 ( b) ( 1 ) , in turn , was then enacted to provide for a fine of up to $ 250,000 , or imprisonment of up to five years , or both , if the offense
" involves the reproduction or distribution , during any one - hundred - and - eighty - day period , of at least one thousand phonorecords or copies infringing the copyright in one or more sound recordings [ or ] at least sixty - five copies infringing the copyright in one or more motion pictures or other audiovisual works . "
Subsection ( b ) ( 2 ) provides for a similar fine and up to two years ' imprisonment if the offense involves
" more than one hundred but less than one thousand phonorecords or copies infringing the copyright in one or more sound recordings [ or ] more than seven but less than sixty - five copies infringing the copyright in one or more motion pictures or other audiovisual works . "
And subsection ( b ) ( 3 ) provides for a fine of not more than $ 25,000 and up to one year 's imprisonment in any other case of willful infringement .
The legislative history indicates that Congress set out from a belief that the existing misdemeanor penalties for copyright infringement were simply inadequate to deter the enormously lucrative activities of large - scale bootleggers and pirates .
See 128 Cong.Rec. 9158-9159 ( 1982 ) ( remarks of Rep. Kastenmeier ) ; The Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1981 : Hearings on S. 691 before the Subcommittee on Criminal Law of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary , 97th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 8 ( 1981 ) ( statement of Renee
Page 473 U. S. 225
L. Szybala , Special Assistant to the Associate Attorney General ) .
Accordingly , it acted to " strengthen the laws against record , tape , and film piracy " by " increas[ing ] the penalties . . . for copyright infringements involving such products , " thereby " bring[ing ] the penalties for record and film piracy . . . into line with the enormous profits which are being reaped from such activities . "
S.Rep. No. 97-274 , pp. 1 , 7 ( 1981 ) . [ Footnote 18 ]
Thus , the history of the criminal infringement provisions of the Copyright Act reveals a good deal of care on Congress ' part before subjecting copyright infringement to serious criminal penalties .
First , Congress hesitated long before imposing felony sanctions on copyright infringers .
Second , when it did so , it carefully chose those areas of infringement that required severe response -- specifically , sound recordings and motion pictures -- and studiously graded penalties even in those areas of heightened concern .
This step - by - step , carefully considered approach is consistent with Congress ' traditional sensitivity to the special concerns implicated by the copyright laws .
In stark contrast , the Government 's theory of this case presupposes a congressional decision to bring the felony provisions of § 2314 , which make available the comparatively light fine of not more than $ 10,000 but the relatively harsh
Page 473 U. S. 226
term of imprisonment of up to 10 years , to bear on the distribution of a sufficient quantity of any infringing goods simply because of the presence here of a factor -- interstate transportation -- not otherwise thought relevant to copyright law .
The Government thereby presumes congressional adoption of an indirect but blunderbuss solution to a problem treated with precision when considered directly .
To the contrary , the discrepancy between the two approaches convinces us that Congress had no intention to reach copyright infringement when it enacted § 2314 .
D
The broad consequences of the Government 's theory , both in the field of copyright and in kindred fields of intellectual property law , provide a final and dispositive factor against reading § 2314 in the manner suggested .
For example , in Harper & Row , Publishers , Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U. S. 539 ( 1985 ) , this Court very recently held that The Nation , a weekly magazine of political commentary , had infringed former President Ford 's copyright in the unpublished manuscript of his memoirs by verbatim excerpting of some 300 words from the work .
It rejected The Nation 's argument that the excerpting constituted fair use .
Presented with the facts of that case as a hypothetical at oral argument in the present litigation , the Government conceded that its theory of § 2314 would permit prosecution of the magazine if it transported copies of sufficient value across state lines .
Tr. of Oral Arg. 35 .
Whatever the wisdom or propriety of The Nation 's decision to publish the excerpts , we would pause , in the absence of any explicit indication of congressional intention , to bring such conduct within the purview of a criminal statute making available serious penalties for the interstate transportation of goods " stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
Likewise , the field of copyright does not cabin the Government 's theory , which would as easily encompass the law of patents and other forms of intellectual property .
If " the
Page 473 U. S. 227
intangible idea protected by the copyright is effectively made tangible by its embodiment upon the tapes , " United States v. Gottesman , 724 F.2d 1517 , 1520 ( CA11 1984 ) , phonorecords , or films shipped in interstate commerce as to render those items stolen goods for purposes of § 2314 , so too would the intangible idea protected by a patent be made tangible by its embodiment in an article manufactured in accord with patented specifications .
Thus , as the Government as much as acknowledged at argument , Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 , its view of the statute would readily permit its application to interstate shipments of patent - infringing goods .
Despite its undoubted power to do so , however , Congress has not provided criminal penalties for distribution of goods infringing valid patents .
[ Footnote 19 ]
Thus , the rationale supporting application of the statute under the circumstances of this case would equally justify its use in wide expanses of the law which Congress has evidenced no intention to enter by way of criminal sanction .
[ Footnote 20 ]
This factor militates strongly against the reading proffered by the Government .
Cf. Williams v. United States , 458 U.S. at 458 U. S. 287 .
Page 473 U. S. 228
III
No more than other legislation do criminal statutes take on straitjackets upon enactment .
In sanctioning the use of § 2314 in the manner urged by the Government here , the Courts of Appeals understandably have sought to utilize an existing and readily available tool to combat the increasingly serious problem of bootlegging , piracy , and copyright infringement .
Nevertheless , the deliberation with which Congress over the last decade has addressed the problem of copyright infringement for profit , as well as the precision with which it has chosen to apply criminal penalties in this area , demonstrates anew the wisdom of leaving it to the legislature to define crime and prescribe penalties .
[ Footnote 21 ]
Here , the language of § 2314 does not " plainly and unmistakably " cover petitioner Dowling 's conduct , United States v. Lacher , 134 U. S. 624 , 134 U. S. 628 ( 1890 ) ; the purpose of the provision to fill gaps in state law enforcement does not couch the problem under attack ; and the rationale employed to apply the statute to
Page 473 U. S. 229
petitioner 's conduct would support its extension to significant bodies of law that Congress gave no indication it intended to touch .
In sum , Congress has not spoken with the requisite clarity .
Invoking the " time - honored interpretive guideline " that " ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity , ' " Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. at 471 U. S. 427 , quoting Rewis v. United States , 401 U. S. 808 , 401 U. S. 812 ( 1971 ) , we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals .
It is so ordered .

Only the § 2314 counts concern us here .

[ Footnote 2 ]
A " bootleg " phonorecord is one which contains an unauthorized copy of a commercially unreleased performance .
As in this case , the bootleg material may come from various sources .
For example , fans may record concert performances , motion picture soundtracks , or television appearances .
Outsiders may obtain copies of " out - takes , " those portions of the tapes recorded in the studio but not included in the " master , " that is , the final edited version slated for release after transcription to phonorecords or commercial tapes .
Or bootleggers may gain possession of an " acetate , " which is a phonorecord cut with a stylus , rather than stamped , capable of being played only a few times before wearing out , and utilized to assess how a performance will likely sound on a phonorecord .
Though the terms frequently are used interchangeably , a " bootleg " record is not the same as a " pirated " one , the latter being an unauthorized copy of a performance already commercially released .
[ Footnote 3 ]
See n 2 , supra .
For example , according to the stipulated testimony of the Presley archivist at RCA Records , which held the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute sound recordings of Presley performances from early in his career through the time of trial in this case , the " Elvis Presley Dorsey Shows " contained performances from Presley 's appearances on a series of six television shows in January , February , and March , 1956 ; " Elvis Presley From the Waist Up " contained performances from three appearances on " The Ed Sullivan Show " in September and October , 1956 , and January , 1957 ; " Plantation Rock " included a version of the title song recorded from an acetate , which other testimony indicated Dowling had purchased from the author of the song ; " The Legend Lives On " included material from unreleased master tapes from the RCA Records inventory ; " Rockin ' with Elvis New Year 's Eve " derived from a recording by an audience member at a 1976 concert in Pittsburgh ; and " Elvis on Tour " came from the master tape or the film source of the film of the same name .
Stipulation re Testimony of Joan Deary , 2 Record , Doc. No. 109 , pp. 24 , 25 , 35 , 37 , 40 , 44 .
With the exceptions of " Plantation Rock " and " Elvis on Tour , " quantities of each of these albums were included in the shipments giving rise to the § 2314 counts .
[ Footnote 4 ]
See Stipulation re Copyrights , Royalties and Licenses , 2 Record , Doc. No. 109 , pp. 111-125 , and Stipulation re Songs on Albums , 2 Record , Doc. No. 109 , pp. 127-145 .
The Copyright Act requires record manufacturers to obtain licenses and pay royalties to copyright holders upon pressing records that contain performances of copyrighted musical compositions .
17 U.S.C. § 115 .
While motion picture copyrights protect the soundtracks of Presley 's movies , Congress did not extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings until the Sound Recording Act of 1971 , Pub.L. 92-140 , 85 Stat. 391 , and then only to sound recordings fixed after February 15 , 1972 .
See Goldstein v. California , 412 U. S. 546 , 412 U. S. 551-552 ( 1973 ) .
Therefore , most of the sound recordings involved in this case , as opposed to the musical compositions performed , are apparently not protected by copyright .
In any event , the § 2314 counts rely solely on infringement of copyrights to musical compositions .
See n 1 , supra .

In United States v. Smith , 686 F.2d 234 ( CA5 1982 ) , the court held that interstate transportation of unauthorized copies of copyrighted motion pictures recorded " off the air " during television broadcasting did not fall within the reach of § 2314 .
The other courts which have addressed the issue have either agreed with the Ninth Circuit that interstate transportation of copies of infringing motion pictures and sound recordings comes within the statute , or assumed the same .
See United States v. Drum , 733 F.2d 1503 , 1505 - 1506 ( CA11 ) ( sound recordings ) , cert .

[ Footnote 7 ]
The Government argues in the alternative that , even if the unauthorized use of copyrighted musical compositions does not , alone , render the phonorecords contained in these shipments " stolen , converted or taken by fraud , " the record contains evidence amply establishing that the bootleggers obtained the source material through illicit means .
The Government points to testimony , for example , that the custodians of the tapes containing the out - takes which found their way onto Dowling 's records neither authorized their release nor permitted access to them by unauthorized persons .
App. 22-23 , 34 , 38-39 , 42-43 , 46 .
According to the Government , the wrongfully obtained tapes which contained the musical material should be considered " the same " as the phonorecords onto which the sounds were transferred , which were therefore " stolen , converted or taken by fraud " within the meaning of § 2314 .
Cf. United States v. Bottone , 365 F.2d 389 ( CA2 ) , cert .
denied , 385 U.S. 974 ( 1966 ) .
For several reasons , we decline to consider this alternative basis for upholding Dowling 's convictions .
The § 2314 counts in the indictment were founded exclusively on the allegations that the shipped phonorecords , which contained " Elvis Presley performances of copyrighted musical compositions , " were " stolen , converted and taken by fraud , in that they were manufactured without the consent of the copyright proprietors . "
See n 1 , supra .
The decision of the Court of Appeals does not rely on any theory of illegal procurement ; it rests solely on a holding that
" Dowling 's unauthorized sale of phonorecords of copyrighted material clearly involved ' goods , wares or merchandise ' within the meaning of the statute . "
739 F.2d 1445 , 1450 -1451 ( CA9 1984 ) .
Moreover , even assuming that the stipulated testimony contained sufficient evidence to establish the unlawful procurement of the source material , the Government made no attempt in the District Court to address the difficult problems of valuation under its alternative theory .
For example , it introduced no evidence that might have established the value of the tapes allegedly stolen from the RCA archives , nor how that value might relate to the value of the goods ultimately shipped .
Instead , its evidence concerning the value of the interstate shipments of records attempted to isolate the value attributable to the copyrighted musical compositions .
App. 24-33 .
Under these circumstances , we assess the validity of Dowling 's convictions only under the allegations made in the indictment .

The dissent relies on United States v. Turley , 352 U. S. 407 ( 1957 ) , and Morissette v. United States , 342 U. S. 246 ( 1952 ) , to give § 2314 a " very broad " reading .
Post at 473 U. S. 231-232 .
In Turley , after considering the purpose of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act to combat interstate transportation of feloniously taken vehicles , the Court rejected an interpretation of " stolen " which would have limited that term to common law larceny .
352 U.S. at 352 U. S. 417 .
Similarly , in Morissette , in considering the language of 18 U.S.C. § 641 providing that " [ w ] hoever embezzles , steals , purloins , or knowingly converts " Government property be subject to specified penalties , the Court pointed out that conversion extends beyond the common law definition of stealing .
342 U.S. at 342 U. S. 271-272 . Neither Turley nor Morissette involved copyright law specifically or intellectual property in general ; neither , therefore , sheds light on the particular problems presented by this case .

This Court has explained :
" By 1919 , the law of most States against local theft had developed so as to include not only common law larceny but embezzlement , false pretenses , larceny by trick , and other types of wrongful taking .
The advent of the automobile , however , created a new problem with which the States found it difficult to deal .
The automobile was uniquely suited to felonious taking , whether by larceny , embezzlement or false pretenses .
It was a valuable , salable article which itself supplied the means for speedy escape .
' The automobile [ became ] the perfect chattel for modern large - scale theft . '
This challenge could be best met through use of the Federal Government 's jurisdiction over interstate commerce .
The need for federal action increased with the number , distribution and speed of the motor vehicles until , by 1919 , it became a necessity .
The result was the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act . "

The Attorney General explained :
" These criminals have made full use of the improved methods of transportation and communication , and have taken advantage of the limited jurisdiction possessed by State authorities in pursuing fugitive criminals , and of the want of any central coordinating agency acting on behalf of all of the States .
In pursuing this class of offenders , almost inevitably breakdown of law enforcement results from this want of some coordinating and centralized law enforcement agency .

Congress did not remove this bar until the Sound Recording Act of 1971 , Pub.L. 92-140 , 85 Stat. 391 , which , while for the first time extending federal copyright coverage to sound recordings , see n 4 , supra , also made willful infringement of copyright in musical compositions subject to the general criminal provision .
See 85 Stat. 392 .
Congress first provided criminal penalties for copyright infringement in the Act of Jan. 6 , 1897 , 29 Stat.

The dissent suggests that , by providing that the new penalties " shall be in addition to any other provisions of Title 17 or any other law , " 18 U.S.C. § 2319 ( a ) , Congress " implicitly " approved the interpretation of § 2314 urged by the Government .

The Government 's rationale would also apply to goods infringing trademark rights .
Yet , despite having long and extensively legislated in this area , see federal Trademark Act of 1946 ( Lanham Act ) , 15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq. , in the modern era , Congress only recently has resorted to criminal sanctions to control trademark infringement .
See Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 , Pub.L. 98-473 , ch. XV , 98 Stat. 2178 .
See also S.Rep. No. 98-526 , pp. 1 - 2 , 5 ( 1984 ) ; 2 J. McCarthy , Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 30:39 ( 2d ed.1984 ) .
[ Footnote 21 ]
Indeed , in opposing the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case , the Government acknowledged that it no longer needs § 2314 to prosecute and punish serious copyright infringement .
Adverting to the most recent congressional copyright action , it advised the Court :
" [ A]pplication of Section 2314 . . . to the sort of conduct involved in this case is of considerably diminished significance since passage , subsequent to the offenses involved in this case , of the Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1982 , Pub.L. No. 97-180 , 96 Stat. 91 et seq . ( codified at 17 U.S.C. 506(a ) and 18 U.S.C. 2318 , 2319 ) .
The new statute provides for felony treatment for most serious cases of copyright infringement involving sound recordings and audiovisual materials and trafficking in counterfeit labels , while prior law provided only for misdemeanor treatment for first offenses under the copyright statutes .
In view of the increased penalties provided under the new statute , prosecutors are likely to have less occasion to invoke other criminal statutes in connection with copyright infringing activity . "
Brief in Opposition 8 .
These observations suggest the conclusion we have reached -- that § 2314 was not in the first place the proper means by which to counter the spread of copyright infringement in sound recordings and motion pictures .
JUSTICE POWELL , with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE WHITE join , dissenting .
The Court holds today that 18 U.S. C § 2314 does not apply to this case because the rights of a copyright holder are " different " from the rights of owners of other kinds of property .
The Court does not explain , however , how the differences it identifies are relevant either under the language of § 2314 or in terms of the purposes of the statute .
Because I believe that the language of § 2314 fairly covers the interstate transportation of goods containing unauthorized use of copyrighted material , I dissent .
Section 2314 provides for criminal penalties against any person who
" transports in interstate or foreign commerce any goods , wares , merchandise , securities or money , of the value of $ 5,000 or more , knowing the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
There is no dispute that the items Dowling transported in interstate commerce -- bootleg Elvis Presley records -- are goods , wares , or merchandise .
Nor is there a dispute that the records contained copyrighted Elvis Presley performances that Dowling had no right to reproduce and distribute .
The only issue here is whether the unauthorized use of a copyright may be " equate[d ] with theft , conversion , or fraud " for purposes of § 2314 .
Ante at 473 U. S. 217 .
Virtually every court that has considered the question has concluded that § 2314 is broad
Page 473 U. S. 230
enough to cover activities such as Dowling 's .
See , e.g. , United States v. Drum , 733 F.2d 1503 , 1505 - 1506 ( CA11 ) , cert .
denied , 469 U.S. 1061 ( 1984 ) ; United States v. Whetzel , 191 U.S.App.D.C. 184 , 187 , n. 10 , 589 F.2d 707 , 710 , n. 10 ( 1978 ) ; United States v. Berkwitt , 619 F.2d 649 , 656-658 ( CA7 1980 ) ; United States v. Sam Goody , Inc. , 506 F. Supp. 380 , 385-391 ( EDNY 1981 ) .
The only case cited by the Court that lends support to its holding is United States v. Smith , 686 F.2d 234 ( CA5 1982 ) .
[ Footnote 2/1 ]
The Court 's decision today is thus contrary to the clear weight of authority .
The Court focuses on the fact that " [t ] he copyright owner . . . holds no ordinary chattel . "
Ante at 473 U. S. 216 .
The Court quite correctly notes that a copyright is " comprise [d ] . . . of carefully defined and carefully delimited interests , " ibid. , and that the copyright owner does not enjoy " complete control over all possible uses of his work , ' " ante at 473 U. S. 217 , quoting Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios , Inc. , 464 U. S. 417 , 464 U. S. 432 ( 1984 ) .
But among the rights a copyright owner enjoys is the right to publish , copy , and distribute the copyrighted work .
Indeed , these rights define virtually the entire scope of an owner 's rights in intangible property such as a copyright .
Interference with these rights may be " different " from the physical removal of tangible objects , but it is not clear why this difference matters under the terms of § 2314 .
The statute makes no distinction between tangible and intangible property .
The basic goal of the National Stolen Property Act , thwarting the interstate transportation of misappropriated goods , is not served by the judicial imposition of this distinction .
Although the rights of copyright owners
Page 473 U. S. 231
in their property may be more limited than those of owners of other kinds of property , they are surely " just as deserving of protection .
. . . "
United States v. Drum , supra , at 1506 .
The Court concedes that § 2314 has never been interpreted to require that the goods , wares , or merchandise stolen and transported in violation of the statute remain in unaltered form .
Ante at 473 U. S. 216 .
See also United States v. Bottone , 365 F.2d 389 , 393-394 ( CA2 1966 ) .
It likewise recognizes that the statute is applicable even when the misappropriated item " owes a major portion of its value to an intangible component . "
Ante at 473 U. S. 216 .
The difficulty the Court finds with the application of § 2314 here is in finding a theft , conversion , or fraudulent taking , in light of the intangible nature of a copyright .
But this difficulty , it seems to me , has more to do with its views on the relative evil of copyright infringement versus other kinds of thievery , than it does with interpretation of the statutory language .
The statutory terms at issue here , i.e. , " stolen , converted or taken by fraud , " traditionally have been given broad scope by the courts .
For example , in United States v. Turley , 352 U. S. 407 ( 1957 ) , this Court held that the term " stolen " included all felonious takings with intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership , regardless of whether the theft would constitute larceny at common law .
Id. at 352 U. S. 417 .
Similarly , in Morissette v. United States , 342 U. S. 246 ( 1952 ) , the Court stated that conversion
" may be consummated without any intent to keep and without any wrongful taking , where the initial possession by the converter was entirely lawful .
Conversion may include misuse or abuse of property .
It may reach use in an unauthorized manner or to an unauthorized extent of property placed in one 's custody for limited use . "
Id. at 342 U. S. 271-272 .
Dowling 's unauthorized duplication and commercial exploitation of the copyrighted performances were intended to gain for himself the rights and benefits lawfully reserved to the copyright owner .
Under Turley , supra , his acts should be
Page 473 U. S. 232
viewed as the theft of these performances .
Likewise , Dowling 's acts constitute the unauthorized use of another 's property , and are fairly cognizable as conversion under the Court 's definition in Morissette .
The Court invokes the familiar rule that a criminal statute is to be construed narrowly .
This rule is intended to assure fair warning to the public , e.g. , United States v. Bass , 404 U. S. 336 , 404 U. S. 348 ( 1971 ) ; McBole v. United States , 283 U. S. 25 , 283 U. S. 27 ( 1931 ) , and is applied when statutory language is ambiguous or inadequate to put persons on notice of what the legislature has made a crime .
See , e.g. , United States v. Bass , supra ; Rewis v. United States , 401 U. S. 808 , 401 U. S. 812 ( 1971 ) ; Bell v. United States , 349 U. S. 81 , 349 U. S. 83 ( 1955 ) .
I disagree not with these principles , but with their application to this statute .
As I read § 2314 , it is not ambiguous , but simply very broad .
The statute punishes individuals who transport goods , wares , or merchandise worth $ 5,000 or more , knowing " the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud . "
18 U.S.C. § 2314 .
As noted above , this Court has given the terms " stolen " and " converted " broad meaning in the past .
The petitioner could not have had any doubt that he was committing a theft as well as defrauding the copyright owner .
[ Footnote 2/2 ]
The Court also emphasizes the fact that the copyright laws contain their own penalties for violation of their terms .
But the fact that particular conduct may violate more than one federal law does not foreclose the Government from making a choice as to which of the statutes should be the basis for an indictment .
" This Court has long recognized that , when an act violates more than one criminal statute , the Government
Page 473 U. S. 233
may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants . "
United States v. Batchelder , 442 U. S. 114 , 442 U. S. 123-124 ( 1979 ) .
Finally , Congress implicitly has approved the Government 's use of § 2314 to reach conduct like Dowling 's .
In adopting the Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1982 , Pub.L. 97-180 , 96 Stat.
91 , Congress provided that the new penalties " shall be in addition to any other provisions of title 17 or any other law . "
18 U.S.C. § 2319 ( a ) ( emphasis added ) .
The Senate Judiciary Committee specifically added the italicized language to clarify that the new provision " supplement [s ] existing remedies contained in the copyright law or any other law . "
S.Rep. No. 97-274 , p. 2 ( 1981 ) ( emphasis added ) .
Many courts had used § 2314 to reach the shipment of goods containing unauthorized use of copyrighted material prior to the enactment of the Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act .
By choosing to make its new felony provisions supplemental , Congress implicitly consented to continued application of § 2314 to these offenses .
Dowling and his partners " could not have doubted the criminal nature of their conduct .
. . . "
United States v. Bottone , supra , at 394 .
His claim that § 2314 does not reach his clearly unlawful use of copyrighted performances evinces " the sort of sterile formality " properly rejected by the vast majority of courts that have considered the question .
United States v. Belmont , 715 F.2d 459 , 462 ( CA9 1983 ) , cert .
denied , 465 U.S. 1022 ( 1984 ) .
Accordingly , I dissent .
[ Footnote 2/1 ]
In \ United States v. Drum , \ the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit considered and rejected the arguments offered in \ United States v. Smith\ and reiterated by the Court today .
I agree with \ Drum\ that neither the language nor purpose of § 2314 supports the view that the statute does not reach the unauthorized duplication and distribution of copyrighted material .
[ Footnote 2/2 ]
Indeed , there was stipulated testimony by a former employee of petitioner 's , himself an unindicted coconspirator , that petitioner and his partner
" were wary of any unusually large record orders , because they could be charged with an interstate transportation of stolen property if they shipped more than $ 5,000 worth of records . "
App. A19 -A20 ( stipulation regarding testimony of Aca " Ace " Anderson ) .
Neither side can drown out the other .
Both so far are exercising a measure of restraint .
But as authorities try to rein in Iran ’s most serious unrest since the Islamic Revolution , they face a diverse opposition united in its rejection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his policies .
After days of ignoring or dismissing the criticism , authorities appear to have recognized that they ’re unable to use their hold over electronic communications networks and state - controlled broadcasting to quell the protests over Friday ’s election .
They have started implementing a softer approach in public .
But they may not understand the depth of the problem they face .
The result Wednesday was the third mass protest rally in as many days , which witnesses said drew tens of thousands , and perhaps hundreds of thousands , onto the streets of Tehran .
And new protests are planned for today .
Mir -Hossein Mousavi , who lost to Ahmadinejad in an election his green - clad supporters regard as fraudulent , has asked backers to go to local mosques to pay tribute to those killed in the protests .
Within a culture steeped in the Shiite Muslim mystique of martyrdom , each death may motivate rather than discourage activists .

Whether or not Ahmadinejad won a majority of votes in the election , a large segment of the population rejects his vision and leadership .
Critics complain that he is popular among only a limited swath of Iranians of a certain religious and social background , the pious lower - middle class who continue to treasure their rural roots .
His modest lifestyle appeals to many who are fed up with official corruption , and he has used the country ’s oil wealth to finance payments to the poor .
But Iran is also suffering from high unemployment and inflation , and the president ’s opponents fear his foreign policy will lead to isolation from , if not open conflict with , the West .
It ’s not just that Ahmadinejad is unpopular among middle - class urbanites , minorities , women and youths who have united against him .
Unlike his reformist predecessor Mohammad Khatami , who advocated an “ Iran for all Iranians , ” Ahmadinejad , his critics believe , rules as if only his segment of the country ’s diverse tapestry counts .
After Ahmadinejad dismissed the protesters on Sunday as dirt , Iranian authorities have acknowledged the discontent but are seeking to keep it within the framework of the Islamic Republic ’s politics .

A smiling Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the nation ’s supreme leader , met Tuesday night with the representatives of all four presidential candidates , assuring them that fraud allegations would be investigated .
On Wednesday , a newscaster on state - controlled television slyly updated Ahmadinejad ’s comparison of Mousavi supporters to sore losers leaving a soccer game with a reference to a widely watched international match Wednesday between Iran and South Korea .
The game itself helped illustrate how widespread Mousavi ’s support has become .
A number of players wore green ribbons around their wrists .
However , the newscaster cited a different lesson to be learned from the game , which ended in a 1 - 1 draw .
“ During the game today between Iran and South Korea , it does n’t matter which player scores a goal , so long as Iran wins , ” he said .

The website of Iran ’s English - language Press TV satellite channel acknowledged Wednesday that “ hundreds of thousands ” had joined in rallies in the capital and other cities , among the first cracks in a wall of media silence or derision .
Officials and media argue that the West has exploited a minor domestic political squabble to foment Iranians against the state .
Iranian officials summoned the Czech , French , German and British ambassadors Tuesday to complain .
On Wednesday , they summoned the Swiss ambassador , who represents U.S. interests .
Authorities have been unable to quell the protests the way they suppressed student uprisings in 1999 and 2003 , using more blunt instruments of power .
They ’ve arrested a number of prominent reformist figures , including , on Wednesday , the outspoken former deputy interior minister , Saeed Leylaz , and sociology professor Hamid - Reza Jalaeipour .

Details also emerged about an attack by pro-government vigilantes on dormitories of Tehran University early Monday in which at least five and as many as seven people were shot or stabbed to death .
According to sources in Tehran , doctors at a hospital refused to work as a sign of protest over the killings .
Former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati , a confidant of Khamenei , summoned chancellors of medical universities for a meeting in which he urged them to crack down on campus protests .
The Revolutionary Guard , which launched a cyber - crimes unit this year , warned that any Iranian posting provocative material regarding the unrest on blogs or websites would be punished .
Cellphone service was shut down much of the day , and authorities are keeping an eye on websites .

A 21 - year - old engineering student named Ali said he had never even heard of Twitter .
But he learned about Wednesday ’s silent demonstration at Seventh of Tir Square by attending the previous day ’s march along Vali Asr Street .
So he told friends and relatives by using pay phones , and spread the word to his friends at the dormitories .
“ All the websites are shut down , ” he said , asking that his last name and his school not be published .
“ The phones never work .
We find out through word of mouth . ”
On the street , a loose network of organizers appears to guide the demonstrators , cordoning off the marchers from traffic and urging them not to chant slogans or engage in provocative talk with the Basiji militiamen who sometimes stand glaring at the protesters .
The impromptu leaders , mostly students and women ’s rights activists , hide their faces with green bandannas or surgical masks to prevent security officials from identifying them .

Protesters have tailored their message to make sure no one makes blanket calls against the Islamic Republic .
Such rhetoric would not only provoke the authorities , but alienate segments of a budding movement that includes a huge cross-section of the nation : emergency room physicians and pious , working - class women who cover all but their faces in black chadors ; factory owners and factory workers ; and a wide range of political groups whose agendas converge in opposition to Ahmadinejad .
Posters held aloft Wednesday urged demonstrators to stop their march at a certain point and call out praise for the prophet Muhammad .
Then , witnesses said , protesters were instructed to remain silent for 10 minutes in honor of those killed so far in the unrest , disperse and go home .
Big rallies held Tuesday and Wednesday were largely silent , devoid of slogans altogether , except for the occasional salavats -- blessings for the prophet and his descendants -- which served to both refresh the crowd as it walked along in the late spring heat and make older , pious protesters feel welcome as they worked their prayer beads .
“ We had one vote and we gave it to Mousavi , ” said one placard at Wednesday ’s rally .
“ We have one life and we ’ll give it up for freedom . ”
Advertisement
Both the government and the protesters seem eager to avoid an all - out confrontation .
Not only would a Tiananmen Square - style massacre sully officials ’ claims to popular legitimacy , it would create a whole new set of martyrs who could further galvanize a popular movement .
Such killings paved the way for the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Most of the violence has been inflicted by semiofficial militias such as the Basiji or the secretive Ansar-e Hezbollah , which have reportedly been responsible for at least 12 deaths in the last five days .
Perhaps more perilous for authorities is the possibility that some soldiers , security officials and Revolutionary Guardsmen might refuse orders to fire on protesters , creating a dangerous rift within the security apparatuses .
“ I would never do it , ” said Hossein , a 23 - year - old member of the security forces who said he and many of his friends at the military base where he serves support the marchers .
“ Maybe someone would , but I would never fire on any of these people myself . ”

daragahi@latimes.com
Mostaghim is a special correspondent .
Joining us today is James McCombe , the technical visionary behind Caustic Graphics and one of the company 's three founders .
Most recently James was the chief architect of Apple 's next - generation embedded rasterization algorithms , the basis of the rendering and compositing technology used in the iPhone and iPod .
He was also a lead architect for Apple 's OpenGL graphics system , and worked with the OpenGL standards committee to create early specifications for programmable shading languages .
Dr. Dobb's : James , what is ray tracing and why is it important ?
JM : Ray tracing is a method of using " virtual light rays " to determine visibility between two points in a geometric scene .
This allows for the modeling of physically accurate lighting phenomena such as reflection , refraction , soft shadowing , and global illumination , just to name a few .
The simplest example involves starting with a pixel on the display .
We trace a ray outward until we encounter the first object in the scene that the ray intersects .
Then , that object sets the color of the pixel to the color of the object .
The object could then cast more rays into the scene based on the properties of the material that the object is simulating .
These additional rays could be used to determine if the object is in shadow , to calculate a glossy reflection , to evaluate translucency , etc .
After many millions of rays bounce around the scene every which way , a beautiful image results .
Ray tracing is a much more intuitive rendering paradigm and can provide high - quality images with relative ease to the artist and programmer when compared to rasterization - based techniques which require many strange tricks to be employed to creating seemingly natural phenomena .
Unfortunately , ray tracing has traditionally been orders of magnitude slower so it was n't fit for interactive applications .
In addition , ray tracing has never had a general purpose API to abstract it from the underlying hardware , like OpenGL and DirectX have provided for rasterization .
We believe ray tracing will gradually supersede rasterization as the most popular rendering technique once it can be performed at acceptable speeds and have a familiar hardware independent programming interface .
Dr. Dobb's :
How does ray tracing differ from rasterization ?
JM : As I mentioned earlier , ray tracing can allow all of the objects in the scene to interact with each other by casting light rays between them .
These complex interactions create the difference between visually pleasing images and images that are obviously " computer generated " .
For example , light that bounces off of a red book on a shelf can produce a reddish tint on a white wall behind it .
Rasterization , by contrast , streams all of the geometry through the pipeline one object at a time .
This means that the red book has no way to know that it should tint the white wall , and the white wall has no way to know about the red book .
To overcome some of the limitations of rasterization , many content creators use tricks and pre-baking .
These can yield good results , but at a cost of labor and scene dynamism .
Tens of thousands of hours and millions of dollars are spent creating the complex multi-pass renderers behind high - production - value video games .
And each additional interaction needs to be coded into the game engine .
Nothing just " falls out " .
Nothing is free .
And these hacks are heavily specialized to the scene they are rendering .
Many of the supporting assets for an object ( shadow maps , reflection maps , etc. ) need to be recreated for every environment that the object may find itself inside of .
You could not transplant a car in a racing game from an Alpine track to a City track without doing substantial work to regenerate many of its assets .
Dr. Dobb's : Caustic Graphics , the company you founded , has developed a ray - tracing co-processor .
What are the advantages of the co-processor approach , as opposed to a software only ray tracer .
JM : In a word , efficiency .
Today 's GPGPUs have a tremendous amount of compute power but their architectures are not suited to ray tracing .
This is because , unlike rasterization , ray tracers cannot just stream geometry through a pipeline .
The complex visual effects that make difference between " game " quality graphics and photorealistic quality are created with incoherent rays bouncing around the scene in a chaotic way .
Each of these rays could access a different part of the scene and run a different program to simulate the material it is interacting with .
GPGPUs , which amount to incredibly wide SIMD machines , are optimized for running many instances of the same program kernel and accessing data that is fairly nearby in memory .
This means that GPGPU ray tracers do n't utilize most of the compute available since adjacent code threads will be taking divergent branching paths causing stalls and also frequently waiting on global memory access due to the small caches inherent in GPGPU architectures .
The Caustic co-processor offloads the scattered database operations inherent in ray - tracing and schedules results so that many rays accessing similar objects can be evaluated at the same time .
This relatively small chip unlocks the massive compute available in a GPGPU and allows it to run highly complex shaders in a ray - tracing system .
Dr. Dobb's :
Does it make sense for your co-processor to be implemented in one core of a multicore processor ?
JM : The internal structure of the Caustic hardware is not similar to anything in general - purpose processors today .
We don not believe it is possible to achieve comparable performance on today 's CPUs .
However , just as floating - point instructions have made their way into almost all CPUs available , we believe the fundamental capabilities of the Caustic hardware could be integrated into future GPGPU architectures , enabling even better performance .
With Caustic 's help , of course .
Another alternative would be to take the Caustic co-processor IP as - is and transplant an existing general - purpose core in a multicore processor .
As I said earlier , the Caustic co-processor is highly silicon efficient and would unlock the potential of the other general - purpose cores to perform shading operations in an efficient and ordered fashion .
Dr. Dobb's :
In what way did you extend the OpenGL APIs ?
JM : We have diverged from OpenGL ES in two significant ways .
First , we allow shaders to cast rays .
A shader author can programatically define the way a material interacts with light by using a ray shader .
In addition to all of the shading techniques available in a traditional GLSL fragment shader , rays become the most powerful tool in the toolbox , enabling interactions between ray shaders on multiple different objects in the scene .
Second , we changed to rendering pipeline to require " retain mode " operation .
Because ray tracing requires every part of the scene to be accessible when rays are being evaluated , we have created " Primitive Objects " to encapsulate all of the state needed to render an object in the scene .
A primitive object can reference shaders , textures , uniforms , vertex data , and anything else that is specific to a single object .
Dr. Dobb's :
Where can readers go for more information on the Caustic co-processor and SDK ?
JM : For more information , you can read our technical brief on CausticGL published here .
Also , our technical F.A.Q. contains lots of information about CausticOne published here .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Pennsylvania state workers ' paychecks are a little light these days .
Struggling to resolve a 20 - day - old budget impasse , Pennsylvania is withholding pay for 69,000 state employees for time worked after July 1 .
Workers Friday received only 70 % of their salary , covering days worked in June .
Starting two weeks from now , they 'll get nothing on payday until a state budget is approved .
Pennsylvania is one of three states that have yet to pass budgets for fiscal 2010 , which began July 1 .
The other two -- Connecticut and North Carolina -- are operating under temporary spending measures .
Still two others , Illinois and Ohio , approved their 2010 budgets this week .
In California , which passed a budget in February , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers are moving closer to resolving a $ 26 billion budget shortfall that has forced the state to send out nearly 150,000 IOUs to residents , contractors and small businesses .
When Pennsylvania state workers open their paychecks , they 'll see the words " Budget Impasse Leave without Pay " for the time worked in July .
Even after a budget is signed , employees wo n't see the money for several days .
And they wo n't get interest on the money owed , said a governor 's spokeswoman .
Some 29 financial institutions , primarily credit unions , are offering workers no -interest or low - interest loans .
Several food banks are also providing emergency supplies to employees in need .
They can also check with the state to see if they are temporarily eligible for food stamps or welfare .
Republicans and Democrats are battling over how to close a $ 2 billion budget gap .
The former do n't want to raise taxes , while the latter do n't want to cut too deeply into state services .
Lawmakers may take up the budget issue soon if the House passes its version Friday .
It would then have to pass muster with the governor .
California 's furlough Fridays
Meanwhile , California residents are still reeling from their state 's budget stalemate .
The impasse has affected residents , businesses and the state 's credit rating .
Controller John Chiang has issued 147,000 IOUs totaling $ 662 million since July 2 in an effort to close a nearly $ 3 billion cash shortfall for the month .
They are going to county social service agencies , those owed state income tax refunds and state vendors .
Holders wo n't get the funds until the budget is passed or until Oct. 2 , whichever comes first .
They will receive an interest rate of 3.75 % .
Several dozen credit unions are accepting the IOUs , and Citibank said Friday it will do so until July 24 .
But Wells Fargo , Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , stopped taking the paper after July 10 .
This has left some residents struggling .
Donna Webb , who supplies books to state prisons , has received four IOUs totaling $ 33,000 and is waiting to receive another batch for $ 27,000 .
The Exeter , Calif. , small business owner deposited nearly all the funds in her Bank of America account before it stopped accepting the paper , but she had to wait two weeks to access the money since the bank is n't crediting IOUs as it does standard checks .
Her suppliers , however , are n't cutting her a break .
Already , one has lowered her credit limit because she was late with a payment .
" My company which I started a year ago may not survive this crisis , " said Webb , whose business is called The BookLady .
" I still have to pay my creditors for the products ordered [ and ] they are not inclined nor obligated to accept an IOU from me . "
At the same time , many non-emergency state agencies shut down Friday for the second " furlough Friday " this month .
Schwarzenegger added a third monthly furlough day on July 1 when he declared a state of emergency .
These divisions will be closed the first , second and third Friday of every month , starting July 10 .
The governor and lawmakers have said this week that they are close to a budget deal , though education funding remained a sticking point .
The impasse is growing more costly to California as its financial situation grows more precarious .
Earlier this week , Moody 's downgraded the state 's credit rating to three notches above junk status , following a similar move by Fitch Rating , which put it two notches above .
The state treasurer warned Thursday that such downgrades limit California 's ability to borrow money .
If the Golden State 's rating does fall into junk territory , it could be a disaster , said Treasurer Bill Lockyer .
" If the governor and legislature dump us on that [ junk ] pile , they will end indefinitely the state 's financial ability to build schools , highways , levees -- all the critical public works we need to rebuild California , " he said .
" If we 're denied the ability to sell bonds , financing for infrastructure projects will cease .
It wo n't slow .
It will stop .
Many thousands of California workers will lose their jobs .
Thousands of businesses will lose billions of dollars in revenue . "

Dolphin Rape Caught on Film
Australian tourist , Karl Jurg , captured a horrifying event while vacationing in Florida .
Jurg told reporters , “ It was a nice day , the water was calm .
The captain took us far out so that we could scuba and swim and maybe see some fish .
I do n’t much go for the water so I was taking some pictures of the other people on the boat as they were jumping into the water .
Just as one woman jumped off the boat into the water a dolphin shot straight out of the water and grabbed her and took her under , I just snapped off a couple shots and I was amazed that I actually got it on film .
It ’s weird but it was kind of beautiful the way it grabbed her , it was so graceful .
Poor girl still has n’t been found though . ”
The woman taken by the dolphin was 37 year old pilates instructor and professional dancer , Tanya Halerfan of Liverpool , NY .
Authorities are still looking for Halerfan .
Bob Grunderson of the National Coast Guard made a statement to the press stating , “ Our search for Miss Halerfan or her remains will continue though we hold no hope of finding either .
In past experience with cases of dolphin kidnapping and sexual assault the victims are usually never found . ”
Researchers studying dolphin behavior have been noticing an alarming trend in recent years .
They have discovered rogue packs of adult male dolphins gang raping swimmers in open waters .
Human decoys fitted with tracking devices have been dumped in open waters and observed from helicopter .
Scott Randleston of the Dolphin Research Institute of Boca Raton , has been studying dolphin behavior for 17 years , and came up with the decoy program .
“ In every case the decoy was set upon in a short time by groups of dolphins ranging from 8 to 20 young males .
It seems there are gangs of dolphin predators roaming the open waters looking for humans to sexually assault .
The dolphins in each case were observed circling the swimmer as one of the group grabbed them with their penis and dragged them under , then the others followed .
You see dolphins have a prehensile penis , it is full of powerful muscles and they can wrap it around objects , such as a human wrist , ankle , neck , or waist .
One could compare it to a boa constrictor or an elephant trunk … .
The decoys never resurfaced in any of the studies ….
We tracked one of the decoys to an underwater cave where it had been repeatedly raped and torn apart by the dolphins . ”
There are at least 14 cases of dolphin rape reported each year in the United States , these usually occur near the shore where victims are able to escape before they can be dragged into a dolphin rape cave .
There is no real estimate of how many deaths are the result of dolphin rape each year as many of these occur in open water where there are few eyewitnesses if any .
Authorities will continue the search for Halerfan until Wednesday , stating , “ We believe this to be a reasonable time frame , if she were not killed in the attack it still means she will have been in open water without any sort of flotation device for more than 6 days and the likelihood of survival at that point is not possible . ”
In a rare conservation success , a beautiful butterfly species that was headed for extinction has been brought back from the brink , thanks to careful biological observations of the insect 's life cycle .
The mysterious disappearance of the Large Blue Butterfly across most of northern Europe was originally put down to its popularity among insect collectors [ Telegraph ] .
Then biologist Jeremy Thomas spent six summers in the 1970s studying the very last colony of large blue butterflies in the United Kingdom , and determined that the butterflies were dependent on one species of red ant for their survival -- and those ants were losing their habitat .
The butterflies lay their eggs on flowering thyme plants , and the hatched caterpillars fall to the ground and begin to impersonate immature red ants .
They secrete chemicals and even make noises that make the red ants believe they are wayward grubs .
The ants then mistakenly carry the caterpillars to their underground homes and keep looking after them even though the adopted intruders gobble ant grubs for 10 months before forming a chrysalis and flying away as adult butterflies [ Reuters ] .
However , the red ants live in fields where the grass is short enough to let the sun warm the soil .
Historically , rabbits had kept the grass short , but in the mid-1950s rabbit populations were suddenly devastated by the plague - like disease myxomatosis [ The Independent ] .
Farmers had also been gradually halting the practice of grazing their cattle , which allowed pastures to get overgrown .
When the grass grew less than one inch taller than usual , the increased shade cooled the soil by more than three degrees Fahrenheit , Thomas found , and the red ants vanished .
" To human beings the change looks like absolutely nothing .
But when you are on the scale of insects it makes a huge difference to the micro-habitats where they live , " he said [ Reuters ] .
Thomas worked out the ecological pressures on the large blues in the 1970s , but he was to late to save the species in Britain ; the last colony there died out in 1979 .
But the knowledge to bring it back and keep it was now in place ; and in 1983 ... he brought large blue caterpillars from Sweden and released them [ The Independent ] .
Cows were brought in to graze in the reintroduction sites , and both the red ants and the blue butterflies found their niches in the ecosystem again .
In a paper that will be published online this week by Science , researchers report that there are now more than 30 colonies of large blue butterflies in the United Kingdom , with an estimated population of about 20,000 ....
Broadcaster Sir David Attenborough commented : " The restoration of the large blue butterfly to Britain is a remarkable success story , illustrating the power of ecological research to reverse damaging environmental changes " [ BBC News ] .

University of Hawaii Astronomer Takes Sharpest Picture of Pluto System The Pluto system with Pluto and Charon in the center and Nix and Hydra top right .
Photo by David Tholen .
Almost 30 years after the discovery of Pluto 's large moon , Charon , a University of Hawaii astronomer has used a ground - based telescope to take an image of the Pluto system that exceeds the sharpness possible with the Hubble Space Telescope .
" Several favorable factors occurred simultaneously to yield these spectacular images of the Pluto system , " said Dr. David Tholen , who performed the observations during the early evening of September 5 using the adaptive optics system on one of Mauna Kea 's twin Keck telescopes .
" The natural seeing was better than average that night , more sensitive wavefront sensors were installed on the telescope , and Pluto was at its maximum brightness , thereby giving the improved adaptive optics system more light with which to work its magic , " he said .
The adaptive optics system uses a deformable mirror and sensors that allow it to compensate for turbulence in Earth 's atmosphere that normally blurs the light from celestial bodies .
The new images , which have a resolution of about 35 milliarcseconds , are nearly diffraction limited at the 1.6 - micron wavelength used for the exposures .
They are about 20 times sharper than the images of Pluto taken 30 years ago .
Altogether , Tholen took 16 images of the Pluto system during one hour on the Keck telescope .
When he combined all 16 images to form a single image , Nix and Hydra , Pluto 's small satellites discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2005 , became clearly visible .
The new satellites are both about visual magnitude 23.5 compared with 14th magnitude for Pluto .
" It is our intent to obtain several more images of the Pluto system , hopefully with this same level of quality , so that we can track Nix and Hydra completely around Pluto several times , " said Tholen .
" By making extremely precise measurements of the satellites ' positions , we will determine their masses by detecting the tiny displacements caused by their mutual gravitational attraction .
Once the masses are in hand , we 'll be able to say something more definitive about how big these new satellites are . "
Astronomers have estimated that Nix and Hydra are less than 100 km in diameter , compared with 1212 km for Charon and about 2300 km for Pluto .
Scientists planning the 2015 flyby of Pluto with NASA 's New Horizons spacecraft are intensely interested in the results .
" Something as simple as selecting the proper exposure time to snap images of Nix and Hydra with New Horizons depends on knowing how big they are and how reflective their surfaces are , " said Tholen .
" One of our goals is to have those answers well in advance of the flyby . "

This image combines all 16 exposures , with the contrast adjusted to show Pluto 's new satellites Nix ( left ) and Hydra ( right ) as the small dots in the upper right .
Both Nix and Hydra are about 5000 times fainter than Pluto , thus both Pluto and Charon are washed out in this image .
The Pluto system moved with respect to the background stars during the one hour of observations , leaving the stars trailed in this image .

For comparison , the discovery image of Charon ( 1978 , James Christy ) is available here : Founded in 1967 , the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa conducts research into galaxies , cosmology , stars , planets , and the sun .
Its faculty and staff are also involved in astronomy education , deep space missions , and in the development and management of the observatories on Haleakala and Mauna Kea .
Established in 1907 and fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges , the University of Hawaii is the state 's sole public system of higher education .
The UH System provides an array of undergraduate , graduate , and professional degrees and community programs on 10 campuses and through educational , training , and research centers across the state .
UH enrolls more than 50,000 students from Hawaii , the U.S. mainland , and around the world .

This ad is flat out absurd , why ?
Not because my ‘ religious sentiments ’ have been hurt .
I reckon if my religion is as strong in its tenets and philosophies as I believe it is , if it has survived and thrived over hundreds of years and remains relevant to me today , it will take more than a random act of some idiot somewhere to do it irreparable damage .
Besides , I am not much for jumping to the defense of my religion .
Not because I do n’t care , but because it is stupid — and unspeakably arrogant — for me to claim that my gods and my religion are omnipotent , and in the same breath to suggest that my gods need the intervention of a mere mortal to ensure their safety and security .
If they are powerful , they ’ll look after themselves ; if they are not , then it ’s asinine for me to imagine that they can look after me .
No , this ad is absurd simply because it is bad advertising , period .
There is no intelligence , no creative connect between the product and the visual .
The only apparent reason for the use of this image is for shock value .
I ’m not against ads that shock as a means of reinforcing a message — vide the recent Calvin Klein ad , to cite just one instance .
But if shock is the sole raison d’etre of your creativity , the least you could do is avoid gratuitously trampling on the feelings of others .
The corporate in question deserves all the flak it is getting for using , sans rhyme or apparent reason , an image that is enshrined in the iconography of a particular religion .
[ With no intention to denigrate Christianity , how would it play if an image of Jesus Christ at , say , the Last Supper was used to promote a particular brand of wine ?
At least such advertising would connect product and visual more directly , since there is no argument that wine was part of the menu at that event . ]
As if the ad were n’t nonsensical enough , the related reportage takes the absurdity quotient a few notches higher .
Most Hindus are vegetarian .
I choked down the eggs and bacon I had for breakfast and was getting ready to argue the point , when I got trumped .
If an “ acclaimed Hindu statesman ” says so , then I guess he must be right , and my breakfast must in fact have been grass , tricked out as a sunny - side - up [ It is all Maya , did n’t Krishna say ? ] .
Acclaimed Hindu statesman Rajan Zed , in a statement in Nevada ( USA ) today , said that it was highly disturbing to see goddess Lakshmi , who is highly revered in Hinduism , modeling for a meat sandwich as shown .
Lakshmi was meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not for pushing meat sandwiches in the streets for mercantile greed of a global corporation .
No quarrel with the text of that statement .
As for the ‘ acclaimed Hindu statesman ’ , Amit Varma ’s earlier post suffices for comment .
The real WTF elements come later :
Rajan Zed pointed out that Hinduism promoted strict vegetarianism insisting on ahimsa ( not harming living creatures ) and non-killing , and renouncing animal slaughter and meat eating .
It suggested taking of sattvik ( vegetables , fruits , etc. ) and avoiding rajasik ( eggs , etc. ) and tamasik ( meat , intoxicants , etc. ) foods .
Zed argued that there was extensive protection of life in Hinduism and ahimsa was a command .
It was a clear denigration showing a Hindu goddess patronizing a meat sandwich .
Burger King should create an internal team of senior executives who should clear all the publicity material before it went to the public and this team should be well trained .
If Burger King wanted its executives to learn about world religions , he was willing to help , Rajan Zed added .
What to say ?
Luckily , Hinduism is resilient enough to survive the attentions of Burger King and Rajan Zed both .

The report said : “ The general situation of China 's Muslims has resonated amongst the global jihadist community .

The existence of the program , and the fact that it was kept secret from lawmakers for nearly eight years at the direction of former Vice President Dick Cheney , has fanned an already heated atmosphere in Washington over the Bush administration 's intelligence programs .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials have said that in terminating the program , Panetta may have been more concerned about the fact that the initiative had been kept secret from Congress than he was about the merits of the program .
A U.S. intelligence official said Panetta has not ruled out reviving an effort to develop a similar close - range capability in closer collaboration with lawmakers .
" If the United States ever needs something like this in the future , we 'll find better ways to build it , " the U.S. intelligence official said .
" That includes briefing Congress earlier on .
Panetta understands all that .
He 's an aggressive proponent of counter - terrorism , pushing tools and tactics that work and have the support to be sustainable .
This one did n't . "
Leading Democratic lawmakers have said it was illegal for the CIA not to disclose the program to intelligence committees , and called for an investigation .
" Individuals who ordered that Congress be kept in the dark should be held accountable , " Sen. Russell D. Feingold ( D - Wis. ) , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said Monday .
Feingold also said he had expressed " deep concerns about the program itself " in a classified letter to President Obama .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the former vice president may have broken the law by instructing the CIA to keep the program secret .
Had Cheneyin killing any of al Qaeda leaders with his extra-constitutional paramilitary squads I might be more willing to defend him .
I wonder if they even tried or if his squads had more sinister purposes than tracking down al Qaeda members .
Is the CIA reallyincompetent and useless ?
Let 's see if the Chinese are as complacent about letting al Qaeda thumb its nose at them the way the worthless Bush Regime did .
What was actually wrong with Cheney 's CIA death squads were not only their inability to actually accomplish anything at all but also that they were illegal from day one , using public money without bothering to inform congressional intelligence committee leadership .
Stooges for Cheney -- particularly his vicious daughter Liz - - are screaming like stuck pigs at the prospect of Cheney being hauled in front of investigators and questioned about his unconstitutional activities .
Hopefully Jeb and Liz will reprise a Bush Cheney ticket in the not too distant future .
She says she 's more than open to running and the Bush Family is still determined to get its hands back on the levers of political power again .
Impossible , you say ?
Why ?
This is the United States ; is possible and no matter how venal or ignorant the Bushes have proven themselves , no one has been hauled before a firing squad and no one is in prison so why should they slink back into the muck they crawled out of ?

FIVE years ago Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske wrote a book , “ Trading Up : The New American Luxury ” .
They argued that Americans , even those of modest means , were abandoning merely adequate products for luxurious ones .
Jake the construction worker , for example , splurged $ 3,000 on Callaway golf clubs , though he could have bought a set nearly as good for a third as much .
( “ They make me feel rich , ” he said . )
A shipping clerk on $ 25,000 a year bought silk pyjamas from Victoria 's Secret .
A couple making $ 125,000 ordered a $ 4,000 brand - name cooking range , even though their kitchen came with a free generic one .
If you read the book backwards , it describes what is going on today .
Americans are trading down .
If they still have jobs ( as 91 % of the workforce do ) , they are worried about losing them .
Their homes are no longer cash machines and their investments are in a ditch .
Household net worth fell by a staggering $ 11.2 trillion last year .
The rich are cancelling orders for yachts .
Working Americans are forgoing even small luxuries .
Lindt & Sprüngli , a maker of exquisite chocolate truffles , is closing 50 of its 80 stores in America .
Hershey 's , a maker of less chocolatey chocolate , is doing rather well .
Limited Brands , which owns Victoria 's Secret , is not .
Americans are rediscovering thrift .
Retail sales fell by 11 % from their peak in late 2007 to April 2009 .
Personal consumption has fallen 2.5 % since last summer .
The Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) , a consultancy , finds that nearly three - quarters of Americans plan to curb their spending over the next year .
Trading down is not difficult .
Instead of , say , blowing $ 4.50 on a Strawberries and Crème Venti Frappuccino from Starbucks , Americans are popping into Dunkin ' Donuts for a basic cuppa Joe at a buck or so .
Instead of shopping at Neiman Marcus ( a posh department store known colloquially as “ Needless Mark - up ” ) , they are driving to the out - of - town Wal - Mart superstore or shopping online for bargains at Amazon ( see chart 2 ) .
A recent Pew poll found that 21 % of Americans planned to grow their own vegetables , 16 % had held a garage sale or sold things online and 10 % had either taken in a friend or relative or moved in with one .
Pundits are coining phrases such as “ austerity chic ” and “ luxury shame ” .
Four - fifths of Americans told the BCG they would defer big purchases that can wait .
The most obvious example is a car .
After a home , this is the most expensive object a typical family buys .
New cars are nice , but old ones can last a long time , as any third - world taxi - driver knows .
So Americans are keeping their old wheels on the road .
Repair shops are bustling .
Desperate dealers are offering interest - free finance .
Hyundai , a maker of unflashy cars , has lifted its share of the American market by saying : buy a car from us , and if you lose your job we 'll buy it back .
The beneficiaries of the new parsimony are , unsurprisingly , firms that offer low prices .
The only two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average that rose in 2008 were Wal - Mart and McDonald's .
Wal - Mart , with its hyperefficient supply chain , is so good at squeezing costs that it has a measurable effect on the national inflation rate .
McDonald 's is enticing cash - strapped diners with meals for as little as $ 1 .
Americans who still eat out are doing so at cheaper restaurants .
Russ Klein , a senior executive at Burger King , another fast - food chain , reckons that on balance the recession has helped his firm .
High unemployment hurts breakfast sales , because jobless people have less cause to get out of bed .
But overall , cash - strapped consumers are buying more burgers in paper bags and fewer steaks served on white linen .
Bloomberg News
Cheap and cheerful
The competition among the fast - food chains is exuberantly vicious .
Burger King produces edgy advertisements in the hope that people will pass them around online .
Earlier this year it offered users of Facebook , a social - networking website , a free Whopper burger if they would dump ten of their online friends .
Facebook soon shut down the promotion , but not before Burger King was able to claim that the public 's love of its flame - grilled product was “ stronger than 233,906 friendships ” .
Another way Americans are saving money is by staying at home , so firms that offer a distraction from the horrors of family life are doing well .
Netflix , which lets couch potatoes order films from a huge library for as little as $ 4.99 a month , said in April that it had shipped its 2 billionth DVD .
Amazon , an online bookseller that has expanded into music , video games , hiking equipment and even sex toys , boosted profits by 24 % in the first quarter .
Of course , if you are going to spend a lot of time at home , you need to be able to defend it .
Gun sales are unusually brisk : FBI background checks in the three months from November 2008 were up by 31 % on the previous year .
Some Americans are stocking up in anticipation of tighter gun laws under Mr Obama .
Others fear that the newly jobless will turn criminal .
Neither fear is likely to prove founded , but gun stores are still running out of ammunition .
The big squeeze
As consumers cut back , so do companies .
Everyone is hoarding cash , trimming costs and painfully burning off fat .
Inventories fell by 7 % from August 2008 to March this year .
Some industries will have to shrink dramatically to survive .
Car - parts suppliers , for example , are in dire straits , despite a promise of $ 5 billion in emergency loans from the government .
TI Automotive , which makes fuel tanks , has laid off a quarter of its white - collar staff in North America in the past year .
Managers ' salaries have been slashed .
Blue - collar workers ' hourly pay has been frozen and their hours cut by half .
The firm is delaying paying its own suppliers unless they can deliver exactly what it wants , when it wants it .
Yet all this belt - tightening will not be enough .
Car -parts suppliers must consolidate , says William Kozyra , TI 's president .
There are typically six to eight of them for each part .
To achieve the necessary economies of scale , that must shrink to two or three , he reckons .
Unfortunately , suppliers would need to borrow money to finance mergers or acquisitions , and no one will lend right now to an industry whose future is in such doubt .
Other industries are doing better .
Few firms have the crushing legacy costs of GM or Chrysler , and few carry such unbearable debts .
Most of America 's non-financial firms did not go mad in the credit boom .
In fact , since the dotcom and telecoms busts earlier this decade , many have put their balance - sheets in order .
While households and financial firms went on a borrowing binge , non-financial firms stayed fairly sober .
Household debt leapt from 71 % of GDP at the beginning of 2001 to 97 % in late 2008 .
Financial - sector debt vaulted from 85 % to 121 % .
But non-financial firms ' debt rose only from 66 % to 78 % .
Despite massive injections of taxpayers ' cash to restore lenders ' balance - sheets , it will be a while before the credit crunch ends .
Between 2000 and 2007 the average American increased his personal consumption by 44 % .
This accounted for 77 % of America 's economic growth during that period .
Much of it was financed by debt .
In five years , American households extracted $ 2.3 trillion of equity from their homes .
They blew 20 % of this on consumption , 19 % on sprucing up their homes and 44 % on assets such as stocks .

Cleaning up in tough times
The hangover from this party will be long and painful .
Households ' total outstanding borrowing fell in the fourth quarter of 2008 , for the first time since the second world war .
The personal - saving rate rose to 4.2 % in the first quarter of 2009 , from a nadir of minus 0.7 % in 2005 .
“ It is easy to see how consumer deleveraging could result in hundreds of billions of dollars - worth of forgone consumption in coming years , ” say Martin Baily , Susan Lund and Charles Atkins of the McKinsey Global Institute .
For most non-financial firms , however , there are a couple of bright spots in the gloom .
Their balance - sheets are mostly healthier than the banks ' .
And for the strongest firms the downturn offers opportunities to snap up prime assets cheaply .
Consider Marriott .
Although the hotel business tends to rise and fall in lockstep with the wider economy , not every hotelier is equally exposed .
The Marriott name ( or one of its sister brands ) graces more than 3,000 hotels worldwide , but the company owns only half a dozen .
The rest are franchised out or managed by Marriott for a fee .
Since Marriott owns so few properties , it profits less during a boom .
But it suffers less during a slump .
It still collects franchise and management fees .
Only its performance - related payments shrink .
So while owners are struggling , Marriott is scouting for bargains .
Mr Sorenson , the company 's president , predicts that distressed hotels could soon be on sale for half - price .
He will buy some , perhaps , and sell them when times improve .
Like the Rothschilds of old , Marriott likes to buy to the sound of cannons and sell to the sound of violins .
Making money by saving money
Firms that help other firms save money are also in a strong position .
For example , Accruent , a Californian information - technology firm , helps big organisations make more efficient use of their land and buildings .
Its clients include Target ( a retailer ) , Lockheed Martin ( an aerospace firm ) and Yale University .
Organisations such as these may have hundreds of properties , tens of thousands of pages of leases and a labyrinth of obligations to landlords , janitors and the taxman .
In good times property management is seen as a fixed cost , says Mark Friedman , Accruent 's chief executive .
But now firms are looking for ways to trim their bills .
Accruent helps them build more rationally , find cheaper leases and fend off landlords who try to overcharge for extras .
The recession creates new problems : leases do n't expire just because you lay people off .
Accruent helps firms shuffle employees around to create an empty building that can then be sold or sublet .
So its services are in demand .
But the sheer unpredictability of the economy still makes Mr Friedman nervous .
Quite often , he opens the Wall Street Journal and finds that something bad has happened to a firm he thought he was about to do business with .
“ It feels like we 're driving at 100 mph in a fog , ” he says .
On the plus side , many of the efficiencies discovered through necessity during the downturn will outlast it .
For example , firms are cutting business travel by videoconferencing .
Mr Sorenson of Marriott plays down the threat , arguing that there is no substitute for meeting people face - to - face .
Others are not so sure .
Videoconferencing technology keeps improving .
Some meetings are necessary , but others are a waste of time .
Mr Kozyra of TI Automotive predicts that , when the good times return , “ we 'll go halfway back ” to travelling , and maybe send two executives to meet customers instead of six .

A group calling themselves " Answers in Genesis " recently took out a billboard in Texas depicting a young boy holding a gun .
Here ’s how Answers in Genesis describes themselves :
An apologetics ( i.e. , Christianity - defending ) ministry , dedicated to enabling Christians to defend their faith and to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ effectively …we also desire to train others to develop a biblical worldview , and seek to expose the bankruptcy of evolutionary ideas , and its bedfellow , a “ millions of years old ” earth ( and even older universe ) .
[..]
Personally , I ca n’t believe they are implying that non-believers , or to whom God “ does n’t matter , ” are going to take a gun and shoot someone in the face .
Striking yes ; thoughtful , absolutely not .
Although supposedly their beef is with evolution , I do n’t see how that point is conveyed with this picture .
So , according to them , believing what Darwin had to say means a person is lawless and will go on a killing rampage ?
They were so enamored of this image , they used it in a TV ad as well :
Given the rising violence we 're seeing lately , I hope that Answers in Genesis remove the ad and rethink the campaign altogether , before someone interprets it as a way to prove their faith .
Japanese bento is a small meal that ’s normally packed at home ( there are little restaurants that do take - out bento now ) , and almost always single - serving .
Traditionally , bento consists of rice and either fish or meat ( usually chicken ) , sometimes egg ( she does a literal ‘ egg roll ’ in the video below which looks very tasty ) , and some pickled or cooked vegetables that function as a small side dish .
The bento boxes used range from plastic disposable containers to beautiful hand - crafted lacquerware that
would qualify as art in and of itself .
Even though bento lunches are easily available in lots of places all over Japan–including train stations , department stores , convenience stations , and , of course , bento shops–it is still quite common for Japanese homemakers ( usually housewives ) to spend considerable
effort ( although not necessarily time , as you ’ll see below a very nice bento box can be made in 5 or 10 minutes after some practice ) producing an appealing bento lunch for their spouse ( usually a salaryman ) to take to work with them .
Here we go ( no , I have no friggin ’ clue what ’s up with the poodle , the Japanese are just weird but we love them ) :
Bento can be very elaborately arranged into all sorts of shapes and images ( see below ) , and contests are often held where people compete to make the most aesthetically pleasing and original arrangement .
The food is usually designed to look like a particular person ( often someone famous ) , animals or cartoon / anime characters , as well as things such as beautiful plants ( bonsai trees ) and pretty flowers .
This style of elaborate bento is called “ kyaraben ” , and you can see examples of it illustrated below with Hello Kitty , Calvin and Hobbes , and Super Mario bento boxes :

EXCLUSIVE : The Finance Committee 's Health Reform Outline
A Senate source just passed me the latest outline of the Senate Finance Committee 's health reform proposal .
This is the post - CBO revision .
Apparently , after the committee staff received the scores , they dug deep and quickly developed this proposal to circulate among members and then send back to CBO .
It was presented earlier today at a closed - door meeting .
Sources say that it's a major scale - back of the outline they had before .
Specifically , subsidies have dropped from 400 percent of the poverty line to 300 percent .
Medicaid eligibility has been tightened to 133 percent of poverty for children and pregnant women and 100 percent of poverty for parents and childless adults .
The plans being offered in the exchange have seen their actuarial values sharply lowered .
Beyond the changes , this is also the clearest look we 've had at the specific policies being considered .
There 's a fairly strong individual mandate , albeit with exemptions for those beneath the poverty line , those who would have to spend more than 15 percent of income for a plan , and undocumented workers .
There are a variety of options for an employer mandate , or the absence of one .
Sen . Kent Conrad 's co-op idea is up for discussion .

In this piece on Politico , Ron Paul holds forth on the surprising way in which establishment Republicans and some Democrats have come around to his ideas on domestic policy .
Actually , it should n't be surprising .
The Texas congressman was the only politician on the national scene last year who accurately predicted the current mess .
Anyway , he may end up in a race against Sarah Palin for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
Here are his thoughts on Palin :
" I wonder whether she 's energizing the 15 - 20 year olds .
That would be a question I would have .
Because she does n't talk about the Federal Reserve and some of these issues .
She does n't talk too much about personal liberties , civil liberties , getting rid of drug laws , attacking the war on drugs , punishing people who torture . "
Paul characterizes her supporters as " more establishment , conventional Country - Club type of Republicans . "
That 's certainly the case .
The supposedly " conservative " Palin rarely espouses anything that could be taken as a conservative philosophy .
Meanwhile Paul is something of a walking encyclopedia of true American conservatism stretching back through Barry Goldwater through Robert Taft to the founding fathers .
The reason young people follow Paul is that he shows them just how bad things will be for them thanks to all the generations back to the so - called " greatest generation , " which came close to turning America into a socialist state .
Now the kids will be paying the tab for that state for the rest of their lives .
Paul offers them a way out .
Palin offers nothing .
He 's all ideas and no charisma .
She 's all charisma and no ideas .
It 's a perfect match - up .
Now if only Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee would get out of the way .
Think of how much stuff you ’ve accumulated over the past 2 years .
Now think of what it would take to sell it all while getting a reasonable return on your investment .
As part of the Exile Lifestyle project , I ’m currently undertaking the monstrous task of selling everything I own that wo n’t fit inside a single carry - on bag .
Spoiler alert : it ’s a logistical nightmare .
There are some simple things that you can do to prepare for such an eventuality , however , that will result in you getting more return on your sold stuff .
Invest in Quality , Not Quantity
There are so many reasons to buy a few high quality items over many low quality items and I could n’t possibly cover them all here , but one of the major reasons is that a high quality computer / car / desk / mobile phone / etc will last you much longer than the bargain bin equivalent .
Keep in mind that high quality does n’t mean the most expensive brand on the market .
The key is to do your homework before each and every purchase ( which is what so - called ‘ Prosumers ’ or ‘ Mavens ’ do already ) .
Some brands are ‘ premium ’ in name alone … they are of the same or lesser quality than their cheaper competitors , and their superiority lay only in their branding .
On the other hand , there are some brands that are definitely worth paying extra for .
Your priorities will determine which is which , but in general go for the brand that has better customer support , higher - quality materials and a more consistent reputation for quality and durability ( you ’d be surprised how many people buy Apple monitors over Dell monitors , despite the history of problems customers have had with them .
I love Apple computers , but you could n’t convince me to spend hundreds more on a monitor that contains the same general components but with less functionality ) .
Purchasing higher quality products achieves two main goals : the product will last longer , giving you more use for your dollar , and the product will have a higher resale value .
Do a search for used Honda and Toyota vehicles online and you will find that their resale value , even when they have been driven near to death , is extremely high .
This is because both brands have shown themselves to be purveyors of long - lasting products with high levels of performance and little maintenance required .
Next time you are out buying speakers , figure out which brand is the ‘ Honda ’ of the bunch and buy something of theirs .
Buy Low , Sell Low
Something that has driven many dates crazy ( especially in the free - balling neuvo riche city of Los Angeles ) is that I ’m always on the lookout for a deal .
It ’s an old habit that I developed in college after I started my first business ( read : when I was super poor ) and it has served me well .
If you watch the right websites close enough , you ’ll realize that just about everything that ’s available to buy goes on sale at some point , though some companies and genres of products more than others .
I usually do n’t buy big - ticket items unless I can get them 20 - 50 % off sticker price , and I rarely have trouble doing so .
The big , dirty secret is this : the electronics and clothing industries ( for example ) have ridiculously huge markups on most items .
High - end clothing is especially guilty of this , with a shirt that costs the company $ 2 to make being sold for $ 80 , it ’s no wonder they do n’t flinch at dropping the price down to $ 40 for a few weeks ( especially knowing that many people wo n’t even realize there is a sale going on and will still end up paying full price ) .
To keep up on what I call the ‘ real price ’ of things , there are a few sites I quickly scan every day .
One is Dealnews , which is essentially a great big list of things that are on sale right now .
They have editors that scour the web for sales , coupons and special offers , which they present along with all the information you need to take advantage of the discounts .
Another site that I check every day is Slickdeals , which is similar to Dealnews in that they display the day ’s best offers , but different in that they have a very active and knowledgeable community that decides what goes on the front page .
Working for nothing but street cred , the denizens of Slickdeals invariably find whatever is hot each day and discuss why it ’s a great deal ( or why it ’s not worth the hype ) in the forums .
If I ’m looking for information on a product or brand I ’m unfamiliar with , I ’ll usually check Slickdeals in order to get educated quickly .
The long - term benefit of keeping up to date on the real prices of things is that you can buy at a much lower rate than the Manufacturer ’s Suggested Retail Price ( MSRP ) .
Then , when it ’s time to sell that item , you will very likely make your money back ( or more ) while still giving the buyer a better deal than they would find anywhere else !
Win -win !
Pay it Forward
There are some cases where no matter how great your stuff is , you wo n’t be able to sell it and make back anywhere close to what you paid for it ( you might be leaving too quickly to set up a deal , trying to sell high - end merchandise during an economic downturn , etc ) .
In these cases , you have to make a choice .
You could sell the item for less than it ’s worth , potentially giving someone out there an early Christmas while pocketing a latte ’s worth of cash for your trouble .
The other option is to find an alternative way to be compensated for your merch .
You could trade that old XBox for a massage from a therapist friend , or let that antique desk lamp go in exchange for a nice home cooked meal from a light - deprived colleague .
You can also go to a site like Swaptree , which allows you to easily trade your books , DVDs , video games and old albums ( people still have ALBUMS ? ) for new books you have n’t read , games you have n’t beaten , DVDs you have n’t seen and music you have n’t yet ripped onto your computer .
Of course , there is always something to be said for paying it forward and just giving your stuff to someone who needs it .
If you give stuff away not expecting to get anything in return , you definitely wo n’t be disappointed , but you will certainly be pleasantly surprised if that person finds a way to help you out sometime in the future .
I have a friend who would call this ‘ putting change in the karma credit bank ’ while I just call it treating others how you would like to be treated .
I ’ve been using a combination of these different tactics to sell my stuff , and I ’m about halfway through the process ( with a little under two months left before I leave ) .
An idea that I have n’t tried ( but am seriously considering ) is having a ‘ Garage Sale Party ’ in which I ’ll invite my friends over and ( along with drinks and foodstuffs ) have all the stuff I ’m selling out for perusal .
During the party , if someone sees something they like , they can make an offer for it .
The idea is that I ’ll be able to see all my friends ( a luxury , since I wo n’t be able to see them after I leave ) and will be moving closer to my goal of selling all my stuff at the same time ( contented with the knowledge that each and every item will be going to a good home ) .
What have you done in the past ( or are considering doing in the future ) to sell your stuff ?
Any tactics that have worked particularly well ?
Any that have failed miserably ?

Update : April 24 , 2016
Seven years later , this is still my attitude about buying things .
Branding accounts for a lot of the costs we pay for things , and knowing which brands have what kind of markup is vital .
At the same time , knowing when it ’s worthwhile to spend more on something , based on your needs and priorities , is key if you want to end up with something that will last , something you will use , something with aesthetics you enjoy , and so on .
I do still watch for sales , though , and this is something that bugs some people .
We ’re supposed to scoff at markdowns , but I think it ’s wonderful to get something for 50 % off of the sticker price , as long as it ’s something I was intending to buy anyway .
It ’s not ideal to buy something just because it ’s discounted , but waiting until something drops to a level that seems reasonable is a good approach to getting the things you want without breaking the bank .
This is something I do with plane tickets , too .
At the moment , I ’m on the lookout for tickets to Alaska and Hawaii .
I ’ve set a few alerts , but mostly I ’m just watching a few places that I know will tell me when those types of tickets go on sale , and I know generally what I ’m willing to pay for them , what upgrades would be nice ( and which ones I ’m willing to pay for , and which ones I ’m not ) , and where I could most easily fly from .
If you ’re not in any hurry , this is the best way to travel without spending gobs of money ; it ’s just that most people have a finite window in which they can travel , so they end up paying a premium for something less than they might have preferred to get .
* Cheap alcohol kills more than half Russians aged 15 - 54
* Russia has at least 5 million alcoholics , many more drunks
* Political will needed to stem cheap and illicit vodka
MOSCOW , June 26 ( Reuters ) - Cheap and illicit alcohol kills more than half Russian men and women in their most productive years and the government must act urgently to reverse the trend , a study to be published in The Lancet at the weekend said .
" Excessive alcohol consumption in Russia , particularly by men , has in several recent years caused more than half of all the deaths at ages of 15 - 54 years , " the Lancet article said .
The research conducted in three industrial cities -- Tomsk , Barnaul and Biysk -- said " excess mortality from liver cancer , throat cancer , liver disease , and pancreatic disease is largely or wholly because alcohol caused the disease that caused death " .
High mortality from tuberculosis and pneumonia may be partly a result of increased exposure to infection , weak immunity , or decreased likelihood of cure , the research found .
Russia 's mortality rate in people aged 15 - 54 years was more than five times higher for men and three times higher for women than in Western Europe , the study showed .
Alcohol is responsible for about three quarters of the deaths of all Russian men aged 15 - 54 and about half of all deaths of Russian women of the same age , the data showed .
Russia must stop or tax the illicit alcohol output , the article said , adding this in turn would mean " confrontation with organised criminals and corrupt officials ...
All that is needed is the political will to make public health a priority " .
David Zaridze , head of the Russian Cancer Research Centre and principle author of the study , told Reuters , " Each year 1.3 million people die from cardio - vascular diseases in Russia . "
" Based on our investigation , it is possible to suggest that at least a third of these deaths is linked to alcohol consumption and not to any specific heart pathology , " he said .
Alcohol - related deaths also include suicides , murders , drowning and deaths in fires , he said .
A United Nations report said in April that poor diet , leading to heart disease , heavy drinking and the high incidence of violent deaths may cut Russia 's present population of some 142 million to around 131 million by 2025 .
CHEAP VODKA AND POLITICAL WILL
Store shelves across Russia are laden with cheap vodka that costs between 60 roubles ( $ 1.92 ) and 80 roubles ( $ 2.56 ) per half litre bottle , while Russia 's illicit alcohol production is estimated to account for at least 50 percent of consumption .
Alexander Nemtsov , a department chief at the Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry , estimated Russia 's annual consumption at 15 litres of pure alcohol per capita , including children and elderly people .
This compares to just 6 litres in 1864 , he said .
He estimated Russia had some 2.5 million registered alcoholics and about the same number of unregistered ones .
" Drunkards , not alcoholics , are the main threat to demography , " Nemtsov told Reuters .
" Heavy drinkers make up 40 percent of Russian males , but this figure may be bigger . "
The proportion of male and female drinkers is 4 to 1 , he said .
Thirty - thousand people -- twice the number the Soviet Union lost during its 10 - year war in Afghanistan -- die from alcohol poisoning in Russia each year .
Psychiatrist Nemtsov said fighting drinking in Russia was an uphill task , because cheap vodka was only part of the problem .
" Poor quality of life , cultural disadvantages , poverty and everyday stress all contribute to the problem , " he said .

A 30 - year - old Toronto man , and a 28 - year - old man from Marmora have been charged after the OPP discovered nearly $ 150,000 worth of marijuana during a RIDE checkpoint in Mississauga .
OPP officers were conducting a RIDE checkpoint Tuesday morning on the westbound QEW off - ramp to Dixie Rd. in Mississauga when an officer stopped a vehicle at the checkpoint .
The officer immediately detected the odour of fresh marijuana , and a number of marijuana plants were seen in plain view at the rear of the vehicle , police say .
Police seized over 148 marijuana plants , with a street value of $ 148,000 .
Brian Carvalho , 30 of Toronto , and Sean Wilson , 28 , of Marmora , are facing charges of possession and trafficking of a controlled substance .
Sure , McVeigh was fully aware that innocent secretaries and receptionists would be killed as a result of the massive truck bomb he detonated on April 19 , 1995 .
But he was a keen Star Wars fan and he compared those innocents to the " space - age clerical workers inside the Death Star .
Those people were n't storm troopers .
But they were vital to the operations of the Evil Empire .
And when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star , the movie audiences cheered .
The bad guys were beaten .
That was all that really mattered . "
It is , therefore , churlish of McVeigh to scornfully dismiss - as crazy paranoid nuts - the legions of conspiracy theorists who believe that the truth of the Oklahoma City bombing has yet to be officially recognised .
McVeigh is seething about this inside his death row cell .
He is due to be executed on May 16 .
He feels the conspiracy theories are tainting his impending martyrdom .
" You ca n't handle the truth , " he has said .
" And the truth is that it is pretty scary that one guy can do this all alone . "
The conspiracy theories centre on a bizarre white separatist encampment on the Oklahoma / Arkansas border called Elohim City and two of its regular visitors : a flamboyant neo -Nazi called Dennis Mahon and an extraordinary German called Andy Strassmeir .
McVeigh says the Elohim City conspiracy theories are nonsense , a red herring .
But I did n't know what to think .
They seemed pretty convincing to me .
Perhaps I am becoming a conspiracy nut .
Whatever , I wanted to meet the alleged co-conspirators .
It would , at least , be interesting to ask them how it felt to be widely considered , by conspiracy theorists , to be the hidden hands behind the Oklahoma City bombing .
It was a Monday morning in early April .
Dennis Mahon was jumpy and on the run in Arizona .
" It drives you crazy , " he said .
" Thousands think I was involved .
I 've started to believe it myself .
Maybe I was there .
Maybe they brainwashed me and I forgot about it .
Maybe I can get hypnotised and remember it .
Everybody said I was there .
Everybody said I drove the truck .
They saw me . "
This is true .
In the immediate aftermath of the bombing , many passers - by claimed to have seen McVeigh in Oklahoma City with unknown others .
One witness drew a sketch of a John Doe who looked remarkably like how Dennis Mahon might look in dark glasses and a pencil moustache .
" Maybe there 's somebody out there who looks like me , " said Dennis .
" I 'm just about ready to turn myself in and tell them , ' Okay motherfuckers , I did it ' .
But I did n't . "
Then Dennis showed me his scar - the result , he said , of a stress - related intestinal infection .
But for all of this Dennis Mahon seemed secretly thrilled to be a central player in the alternative history of the Oklahoma bombing .
Columbia Pictures is even considering making a movie of the story I am about to tell .
" It 'll be a hell of a good movie , " he said .
" I hope Tom Berenger plays me .
But one guy said Danny DeVito 's going to play me .
That 'll devastate me .
I 'll leave the country . "
Dennis peered through the curtains of our secret rendezvous location : Room 315 of the Hampton Inn near Phoenix airport .
" The Feds are on my tail ! " he stammered .
" The bastard sons of the FBI followed me here .
See that white car ? "
" Why are they following you ? " I asked .
" Well , Tim McVeigh did all his training over there , " he said , pointing west to Kingman , Arizona .
" And he 's going to be executed .
And they 're afraid there might be retaliation for that .
And there very well might be .
There very , very , very well might be . "
Dennis Mahon is a veteran neo -Nazi .
He was famous before the Oklahoma bombing conspiracy theories .
When you see him in old Ku Klux Klan recruitment videos from the 80s , he looks striking and quick - witted .
Now he is jowly , the spitting image of the actor John Goodman .
" Yeah , I 'm an old guy now , " says Dennis .
" I 'm an old comrade .
I 've seen changes .
More lone wolfism .
One man one act .
These stupid Klan guys want to be circus clowns .
And the Klan 's targets are just little negroes .
And then they get drunk in a pub and talk about it .
You 've got to raise your sights a little bit .
If you 're going to get 10 years for calling somebody a nigger , or throwing a rock through a synagogue window , you might as well go and do a McVeigh .
And I think the kids are learning that . "
Dennis Mahon glanced out of the window at the white car .
" I do n't believe they can hear us because . . . "
He paused .
" Did you get the room at the last minute ? "
" Yes , " I said .
" Well , I think we 're okay , " he said .
Dennis sat on the bed .
" I 'd never heard of a Tim McVeigh , " he said .
" I 'd heard of a Tim Tuttle .
Tim Tuttle was a real good patriot .
Tim Tuttle was a highly decorated army guy from the Gulf War and he was travelling through the area and people wanted me to meet him . "
" Did you meet Tim Tuttle ? " I asked .
" Yes , " said Dennis .
" I met Tim Tuttle , but I did n't know he was alias Tim McVeigh .
I met him at gun shows .
He sold military stuff , knives , gun parts , camouflage uniforms .
I remember he had real short hair and real intense eyes and the real long narrow nose like yours . "
Dennis scrutinised , and misinterpreted , my Jewish nose .
" It 's a good nose , " said Dennis .
" Do n't get me wrong .
Better than mine .
Mine 's been broke .
And we talked about Waco .
And I said , ' What comes around goes around .
If they keep doing this terrorism on our people , terrorism 's going to happen to them . ' "
" That 's what you said ? "
" That 's what I said to him .
He said , ' Probably .
Probably so . ' "
" Carol Howe testified that she was at your house when Tim Tuttle telephoned you shortly before the Oklahoma bomb , " I said .
" Yeah , well , " said Dennis , sharply .
" That was another Tim .
Okay ?
Another Tim .
His name was Tim Buttle . "
We talked about Carol Howe - about the strange love affair at the heart of the conspiracy theories .
Carol was a Tulsa society girl and a champion horse rider .
She attended private schools and won some local beauty contests .
Her father Bob was an oil executive .
Her mother Aubyn was a charity hostess .
But Carol got in with a druggy crowd and she ended up jumping off a roof and breaking her feet .
While she was convalescing from her injuries , she began to idly telephone the local " Dial - A - Racist " hotline and listen to the recorded messages :
" The international corporations and Jews and banks control America , and they 're out to enslave and destroy the white race . "
She fell in love with the voice as she lay in her sick bed .
The voice belonged to Dennis Mahon .
She sought him out .
" I met her in a restaurant in Tulsa , " said Dennis , " and she comes on crutches .
Here 's a beautiful young woman who 's really in bad shape - you know , physically - hobbling round on crutches trying to fight for her race .
And my heart went out to her .
She was strikingly beautiful and highly intelligent .
Super high IQ .
I think she had an IQ of 130 .
Way up there .
She was a lot smarter than I was .
She was a very rich girl , a debutante .
I saw her house .
Six bedrooms .
Five car garage .
Very wealthy . "
Within minutes of meeting Carol , Dennis had formulated some big plans for her .
" I was going to get her on Oprah .
Most of our women are not very intelligent .
All they can say is ' nigger this ' and ' nigger that ' .
She could have been our Aryan spokeswoman . "
" Did you fall in love with her ? " I asked .
" I tried not to , I really did , " said Dennis .
" I tried to keep it on a professional level .
But it was very hard .
She was 23 years old .
And she had a big swastika tattoo on her arm .
I got a bit weak .
I did fawn over her .
And , yes , I had an intimate relationship with her .
I finally said , ' Let 's just forget about this whole thing and get married and have children . ' "
" Would you have given up neo - Nazism for her ? "
" Oh yes , " said Dennis .
" In order to raise a family you have to make pretty good money .
But no .
She was like a Patty Hearst .
She wanted to get into the guns and the explosives . "
So Dennis made Carol some bombs .
" We let them off out in the woods , " said Dennis .
" And she was . . . "
He broke off .
His face flushed red .
" She could n't make love to me fast enough after that .
She loved the bombs . "
" She testified that you raped her , " I said , " and that 's why you split up . "
" Well , she 's a lying little snitch , " said Dennis .
" What really happened was that I finally got so tired .
I knew that eventually she was going to make a bomb and hurt herself real bad and I 'd be drawn into it .
And I would have gone to jail . "
Dennis said it was an amicable split .
( Carol testified that he threatened to kill her . )
Dennis said he wanted to see her happy .
He wanted to introduce her to eligible boys .
So he took her to a place called Elohim City .
" It 's a white separatist community , " said Dennis .
" They 're fundamentalists , but it 's really nice .
Lots of good single men out there . "
Elohim City is , for conspiracy theorists , the linchpin of the story .
I have been told many times - by conspiracy - minded relatives of bombing victims , by local journalists and Oklahoma City councillors - that Elohim City is a terrorist training camp .
It was certainly the hideout of the Aryan Republican Army , who committed a two - year spree of bank robberies using explosives .
And it was home , for a year and a half , to a man called Andy Strassmeir .
" He was this tall , tough - looking guy , " said Dennis .
" A deep German accent .
They called him Andy the German .
I learned that his visa had run out and he was head of security out at Elohim City .
I got to be pretty good friends with him .
He told me he was very highly trained .
Like our Green Berets .
Or your SAS .
He really knew his stuff .
And he had trained a lot of good people at Elohim City .
One time he had almost 30 young men , and women too , drilling them in full soldier drill .
And they did just as good as any highly trained army unit in this country . "
" That makes Elohim City sound like a training camp , " I said .
" Well , " he said , " after Waco they were very fearful they could be next . "
So Dennis took Carol to Elohim City to meet boys .
But there was something that he did n't know .
After Dennis had threatened to kill Carol , she reported him to the police .
Then the local Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms - the ATF , the same government agency that raided Waco - approached Carol and asked her to become an undercover informant , and spy for them on Dennis and Elohim City .
She agreed .
In the months leading up to the Oklahoma bombing , Carol filed a series of reports to the ATF .
In one , she reported that Andy Strassmeir had declared , " It 's time to go to war , " and , " It 's time to start bombing federal buildings . "
In another , she reported that Strassmeir had travelled to Oklahoma City to case the Murrah building as a potential target .
In a third , she reported that Elohim City 's patriarch , Reverend Robert Millar , preached a Holy War against the Federal Government , and suggested that April 19 might be a good day to start that war .
Immediately after the bombing , Carol Howe identified Timothy McVeigh as someone she saw walking through the Elohim City forests with Andy Strassmeir .
She also testified that she overheard Dennis Mahon take a telephone call from " Tim Tuttle " - the alias McVeigh used .
" Carol had a lot of boyfriends at Elohim City , " said Dennis .
" But she 'd scare them off .
You know .
' Hey !
Let 's make a bomb !'
That kind of talk tends to scare guys away . "
Dennis paused .
" Especially when they may actually be planning something . "
" I 'm sorry ? " I said .
This was an extraordinary thing for Dennis to say .
Dennis remains to this day a close friend of the people at Elohim City .
Until now , he has always denied that the community had anything to do with the Oklahoma City bombing .
Was he now implying that they may have actually been involved ?
" Before that bomb went off in Oklahoma City , " said Dennis , " they got rid of her .
They told Carol to go back home .
They said , ' We need to be by ourselves for a while . ' "
" Who said that to her ? " I asked .
" Her last boyfriend broke up with her and said , ' Maybe you ought to go to Tulsa .
Stay away for a while . '
She was away from Elohim City for almost two months before the bomb went off .
Which is probably a good thing . "
Dennis is a conspiracy theorist , but he said he does n't believe the conspiracy theory that he was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing .
" I think Andy Strassmeir was , " he said .
" Or at least he knew about it .
I 've been trying to contact him for years .
I 've always defended him .
And now he wo n't return my phone calls .
And I 've been banned from Germany .
Why is that ?
So I 'm taking all the heat and he 's run off to Germany . "
Dennis said that if Andy Strassmeir was n't involved , perhaps a crack team of Iraqi Republican Guards were , acting under the orders of Saddam Hussein .
" There 's quite a few Iraqis in Oklahoma , " he said .
" Those guys are highly trained in improvised munitions and explosives .
Whereas
Tim was not .
Certainly one of them could have trained Tim .
There are 600 Iraqi Republican Guards in the Oklahoma City area . "
The conspiracy theories were getting crazier .
I wanted to get back to the facts .
And this is a fact : on the morning of April 19 , 1995 - just as Timothy McVeigh 's yellow Ryder truck packed with three 55 - gallon drums of liquid nitromethane pulled up outside the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City - a death row prisoner in Arkansas called Richard Wayne Snell asked his guard if he could watch the TV news .
The guard agreed .
Snell was to be executed within hours .
Getting to watch CNN was just about his final request .
Snell had murdered a black state trooper called Louis Bryant and a pawn shop owner called William Stumpp , whom Snell had mistakenly believed to be Jewish .
Snell had also plotted , in 1983 , to blow up the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City .
He only abandoned the plan when the rocket - launcher he'd been practising with exploded in his hands .
He took this as a sign that God did n't want him to go ahead with the plan .
Snell 's co-conspirator in the 1983 plot was a neo -Nazi called James Ellison , who lived at Elohim City and was , in fact , married to Reverend Millar 's granddaughter .
Within the more hard - core factions of the American militia movement , Snell was a hero and a martyr : a respected preacher and political prisoner .
His supporters were outraged that the Arkansas governor had chosen April 19 for the execution date .
They considered it a deliberate kick in the teeth .
April 19 is holy day for anti-government activists and conspiracy theorists .
On April 19 , 1993 , Federal agents ended the siege at Waco .
David Koresh 's Branch Davidian church went up in flames .
On April 19 , 1775 , 400 British government troops attempted to disarm the citizens of Lexington , Massachusetts .
A hundred colonists shot back , the first shots of the American Revolution , the " shots heard around the world " .
( When I visit American militias and patriots and neo -Nazis , they often ask me what I , a Brit , thinks of the Lexington uprising .
I explain that I 'm not au fait with the ins and outs .
They are scandalised that our syllabus does n't teach this pivotal moment in British history . )
So executing Snell on April 19 was perceived to be an insult levelled at the American militia movement .
The guard on death watch duty agreed to Snell 's request .
He turned on CNN , just as news was breaking of the bombing of the Murrah building .
Snell had already warned his prison guards that his death would be avenged .
And now , the penitentiary 's death watch log noted , Richard Wayne Snell watched the breaking news and he " smiled and chuckled and nodded " .
Shortly afterwards , he was executed by lethal injection .
His good friend and spiritual advisor , the Reverend Robert Millar , transported his body to its final resting place : Elohim City .
After all I 'd heard about Elohim City , I felt a little intimidated as I drove up into the Ozark mountains towards the community .
I turned left at the covered bridge , the very spot where Timothy McVeigh had received a speeding ticket on October 12 , 1993 .
McVeigh has always denied visiting Elohim City , but I could n't imagine where else he could have been heading , out here in the middle of the dusty nothingness .
In fact , only one official record links McVeigh to Elohim City : a telephone call he made on April 5 , 1995 , a fortnight before the bombing .
He had bought a telephone calling card from the back pages of the Spotlight , the right - wing newspaper dedicated to seeking out and exposing the Bilderberg Group , the internationalist think tank believed by conspiracy theorists , McVeigh included , to be the shadowy elite that secretly rules the world .
McVeigh used the phone card to make enquiries about where he might order a Ryder truck .
Then he phoned Elohim City and asked to speak to " Andy " .
But Andy Strassmeir was n't there .
So McVeigh put the phone down again .
My instructions were to pull up at Elohim City 's entrance , stay in the car , and honk my horn until somebody came to fetch me .
I did this .
I honked and honked , intrusively breaking the silence .
I wondered why I had to sit there and honk .
Were people doing things that they did n't want a journalist to know about ?
Had they been told to stop doing whatever it was when the honking journalist arrived ?
So I felt intimidated as I sat there honking .
And then the children of Elohim City suddenly appeared from nowhere and performed , for my benefit , an impressive and well rehearsed rendition of Riverdance .
I clapped when it was over .
Then Elohim City 's resident chiropractor , Dr Buzz , offered me a cranial massage .
" No thanks , " I said .
Elohim City looked like something out of the Brothers Grimm .
Brightly coloured elf type houses scattered the forest .
The whole place would have resembled some new - age retreat , something like the Findhorn Foundation , if it was n't for the fact that everyone was carrying semi-automatic rifles .
Then I was invited into the meeting hall to sit in on a travelling soap salesman 's presentation .
He wanted to sell Elohim City soap powder and water - refining tablets .
The women of the community and Reverend Millar , who looks like Santa Claus , fired questions at the salesman .
" We do n't want chlorine , " said Reverend Millar .
" Chlorine causes cancer . "
" This is n't a game , " said the salesman .
" This is serious .
Cleanliness is serious . "
" Health is important , " said Reverend Millar .
Reverend Millar is a conspiracy theorist , but he does n't believe the conspiracy theory that he and his community were behind the Oklahoma City bombing .
He thinks the bomb was planted by the government itself , a New World Order plot to turn the world against survivalists and implement gun-control legislation , much like Hitler 's burning of the Reichstag .
" I think , " he told me , " it was an operation by the Zionists who have infiltrated our government agencies to disparage people like us .
To give us a black eye . "
Carol Howe , he added , was " a poor little rich girl .
We fed her and housed her .
I did n't know that $ 400 of my tax money was going to her with each visit .
She was here several times .
And then she went back and told things that were so far from the truth .
She said we had prepared a bomb or discussed that sort of thing .
Something very violent .
And , as you can see , that 's hardly typical of us here . "
" Could you show me your cemetery ? " I asked .
" Sure , " he said .
He took me down to a field at the bottom of a hill .
" How many people are buried here ? " I asked him .
" All the dead ones , " he said .
" Ha ha !
I 'm sorry .
Half - a- dozen . "
We looked at the headstones .
" This is my beloved wife , " said Reverend Millar .
" We had been married 55 years and nine months .
She was my sweetheart from college days .
And here 's Richard Wayne Snell .
I guess this is the one you 're interested in . "
Snell 's headstone read , " Rev Richard Wayne Snell .
Patriot .
May 21st 1930 - April 19th 1995 " .
" It was a lethal injection , " said Reverend Millar .
" I was there .
He said , ' I am ready to go . '
He died in full confidence of his hereafter .
The idea that he was all excited about a bombing in Oklahoma City never passed between us . "
" Why is he buried at Elohim City ? " I asked .
" He requested it , " said Reverend Millar , a little sharply .
" He asked me to be his spiritual adviser .
I visited him regularly in the years between the trial and the execution . "
" April 19 , " I said .
" Very significant , " he said .
" I had talked to the lieutenant governor of Arkansas and I suggested that it was a poor day to choose .
I thought it would contribute to civic unrest . "
He paused , and softly added , " The government can be more interested in demonstrating their control than they are in the interests of the nation that they represent . "
As we walked away from the cemetery , Reverend Millar happened to notice the Kansas licence plate of my hire car .
" Ah , " laughed Reverend Millar .
" Just like the Ryder truck !
You rented this in Kansas ! "
There was a silence .
" I 'm sorry ? " I said .
Reverend Millar is a man who claims to know nothing about the Oklahoma City bombing , who says he needs to be reminded even of what date the explosion occurred .
And now he was bringing up the most esoteric fact about McVeigh 's plot - that the Ryder truck used for the bombing had been rented in Kansas .
Was this a little playful clue , on his part , that there was more to Elohim City than meets the eye ?
Reverend Millar giggled .
" Just kidding , " he said .
There is a tiny strip club in Tulsa called Lady Godiva .
It was once a salad bar , but the salads did n't take off so Floyd Ratcliffe bought the place up , painted it black , advertised for topless dancers , and now between 75 and 150 men attend each night .
I sat in the back office with Floyd and his former wife Julie .
" My official title , " said Julie to my notepad , " is vice - president of Lady Godiva . "
She laughed .
Then she stopped laughing and said , " I 'm not bullshitting you .
Really . "
Behind us , a CCTV monitor screen flashed between the big bouncer doing neck exercises at the door , the bar , the stage , and the dressing room where the strippers went to change and apply make - up .
A second CCTV monitor focused just on the dressing room .
" Do the women know they 're being taped naked backstage ? " I asked Floyd .
" Why do you tape them ? "
" A lot of the girls , " explained Floyd , " are good girls .
But it keeps down thievery .
It keeps down drugs . "
On the night of April 8 , 1995 , two strippers from Arkansas got into a fight in Lady Godiva 's dressing room - a fight that was taped by Floyd 's CCTV camera .
" As it turns out , " explained Floyd , " one of the girls was nervous and had taken some pills before she got here , which made her hyper and made her clash with everybody . "
" We usually erase the tapes after two weeks , " added Julie .
" The reason why we kept this particular tape is because the cat fight was really quite humorous .
So we kept it for entertainment . "
Some weeks after the cat fight occurred , the two warring strippers applied for jobs at an erotic bar in Arkansas .
Their prospective employer had heard of the taped cat fight and so he asked Floyd to send him the cassette .
" He was trying to figure out whose fault the cat fight was , " explained Floyd .
" Was it one of the girls ' fault ?
Was it Lady Godiva 's fault ? "
So Floyd sent the tape to the club owner in Arkansas .
" So , " said Floyd , " he 's looking at the tape to try and find out what went wrong , and I think , being a little bit nosy , he wanted to see the rest of the tape .
And as he's watching the rest of the tape , he suddenly realises that he 's seeing something quite extraordinary . "
This was true .
There is a moment on the CCTV tape dated April 8 , 1995 , that could be seen to be incredible .
Here is a transcript of that moment :
Stripper 1 ( leaning into the mirror , adjusting her costume ) : " You know those three guys I 'm sitting out there with ?
Well one of them says he 's looking for a girl to fool around with tonight .
Are you interested ? "
Stripper 2 : " Well , okay , I 'll figure out a way to scam them . "
The conversation becomes unintelligible for a while .
The strippers talk about the three guys out front .
Stripper 1 : ( unintelligible ) " ... and one of them said , ' I 'm a very smart man . '
' You are ? '
' Yes , I am .
And on April 19 , 1995 , you 'll remember me for the rest of your life ! '
' Oh really ? ' ' Yes , you will . ' "
Stripper 1 laughs and starts to walk out of the dressing room .
Then she turns back to the other and says , " Weirdo ! "
" They were odd comments , " said Julie .
" It just seemed odd .
The girls thought , maybe they 're going to come out with some big invention on April 19 . "
" But unfortunately , " said Floyd , " it turned out to be such a devastating event that they were in fact talking about . "
When the club owner in Arkansas realised the significance of the tape , he sent it back to Floyd and Julie .
They telephoned the FBI .
" Several days later , " said Floyd , " a couple of agents came to the club , confiscated the tape , talked to the girls involved , and showed them pictures .
The girls did identify three guys . "
" McVeigh , " said Julie .
" They identified McVeigh and Nichols and the other gentlemen .
Um. Sloshmayer ... "
" Strassmeir ? " I asked .
" Strassmeir , " said Julie .
" Right .
Excuse me .
They all did identify that gentleman . "
" And of course , " I said , " everyone 's heard of McVeigh and Nichols .
But not of Strassmeir . "
" True , " said Julie .
" But the girls did identify Strassmeir in the line - ups . "
" It seems like the more we find out , " said Floyd , " the less we want to know .
I do n't know if it 's a cover up .
I do n't know if they 're trying to protect Strassmeir .
There are just a lot of things I do n't know .
There are a lot of things that we will never know . "
There was a silence .
" It 's a bad deal , " said Floyd .
Julie nodded .
" It 's a bad deal all around .
They were here .
It 's nothing to be proud of .
If not here , someplace else . "
" They wanted to see girls , " I said .
" Sure , " said Floyd .
" Sure .
It 's a semi-nude sexual - oriented type business , so we 're quite popular in this part of the country . "
" What did the FBI agents say ? " I asked .
" At the time , they said , ' We 'll put it on the back burner and let it sit . ' " Floyd paused .
" Well , that 's where it 's been .
This is five years later .
And it 's still on the back burner . "
Something else was noticed at Lady Godiva on the night of April 8 .
After one of the cat - fight strippers had been thrown out of the club by Floyd , she needed to urinate .
Floyd would n't let her back in , so she urinated in the car park .
She urinated right next to a yellow Ryder truck .
In the immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing , President Clinton promised that no stone would be left unturned .
Two thousand Federal agents were assigned to the case , 20,000 individuals were interviewed .
But the people at Elohim City were never questioned .
Andy Strassmeir was never questioned .
Surely they could at least have questioned him .
It turns out that Andy Strassmeir 's father is Gunther Strassmeir , Helmut Kohl 's Secretary of State , a man known as the " architect of German reunification " .
Andy Strassmeir received military intelligence training at the Bundeswehr Academy in Hanover .
In the light of this new knowledge , Reverend Millar now believes that Carol Howe was not the only undercover federal informant working at Elohim City .
" Strassmeir , " he said , " did n't contribute to community harmony .
We had a little lady here .
She was 80 years old .
She 'd feed him .
She liked Andy .
She cared for him .
But when she wanted some painting done , he wanted to get paid by the hour .
He acted like he was without financial resources .
But whenever he went to buy something , he had the credit cards to buy the best . "
Reverend Millar paused .
" We do know , " he added , " that Andy contacted an anti-terrorist agency here in the United States when he first landed . "
Andy Strassmeir is now back in Germany , living with his parents .
In the light of Carol Howe 's undercover reports to the ATF , the American government considered launching a raid on Elohim City in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing .
But they abandoned the plan .
I asked FBI special agent Bob Ricks why they changed their minds .
( Incidentally , Ricks was one of the special agents in charge of the siege at Waco .
McVeigh had originally considered killing Ricks - or a Waco and Ruby Ridge sniper called Lon Horiuchi - instead of blowing up the Murrah building .
But he decided that the Murrah would make more of an impact . )
" Why did we abandon the raid on Elohim City ? " said Ricks .
" We did n't want another Waco . "
There is a terrible irony to that decision .
The American government 's paranoid fear , and the reason why they originally raided Waco , was that they believed David Koresh might launch a terrorist attack on mainstream America .
If you believe the Oklahoma conspiracy theories - if you believe that this story is more than just a series of coincidences - you are left with a startling conclusion .
Had the raid on Elohim City not been abandoned , the Oklahoma City bombing might never have happened .
The conspiracy theories inevitably reach a chilling conclusion : something that the theorists are disinclined to state publicly , fearful that the general public might consider them paranoid lunatics .
They ask themselves why every member of the ATF based at the Murrah building survived the bombing .
The ATF office was one of McVeigh 's chief targets .
Most of the Bureau 's employees did n't turn up for work that morning .
The conspiracy theorists put two and two together .
Perhaps Strassmeir had tipped them off about the bombing in advance , and they incompetently failed to stop it happening .
Perhaps they planned a sting operation , but it somehow went awry .
Perhaps they have been covering this fact up ever since .
Timothy McVeigh says he was 1,000 miles away from Lady Godiva on April 8 .
He says he was at the Imperial Motel in Kingman , Arizona .
He says the conspiracy theorists are crazy , and he only ever met Andy Strassmeir once , at a gun show .
He says he never visited Elohim City .
He admits he telephoned the community on April 5 , and asked to speak to Andy , but only because he thought that Elohim City might have been a suitable hideout for him after the bombing .
One wonders why , if this story is true , McVeigh is protecting Strassmeir - an undercover informant .
Does he fear reprisals against his family if he spills the beans ?
Is he embarrassed that he was suckered by a federal employee ?
Does he want to be considered a lone wolf , a martyr ?
McVeigh 's aim , in blowing up the Murrah building , was to strike at the heart of the New World Order .
And now conspiracy theorists are beginning to believe that the New World Order itself might have played a role in the conspiracy .
McVeigh is seething about this in his death row cell .
He will consequently be executed , on May 16 , an unsatisfied man .
Classic cars are the pride of their owners as well as a tourist attraction : Buick , Chevrolet ...
Old classic american cars of Cuba became an icon of the country .
They can be seen everywhere on the island and they all shine as if it is their first ride .
I definitively enjoyed taking pictures of these american classic cars in Cuba because of the bright colours of course but also because they represent the way cuban people struggle to live .
These cars seem brand new but they are not !
Cuban people have to make miracles with their hands , using old materials and refurbish them .
Just for information purposes , the following graph is from Northern Trust .
What was the high of the unemployment rate in the Great Depression ?
The civilian unemployment rate was around 25 % during several months of 1932 - 1933
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
From its bottom in 1933 to 1936 , the G.D.P. climbed spectacularly ( albeit from a very low base ) , averaging gains of almost 11 percent a year .
But then , both the Fed and the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed course .
In the summer of 1936 , the Fed looked at the large volume of excess reserves piled up in the banking system , concluded that this mountain of liquidity could be fodder for future inflation , and began to withdraw it .
...
About the same time , President Roosevelt looked at what seemed to be enormous federal budget deficits , concluded that it was time to put the nation ’s fiscal house in order and started raising taxes and reducing spending .
...
Thus , both monetary and fiscal policies did an abrupt about - face in 1936 and 1937 , and the consequences were as predictable as they were tragic .
The United States economy , which had been rapidly climbing out of the cellar from 1933 to 1936 , was kicked rudely down the stairs again ...
The first example of policy in a liquidity trap comes from the 1930s .
The U.S. economy grew rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , helped along by New Deal policies .
America , however , remained well short of full employment .
Yet policy makers stopped worrying about depression and started worrying about inflation .
The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy , while F.D.R. tried to balance the federal budget .
Sure enough , the economy slumped again , and full recovery had to wait for World War II .
This graph shows the unemployment rate from 1929 through 1947 .
The surge in unemployment in 1937 was related to an attempt to unwind the monetary and fiscal stimulus policies , with disastrous results for employment .
Just something to remember when the Fed and Treasury start to unwind the current stimulus programs .
Several people have commented on 1937 lately ... Alan Blinder wrote in the New York Times in May : And from Paul Krugman in the NY Times in June :

Mr Bainimarama has been scrambling to shore up Fiji 's ailing finances Australia has urged China and the rest of the international community to back efforts to return Fiji to democracy .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said he had asked countries not to use their contacts with Fiji to undermine efforts to pressure Fiji to hold elections .
China has extended its influence into the Pacific , including Fiji , with aid and money for infrastructure projects .
Commodore Frank Bainimarama took power in Fiji in a coup in 2006 and has said elections will not be held until 2014 .
He and his allies have suspended the constitution , detained opponents , delayed elections , suppressed freedom of speech and required lawyers to get new licences to practise from his administration .
The Pacific Islands Forum , currently chaired by Australia , has suspended Fiji , which also faces possible expulsion from the Commonwealth .
Australia and New Zealand have also criticised the United Nations for continuing to use Fijian soldiers in UN peace - keeping operations while Fiji remains under military rule .
Pressure Fiji figured prominently in talks in New Zealand 's capital , Wellington , on Thursday between New Zealand 's Foreign Minister Murray McCully and Mr Smith .
" We 've been urging all members of the international community that , if they are having contact with Fiji , that they should certainly make the point that the international community wants to see Fiji return to democracy , " Mr Smith said .
China nurtures ties with Pacific nations who follow the ' One - China ' policy Mr Smith said that Australia and New Zealand will continue to call for a speedy return to democracy in Fiji , but there are no plans to place trade sanctions on the country .
Mr Bainimarama has told local media that he is aware that New Zealand and Australia have asked China to reconsider its aid and financial support for Fiji .
Australian parliamentary secretary for Pacific Islands affairs , Duncan Kerr , has denied reports that he said Chinese aid to Fiji is hindering sanctions imposed by Canberra and Wellington .
Pacific links
Last month a new bridge was opened in Fiji , funded and built by China .
Fiji's Vice - President Ratu Epeli Nailatiku said the Navuso Bridge symbolised the growing relationship between China and Fiji .
" Fiji regards the relationship with the government and the people of the People 's Republic of China as one of its most important , " the vice - president was reported as saying .
A parliamentary delegation from several Pacific nations , including Fiji , is currently visiting Beijing .
Premier Wen Jiabao told the group that China and Pacific island countries should expand economic and trade co-operation .
He said China would continue offering economic and technological assistance to these nations .

At this point , you would think that most users would be aware that they should keep embarrassing information off of Facebook .
Everyone from potential employers to the press regularly check users ' accounts on the service , looking for evidence of illicit or debauched behavior , and a number of jobs have been lost due to the information found there .
Still , many fail to exercise discretion when using the service , people in positions of power are catching on , and there continue to be problems that result from the blurring of boundaries between public and private .
In what may be the latest example , a suit was filed in Mississippi that alleges a school official — more specifically a teacher acting in her capacity as a cheerleading coach — demanded that members of her squad hand over their Facebook login information .
According to the suit , the teacher used it to access a student 's account , which included a heated discussion of some of the cheerleading squad 's internal politics .
That information was then shared widely among school administrators , which resulted in the student receiving various sanctions .
As we noted when Bozeman , Montana attempted to obtain login credentials from anyone applying for a municipal job , it 's easy for anyone to view pictures and text that a Facebook user has chosen to make public simply by signing up for an account with the service .
By demanding login credentials , authorities gain access to materials that users have chosen to keep private .
Whether this is done because people intend to get access to private data or because they are simply unfamiliar with how Facebook operates is n't always obvious , and probably varies from case to case .
According to this suit , the student 's login details were requested during school hours , and the teacher accessed the account the same day .
The account included the contents of a discussion between the student and a fellow member of the school 's cheerleading squad about its internal politics , which was then allegedly shared with other squad supervisors and the school administration .
The student was then " publicly reprimanded , punished , and humiliated " due to the contents of that discussion .
The student was allegedly forced to sit out of various school activities and had difficulties arranging her academic schedule to avoid taking classes from any of the individuals who were both coaches and teachers .
Her parents claim that attempts to discuss the problem with school administrators brought them no relief .
The Student Press Law Center has more detailed account ( via TechDirt ) of the events , in which it reports that several other students asked for their logins simply deleted their accounts using their cell phones , preventing this sort of intrusion ; the schools apparently have a filter that blocks access to its
Web interface from school computers .
It also suggests that the initial search of the Facebook accounts was done with the intent of finding pictures of the students smoking or drinking .
In any case , the suit alleges that the school 's administration and staff , along with five John Does , violated the student 's Constitutional rights to privacy , free speech and association , and subjected her to cruel and unusual punishment .
There are also charges of causing emotional distress , defamation of character , and civil conspiracy .
In general , courts have concluded that public school students have some constitutional rights , but only a subset of those afforded to the general populace .
It may be that the student 's lawyers are aiming broadly in order to find some area of constitutional law in which the student is clearly protected .
In any case , the message should be clear : either through malice or cluelessness , people in positions of authority are increasingly demanding complete access to users ' personal accounts and , in moments of weakness , many users appear to be giving it to them .
If there 's information you 're not comfortable sharing with the world , Facebook , Twitter , and similar services are n't the place for it .
If previous Iranian government behavior is any indication , the 8 year sentence handed down this past weekend against the two American hikers , Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer , is by no means the final word .
The Iranian government has always sought more tactical flexibility and uses situations such as this to leverage its opponents .
But in addition to the continued U.S. - Iran standoff , the hikers have also fallen prey to political infighting in Tehran that creates the biggest obstacle to clarity .
Their sentence is the latest installment in a series of political football matches between the various factions inside of Iran .
Recall that it was last September when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , attempting to score points for himself just weeks before coming to New York to address the UN General Assembly , announced an imminent release for the third hiker , Sara Shourd .
But Ahmadinejad ’s political opponents in the Judiciary attempted to block the initiative and prevent any corresponding political capital Ahmadinejad hoped to gain .
They cancelled Shourd ’s release and ultimately required her to post bail of $ 500,000 before she was finally released on September 14th .
In a case of déjà vu with Fattal and Bauer , Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi ( appointed by Ahmadinejad ) suggested the trial would lead to their freedom .
But this past weekend , we saw a completely different result .
Now , Fattal and Bauer will continue to languish in Evin Prison instead of being reunited with their families .
You can take action to send a letter calling for their release through Amnesty International ’s website .
In a radio interview with Anti-War.com , NIAC ’s Reza Marashi explained , “ It ’s a puzzle to me what Iran ’s trying to achieve . ”
But he also said there remains a glimmer of hope that the Supreme Leader would issue an edict releasing the hikers .
It could be a way to save face , by showing leniency in the holy month of Ramadan .
This way they “ wo n’t have to come up with a nonsensical justification for keeping them in prison , ” Marashi said .
As Wednesday ’s New York Times editorial put it , “ There is no legitimate excuse not to ( let them go ) .
Mr. Bauer and Mr. Fattal should be freed immediately . ”
But in addition the murky internal political dynamic , this situation is endemic to the conflict between the US and Iran .
As Marashi points out , “ If relations had been halfway normal this would have been resolved far earlier . ”
Without diplomatic relations , there are few levers for the U.S. to pull .
Unfortunately , due to a deeply seeded culture of mistrust on both sides , the US and Iran have framed their relationship as a zero - sum game .
Thus , if one side gains then by nature the other side loses .
It ’s easy to envision how a stalemate can develop as neither side is willing to bargain or negotiate .
So , situations like we see with the hikers become more “ complex , even though ( the solution ) is straight forward . ”
Cuando Michael Jackson murió en el 2009 , la imagen del cantante alcanzó su punto más bajo como consecuencia de múltiples escándalos personales .
Sin embargo , una década posterior , la industria rehabilitó su imagen , devolviendo al rey del pop a un lugar destacado como ícono cultural y también como potencia financiera cuya vida futura se convirtió en una marca de miles de millones de dólares .
Ahora , un documental que detalla las acusaciones de abuso sexual infantil ha creado una nueva ola de indignación pública contra Jackson , poniendo en peligro su legado como superestrella de la música , y el negocio que su patrimonio ha reconstruido en un imperio .
El patrimonio del artista , una vez que se enredó con cientos de millones de dólares de deuda , floreció notablemente desde su muerte por una sobredosis , generando 2,000 millones de dólares a través de acuerdos póstumos , incluido el próximo musical de Broadway , Do n’t Stop ‘ Til You Get Enough ; un espectáculo de Cirque du Soleil en Las Vegas , y 287.5 millones de dólares que Sony pagó por la obra de Jackson a EMI Music .
En el documental Leaving Neverland , que comenzó a transmitirse el domingo 3 de marzo en HBO , el exactor infantil James Safechuck , de 41 años , y el coreógrafo Wade Robson , de 36 años , resucitan las denuncias de abuso infantil que han seguido a Jackson desde principios de los años 90 .
Acusan a Jackson de haberles dado regalos cuando eran niños y , posteriormente , de abusar sexualmente de ellos durante años .
En las entrevistas , los hombres describen la impropiedad en el legendario rancho Neverland de Jackson , incluido que Jackson les dio alcohol , les mostró pornografía e incluso compró un anillo de bodas para el menor de edad Safechuck .
Jackson designó a su madre , Katherine , y sus tres hijos como beneficiarios de su patrimonio , ellos intentaron evitar la emisión de HBO .
For the first time in its 50 - year history , Marine One helicopter uses all - female crew to fly US president

The first black US president , Barack Obama , has clattered up through the glass ceiling to set another milestone .
For the first time in its 50 - year history , the president was flown by an all - female crew on Marine One .
The helicopter took Obama on the first leg of a trip from the White House to New York for a speech to one of the country 's largest black organisations .
It was no accident : marine Major Jennifer Grieves was on her last day of a year - long stint as the first female pilot of Marine One .
To honour her , another female major was appointed as co-pilot and a female colour sergeant as crew chief .
Obama walked across the lawn from the Oval office , shook hands and chatted briefly with Grieves , who also flew his predessor , George Bush .
The helicopter trip took Obama to Andrews air force base , from where he flew north to campaign for the Democratic governor of New Jersey and to tell African Americans to take more responsibility for their lives .
Grieves is going to study at the marine staff college in Quantico , Virginia , to earn credits towards becoming a lieutenant colonel .
There was no word on who was flying the identical decoy helicopters that travel near Marine One in case anyone tries to shoot down the president .
The recent street rebellions against the Ahmadinejad regime in Iran were touted by many as the first baptism - by - fire of Twitter as a political tool .
Celebrity artilces abounded for a brief time , before such foolish dreams came crashing back to earth under the weight of a metric ton of misinformation , unsubstantiated rumor , and idle gossip .
... And the Tweeters Fell Silent
Any Iranian foolish to put her hopes in this most fickle of constituencies that is the Tweeter must have begun to doubt the wisdom of such an approach as short attention spans inevitably set in and , most devastatingly of all , the death of Michael Jackson stole the headlines .
Ahmadinejad could n't have planned it better if he had offed MJ himself ( in cahoots , perhaps , with South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford , the other clear beneficiary of Jackson 's untimely demise ) .
Indeed , the Iranian dissidents were the biggest losers of the day , suffering an even worse fate than Ed McMahon , Farrah Fawcett , and Billy Mays , condemned to historical oblivion by sheer bad timing .
But to this list of those suffering from the technophiles ' abandonment of their brief flirtation with the political , we must now add Manuel " Mel " Zelaya , legitimately elected president of Honduras , recently deposed in a barefaced military coup from the far right .
Zelaya , a former centrist who has recently made leftward moves , raised the ire of the entrenched Honduran oligarchy by , among other things , joining the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) , a radical counterpoint to U.S. - promoted free trade agreements .
His overthrow has been followed by a press blackout , military curfew , and repression in the streets , as hundreds of thousands have rallied to the cause of their former leader , only to meet an iron heel reminiscent of Honduran military regimes of the past ( dodging bullets in the street , as the maganificent BoRev puts it , " is sort of like Twittering , for poor people " ) .
There have been mass arrests , injuries , and deaths , but some exceptions not withstanding , these Hondurans are nevertheless , to quote one observer , " Protesters We Don't Tweet About . "
Following the Venezuelan Blueprint
Comparison to the April 2002 coup against Chávez seems obvious to many .
For Kiraz Janicke , for example , the move against Zelaya constitutes a " carbon copy " of the earlier coup , while Atilio Boron calls it a " repeat " of Chávez 's brief ouster .
Certainly , Zelaya is no Chávez , and as we will see , Obama is certainly no Bush , but especially in light of efforts on the liberal left to deny any similarity , it is worthwhile nevertheless laying out the striking parallels between the strategies adopted by the Honduran golpistas and their Venezuelan counterparts :
The faithful media sows the seeds : in both Venezuela 2002 and Honduras 2009 , the national and international media prepared the ground for an eventual coup by distorting the truth and calling into question the democratic credentials of the president .
In Honduras , this has taken the form of misrepresenting Zelaya 's constitutional proposal as a re-election bid , a line which was and continues to be shamelessly pushed in the media , when the referendum question had nothing to do with re-election at all , but was instead a completely legal mandate to transforming the existing constitution ( itself a holdover from the far - right governments of the 1980s ) .
Some nominally of the left repeated this tasty morsel of misinformation , while Fox News '
Shep Smith argued today that not only had Zelaya sought to extend his term , but to do so would have been " treasonous " ( an interesting perspective on constitutional amendments , to say the least ) .
A coup which is not a coup : in both Venezuela 2002 and Honduras 2009 , every effort was and is being made to deny that what is happening is actually a coup ( here the preceding media efforts really pay off ) .
It was not the military gorilas who violated democratic norms , we are told , it was the democratically elected president who brought this on himself by undermining the " established institutions . "
Here , of course , there is no mention of the origins these institutions have in military government , or the far - right partisan bias with which the Congress and Supreme Court declared the non-binding constitutional referendum illegal .
In Venezuela , this even led to a situation in which , after Chávez 's return , the Supreme Court ruled that what had occurred was not a coup , but instead a " power vacuum " into which the military and the far right just conveniently stepped .
Cartoons and soap operas conceal repression : both coups were followed by an immediate and total press blackout by the elite , oligarchic media outlets .
News of the national crisis gave way unexpectedly , and in an undeniably Kafkaesque manner , to reruns of cartoons and soap operas .
An effort to put a lid on the brewing resistance , to be sure , but it does little when the smell of burning tires is already in the air and established popular organizations are communicating by text message .
For those not responding to the calming effect of mindless programming , hegemony gives way to domination and live ammunition will have to suffice .
A fake letter of resignation : in an effort not so much to convince detractors as to give supporters a less embarrassing explanation of events , coup leaders produced a resignation letter allegedly written and signed by Zelaya .
The only problem ?
Zelaya was still very much alive to deny that he had ever written such a letter ( and the wonderful BoRev. net adds the insightful observation that , had Zelaya actually resigned , he might have changed out of his pajamas before boarding a flight to Costa Rica ) .
A botched timeline reveals premeditation : when sniper deaths at a march sparked the Venezuelan crisis in 2002 , the military high command released a videotaped statement denouncing the government very quickly , almost too quickly .
As it turned out , the statement , complete with a nearly - accurate death count , was filmed ahead of time , strongly suggesting the premeditated massacre occurred at opposition hands .
In Honduras , this has not been quite so dramatic , but the message is the same : the fake resignation letter allegedly signed by Zelaya was dated three days prior to the coup .
But speaking of premeditation , we come to arguably the most important similarity , one which has been controversial in recent days , as liberal / leftist supporters of Obama bend over backwards to reinforce their waning " hope " in the final days of the post- electoral honeymoon : the covert U.S. role in the coup .
Dissecting the U.S. Response
Previously resigned Obamaphiles , desperate to grasp at any shred of proof suggesting that they were right to get high on hope and expect imminent change , are closing ranks around their government and insisting that the U.S. government 's response to the Honduran coup is proof positive of such change .
Some even go so far as to claim that the Obama administration 's support for Zelaya has been " unambiguous , " adding that " complaints that Washington has n't acted fast enough to denounce the Honduran coup are silly and ignorant on the face of them . "
Let 's be clear : no one is saying that U.S. foreign policy is the same under Obama as under Bush , but nor did we expect them to be .
Rather , weexpected things to look very different while maintaining an underlying continuity .
And for anyone who looks closely , Washington 's response to the Honduran coup has been the definition of ambiguity , and such knee - jerk reactions to criticism simply fail to explain the subtle progression of this response , and moreover willfully neglect the subtleties and nuances that State Department officials and Obama himself have deployed .
Let 's lay this out briefly :
On Sunday , at a meeting with narco - terrorist Colombian president Alvaro Uribe , Obama issued the following carefully - worded statement :
" I am deeply concerned by reports coming out of Honduras regarding the detention and expulsion of President Mel Zelaya .
As the Organization of American States did on Friday , I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms , the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter - American Democratic Charter .
Any existing tensions and disputes must be resolved peacefully through dialogue free from any outside interference . "
Such a purposefully - vague statement was meant to communicate a wait - and - see approach : yes , we are " deeply concerned , " but what 's done is done and we must now work toward the reestablishment of " democratic norms . "
The implication is clear : fascistic coup leaders are quite capable of leading a transition back toward the very same democracy they attacked , and the United States is still hoping to avoid Zelaya 's return .
Some commentators were understandably perplexed when the text of a conference call with unnamed " Senior State Department Officials " was released later Sunday , claiming that the United States recognizes only Zelaya as the legitimate leader of Honduras , while implying that the State Department would be calling for his return via an OAS resolution .
But the sharp disconnect between this statement and Obama 's vagaries would only deepen when Secretary of State Clinton stepped into the fray , contradicting claims by both the president and the unnamed senior officials by insisting that the U.S. is not currently classifying events in Honduras as a coup and is not yet demanding Zelaya 's return , but only a vague return to democratic normalcy .
This , of course was another hedge , allowing the State Department leeway both to negotiate with and carry on business as usual with the coup regime were it to remain and to pressure Zelaya for a conditional return .
As to the former , the U.S. seems unwilling to take the risk of cutting direct aid to Honduras , a legal requirement if a " coup " is declared .
The latter is arguably more important : the State Department under Clinton most certainly did not support Zelaya 's efforts to radically challenge entrenched elites through a constitutional reform , and will likely pressure him to return humbled and defanged , with no such transformative aspirations .
John Negroponte , for one , sees things this way , arguing that Clinton " wants to preserve some leverage to try and get Zelaya to back down from his insistence on a referendum . "
And when it comes to containing and undermining Central American leftists , few know the playbook by heart like Negroponte , who as U.S. ambassador to Honduras during the Contra warspersonally oversaw both death squads and the drug trade .
Indeed , against all the left - liberal defenders of the Obama administration , it was probably Mara Liason who was closest to the truth when , speaking as one of three panelists on Fox News ( all of whom , incidentally , support the coup ) , argued that :
" I think they are perfectly happy with the outcome ...
Now , I think it 's the correct public diplomacy and policy to say , of course we 're for the democratically elected president and we do n't like coups in Latin America , but when all the dust settles , they will be perfectly happy to work with this new guy .
They are not working to get Zelaya back into power ...
This is the outcomethe United States would have preferred , this is not the methodthey would want to publicly condone . "
This is the iron fist with a velvet glove : while it may feel softer , it 's as " interventionist " as ever .
But all this aside , what is truly shocking is that the government is being taken at its word in the first place .
Here , the White House and State Department functions as a stand - in for the U.S. state as a whole , obscuring an entire history of underhanded interventionism , especially from the CIA .
Few have sought more insistently to reveal this dark underside of U.S. interventionism in Latin America than Eva Golinger , whose legal efforts to demand the release of government documents under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) revealed the true extent of the Bush administration 's role in the 2002 coup against Chávez ( published in The Chávez Code ) .
Golinger , who has been liveblogging the coup as it has progressed , describes a situation in which it would be utterly implausible to assume the United States government was not at least passively involved :
" The United States maintains a military base in Soto Cano , Honduras , that houses approximately 500 soldiers and special forces .
The U.S. military group in Honduras is one of the largest in U.S. Embassies in the region .
The leaders of the coup today are graduates of the U.S. School of the Americas , a training camp for dictators and repressive forces in Latin America ... The US Military Group in Honduras trains around 300 Honduran soldiers every year , provides more than $ 500,000 annually to the Honduran Armed Forces and additionally provides $ 1.4 million for a military education and exchange program for around 300 more Honduran soldiers every year . "
As Greg Grandin described the situation on Democracy Now ! : " The Honduran military is effectively a subsidiary of the United States government ... if any Latin American country is fully owned by the United States , it 's Honduras ...
So if the U.S. is opposed to this coup going forward , it wo n't go forward . "
To which we could add Jeremy Scahill 's response : " Obama and the US military could likely have halted this coup with a simple series of phone calls , " or , we might add , by threatening to pull funding ( which now , even after the coup , they seem unwilling to do ) .
When we consider the leverage the U.S. enjoys in Honduras , claims by the Obama administration that they attempted to prevent the coup border on the absurd .
Even more absurd , however , are efforts to defend the continued funding of a coup regime as " progress . "
Giordano's " Fact " Fetish
Here , unfortunately , the frequently admirable Al Giordano of Narco News falls deeply into contradiction .
For some inexplicable reason , Giordano has in recent weeks adopted as his modus operandi the flimsiest of pop psychology , first diagnosing those expressing any hesitancy whatsoever about the Iranian rebellion as suffering a profound case of Cold War nostalgia , before then transposing this same exact argument onto those critical of the Obama administration 's response to Zelaya 's ouster .
Setting his sights on Golinger in particular , who he accuses of " screeching " about the U.S. bogeyman , " not operating with a full deck of cards , " and " crying wolf " to fool the masses ( an accusation which is sharply at odds with his description of aloof leftists who have lost their Cold War coordinates and simply can't figure things out ) , Giordano concludes with astounding self - seriousness : " In this hour , those that adhere strictly to the documented facts are those that are showing character worth trusting , today and into the future . "
But Giordano's contradictory rhetoric of " documented facts " would have prevented him from accurately understanding the Venezuelan coup of 2002 ( since the " facts " were very much contested ) , and especially the U.S. role .
Such things are not advertised , and required the painstaking legal work of Golinger herself to reveal .
Were it not for Golinger 's departure from the " documented facts " parroted by press and government alike , we would never have known what happened in April 2002 .
As Golinger herself puts it : much like today in Honduras , " during the April 2002 coup against Chávez in Venezuela , the State Department also claimed it knew of the coup and tried to ‘ stop ' it .
Later , in my investigations , it was discovered through documents from State and CIA declassified under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) that CIA , State and other US agencies , funded , supported , advised and armed the coup leaders . "
When in 2002 we insisted that the CIA was involved , would Giordano have accused us of " crying wolf " ?
When we questioned the established facts and sought to painstakingly establish our own , would he have sat us on the couch to psychoanalyze our " Cold War nostalgia " ?
But of course , Giordano did not follow his own advice in 2002 .
If we are to understand what happens , we need to approach the " documented facts " from a more critical ( dare I say , dialectical ? ) perspective .
We need to draw on our historical understanding , on our grasp of the forces in play , and insistently create our own facts and truths .
Otherwise , we 'll always be one step behind the enemy , and unwittingly attacking our comrades .
As it stands , the coup against Zelaya seems to be running out of steam .
Zelaya has announced he will return to Honduras after the OAS ultimatum expires in 72 hours , and flanked by heads of state and OAS head José Miguel Insulza no less , while the coup leaders insist that he will be arrested on sight .
Social movements are mobilized , and some army battalions are refusing to accept the coup government .
Unless they are prepared to take the low road of outright repression , it seems likely that the coup leaders will need to crawl back into their hole and wait for the next manufactured crisis .

Our political system sometimes produces such skewed results that it ’s difficult not to blame bloviating politicians .
But maybe the deeper problem lies in our brains .
Evidence is accumulating that the human brain systematically misjudges certain kinds of risks .
In effect , evolution has programmed us to be alert for snakes and enemies with clubs , but we are n’t well prepared to respond to dangers that require forethought .
If you come across a garter snake , nearly all of your brain will light up with activity as you process the “ threat . ”
Yet if somebody tells you that carbon emissions will eventually destroy Earth as we know it , only the small part of the brain that focuses on the future  a portion of the prefrontal cortex  will glimmer .
“ We humans do strange things , perhaps because vestiges of our ancient brain still guide us in the modern world , ” notes Paul Slovic , a psychology professor at the University of Oregon and author of a book on how our minds assess risks .
Many users chalk up WiFi connection problems to congestion , especially when living in apartment buildings or urban areas ; there 's just too much data being pushed through those 11 meager channels !
But a thorough new report ( PDF ) commissioned by UK regulators sent researchers into the streets to pinpoint WiFi 's connection problems , and the culprit turns out to be ... baby monitors .
Well , not just baby monitors , of course ; any device that shoots radio energy into WiFi's 2.4GHz spectrum creates interference , and it's interference ( not congestion ) that lies at the root of most perceived problems with WiFi .
The 2.4GHz band actually has quite a bit of spectrum — a full 83MHz between 2.4GHz and 2.483GHz .
Teams were dispatched across the UK to check connections in cities of all sizes , but they found congestion problems only in the center of London .
Because WiFi is so limited by distance , 83MHz of spectrum proved to be plenty , except in the most densely populated bit of the country .
That 's not to say that WiFi is an efficient protocol ; it 's not .
Researchers found that a full 90 percent of all " frames " transmitted by WiFi radios contained only management and node broadcast data .
" We have found that it is rare for the user data frame rate to exceed 10 percent of the total frame rate , " says the report .
Even so , the idea that one 's neighbors are " hogging " all the bandwidth in a particular WiFi channel by excessive downloading simply is n't supported by the data .
The culprit for poor WiFi turns out , in almost all cases , to be interference .
And it 's not generally interference caused by other WiFi radios ; the problematic interference is caused most by baby monitors , microwaves , portable phones , and most of all by " audio video senders " ( wireless video extenders ) which are common in UK apartment buildings .
" The effect of AV senders on WiFi clients is distinctive and repeatable , " says the report .
" As these devices are inexpensive and readily available in supermarkets , we conclude that the majority of the accusations levelled at residential users for abusing the WiFi networks are actually caused by the installation of AV senders or similar devices .
Such devices can easily deprive neighbors of use of a WiFi channel and , at the same time , give the impression of overuse of the channel . "
WiFi has become important enough — and the interference problem bad enough — that the report recommends creating a new " 2.4GHz friendly " logo program to brand devices that are good radio - frequency citizens .
Baby monitors now routinely trumpet their " WiFi friendliness " as a feature , and the new logo program would lay down some principles that every device operating in the 2.4GHz band could follow to make the same claim .
What happened
As Sarah Palin prepares to step down as Alaska 's governor , a new Washington Post - ABC News poll found that her popularity had hit its lowest point since she entered national politics as Republican Sen.
John McCain 's running mate .
The poll found that 53 percent of Americans view Palin unfavorably , and 40 percent see her favorably .
( The Washington Post )
What the commentators said
There 's no one like Sarah Palin , said Steve Haycox in the Anchorage Daily News .
Voters started out admiring her for being so — as she said — " mavericky . "
Eventually it became clear that her stirring speeches were " uninformed , her mind untrained , and her reasoning illogical . "
But the real reason her popularity is sinking is that she 's shirking her civic duties by quitting before her term is up .
" Why , in the wake of her resignation as governor of Alaska , " said Janice Shaw Crouse in Townhall , " do the mainstream media continue their efforts to destroy Sarah Palin ? "
Americans should be thanking Palin for illustrating that " a woman can be feminine while being a strong , smart leader . "
But do n't hold your breath — the media will never give up their " campaign of personal destruction " until they have eliminated her as a 2012 presidential contender .
The media and the public are n't the only ones who have soured on Sarah Palin , said Suzy Khimm in The New Republic .
Alaska legislators from both parties say Palin's " national exposure changed her , moving her much further to the right than she had been and making her nearly impossible to work with . "
Palin says media attacks and frivolous ethics complaints made it impossible for her to do her job , but " it was Palin 's national ambitions that were primarily responsible for her undoing . "
A small noncryptographic PRNG
This is a small fast pseudorandom number generator , suitable for large statistical calculations , but not of cryptographic quality .
Although there is no guaranteed minimum cycle length , the average cycle length is expected to be about 2126 results .
The fastest small unbiased noncryptographic PRNG that I could find ( in C ) typedef unsigned long int u4 ; typedef struct ranctx { u4 a ; u4 b ; u4 c ; u4 d ; } ranctx ; # define rot ( x , k ) ( ( ( x ) < < ( k ) ) | ( ( x ) > > ( 32 -( k ) ) ) ) u4 ranval ( ranctx *x ) { u4 e = x-> a - rot(x->b , 27 ) ; x->a = x->b ^ rot(x-> c , 17 ) ; x->b = x->c + x->d ; x->c = x->d + e ; x->d = e + x -> a ; return x->d ; } void raninit ( ranctx *x , u4 seed ) { u4 i ; x->a = 0xf1ea5eed , x->b = x->c = x->d = seed ; for ( i=0 ; i< 20 ; ++i ) { ( void ) ranval ( x ) ; } }
I have not found any test in any configuration that it does not pass .
It passes DIEHARD .
Sampling just the bottom byte , it passes the run test ( both up and down ) , and the gap test ( for gaps up to length 32 ) for 2 trillion values ( chi.c ) .
The frequency test ( again on the bottom byte ) looked suspicious at 1 trillion values ( chi-square=5 ) , so I ran it for 4 trillion values ( chi-square=0.42 ) , showing the earlier result was a fluke ( freq.c ) .
A test that counts bits per value for five consecutive values ( countx . c ) passes for at least 16 trillion values , both for normal and for graycoded values .
It passes Geronimo Jones ' nda test for at least 1 trillion values ( 4 trillion bytes ) .
The strongest test for small - state generators I 've run across is Bob Blorp2 's bitcounting test ( countx.c ) .
Near as I can tell , what it is doing is indirectly measuring how much avalanche happens by the time entropy is first recycled .
For this generator that 's 5 results .
I can measure that directly too : for every bit of the internal state , I can start with two copies of a random state that differ in just that bit , then run the generator for 5 results , and XOR their 5th result .
Complete avalanche would give an average of 16 bits differing .
The program rngav.c measures this : for the PRNG above , at least 8.8 bits are affected on average .
I used the shifts ( 27 , 17 ) .
Others that achieve 8.8 bits of avalanche include ( 9,16 ) , ( 9,24 ) , ( 10,16 ) , ( 10,24 ) , ( 11,16 ) , ( 11,24 ) , ( 25,8 ) , ( 25,16 ) , ( 26,8 ) , ( 26,16 ) , ( 26,17 ) , and ( 27,16 ) .
Avalanche is much better in reverse , but the code is also slower , both because of more read - after - write dependencies .
It is possible to not fully achieve avalanche yet still pass all practical tests for randomness because nearly - identical states are very rare among the set of all possible states .
If raninit ( seed ) is used ( one of those 232 seeds ) , the shortest cycle is expected to be about 294 ( because 126 - 32 = 94 ) , and it expected that about one seed will run into another seed within 264 values ( because 128-64-2*32=0 ) .
That 's probabilistic ; the actual shortest cycle or collision could be better or worse than that .
I 've tested each seed from raninit ( ) to certain lengths to guarantee it does not cycle and does not hit any other seed .
( You do that by starting a=0 xf1ea5eed and b=c=d=seed , then checking the state after every value for b==c and b==d and a ==0 xf1ea5eed ) .
How far I tested is limited by computing resources on hand .
I tested seed 0 ( the first 20 seeds ) for 250 values , 0..31 ( the first 25 seeds ) for 246 values , the first 210 seeds for 240 values , the first 221 seeds for 232 values , and all 232 seeds for 220 values .
No cycles or overlaps were found .
I wrote this PRNG .
I place it in the public domain .
Same goes for at least the implementation of all those tests linked to above .
I suspect that all you need for a statistically good pseudorandom number generator is
A reversible , nonlinear function where all internal state bits affect one another
A big enough state to give you a long cycle length
Sufficiently fast mixing , when run either forward or backward
( April 2009 ) Elias Yarrkov used a black - box solver to find some fixed points of this generator ( which produce cycles of length 1 ) :
{ 0x00000000 , 0x00000000 , 0x00000000 , 0x00000000 } , { 0x77777777 , 0x55555555 , 0x11111111 , 0x44444444 } , { 0x5591F2E3 , 0x69EBA6CD , 0x2A171E3D , 0x3FD48890 } , { 0x47CB8D56 , 0xAE9B35A7 , 0x5C78F4A8 , 0x522240 FF }
{ 0x71AAC8F9 , 0x66B4F5D3 , 0x1E950B8 F , 0x481FEA44 } , { 0xAB23E5C6 , 0xD3D74D9A , 0x542E3C7A , 0x7FA91120 }
A third rotate would have improved avalanche
A third rotate could be introduced into ranval ( ) without increasing the maximum parallel path through the code .
This came out significantly slower with the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler , though .
( MS VS uses pointer arithmetic for the additions , to trick Intel 's compiler into using 3 - variable instructions instead of 2 - variable .
The extra rotate thwarted that , thus the speed hit . )
A third rotate could increase minimum avalanche to 13 bits , on average , like so :
u4 ranval ( ranctx *x ) { u4 e = x->a - rot(x->b , 23 ) ; x->a = x->b ^ rot(x-> c , 16 ) ; x->b = x-> c + rot(x->d , 11 ) ; x->c = x->d + e ; x->d = e + x-> a ; return x->d ; }
Shifts amounts achieving 13 bits avalanche include ( 3,14,24 ) , ( 3,25,15 ) , ( 4,15,24 ) , ( 6,16,28 ) , ( 7,16,27 ) , ( 8,14,3 ) , ( 11,16,23 ) , ( 12,16,22 ) , ( 12,17,23 ) , ( 13,16,22 ) , ( 15,25,3 ) , ( 16,9,3 ) , ( 17,9,3 ) , ( 17,27,7 ) , ( 19,7,3 ) , ( 23,15,11 ) , ( 23,16,11 ) , ( 23,17,11 ) , ( 24,3,16 ) , ( 24,4,16 ) , ( 25,14,3 ) , ( 27,16,6 ) , ( 27,16,7 ) .
I imagine these are significantly more pseudorandom than the PRNG at the top .
However , since they run slower and no test I know of can detect nonrandomness in either , I 'm recommending the 2 - shift version .
Timings ( June 2009 )
My original timings had one file containing both the generator and a tight loop testing the generator .
The compiler inlined the generators into the tight loop , keeping the state in registers .
On the register - starved Intel platform , that would never happen for real uses of a generator : whatever the random numbers are used for would kick the generator 's state out of registers .
Another approach is to use the generator to fill a large array , then to read values out of that array one by one , like with this code in a .h file :
static inline u4 ranval ( random_context * r ) { if ( r -> count >= SIZE ) { fill ( r ) ; r->count = 0 ; } return r->result[r-> count ++ ] ; }
Here 's some new timings of generators for 20000 * 65536 results for various generators , variously inlined , used with a 256 - item array , or in a routine that calculates a single value .

64 - bit variants
If you want to use 8 - byte terms instead of 4 - byte terms , the proper rotate amounts are ( 39,11 ) for the two - rotate version ( yielding at least 13.3 bits of avalanche after 5 rounds ) or ( 7,13,37 ) for the three - rotate version ( yielding 18.4 bits of avalanche after 5 rounds ) .
I think I 'd go with the three - rotate version , because the ideal is 32 bits of avalanche , and 13.3 is n't even half of that .
typedef unsigned long long u8 ; typedef struct ranctx { u8 a ; u8 b ; u8 c ; u8 d ; } ranctx ; # define rot ( x , k ) ( ( ( x ) < < ( k ) ) | ( ( x ) > >( 64 -( k ) ) ) ) u8 ranval ( ranctx *x ) { u8 e = x->a - rot(x->b , 7 ) ; x->a = x->b ^ rot(x-> c , 13 ) ; x->b = x-> c + rot(x->d , 37 ) ; x->c = x->d + e ; x->d = e + x -> a ; return x->d ; } void raninit ( ranctx *x , u8 seed ) { u8 i ; x->a = 0xf1ea5eed , x->b = x->c = x->d = seed ; for ( i=0 ; i< 20 ; ++i ) { ( void ) ranval ( x ) ; } }
I do n't think that there 's an 8 - byte rotate instruction on any 64 - bit platform .
And you only need 2 terms to get to 128 bits of internal state if you have 64 - bit terms .
Quite likely 64 - bit deserves a whole different approach , not just different constants .
Dale Weiler implemented this prng as a compiletime constant
2020 : I have a faster 64 - bit bit generator , Wob2 , with 2 mixing registers and 1 counter which is 100 % guaranteed a cycle length of at least 264 and that the sequences from different seeds do not overlap for at least 264 values .
An unlikely - to - be secure extention of this PRNG
The small - state version is n't suitable for encryption .
However , if x->b is replaced with an array and e is used for lookup in the array , it becomes something that is possibly of cryptographic strength :
typedef unsigned long int u4 ; typedef struct ranctx { u4 a ; u4 b[ 256 ] ; u4 c ; u4 d;} ranctx ; # define rot ( x , k ) ( ( ( x ) < < ( k ) ) | ( ( x ) > > ( 32 -( k ) ) ) ) void ranxor ( ranctx * x , u4 m [ 256 ] ) { u4 i ; for ( i=0 ; i< 256 ; ++i ) { u4 e = x ->a - rot(x -> b[ i ] , 27 ) ; x->a = x ->b[ e%256 ] ^ rot(x -> c , 17 ) ; x ->b[ e %256 ] = x->c + x->d ; x->c = x->d + e ; x->d = e + x -> a ; m[ i ] ^= x->d ; } } void raninit ( ranctx * x , u4 seed [ 128 ] ) { u4 i ; u4 junk [ 256 ] ; x->a = x->c = x->d = 0xf1ea5eed ; for ( i=0 ; i< 128 ; ++i ) { x -> b[ i ] = x ->b[ i+128 ] = seed [ i ] ; } for ( i=0 ; i< 10 ; ++i ) { ranxor( x , junk ) ; } }
The routine ranxor ( ) takes a message m [ ] consisting of 256 4 - byte values and XORs 256 pseudorandom 4 - byte values with it .
I strongly recommend against using this for any cryptographic purpose .
If it is secure , it is just barely so .
I do n't think it 's even particularly fast .
The only value I see in it is as a target for cryptanalysis and possible inspiration for future stream ciphers .
Although lack of bias comes from the same good mixing as the original generator , the security comes more from the pseudorandom lookups than from the mixing .
The most blatant weakness is that there is one pseudorandom lookup per result returned , leaving a system with n+256 variables and n equations after seeing n results ( counting pseudorandom lookups as separate variables than lookups from known positions ) .
If you can make progress guessing or linking the variables the whole thing should be solvable .
Another weakness ( and the most curious part of this generator ) is that the positions to be updated in x ->b [ ] are selected pseudorandomly rather than in a regular order .
That means each pass leaves about 1/e of the positions in x ->b [ ] unchanged .
Which means you can reduce the number of independent variables just by guessing which positions do n't get changed between rounds .
I still do n't know how to break it , but I have n't tried very hard .

The Flag of Equal Marriage was an evolving protest flag for equal marriage rights in the US .
It included one star for each state which recognized and performed same - sex marriages , with a goal of seeing all 50 stars lit up to match the American flag .
On June 26th , 2015 , the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to every state with their decision on Obergefell v. Hodges , making our union a bit more perfect .
The Flag of Equal Marriage and the American flag are now one and the same .

This list looks at some amazing past inventions that have been lost .
Some may be cause for skepticism but almost all of the items here are things that we would definitely love to understand better today .
Keep an open mind as some entries are famous for their part in conspiracy theories .
Be sure to list other lost or suppressed inventions in the comments .
10 Greek Fire
Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire .
The Byzantines typically used it in naval battles to great effect as it could continue burning even on water .
The ingredients and the processes of manufacture and deployment of Greek fire were very carefully guarded military secrets .
So strict was the secrecy that the composition of Greek fire was lost , and remains a source of speculation to this day .
Consequently , the “ mystery ” of the formula has long dominated the research into Greek fire .
Despite this almost exclusive focus however , Greek fire is best understood as a complete weapon system of many components , all of which were needed to operate together to render it effective .
9 Orgone Wilhelm Reich
Orgone energy is a hypothetical form of energy first proposed and promoted in the 1930s by psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich .
It is claimed that orgone is a manifestation of the Freudian concept of libido .
Reich saw orgone as a universal bioenergetic force lying behind and causing much , if not all , observable phenomena .
Reich developed a device – an “ orgone accumulator ” for clinical trials and tests .
From the 1950s onwards , the FDA became involved in aggressively investigating healthcare providers who were offering treatment not accepted by mainstream researchers , and in particular by the American Medical Association .
Reich was one of the therapists who was targeted .
On February 10 , 1954 , the U.S. Attorney for Maine , acting on behalf of the FDA , filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction under Sections 301 and 302 of the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , to prevent interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and to ban some of Reich ’s writing .
The court complied and ordered that all accumulators and their parts were to be destroyed .
All written material that discussed how to use the accumulators was also to be destroyed .
It also banned ten of Reich ’s books that mentioned orgone energy , until such time as references to orgone were deleted .
8 Perpetual Motion Viktor Schauberger
Schauberger and his works have become part of an internet - based conspiracy theory claiming that Schauberger invented free energy / perpetual motion devices and that this was “ covered up ” by the US government .
While , perpetual motion devices are impossible under basic laws of physics as they violate the fundamental concept of conservation of energy , Schauberger never claimed to have invented perpetual motion machines , but instead stated that he used the Earth ’s natural power .
After the Second World War , Schauberger was apprehended by US intelligence agents , and kept in custody for 9 months .
They confiscated all his documents and prototypes , and interrogated him to determine his activities during the war .
7 Ozone Therapy
Some people , including a number of doctors and biochemists , believe ozone has remarkable healing properties .
The advent of precise medical ozone generators has only recently allowed the mechanisms , action and possible toxicity of ozone to be evaluated by clinical trials .
But despite anecdotal evidence of ozone therapy having caused remission in a variety of diseases , therapeutic use of ozone is not endorsed by health authorities or medical associations in any English speaking country , and most US states prohibit the marketing of ozone generators , its medical use , and even research and clinical trials of ozone therapy , so that doctors risk losing their medical licenses by administering or prescribing ozone therapies .
6 Anti-Gravity Device Thomas Townsend Brown
In 1956 , the aviation trade publication Interavia reported that Thomas Townsend Brown had made substantial progress in anti-gravity or electro - gravitic propulsion research .
Top U.S. aerospace companies had also become involved in such research which may have become a classified subject by 1957 .
Though the effect he discovered has been proven to exist by many others , Brown ’s work was controversial because others and even he himself believed that this effect could explain the existence and operation of unidentified flying objects ( UFOs ) .
Brown ’s research has since become something of a popular pursuit around the world , with amateur experimenters replicating his early experiments in the form of “ lifters ” powered by high - voltage .
5 Cold Fusion Device Eugene Mallove
Eugene Mallove was a notable proponent and supporter of research into cold fusion .
He authored the book Fire from Ice , which details the 1989 report of table - top cold fusion from Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann at the University of Utah .
The book claims the team did produce “ greater - than - unity ” output energy in an experiment , which supposedly was successfully replicated on several occasions .
Mallove claims that the results were suppressed through an organized campaign of ridicule from mainstream physicists .
He was fatally beaten May 14 , 2004 in Norwich , Connecticut by an unknown assailant .
His violent death was suspected by some to be related to the nature of his work .
4 Water Fuel Cell Stanley Meyer
Stanley Meyer produced nine patents relating to his “ water powered ” car .
He was subsequently sued by two investors and the court found Meyer guilty of “ gross and egregious fraud ” , ordering him to repay the investors their $ 25,000 .
Following his sudden death , an autopsy showed that he died of a cerebral aneurysm .
Meyer ’s supporters continue to claim that he was assassinated by ‘ Big Oil ’ , Arab death squads , Belgian assassins , or the US Government in order to suppress his inventions .
3 Earthquake Machine Nikola Tesla
At one point while experimenting with mechanical oscillators , Nikola Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings causing complaints to the police .
As the speed grew he hit the resonance frequency of his own building and belatedly realizing the danger he was forced to apply a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment , just as the astonished police arrived .
The Discovery Channel ’s popular MythBusters show examined Tesla ’s claim that he had created an “ Earthquake Machine ” in their 60th episode .
They tested the physical phenomenon known as mechanical resonance on a traffic bridge , which today are built to withstand such forces .
While a single I - beam of steel was deflected several feet in each direction by their oscillator , and they reportedly felt the bridge shaking many yards away , there were no “ earth shattering ” effects .
It is worth indicating that , in the time of the event undertaken by Tesla , buildings were not built to withstand such resonance .
2 Flexible Glass Unknown
Flexible glass is a legendary lost invention from during the reign of Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar ( between 14 CE - 37 CE ) .
As recounted by Isadore of Seville , the craftsman who invented the technique brought before Caesar a drinking bowl made of flexible glass , and Caesar threw it to the floor , whereupon the material dented , rather than shattering .
The inventor was able to simply repair the dent with a small hammer .
After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture , Caesar had the man beheaded , fearing such material could undermine the value of gold and silver .
1 Chronovision Father Marcello Pellegrino Ernetti
Father Ernetti is fascinating not just because of his work as an exorcist in the Venice region , but more especially because of his work on the “ chronovision ” .
In the 1960s he is said to have claimed he constructed a time viewer of sorts in the 1950s , as part of a group that supposedly included Nobel Laureate Enrico Fermi and Wernher von Braun .
The machine was called the Chronovisor , and could allegedly see and hear events of the past .
According to an explanation by Ernetti , the luminous energy and sound that objects emanate are recorded in their environment , such that proper use of the chronovisor could reconstruct from said energy the images and sounds of a specific set of events from the past .
Through the viewing screen of the chronovisor Father Ernetti claimed to have witnessed a performance in Rome in 169 BC of the now - lost tragedy , Thyestes , by the father of Latin poetry , Quintus Ennius .
He also claimed to have witnessed Christ dying on the cross .
On his death - bed in 1994 , Father Ernetti said that he attended a meeting of all the people involved in the chronovision at the Vatican during which the only existing machine was destroyed .

Pause Police : The Greatest Business Card Ever
I… I do n’t even know what to say .
There are so many things going on in this picture that I do n’t even know where to start .
I ’m thinking someone needs to call Dexter Ivy in Harlem at the number listed below and let me know how it goes .
Shouts to @EazyEDot for the pic !
If President Obama nominates Judge Diane P. Wood to the Supreme Court , conservatives plan to attack her as an “ outspoken ” supporter of “ abortion , including partial - birth abortion . ”
If he nominates Judge Sonia Sotomayor , they plan to accuse her of being “ willing to expand constitutional rights beyond the text of the Constitution . ”
And if he nominates Kathleen M. Sullivan , a law professor at Stanford , they plan to denounce her as a “ prominent supporter of homosexual marriage . ”
... While conservatives say they know they have little chance of defeating Mr. Obama ’s choice because Democrats control the Senate , they say they hope to mount a fight that could help refill depleted coffers and galvanize a movement demoralized by Republican electoral defeats .
“ It ’s an immense opportunity to build the conservative movement and identify the troops out there , ” said Richard A. Viguerie , a conservative fund - raiser .
“ It ’s a massive teaching moment for America .
We ’ve got the packages written .
We ’re waiting right now to put a name in . ”
Gary Marx , executive director of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network , said donors , whom he declined to identify , had committed to contributing millions of dollars for television , radio and Internet advertisements that might reunite conservatives in a confirmation battle .
What most people do n't know is that after the above - mentioned 1886 decision , artificial persons were held to have exactly the same legal rights as we natural folk .
( Not to mention the clear advantages corporations enjoy : they can be in several places at once , for instance , and at least in theory they 're immortal . )
Up until the New Deal , many laws regulating corporations were struck down under the " equal protection " clause of the 14th Amendment -- in fact , that clause was invoked far more often on behalf of corporations than former slaves .
Although the doctrine of personhood has been weakened since , even now lawyers argue that an attempt to sue a corporation for lying is an unconstitutional infringement on its First Amendment right to free speech .
( This year , for example , we saw Nike v. Kasky . )
You 're thinking :
By what tortured reasoning did the Supreme Court decide that corporations were protected by the 14th Amendment , which everyone knows was enacted to protect the rights of real people ?
Answer : Apparently it did n't decide .
As revealed by our friend bex -- and detailed by Thom Hartmann in Unequal Protection : The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights ( 2002 ) -- the whole thing began as a courtroom comment by a judge , which was elevated to the status of legal precedent by an overreaching court reporter ...
Hartmann 's book has caused a stir in legal circles , and some hope the Supreme Court will take another look at corporate personhood .
A few naifs think a reversal will spell the end of global corporate tyranny .
Ain't gonna happen -- fact is , the courts have been chipping away at corporate personhood for years , and you do n't exactly see our capitalist overlords suffering from it .
But it'd be nice to have a clear - cut ruling , say , that limiting campaign contributions by big businesses does n't mean you 're restricting their First Amendment rights .
Like we said last week , most Americans -- and obviously that does n't include the kind of people who get their opinions from Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , Ann Coulter or others who exploit hatred and bigotry to make their livings -- feel confident that Obama will make a good choice in his first Supreme Court nominee .
That has n't stopped the obstructionist coalition in the Senate from sitting down and plotting a strategy to denigrate and smear whoever he nominates .
Although most Senate Republicans have signed on , it 's ironic that the leader , a poorly educated Ku Klux Klan sympathizer from Alabama , Jeff Sessions , was chosen to lead their efforts on the Judiciary Committee .
It 's ironic because the same Judiciary Committee once considered Sessions ' own nomination for a judgeship and found him wanting and too bigoted .
According to Charlie Savage in yesterday ' sthe Republicans and their extreme right - wing allies are stockpiling ammunition to use against any of the frequently - mentioned prospects Obama is thought to be considering .
Although the hard right religious radicals who get most worked up over nomination battles never quite understand the concept of separation of Church and State and are always bothering normal people about their religious conceptions and superstitions , the Republican Party 's only real interest in this fight -- besides raking in dough from the suckers -- is to force Obama to pick a pro-corporatist judge .
In the end that is thequalification Republicans care about .
Their brief against Sonia Sotomayor , for example , " cites a ruling in which she said a man could sue a private corporation for violating his constitutional rights while acting as a government contractor . "
That 's an area where Republicans will never allow anyone to tread .
In 1886 an activist right wing judge made a wrongheaded pronouncement that has been a disaster for American working families ever since and that is the entire basis for Republican Party judicial " thought . "
The case , appears to -- or has been interpreted to -- declare that a corporation is , legally , a person and hence protected by the 14th Amendment which guarantees the equal protection of the law .
This misinterpretation of the law -- literally put forward by a court reporter ! -- has changed the course of history by guaranteeing that rise of corporate rule and a drastic imbalance between powerful private corporations and society ( ordinary citizens ) .
Most Republican senators do n't really care that much what judges think about abortion , gays , guns or flags .
They live and die for this concept of corporate personhood .
All of Bush 's nominees , where ever else they stood on what ever issue , they were solid on protecting the legal dominance of corporations .
That will be the real backdrop of the drama over whomever Obama nominates , although it will take replacing judges like Scalia , Thomas , Roberts , Alito and Kennedy -- none of whom will likely be leaving the court , other than by the grace of God , while Obama is President -- to substantially change anything at all to do with the Supreme Court .
Labels : Obama 's judicial nominees , obstructionist Republicans
WebKit on Mac OS
X now has support for CSS 3D transforms , which allow you to position elements on the page in three - dimensional space using CSS .
This is a natural extension of 2D transforms , which we described in an earlier blog post .
3D transforms have been supported on iPhone since 2.0 , and now we ’re please to announce that we have currently added support for Leopard and later .
If you want to jump right in and see a demo , make sure you ’re running recent WebKit nightly build on Leopard or later , and load this example :
Poster Circle
Here ’s a screenshot for those not running a recent - enough WebKit ( if you are , hover over it for a treat ! ) :
Like many of the examples you ’ll see here , this one combines CSS transforms with CSS transitions and animations to great effect .
3D transforms are applied via the same - webkit - transform property as 2D transforms .
For example , here ’s how to rotate an element about the Y ( vertical ) axis :
- webkit - transform : rotateY ( 45deg ) ;
There are several new transform functions available for use in the - webkit - transform property :
translate3d( x , y , z ) , translateZ (z )
Move the element in x , y and z , and just move the element in z .
Positive z is towards the viewer .
Unlike x and y , the z value can not be a percentage .
scale3d ( sx , sy , sz ) , scaleZ ( sz )
Scale the element in x , y and z .
The z scale affects the scaling along the z axis in transformed children . rotateX ( angle ) , rotate Y ( angle ) , rotate3d( x , y , z , angle ) ,
The first two forms simply rotate the element about the horizontal and vertical axes .
Angle units can be degrees ( deg ) radians ( rad ) or gradians ( grad ) .
The last form allows you to rotate the element around an arbitrary vector in 3D space ; x , y and z should specify the unit vector you wish to rotate around ( we ’ll normalize it for you ) .
perspective (p )
This function allows you to put some perspective into the transformation matrix .
For an explanation of p , see below .
Normally perspective is applied via the - webkit - perspective property , but this function allows you to get a perspective effect for a single element , with something like : - webkit - transform : perspective ( 500 px ) rotateY ( 20deg ) ; matrix3d ( … )
This function allows you to specify the raw 4×4 homogeneous transformation matrix of 16 values in column - major order .
Have fun with that !
We ’ve also extended one other CSS transform property , and implemented the four other 3D - related properties described in the spec :
- webkit - transform - origin now accepts three values , allowing you to specify a z offset for the transform origin .
- webkit - perspective is used to give an illusion of depth ; it determines how things change size based on their z - offset from the z=0 plane .
You can think of it as though you ’re looking at the page from a distance p away .
Objects on the z=0 plane appear in their normal size .
Something at a z offset of p/2 ( halfway between the viewer and the z=0 plane ) will look twice as big , and something at a z offset of –p will look half as big .
Thus , large values give a little foreshortening effect , and small values lots of foreshortening .
Values between 500px and 1000 px give a reasonable - looking result for most content .
The default origin for the perspective effect is the center of the element ’s border box , but you can control this with - webkit - perspective - origin .
Here ’s an example that shows how perspective works :
Perspective
The interesting thing about - webkit - perspective is that it does not affect the element directly .
Instead , it affects the appearance of the 3D transforms on the transformed descendants of that element ; you can think of it as adding a transform that gets multiplied into the descendant transforms .
This allows those descendants to all share the same perspective as they move around .
We ’ve described how you can assign 3D transforms to elements and make them look three - dimensional with some perspective .
However , so far , all the effects are really just painting effects .
Those transformed children are still rendering into the plane of their parent ; in other words , they are flattened .
When you start to build hierarchies of objects with 3D transforms , flattening is not what you want .
You want parents and children to live in a shared three - dimensional space , and to all share the same perspective which propagates up from some container .
This is where - webkit - transform - style comes in .
- webkit - transform - style has two values :
flat :
This is the default value , and gives the behavior described above ; transformed children are flattened into the plane of their parent ( think of the 3D transform as simply a painting effect ) .
: This is the default value , and gives the behavior described above ; transformed children are flattened into the plane of their parent ( think of the 3D transform as simply a painting effect ) .
preserve - 3d :
This value states that the element to which it is assigned does not flatten its children into it ; instead , those children live in a shared 3D space with the element .
Here ’s an example that shows transform - style in action :
Transform Style
A common pattern , therefore , is to have content that looks like this :
< div class=" container " style= " - webkit- perspective : 600 px " > < div class= " box " style= " - webkit-transform - style : preserve - 3d ; - webkit - transform : rotateY ( 10deg ) " > < div class = " leaf " style= " - webkit- transform : rotateX ( 10deg ) " ></div > </div > </div >
Here both ‘ leaf ’ and ‘ box ’ share the same 3D space , so both appear with the perspective specified on the container .
‘ box ’ can also be rotated with a transition or animation , and ‘ leaf ’ will move around as ‘ box ’ moves , in perspective .
One thing you may have noticed in these demos is that it ’s quite common to have a 3D transform that flips an element around so that you can see its reverse side .
In some cases you do n’t want the element to appear at all in this situation ( say , for example , you want to position two elements back - to - back , so you need to hide the one that ’s facing away from the viewer ) .
This is the reason for the last 3d - related property , - webkit - backface - visibility .
Its two values — visible ( the default ) , and hidden — specify whether the element is visible or not when that element is transformed such that its back face is towards the viewer .
Here ’s a final example that shows backface - visibility in action , along with more 3D goodness , animations and transitions :

Clarksville , Tenn. , resident Joel Palmer Watts , 27 , told police after his arrest in a sting that his girlfriend was involved in a " sexual relationship " with Stanley and that he found explicit photographs of his girlfriend that appeared to have been taken in the Republican senator ’s Nashville apartment .
Republican Paul Stanley claims to be an Evangelical Christian .
Now there 's a big shock .
The girlfriend is identified in a police affidavit as McKensie Morrison .
She is a junior at Austin Peay State University and was one of her school ’s two legislative interns this year .
Her age was not available .
Her age may not be available , but her pictures are here .
Republican Paul Stanley is 47 .
The young lady in question appears to be in her very early 20's .... as in ... young enough to be his daughter .
Stanley — who is married and has two children — did n’t return telephone calls to his house Tuesday evening , although he did release a prepared statement ...
" Unfortunately , I am the victim and a witness to a crime in an ongoing investigation , " Stanley , 47 , said in the statement .
Barf .
Spare me .
He also said he would clear up " misinformation " about the case at a future , unspecified date , saying authorities had advised him not to comment further .
Translation :
At some point soon , he will have a press conference .
His wife will stand by him .
If he can convince his church pastor to show up , he may be there too .
Republican Paul Stanley will then yammer - on about how he has broken his marriage vows , he has sinned against God , he has let his district down ... yada - yada - yada .
All the Republicans will forgive him as long as he promises to keep fighting the good fight to protect the sanctity of marriage from the scary gay people .

WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A key House panel on Wednesday advanced a bill to crack down on credit card interest rates and fees amid signs the Obama administration will try to toughen the bill further before it goes to a full vote .
The House Financial Services Committee passed the bill 48 - 19 ; nine Republicans joined the panel 's Democrats in voting for it .
The bill could go to the full House for a vote as soon as next week .
The committee vote came as President Obama gets set to meet Thursday with 14 executives from the largest credit card companies .
Until last Sunday , when Obama economic adviser Larry Summers spoke publicly about the administration getting tough on credit card companies , the White House had been largely silent about the bill .
Obama advocated for a credit card holder bill of rights during last year 's presidential campaign .
The White House intends to reveal its proposed changes Thursday after the meeting with executives .
One change the administration may seek would be a provision requiring better notification on the long - term consequences of making only the minimum suggested payment , according to Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of House Financial Services .
The legislation is a cornerstone of efforts by consumer groups and mostly congressional Democrats to rewrite rules governing lending practices by card companies , banks and others The House bill , championed by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , is similar to one passed by the House last year .
" This bill cracks down on some of the most outrageous abuses , " Maloney said Wednesday .
" My bill levels the playing field so consumers have more control over their credit . "
In the Senate , which did not advance credit card proposals last year , a committee has passed a version of the House bill , with one Democrat voting against it .
The House bill mirrors tougher rules that the Federal Reserve passed last December but that do n't go into effect until July 2010 .
The Fed changes would stop higher interest rates from being imposed when consumers are late paying unrelated bills .
The changes also stop companies from averaging finance charges from two previous cycles , a practice that dings consumers who carry a balance and pay it off .
Several House Republicans said the pending Fed rule changes make congressional action unnecessary .
But Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services panel , disagreed .
" What the Federal Reserve giveth , the Federal Reserve can taketh away , " he said .
Frank pointed out that the Fed could later undo the rules if Congress does n't pass a law .
Meanwhile , industry lobbyists are fighting both the House and Senate bills for many reasons .
But they especially do n't like how the proposals would prevent card issuers from raising interest rates and fees based on risky behavior .
" I have n't heard any evidence that the competitive market is n't working , " said Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas .
" In the absence of that , why are you attacking risk - based pricing ? "
Wacko Summer Seasonal
Magic Hat Brewing Company , South Burlington , VT
Info : “ Crisp like the morning , cool like the evening , and quenching all day long .
It ’s the beer that dances to the beat of summer .
Pop the top and let your summer loose .
Wacko is the song of summer .
A delicious , beet - red summer beer with a big , malty aroma , a subdued hop bite , and a clean , slightly sweet finish . ”
Hey , I can totally get behind a beer that dares to step off the beaten path and wander through the ground less traveled .
I hate boring , cookie - cutter flavors and I hate submissive and redundant mass produced swill .
So , when I dipped into my Summer Selection 12 - pack from Magic Hat , I was caught agape at the label proclaiming its ‘ beet juice color ’ .
Not for nothin ’ is also the fact that I hate beets .
Well , I was really hoping it did n’t taste like dirt .
This beer is perhaps the reddest liquid I have ever seen shy of blood and Kool - Aid .
Beet juice ?
No shit .
And boy oh boy does it have a nice creamy head and a nose not unlike a malty , tart , rich piece of beer - scented candy !
Wait .
Let us not forget that shooting to far away from the bitter IPA ’s and even surpassing the chocolaty caramels of a Stout or Porter can , sometimes , be bad .
But , I do love giving new beers the benefit of the doubt .
Wow .
Subtle , yet distinctly complex myriad of flavors permeate almost too late for recognition on the first swallow .
Nope .
No beet flavor here , thank God .
But wow , the miasma of malty , hoppy snap at the onset with a well - rounded clean - up of light and slightly sugary mouth feel is something new and different indeed .
A dusting of bitterness encompasses the whole maelstrom of flavor and seals nicely in what could almost be described as a beer - coated taste bud flavor bomb .
Smashing .
This is the very reason why I like trying new and varied beers from a boxed collection : something new every time .
I think I ’d add this to a meal of something of the gamier variety like venison , duck , or even a fishier fish .
Nice .
Rating : * * * *
Do n’t let a beet - red beer that ’s more amber than amber catch you unawares , this Wacko is on point .
ClearType Tuner is a pretty cool feature that I came to know about through an article on detector pro .
It is generally really helpful and a blessing in disguise to people like me who have eyesight problems .
It makes the text appear relatively clearer and thus reduces the strain on the eyes .
The text appears smoother and darker .
Infact you can sharpen it to the extent you want .
If for reasons you want the text to appear blurred , you can do so .
Reading lengthy pieces of material becomes easy with this technology .
In short , it tunes up your display pretty well .
Although the technology was meant for LCD displays , it may also improve the visual with CRT display .
Actually , ClearType plays with stationary pixels by turning its parts on and off .
However , CRT ( Cathode Ray Tube ) uses an electron gun to mobilize the electrons instead of keeping them at a particular position .
It is the 178th most popular configurator on Windows and also one of the top ten features of Windows 7 .
By default , ClearType is enabled and it is possible to further increase the legibility of the text that appears on your screen .
The following are sample texts to better compare the appearance of text with and without the tuner turned on .
Starting with Windows 7 , Microsoft has integrated the tuner utility to fine tune ClearType settings to your needs .
On previous versions of Windows , it was only possible by using PowerToys tools .
ClearType Tuner in Windows 7 is a new control panel component which uses various samples of ClearType , presented in the form of an eye - test , to make fine grained adjustments to the ClearType algorithms .
Each wizard page tunes a parameter such as monitor gamma , your sensitivity to color artifacts , and your preference for letter heaviness .
The steps to access and tune it are quite simple !
Step 1 : You can access the ClearType Text Tuner by any of the following ways :
Type CTTUNE in Start menu search and click on CTTUNE :
Through the directory address C : \Windows \System32 :
Or through Command Prompt : Type cttune .exe in command prompt :
Step 2 : The following wizard screen will appear :
You can enable or disable the tuner by clicking on the Turn on ClearType checkbox .
Click Next
Step 3 : Select the sample text block that suits you best and then click Next ( for the next four consecutive screens ) :
Step 4 : Click Finish .
You are done !
Read this article at E7 Blog to understand the complete engineering changes to ClearType technology in Windows 7 .
I just modified the settings of the tuner for my laptop .
I hope you find it as useful as i did 🙂

Wisconsin school board leaders are bristling over a proposed bill that would force teachers to include in curriculums a history of organized labor and collective bargaining .
“ The state ’s already required certain financial courses and civics in government , which I do n’t think is a bad thing , ” said Robert Roy , president of the Milton School District Board of Education .
“ But at some point , you have to draw the line because with everything they say we have to teach , something else has to come out of the curriculum . ”
Nevertheless , several Democratic lawmakers are pushing the bill .
“ It ’s important that the new generation knows the history of unions , ” said bill author Sen .
Dave Hansen , D - Green Bay .
“ This was the first state to introduce workers ’ compensation and unemployment insurance .
“ We teach about almost everything else , why would n’t we teach about this ? ”
Hansen said lawmakers tried many times without luck since 1995 to pass the labor bill .
In 2001 , Hansen led a charge for the bill only to watch it pass the Senate and die in the Assembly .
Now the role is reversed .
The Assembly passed the bill in April , and the Senate Committee on Education on Thursday held a public hearing on the proposal .
“ Nobody spoke against it , ” Hansen said .
But the Wisconsin Association of School Boards registered in opposition .
“ Teaching decisions should be left in the hands of those closest to the students , ” said John Ashley , WASB ’s executive director .
“ It ’s a very slippery slope when we let the Legislature start deciding what is best for us to teach . ”
There is sound reasoning behind the union bill because it prepares students for the working world , said Hansen , who said he is considering other school - related bills , such as one that would force Wisconsin schools to teach financial literacy .
Scott Vaughn , executive director of the Building and Construction Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin , said the history of unions should be a subject in classrooms .
“ It ’s been ignored , ” he said .
“ People coming into the unions should know that people died for what we have and that laws that are now all over the country were first passed here . ”
But Roy , who taught social studies at Portage High School before taking over as board president in Milton , said several schools already weave some unions into American or Wisconsin history courses .
“ If you ’re interested in it , then it ’s good knowledge to have and interesting to learn about , ” he said .
“ But I never had it in high school , and I think I ’ve done fine . ”
Hansen said the bill does not propose penalties for teachers who choose not to teach labor history .
“ Maybe that ’s something we ’ll do later on , ” he said .
“ At this point , we ’re just saying , ‘ At least present this to kids . ’ ”
Still , a recommendation is different from a mandate , Roy said .
“ ( Labor history ) is out there for people to learn about , ” he said .
“ But if you ’re going to tell me that making kids learn it makes them better citizens or better workers , well , I think that ’s questionable . ”
Governor Mark Sanford says “ God will make him better ” after he had an affair with an Argentinian mistress .
Apparently , God was missing when Sanford was secretly emailing the mistress , catching a flight to see her , and getting it on :
It ’s in the spirit of making good from bad that I am committing to you and the larger family of South Carolinians to use this experience to both trust God in his larger work of changing me , and from my end , to work to becoming a better and more effective leader … …
In this regard I think all that has transpired will be particularly relevant in the way I deal with the legislative body and other state leaders going forward .
Micah 6:8 asks us to do justice , love mercy , and to walk humbly , and as I begin these steps into the last 18 months of this administration , it will indeed be with a more contrite and humble spirit .
Maybe Sanford did n’t read enough of his Bible because Micah 6:13 , a few verses later , has God saying something very different :
Therefore , I have begun to destroy you , to ruin you because of your sins .
By the way , God has already responded to Sanford ’s piece :
“ At no point did I say that I was trying to make Mark Sanford a better person , ” the Almighty told reporters .
“ And the only time that bastard has prayed to Me was last month , when his exact words were , ‘ Please do n’t let Jenny find out where I really am . ' ”
There ’s no longer any need in PHP to create your own regular expressions to try to validate an email address ; simply use filter_var ( ) instead .
This is available from PHP 5.2.0 .
Update July 23rd 2010
As pointed out in a comment on this page , e.g. chris@example will validate even though it is not a regular domain .
However , the domain part of an email address does not actually need to contain a dot ( e.g. localhost ) .
In real uses you would normally want to ensure the domain part includes a dot , so I have written an updated post which adds a regular expression to check for this :
Validate email addresses with filter_var
The filter_var function accepts three parameters but for testing an email address only the first two are needed .
The first parameter is the data to filter , in this instance an email address , and the second the filter type , in this instance FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL .
filter_var function returns the filtered data or false if the filter fails .
Therefore a test can be done for a valid email address by checking to see if anything is returned like so :
if ( filter_var ( " chris@example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ) { // it 's valid so do something } else { // it 's not valid so do something else }
Here ’s some more examples :
// test good email address echo filter_var ( " chris@example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // test good email address echo filter_var ( " chris@a.b.c.example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // not allowed .
before @ echo filter_var ( " chris.@example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // not allowed .. in domain part echo filter_var ( " chris@example..com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // not allowed .
after @ echo filter_var ( " chris@.example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // not allowed double @ echo filter_var ( " chris@@example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // not allowed @ more than once anywhere echo filter_var ( " chris@exa@mple.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ; // must have @ echo filter_var ( " chris#example.com " , FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ? " goodn " : " badn " ;
And the output from the above :
good good bad bad bad bad bad bad
Checking for a valid domain
I ’ve been asked by a few people how to check if the domain is valid , as part of checking validity of an email address .
One way to do it is by doing an MX record lookup on the domain ( with a fallback to an A record lookup ) .
I would n’t do this myself , but have written a post about how to get a mail server ’s IP address with PHP to help people out should they want to .

he makes the eminently practical point that at the very least the leadership should be held to mustering its voting clout on cloture votes , requiring caucus members to toe the line on them .
They would still be free to vote their conscience in the final vote on a bill , but they should n't be allowed to aid the opposition in preventing a final vote from happening .

" I think that with Al Franken coming on board , you have effectively 60 Democrats in the caucus , 58 and two Independents .
I think the strategy should be to say , it does n't take 60 votes to pass a piece of legislation .
It takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster .
I think the strategy should be that every Democrat , no matter whether or not they ultimately end up voting for the final bill , is to say we are going to vote together to stop a Republican filibuster .
And if somebody who votes for that ends up saying , ' I 'm not gonna vote for this bill , it 's too radical , blah , blah , blah , that 's fine . ' " ( emphasis added )
I love this Sanders Rule .
It makes perfect sense .
This is the whole point of having 60 senators in your caucus .
I do n't need or want ideological rigidity on the Democratic side .
I believe in the Big Tent .
So , how people vote is up to them .
But getting these bills to the floor to get up or down votes is absolutely necessary .
This is part and parcel of being in the caucus .
Not just in healthcare , but all of the bills must have up or down votes ( but by far the most important thing right now is to include a public option in the healthcare bill that gets an up or down vote ) .
I know Democrats bend over backwards to accommodate the Republicans and appeal to bipartisanship .
Although the Republicans never , ever seem to reciprocate , that is all fine and dandy , as long as we get to vote on the legislative proposals .
They can have bipartisan proposals come up .
They can have progressive or conservative proposals come up .
But no matter what they should all get a vote , as long as there are sixty senators in the Democratic caucus .
If the Democrats do n't use their 60 seat majority to break filibusters , then they are absolutely complicit .
There are no excuses left .
It 's one thing to say you 're voting your conscience on a bill ( though a great majority of the time they are in fact voting their pocketbook by voting with the lobbyists ) , it 's another to say that you will join the Republicans in upholding a filibuster .
That is not acceptable .
Everyone who voted for a Democrat in the country should absolutely insist that they follow the Sanders Rule .
All bills must get up or down votes .
That 's the least they can do with the overwhelming mandate they have been given to get us real change .
If they squander this - with control of the White House , a huge majority in the House , a filibuster proof majority in the Senate and all of the national polls behind them - then they were lying .
They never intended to bring us change in the first place .
The lobbyists will have won .
And Obama 's presidency will be like all of the others .
A lot of bullshit promises and no change despite every conceivable advantage .
If they can't get it done under these circumstances , then they can never get it done - nor did they ever want to .
We 've been talking , of course , about the implications of the Democrats reaching , more or less , the magic 60 threshhold in the Senate .
The consensus is that thereany implication , considering the lack of cohesiveness of those 60 senators the 58 nominal Democrats and the two Independents who caucus with the Democrats .
Why , just look at those two Independents .
You 've got probably the most upright person in the Senate , Vermont 's Bernie Sanders , and perhsps the most lowdown , Connecticut 's Holy Joe Lieberman .
Both New Englanders , but it 's hard to think of much of anything else they have in common .
It turns out that Senator Sanders has been thinking along the lines of our friend Lane Hudson , whose thinking we passed on in one of our ponderings of the Democratic supermajority .
Beyond the importance of making sure that we make Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid aware of our hopes and expectations , The filibuster , which in all its configurations has always been understood as aresort , reserved for matters of do - or - die principle , has been transformed by the new Republican minority into a strategy ofresort .
Having no program of their own , except to screech " Hell no " at any proposal made by Democrats , they now threaten it routinely , indeed .
What they have wrought is a substantial transformation of the way the Senate does business , so that the most routine Senate business now requires 60 votes .
Our friend Cenk Uygur ( of the Young Turks ) wants everybody to know about " The Sanders Rule : All Bills Get Up or Down Votes . "
He first quotes the senator : and then comments :

Metasm is an LGPL ’ed assembly manipulation framework written in Ruby .
It is capable of following flow dependences along multiple paths , a feature called backtracking in metasm jargon and close to the notion of program slicing [ wikipedia.org ] .
Definition : a node j is flow - dependent on a node i if ( 1 ) a variable x is referenced at j , ( 2 ) x is defined at i and ( 3 ) there exists a path from i to j without intervening definitions of x. Source [ research.ibm.com ]
We are going to use the following ruby script to test the backtracker with different source programs , it takes as input a program ( sourcecode ) , a node ( labeled ‘ sliceme ’ ) and a variable ( eax ) and returns the flow - dependences of eax and in some cases , the actual values that eax will take .
require ' metasm ' include Metasm def sliceit ( asmsource , label , reg ) # encode the shellcode sc = Shellcode.assemble ( Ia32.new , asmsource ) dasm = sc.disassemble (0 ) # get the address of the label offset = sc.encoded.export[ label ] reg = reg.to_sym # backtrace log = [ ] dasm.backtrace( reg , offset , : log => log ) # return the trace log end sourcecode =
<< EOS ; asm program here EOS slice = sliceit ( sourcecode , ' sliceme ' , 'eax ' ) # slice est un tableau qui contient le log du backtrace slice .
each { |ev , * args| if ev == : di # decodedinstruction after = args [ 0 ] before = args [ 1 ] instr = args [ 2 ] puts " #{instr} [ # {before} -> # {after} ] " end # }
Let ’s take some simple code samples .
If there is a single execution path , metasm can compute the value contained in the variable , for instance :
mov eax , 42h inc eax sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 5 inc eax [ eax -> eax +1 ] 0 mov eax , 42h [ eax +1 -> 43 h ]
We can see that useless definitions of the variable are not taken into account :
mov eax , 0h mov eax , 42h inc eax sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 0 ah inc eax [ eax -> eax +1 ] 5 mov eax , 42h [ eax +1 -> 43 h ]
Definitions of other variables are also ignored ( if eax does not depend on them ) :
mov eax , 42h mov ebx , 0 sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 0 mov eax , 42h [ eax -> 42 h ]
But they are included if eax depends on them :
mov ebx , 1h mov eax , 42h add eax , ebx sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 0ah add eax , ebx [ eax -> eax+ebx ] 5 mov eax , 42h [ eax+ebx -> ebx+42h ] 0 mov ebx , 1 [ ebx+42h -> 43 h ]
If there are multiple acyclic paths , metasm will be able to compute the value of the sliced variable along each path , for instance :
mov eax , 42h cmp ebx , 0 jnz pouet dec eax jmp sliceme pouet : inc eax sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 0dh inc eax [ eax -> eax +1 ] 0 mov eax , 42h [ eax +1 -> 43h ] 0 ah dec eax [ eax -> eax - 1 ] 0 mov eax , 42h [ eax - 1 -> 41 h ]
Metasm states that at the end , eax will be either 41h or 43 h but it does n’t know which one .
It does n’t state it explicitly , but the value of eax is control - dependent on ebx .
Finally in the worst case scenario , if there are cyclic paths ( such as loops ) , metasm will go through each path once but will be unable to compute the value after the cycle .
Note that in the general case , this is undecidable .
mov eax , 0 entry : cmp ebx , 0 jnz sliceme dec ebx inc eax jmp entry sliceme : jmp eax -> metasm returns : 0 bh inc eax [ eax -> eax +1 ] 0 mov eax , entrypoint_0 [ eax -> 0 ]
Goldman Sachs ’ uncanny ability to make money during the recession has drawn the attention of a bipartisan group of House members who suggest the investment bank took taxpayer dollars and ratcheted up the risk in order to pay fat bonuses .
The congressional members , including Reps. Alan Grayson , ( D - Fla. ) , Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , Maxine Waters ( D - Calif . ) and Walter B. Jones ( R - NC ) , wrote a two - page letter yesterday asking the Federal Reserve to explain why it granted a special exemption allowing Goldman to take on more risk over the past few quarters .
“ The company and its employees have taken full advantage of its new government subsidies , and the retained ability to bet big , ” said the letter .
Goldman sought bank - holding company status late last year because the move would offer the financial institution easier access to taxpayer funds .
In exchange for that access , the firm would face more oversight from the Fed and stricter rules that would require it take less risk .
However , the Fed granted Goldman , along with Morgan Stanley , temporary exemptions that allowed them to take on the same risky bets an investment bank would have .
That risky stance helped Goldman post a second - quarter profit of $ 2.7 billion on revenues of $ 13.76 billion — a performance that could see every Goldman employee ’s bonus amount to $ 772,858 , the representatives ’ letter noted .
“ I think we should do our best to find out as much as we can about [ Goldman ] , especially with all the bailout money that ’s been spent , ” Paul told The Post .
Miss Jackson , who suffers from cerebral palsy , said : " It took a week of David being in the office for us to build up courage .
The first few steps were very nerve - racking but , once I got to my desk and got used to it , I felt totally comfortable .

先週のRubyKaigi2009 で「 Ruby で*1何か作りたい欲」を激しく刺激されたので、前から欲しかった物理エンジンをRubyに移植してみた。本気アプリならChipmunkのRubyバインディングでFAっぽいけど、ピュアRubyのもあればあったで嬉しいっしょ。
物理エンジンと言えば前にBox2DのAS3版をJSに移植したことがあるんだけど、Rubyの場合はJSみたいに単純に置換ってわけにいかないから難度高すぎ。30分ソース眺めて諦めた。で、もうちょっとシンプルそうなエンジンということで移植のターゲットとしてはAPE
( Actionscript Physics Engine ) を選択。ちなみに今回は置換じゃなくてちゃんと目視&手打で移植したっす。
移植してみて分かったのは、APEはホントにシンプル。Box2Dにあった便利機能とかぜんぜんないので、ちゃんとしたゲームを作るならどう考えてもBox2D移植するのが正解。ただ、いろいろ弄りながら物理エンジンを勉強しようと思ってる自分には、これはこれでいい選択だったかなと。
レンダラは入れ替え可能だけど、今のところShoes用の適当なのしか用意してない。触ってみたい人は観念してShoes2をインストールすればいいと思う。Shoes可愛いよShoes。いずれSDLとかTkキャンバスを使ったレンダラを追加するつもりなので、Shoesなんて入れてらんねーって人は一週間くらい待てばいいことあるかも。
ちなみに名前 のPongoはオランウータンのこと。検索したらRed Apeとも呼ばれてるらしいので赤いAPEってことで。最初は単純にAPEの頭にRをつけようかと思ったけどそれはさすがに、ねぇ・・・。

Numerous reports , campaigns , and studies have evaluated the health risks of aspartame .
You may not even be aware of it , because the campaigns are normally directed at the brand name under which it is sold .
Names like Equal and NutraSweet are more known as the artificial sweeteners that are often claimed to be a healthy alternative to sugar .
Now , Phoenix Organics , a beverage company based in New Zealand , is launching their own campaign to warn people of the dangers caused by aspartame .
Their campaign , " Think Before You Drink , " will see 20,000 bottles of their own Phoenix Organic Cola labeled with warnings , pointing to the potential health risks caused by aspartame .
In fact , Phoenix Organics has gone all out in their attempt to make people aware of the dangers of artificial sweeteners .
A whole section of their website is dedicated to " information on aspartame " , with links to websites concerning New Zealand itself , such as products in NZ that contain aspartame , and links and references to independent research on aspartame .
" Having read the Bressler Report of the FDA and other reports on the effects of aspartame , we had the living daylights scared out of all of us , " said company directors Stefan Lepionka and Marc Ellis .
" We cannot believe that the New Zealand government has declared this safe in the face of such evidence . "
Lepionka and Ellis are referring to the 1977 FDA 's Bressler Report [ 1 ] , a 76 page report containing the investigation of G. D. Searle 's laboratory in Skokie , Illinois in to aspartame .
Research on Aspartame Dangers
Since the release of the Bressler Report , aspartame has been the focus of several clinical studies , which have revealed possible connections between aspartame and illnesses such as headaches , migraines , brain tumors , brain lesions and lymphoma . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
In 1995 , FDA Epidemiology Branch Chief Thomas Wilcox concluded that reports showed aspartame to be the cause of 75 % of all reports of adverse reactions to substances in the food supply , between 1981 & 1995 [ 4 ] .
Additionally , a report by the Department of Health & Human Services in 1993 entitled ' Adverse Reactions Associated With Aspartame Consumption ' found a total of 92 different symptoms and health conditions reported after consuming this artificial sweetener [ 5 ] .
So when Phoenix Organics say that they have " ... contacted a number of groups that have been fighting to raise awareness of the health concerns surrounding aspartame … " and pledged that the company " … will do whatever it can to support the overall aim to have the government restrict and ban aspartame , " you tend to believe they 're going out all guns blazing .
My Thoughts on Artificial Sweeteners
It is really sad that the FDA would allow such poisons to be introduced into our food supply .
It makes me wonder if it is just another ploy to create more illness and prescribe people more pharmaceuticals .
As a matter of fact , aspartame is even contained in some pharmaceutical drugs .
I personally recommend people replace all artificial sweeteners such as aspartame , sucralose and saccharin with all natural sweeteners such as organic agave nectar or raw locally harvested honey .
Please read all labels and steer clear of these harmful substances .

A three - dimensional Sierpinski triangle is created recursively , by replacing each pyramid with five sub-pyramids .
To create one , we use Penumbra , which is a thin but idiomatic wrapper for OpenGL .
First , we create a pyramid .
( defn draw - pyramid [ ] ( material 0.8 0.2 0.2 1 ) ; ; draw the four sides ( draw - triangle - fan ( vertex 0 1 0 ) ( dotimes [ _ 5 ] ( rotate 90 0 1 0 ) ( normal 1 0.5 1 ) ( vertex 0.5 0 0.5 ) ) ) ;; draw the bottom ( draw - quads ( normal 0 - 1 0 ) ( dotimes [ _ 4 ] ( rotate - 90 0 1 0 ) ( vertex 0.5 0 0.5 ) ) ) )
The pyramid is defined in two parts : a fan of triangles around the tip , and a square at the bottom .
Both are defined by rotating iteratively around the central axis .
( draw - pyramid )
Next , we turn one pyramid into five smaller pyramids .
( defn subdivide [ display - list ] ( push - matrix ( scale 0.5 0.5 0.5 ) ;; draw the top sub-division ( push - matrix ( translate 0 1 0 ) ( call - display - list display - list ) ) ;; draw the bottom four sub-division ( dotimes [ _ 4 ] ( rotate 90 0 1 0 ) ( push - matrix ( translate 0.5 0 0.5 ) ( call - display - list display - list ) ) ) ) )
The subdivide function takes a display list as its argument , which is a cached list of OpenGL calls .
This list is called five times , first at the top and then four times around the central axis .
( subdivide ( get - display - list ( draw - pyramid ) ) )
We can call subdivide as many times as we like , but Clojure gives us a superior approach , by way of lazy sequences .
( defn sierpinski [ ] ( iterate # ( get - display - list ( subdivide % ) ) ( get - display - list ( draw - pyramid ) ) ) )

If you can't build your own click on the Cabinet Builders link for a list of builders who can custom craft speakers for you , at prices well below what you 'd have to pay for commercial speakers of lesser quality .
THE PRODUCT LINES :
SIMPLEXX
Simplexx is our easy to build line of bass reflex speakers , including home theater subwoofers , electric bass , keyboard , PA main , monitor and subwoofer cabs .
DR HORNS
DR Pro-Sound Folded
Horns utilize state - of - the - art folding geometries to achieve an unmatched combination of efficiency and bandwidth .
Compared to store - bought speakers , DR horns typically are 8 to 10 dB more sensitive per watt of input power .
That means you need less than half the cabinets and amp power than you 're using now to reach your audience .
No larger or heavier than the ported - box designs they replace , DRs run two - way with better fidelity than commercial three - way systems .
If you want to carry half as many cabinets and a third the electronics from gig to gig , and sound better than ever before , make the switch to DR horns .
TUBA SUBS
When it comes to earth - shaking gut - wrenching low - down bass there 's no substitute for a folded horn .
Tuba
Subs take advantage of proprietary folding topology to squeeze the most performance possible from small woofers , and that translates into huge bass from small cabinets , with high efficiency that keeps amp power requirements minimal .
In fact , a Tuba loaded with a single ten and 100 watts input will out power an eighteen in a traditional cabinet driven by 800 watts !
Yet the Tuba is no larger than the competition .
Want more bass from less space ?
Go Tuba Sub !
TITAN CONCERT SUBS
Tubas are made to go as low as possible .
Titans are made to go as loud as possible .
Which to choose ?
If you 're a DJ you 'll probably prefer the Tubas , they 'll handle the synthesized lows of today 's CDs .
For live - sound concert use the Titan is the sub of choice , optimized for higher output in the electric bass and kick - drum range .
And if you 're a bass player trying to compete with stacks , put a Titan 39 under your rig and grin when the guitar players cry for mercy !
OMNI SPEAKERS
Not everyone has the skills or tools required to build a DR horn .
Omni is a series of easy to build cabinets that are still fully horn - loaded , for performance that store bought speakers just can't touch .
XF GUITAR CABS
Commercial guitar cabs all have the same shortcoming : laser beam dispersion .
If you 're directly in front of the cab it 's too loud , while everywhere else it 's not loud enough .
But even Goldilocks would have loved the XF cab , because no matter where you are it always sounds just right !
WEDGEHORN
Commercial floor wedge monitors are just regular speakers in an angled box .
Wedgehorns are specifically designed to deliver what you want to hear through high stage levels : Vocals !
And , they do so with a wider dispersion angle than any commercial monitor .
HOME THEATER
You do n't have to be a pro to enjoy the best sound around .
Be it mains , center channel or subs , there 's a project for you too .
You can have sound from your home theatre that even the local movie house can't touch , and at a price you 'd have never thought possible .
CONSTRUCTION DEGREE of DIFFICULTY
Each catalog page shows the relative ease of construction , based on a scale of 1 to 10 , where 1 is a simple box that anyone can build , and 10 is for very skilled woodworkers only .
But do n't let a 9 rating scare you .
The plans are so detailed that even woodworking neophytes can build a DR horn , it just takes longer than a Simplexx .
EQUIVALENT RETAIL VALUE
Each project page lists an equivalent retail value , which is the minimum price you should expect to pay for a commercial cabinet of similar quality .
In most cases these values are quite conservative , since most of our projects have features that are not available commercially , at any price .

BUENOS AIRES —
It 's vacation time in the Northern Hemisphere as families pile into cars for a day at the beach .
But in South America , it 's winter , and this year that means swine flu .
Argentina 's health minister claims his country is currently the most affected on earth .
Visiting infectious disease specialist Alejandro Macias , who helped coordinate the response to the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico , calls it “ the epicenter of the world . ”
This is where most of the swine flu deaths are now happening , according to World Health Organization numbers .
With 137 official H1N1 deaths , the outbreak in Argentina has been the second deadliest of the pandemic , second only to the United States .
All of those deaths were registered in the past month , almost a third of them just this past weekend .
With the flu up north slowed by the summer but just moving into full swing down here , Argentina may very soon have lost more people to the disease than any country on earth .
" The countries of the Northern Hemisphere are looking at Argentina as a mirror , " Macias said in an interview with the second largest Argentine newspaper last week .
" The same scenario will be reflected next winter in the north , and we 've come here to learn . "
Canada , Australia and neighbor Chile have all reported several times as many cases of the infection .
But the death toll and the mortality rate have been drastically worse in Argentina than in any almost any other country , raising questions about this government 's handling of the outbreak .
About half of Argentina 's H1N1 deaths have been in and around the capital , Buenos Aires .
“ Paranoia ” is the word resident Natalia Mueller used to describe the atmosphere in the epicenter of the epicenter , as she accompanied a feeble , mask - wearing friend to a clinic .
Mueller was herself sick for a week , and she says that most of her co-workers at a popular Buenos Aires shopping mall fell ill too .
A few of them died .
Although life has largely gone on as normal , the fear has been palpable at certain times and places .
The financial district was eerily empty when the government declared a bank holiday last week , lengthening the Independence Day weekend .
It has also shut down all schools nationwide , doubling the the usual two - week winter vacation .
The mayor of Buenos Aires asked children to stay home , but did n't pass any prohibitions on large gatherings .
Many of the usual gathering places have closed by their own choice .
In the face of an 80 percent drop in ticket sales , the Argentine Association of Theatrical Businesses closed all the theaters in the country for 10 days .
A range of other social events have been individually cancelled , from tango balls to professional conferences to religious pilgrimages .
Economists warn of significant contraction this year due to the drop in business activity — except , of course , in the pharmaceutical sector , which has been selling out supplies of face masks and antiseptic hand gel .
But for the most part Argentine life has continued undaunted .
Buenos Aires is not the white - faced ghost town that some would imagine .
With the new holidays , many vacationing employees and schoolchildren took the opportunity to go shopping .
Some of the most popular retail districts of the city bustled as busily as ever , with nary a medical mask in sight .
The subway and the streets at rush hour are as packed as ever ; and the cafes are still busy with denizens tarrying over a coffee and the newspaper , which blares headlines of the mounting death toll .
And hospital visits do n't give a picture of pestilence either , although there have been scattered reports of overcrowding .
That seems only to be a problem at public hospitals , many of which have postponed non-urgent procedures to prioritize flu victims .
To bolster the availability of medical care , the government has installed mobile medical booths , at least 30 in the capital area .
Still , many accuse the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of failing to adequately confront the epidemic .
Critics say that the government has obfuscated statistics and downplayed the gravity of the situation in order to save face — a common complaint against this administration , and an especially pointed one during the recent election .
Many voters lined up for the polls on June 28 wearing face masks and standing the suggested meter apart ; some even defied the obligatory vote , preferring to stay home and healthy .
Graciela Ocana , who has now been replaced as health minister , quickly revealed that the president had ignored her advice to postpone the elections due to contagion concerns .
Criminal cases have now been brought into federal courts accusing the ruling party of “ propagating the illness and causing us to infect each other . ”
This is an ironic turn for a government that , when the pandemic first surfaced , had taken action that was too strong even for the WHO : cancelling all flights from Mexico .
Now it 's getting a taste of its own medicine , with Brazilian airlines cancelling flights and Brazil 's government issuing travel warnings , and neighbor Bolivia threatening to close the border .
Closed borders would pose a problem for Argentines crossing over into Chile and Uruguay to buy Tamiflu .
Distribution has been tightly controlled in Argentina , with the drug available only by prescription through the government .
Last week the government said it would start administering the drug to anyone showing H1N1 symptoms .
That should be made more feasible by large shipments imported this past weekend .
Argentina will also get a quarter of the nearly half a million doses donated worldwide by the United States .
Officials hope that those stocks will be enough to curb the mortality rate , provided the epidemic stays controlled .
Signs suggest it may have peaked with national health minister Juan Manzur claiming that doctor visits and hospitalizations are down in recent days .
But his provincial counterpart Claudio Zin warns that there could be a resurgence in Buenos Aires in the coming weeks without vigilance .
And even if the situation in Buenos Aires does n't get worse , it remains to be seen what will happen in other provinces , which often catch the second wave of outbreaks that start in the capital .

Austria 's Wurz has had mixed success in his Formula 1 career to date Former grand prix driver Alexander Wurz says he is considering a return to Formula 1 with new US F1 team in 2010 .
The Austrian retired from F1 at the end of 2007 but has had talks with US F1 boss Peter Windsor about a comeback .
" It could be an interesting task to help a new team , whether that 's only inside the car or outside the car , " Wurz told BBC Sport on Saturday .
Windsor said on Friday that he wanted one experienced driver and an American rising star for his team 's debut .
Indy Racing League front - runner Graham Rahal , the son of US racing legend and former Jaguar F1 team boss Bobby Rahal , has been linked with the other seat .
Wurz , who has driven in 69 grands prix but has raced in sportscars for the last two years , said he had discussed next year with Windsor at the German Grand Prix two weeks ago .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We had a chat and a coffee at the Nurburgring to see if we had common interests and ideas , " he said , " and we discussed what we can do together , but it is in the very early stages .
" We can't say much more than that about it .
It all depends how everything comes together . "
Also hinting at a possible senior management role , he added : " There can be lots of possibilities . "
The Austrian , however , would not be drawn on why he might change his mind about wanting to race in F1 again .
Windsor said : " Any new team coming into Formula 1 needs to look at drivers with experience .
" Alex Wurz could perhaps be able to operate at our rate of learning . "
Wurz last raced in F1 for Williams in 2007 , when he quit one race before the end of the season , saying he was retiring from F1 .
The 35 - year - old raced for Benetton from 1997 - 2000 before spending five years as a test driver for McLaren and then Williams , who gave him a race seat for 2007 .
Anybody who has got a lot of F1 mileage who is still hungry and is a good guy is the sort of person we would be looking at for one of our two cars
US F1 team boss Peter Windsor Windsor added : " Alex has got a great brain , he is a good guy and a good friend .
" We have said several times that we want to run Americans , but our first year in F1 will be critical in a number of ways especially in this compressed time zone .
" We do n't have a lot of time to do everything now because of all the turbulence and politics we have had this season , so there is maybe an argument for running an experienced driver in one car . "
Wurz was lined up to take on a role as team boss with the Austrian Superfund team but their application for one of three new team licences for the 2010 season was rejected .
The licences were granted to US F1 , Campos Racing and Manor - and all three teams have been linked with a succession of former F1 drivers .
Jacques Villeneuve - F1 world champion in 1997 - has voiced his interest in securing a drive for 2010 but former Williams team boss Windsor believes his team might not match Villeneuve 's expectations .
" Jacques is a former world champion and he comes in with that persona and that largesse and it could be that for a team that needs to grow at it's own organic rate Jacques would come in with his own rate of expectation and they might not match , " he said .
606 : DEBATE
" The rate at which you learn and grow really affects the way that team will perform over the next decade .
" If you look at BAR - Supertec , as they were when they started ( in 1999 ) , in the days of Jacques Villeneuve , you could argue that the team was running before they could walk .
" And I think that 's one of the reasons they did n't go on to achieve the success that they maybe should have with their resources .
" We want to walk then canter and then sprint and we want to do all those things in the right order .
" Anybody who has got a lot of F1 mileage who is still hungry and is a good guy is the sort of person we would be looking at for one of our two cars . "

From cookies to Parmesan cheese , a wealth of store - brand alternatives are available at your grocery store .
How can you tell when reaching down one shelf might be worth it ?
Check the ingredients and know the manufacturers .

Photo by Torben H .
The Street.com 's MainStreet blog points out that many national manufacturers also produce " private label " or store brand products for major grocery chains .
When it comes to aluminum foil , spices , and frozen vegetables , for instance , it might surprise you to know that Reynolds , McCormick , and Birds Eye , respectively , are churning out goods for the same stores they sell their name brand lines to .
The post also points out that some store brands have passed or exceeded national brand ratings in Consumer Reports tests , so keep on munching with confidence , fans of Kroger Mini-Wheats and Winn - Dixie Prestige Premium chocolate ice cream .

When should one shy away from store brands ?
When the product is more esoteric and noted to have a distinct flavor and recipe use .
In general , that means thinking twice if you 're looking for something marketed as " The Original X " or the " distinct flavor of X . "
If you 're particular about the tartness of A1 Steak Sauce or the exact flavor of Miracle Whip , generic options may not be right for you .
Store brands that emphasize value may contain cheaper ingredients , and even when national brands manufacture a different type of product to be sold as a store brand , they make it to the store 's own specifications , which could mean a change in ingredients , Consumer Reports says .
In other words , reading the ingredients list , sorted by concentrations , on both store and national brands can't hurt if you 're thinking about switching .
You 'll be tripped up occasionally by " natural flavors , " but one purchase should give you an idea of what can and can't be replicated at a local level .
What is your experience with switching to store brand food versions ?
Which name brand foods were you able to substitute with store brand ?
Which store brand foods just did n't cut it ?

Not all orgasms are created equal .
For instance , intercourse orgasms are known to trump masturbatory ones , as evidenced by the amount of dopamine and prolactin produced .
For men , sexual excitement produces higher sperm counts .
As I recount in BLONDES , men who felt jealous or threatened by the possibility of a cheating partner had higher sperm counts than men who did not .
The same is also true of male porn - watchers masturbating to a threesome .
When guys watched two men attending to one woman , they had higher sperm counts than when watching one - on - one sex .
Sperm competition is the reason , according to the notorious British biologists Baker & Bellis .
Men produce more copious , higher quality semen in situations in which those sperm might compete with rival sperm from other males .
And now there ’s more — speculation that beautiful women also inspire men to have better quality sperm .
Female beauty has been found to enhance male sperm quality in other species .
The latest evidence comes from a study led by Oxford biologist Charlie Cornwallis on Gallus gallus , a species of bird .
Cornwallis and his colleagues discovered that the comelier the chick — e.g. , plump with an elaborate comb — the better the quality her partner ’s sperm ( more motile , higher velocity , with a higher sperm count ) .
Interestingly , this was true of dominant males but not subordinate ones , who appeared to put everything they had into every copulation .
From Cornwallis ’ perspective , the most fit males invest their best loads in the most reproductively fit females .
No study has yet proven that the same is true in humans — it ’s not exactly ethical to recruit a guy to have sex with both a beauty and a plain Jane and then compare the aftermath .
A beauty bias that affects sperm count may be true only in a wildly polygamous species , which humans are not .
Even so , this theory applied to humans does n’t sound so controversial if you think about it — after all , sperm counts in men are associated with sexual excitement .
Beauty can spark frisson .
Even more exciting to ponder is how in practice an alpha male would make a larger reproductive investment in the most desirable mate .
How does a Hugh Hefner decide ?
And would n’t it be ironic if this were true ?
If you are found liable for a car accident , you may be responsible for reimbursing the victim(s ) for all expenses incurred due to your actions .
This may be true regardless of if you are entirely or partially at - fault .
Thus , it is imperative that you know how to protect your assets , as you ( like many defendants [… ]
The first time Dr. George Tiller was shot by an anti-abortion terrorist was also soon after the election of a pro-choice president .
P
The pattern is not reassuring .
P
That time , in 1993 , the Kansas doctor was wounded in the arms by Shelley Shannon of southern Oregon , still in prison for the shooting .
That attack was part of a wave of shootings and bombings from 1993 to 1998 -- including the murders of two doctors , two clinic workers , a security escort and a policeman -- following the election and re-election of a president supporting a right to abortion and security for clinics .
P
It 's enough to make you worry that Dr. Tiller 's murder Sunday wo n't be the last .
P
According to Heidi Beirich , director of research at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Birmingham , Ala. , which keeps track of domestic terrorism , it 's not even the first .
Beirich cites Richard Poplawski of Pittsburgh , who began stockpiling weapons and fearing that Obama would take them away , and in April allegedly killed three Pittsburgh policemen who came to ask about his arsenal .
P
" Domestic terrorism seems to be picking up , " says Beirich .
" It happened in the '90s , and it 's happening again . " P
When certain folks feel political trends running against them , they may move to more violent strategies .
Whatever the cable jabberers claim , this is n't about the particular kinds of abortions performed by Tiller -- many of the '90s casualties hardly fit that pattern -- it 's about people ready to brutally impose their will on other people 's political decisions .
P
" After the election in November , " says Vicki Saporta , president of the National Abortion Federation , a group of providers , " we sent our members an alert asking them to be on heightened alert .
We know from experience that electoral losses can stir anti-abortion forces . "
P
Recently , the Department of Homeland Security issued a report , " Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling a Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment , " warning of extremist hostility to the new administration and noting " Rightwing extremism .$ ?.$?. may include groups or individuals that are dedicated to a single issue , such as opposition to abortion or to immigration . "
P
The list might include groups such as the Army of God , whose Web site exults today , " The lives of innocent babies scheduled to be murdered by George Tiller are spared by the action of American hero Scott Roeder .
George Tiller the Babykiller reaped what he sowed and is now in eternal hell . "
P
Still , the Homeland Security report was blasted , partly for a mention that groups might seek to recruit militarily skilled veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan , partly because of charges that it smeared the administration 's political opponents .
Republican national chairman Michael Steele claimed the report attacked peaceful dissenters " as terrorists . "
P
To Heidi Beirich , the report " was n't doing anything but stating the obvious . "
P
But it seems more acceptable to be concerned about some kinds of terrorism than others .
P
This is not part of a debate about abortion , as much as relatively mainstream voices denounced Tiller as a " killer " and a " Nazi , " and then piously professed their dismay at his murder .
This is about using extreme violence to create fear and force people to behave the way you want them to .
P
That strategy has an obvious definition .
P
This may be why Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue , complains , " I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller 's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions . "
P
Especially actions .
P
The overwhelming bulk of anti-abortion activity , of course , has nothing to do with violence or intimidation .
But when political trends run against them , parts of the fringe tend to turn to bloody reprisal .
P
And it 's at least important to call that what it is .
P
" As long as you have a terrorist who is willing to walk into a church and kill one person , as long as that element is in society , this is the risk we take , " said Dr. George Carhart , who worked with Dr. Tiller , after Tiller 's murder .
" You can't live your life based on fear .
You have to live by your principles . "
P
Or you can live by terrorism .

People walk past a Wal - Mart sign in Rogers , Arkansas June 4 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores
Inc , the world ’s largest retailer , said on Tuesday that it supports President Barack Obama ’s push to require large employers to offer health insurance to workers .
“ We are for an employer mandate which is fair and broad in its coverage , ” stated a letter addressed to Obama and signed by Mike Duke , the chief executive of Wal - Mart ; Andy Stern , the president of Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) and John Podesta , the CEO of the Center for American Progress .
Wal - Mart ’s public statement of support for employer mandated coverage comes as Obama pushes for an overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system .
He has made a healthcare plan that reins in costs and covers most of the roughly 46 million uninsured Americans one of his top priorities .
While the president has left much of the details of health reform to Congress , he has told U.S. lawmakers he is open to requiring larger companies to provide coverage for employees but exempting smaller businesses .
In recent years , Wal - Mart , the nation ’s largest private employer , has come under fire by labor - backed critic groups that accused it of mistreating employees and not offering adequate healthcare coverage .
Wal - Mart has worked to counter critics by promoting its healthcare initiatives , such as its $ 4 generic drug program .
In 2007 , it also joined with the SEIU , which has more than 1 million members , in calling for universal health - care coverage for all Americans by 2012 .
Wal - Mart said it supports an employer mandate that covers as many businesses as possible , as well as part - time and full - time employees .
The requirement would ultimately save companies money , it added .
“ This choice will require employers to consider the trade - off of agreeing to a coverage mandate and additional taxes versus the promise of reduced health care cost increases , ” it said .
It also said health care reform legislation should include provisions that reduce health costs , and that the retailer would support legislation that would put a public healthcare plan in place should private health insurers fail to meet price and competition targets , also known as a “ trigger ” provision .

Exploding drops produce miniature showers .
In every drop of rain , a shower .
Emmanuel Villermaux
A single drop of water can produce a shower of droplets that has all the hallmarks of rainfall , an elegant model by researchers in France suggests .
Scientists had previously thought that the pattern of rainfall seen at ground level was created by drops of rain colliding as they fell .
Fluid dynamicist Emmanuel Villermaux of Aix -Marseille University and graduate student Benjamin Bossa filmed small drops of water dripping from a tap to see what happened to the drops as they fell .
The air resistance on an accelerating drop increases until it exceeds the cohesive forces that keep it together — and the drop bursts into a shower of droplets ( see video ) .
But to see that , Villermaux says , " the experiment would need a height of typically 10 metres — that is high for a standard lab " .
So he and Bossa used jets of air blowing upwards to increase the air resistance drops experienced as they fell .
This meant that the drops fragmented within a shorter distance .
Researchers knew that in still air , a drop initially flattens into a pancake , then deforms into an upturned bowl - shape before bursting into droplets .
Villermaux and Bossa used these shape changes together with their observations to connect the bursting of a single drop to the distribution of raindrop sizes in showers .
Their model , published in Nature Physics , shows that the explosion of a drop into droplets is enough to explain the distribution1 .
Lessons from history
Villermaux 's work on rain was inspired by Wilson Bentley2 , a farmer from Vermont .
More than 100 years ago , Bentley took plates covered with a layer of flour , and left these out in the rain for a brief period .
He measured the damp patches of flour and , from this , documented the number and sizes of raindrops .
" He had no fast camera as we have , but he was clever , " says Villermaux .
" He was the first to notice that within a given rain , the question is not : what is the size of a raindrop ?
The question is : why is there a distribution ? "
The distribution is closely connected to the intensity of the rainfall .
Measurements taken more than 60 years ago by Stewart Marshall and Walter Palmer3 of McGill University in Montreal , Canada , indicated that drop sizes are more broadly distributed in heavy storms than in fine mists .
Villermaux and Bossa reproduced the Marshall–Palmer distribution in their study to answer Bentley 's question .
ADVERTISEMENT
The answer was simpler than scientists had thought : the mechanism behind the size distribution of droplets could be accounted for just by considering the dynamics of single drops falling through air .
The time it takes for a drop to fall from beneath a cloud and spray into droplets is typically shorter than the time it would take for two individual drops to collide within a cloud .
Fluid - dynamics expert Jens Eggers of the University of Bristol , UK , says , " I was expecting things to get complicated , with lots of empirical relationships thrown together .
Instead , based on a few physical ideas , the authors manage to explain a beautiful empirical relationship : the mean drop size is related to the intensity of the rain in a simple and universal way . "
" This work certainly is refreshing , " agrees Yangang Liu of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York .
" However , much remains to be explored .
For example , a major portion of surface rainfall — hence surface - observed raindrop size distributions — arises from melting of snowflakes . "
How , he asks , can Villermaux and Bossa 's theory be reconciled with this type of rainfall ?

I ’m watching the Tour de France again .
It ’s a particularly interesting year because Lance Armstrong just unretired to rejoin the Tour .
I ’m not watching it live , though — I ’m recording everything with the DVR so I can watch it at my leisure .
This is particularly important , considering that I can run it in the background while I ’m working during the week , but on weekends I ’m often not really in a position to watch the thing because I ’m doing things that require leaving home a lot of the time .
Today , I just finished getting caught up with yesterday ’s third stage , having watched the first and second stages from the preceding weekend .
Imagine my surprise when I rewound a little bit to catch something interesting that one of the announcers said , and saw the words “ Holy @# % * ! ” where it should have said “ Tour de France ” .
By the way , the entire Team Astana — the team of which Armstrong is a member this year — was in a breakaway from the peloton yesterday , and finished 39 seconds ahead of the peloton .
That moved Lance Armstrong from 10th place , secured during the time trial on Saturday , up to 3rd place overall .
I do n’t know if Armstrong is going to win , because of course that will depend quite a lot on whether he effectively becomes the Astana team “ leader ” and gets the full support of the team .
If someone else is their “ leader ” through to the end of the Tour , I expect Armstrong to put all his effort into helping that guy win instead .
All told , I fully expect Astana to own the top spot at the end of the 2009 Tour , and maybe more than one podium position at the end .
Anyone else rejoining the Tour after four years of retirement would probably be in about 50th place right now , at best .
Armstrong is proving , once again , that he ’s definitely one of the most impressive professional cyclists of all time .
Addendum :
Apparently , Holy @# %*!
is the name of a television show that was supposed to come on after the Tour stage aired , but since the live broadcast of the Tour ran long it overran the beginning of the Holy @# % *!
show .
Comcast just did n’t modify the notification of the show ’s name on the recording when Holy @# % *! was preëmpted .
I thought of the idea that it might be the name of another show , but then figured that was unlikely , since I ’m pretty sure the FCC would object to the obvious pronunciation of that ( which would probably be “ Holy shit ! ” ) .
It turns out I should n’t have discarded that notion so quickly .
Now , I ’m curious how they pronounce it in promotional spots .
Capable of 30 minutes of flight at around 60 miles per hour , the Martin Jetpack can apparently go as high as 8,000 feet in the air .
Naturally , its creator has equipped the device with an integrated ballistic parachute , just in case something goes wrong with its engine while you ’re flying around .
You certainly would n’t want that machine to stop working on you while you look like a minuscule dot to people on the ground .

When you think about landscape photography , you might immediately think of the wide angle zoom lens , which is great for capturing those expansive landscapes and “ taking it all in . ”
But , a telephoto zoom lens can also be helpful when photographing landscapes .
To understand why , it ’s important to know what determines perspective and how perspective can help convey a particular feeling in a photograph .
What determines perspective ?
As Ansel Adams repeats so often in his wonderful book , The Camera : “ perspective is a function of camera - to - subject distance . ”
There ’s a common misconception that perspective is determined by focal length , but in reality , the only thing that determines perspective is where you put the camera .
There are at least two rules of perspective that you should be familiar with :
the closer you get to a subject , the larger it will appear on the image frame ( yeah , this one ’s obvious ) as you move closer to your scene , the closest objects will increase in size faster than the distant objects ( not so obvious )
The second rule is the one we often forget , and it ’s best illustrated with an example , so take a look at this photo I took in the Eastern Sierra of California :
In this photo , I was standing about 100 ft ( 30 m ) from those boulders in the foreground .
As a result , the dominant object in this shot is the mountain in the background , which stood miles away from the boulders .
Now , look what happens when I move just 50 ft ( 15 m ) closer to those boulders :
All of a sudden , the mountains in the background do n’t look so mighty , and now those boulders in the foreground are the dominant objects .
This photo has a drastically different feeling than the previous one .
The perspective you choose for a landscape will depend on the feeling you ’re trying to convey .
Personally , in this case I prefer the first photo , because as I stood there in front of the scene , I felt like the mountain was in charge : it had an overpowering effect on me .
So , I decided to give it an overpowering effect in the final image .
Another lesson to learn here : you probably noticed how different the lighting conditions are between the two photos above .
The first shot was taken about 15 minutes before sunrise and the second shot was about 15 minutes after sunrise .
Lighting conditions can change in milliseconds , so make sure you ’re there for the entire show and be prepared to capture that light at any moment !
So , why do you need a telephoto zoom lens ?
Since perspective is determined solely by where you put the camera , you ’ll sometimes find that the most pleasing perspective is viewed from a great distance .
So , to fill the frame with this perspective , you ’ll need to zoom in to it with a longer focal length .
For example , the first photo above was taken at 70 mm ( on a 1.6 x crop factor camera ) .
I could have shot it at 40 mm , but I would n’t have filled the frame : I would have inadvertently captured many of the surrounding elements of the scene .
The second shot was taken at 40 mm , and this shorter focal length was necessary because I was much closer to those boulders in the foreground .
So , the lesson here is that carrying a wide range of focal lengths allows you to capture a wide range of perspectives .
What ’s the best telephoto zoom lens for landscape photography ?
This is definitely debatable , but most photographers would recommend the 70 - 200 mm range ( available from most camera manufacturers ) .
Personally , I use Canon ’s 70 - 200 mm F/4L and it is easily my favorite lens ( it ’s great for wildflowers too ! ) .
It ’s good unemployment , if you can get it .
Rick Wagoner , the former General Motors chairman and chief executive who was unseated as part of the automaker ’s restructuring , will receive millions of dollars in severance pay , a lifetime salary and other lucrative benefits , according to public documents filed Tuesday .
Wagoner ’s package draws fresh attention to the thorny issue of executive compensation at companies receiving taxpayer aid .
Under terms of his severance , detailed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission , he will receive $ 8.2 million over the next five years once his retirement is effective Aug .

Wagoner will also receive a payment “ in the annual amount of $ 74,030 for his lifetime ” the filing said .
The automaker will still cover him under a liability insurance policy , and he ’ll receive a life insurance policy currently valued at $ 2.6 million .
The total value of the package is significantly lower than what he would have received had he retired prior to the bailout .
Under Wagoner ’s previous employment contract , he would have been eligible for nearly $ 23 million in payments in addition to a lifelong annual payment , thanks to his 32 years of service at the company .

But a condition of the original round of federal funding GM received in December forced Wagoner to take a symbolic $ 1 salary in 2009 , compared with $ 2.1 million last year .
The automaker worked out a new severance agreement with Wagoner this month , according to the filings .
A Duke and Harvard graduate , Wagoner , 56 , spent nearly his entire career at GM , rising steadily through the ranks before taking the chief executive job in 2000 .
During his tenure atop the company , GM was supplanted by Toyota Motor Corp .
as the world ’s highest - volume automaker , saw its stock value fall more than 95 % and reported net losses of more than $ 85 billion in the last four years .
It was Wagoner , along with his counterparts at Chrysler Group and Ford Motor Co. , who went to Washington twice late last year , including once in a corporate jet , to request emergency aid for the U.S. auto industry , which was finally granted by the Bush administration in December .

But under the supervision of President Obama ’s auto task force , Wagoner finally took the fall in March , just days before the administration said that the restructuring plan the automaker submitted was not up to snuff .
He left a company with an essentially hopeless balance sheet , one that ultimately gave it no choice to but file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , which it did in June .
His top lieutenant , Fritz Henderson , immediately took the CEO job , although he did not become chairman .
Henderson had taken a 30 % pay cut for 2009 as part of the bailout .
But when he became chief executive , he was not required to take just $ 1 in salary .
Instead , his salary for this year remains just shy of $ 1.3 million .

Through the bankruptcy process , GM shed four brands , two - thirds of its debt , thousands of workers and several plants , all as part of its plans to cut costs and return to profitability in the next few years .
The company has borrowed $ 50 billion from taxpayers .
Last week , GM emerged from bankruptcy as a new privately held enterprise , formally called General Motors Co. , which is 60.8 % owned by the federal government .
Shares in the old entity , General Motors Corp. , ceased trading Friday .

Qantas has put the kybosh on online activist group GetUp 's latest anti-censorship campaign , refusing to run the " Censordyne " ad on its flights .
Simon Sheikh , chief executive of GetUp , said the group had planned to run the parody ad on all Qantas domestic flights into Canberra next month to ensure it was seen by politicians and their staff members around the first sitting week of Parliament .
But Qantas refused to run the ad , which lampoons the Government 's forthcoming internet filtering scheme , saying it had a long - standing policy not to run " political advertising " .
Meanwhile , GlaxoSmithKline , which owns the Sensodyne brand , on which the parody campaign is based , said it was considering legal action against GetUp .
The Roman historian Livy famously described the terminal plight of the late Roman Republic : " Nec vitia nostra nec remedia pati possumus " ( " We can bear neither our shortcomings nor the remedies for them " ) .
As I reread this phrase in Christian Meier 's biography of Julius Caesar this past weekend , I could n't help thinking of America 's current fiscal profligacy -- which has been growing for years at an ever - accelerating rate .
Of course , since last fall 's financial / economic crisis , the rate of profligacy has become supercharged .
Like the Roman Republic 's lament , we think we can't survive without deficit spending -- but we soon wo n't be able to survive with deficit spending , either .
In 2012 , federal debt will be more than $ 15 trillion .
Annual interest probably will be between $ 1 trillion and $ 1.7 trillion -- depending on whether long bonds remain at about 3.5 percent or go to recent historic rates ( 6 to 7 percent ) .
Deficits will average about $ 1 trillion a year -- $ 22 trillion by 2019 .
Yearly interest payments then will be more than $ 2 trillion .
That 's the good news .
That assumes the world will continue to buy our Treasury notes at plausible rates .
We had a slight foretaste of the future last week , when 10 - year U.S. Treasury bond yields shot up 60 basis points on soft demand and a Standard & Poor 's warning of a possible ratings downgrade of British bonds .
The bond market may well rebel ultimately against our government 's excessive borrowing and spending ( insufficiently supported by adequate national economic strength ) .
The " good news " of only $ 22 trillion in debt supported by purchasable bonds also assumes that our economy will recover this year and that we then will have continued steady economic growth .
Of course , the more the government borrows the less will be available for the private sector ( the part of the economy that produces things ) .
And the less available borrowing there is for investment and consumption in the economy the slower the economy will grow -- if it grows at all .
But the not - so - good news on top of this astounding and growing indebtedness is that we will have to borrow even vastly more than the current budgets propose .
Starting in 2017 ( just eight years from now ) , the Medicare trust fund will be depleted .
We then will begin to experience a Medicare revenue shortfall that ultimately will total between $ 35 trillion and $ 40 trillion during the following 60 years .
Social Security 's depletion will begin 20 years later and will have a shortfall of a little less than $ 10 trillion during the same period .
Oh , and the current budget projects that defense spending will decrease as a percentage of the federal budget .
While the overall budget is slated to grow 75 percent during the next decade , defense is to grow just 17 percent .
Only imminent and eternal peace would permit such low defense expenditures .
The administration 's health plans also will add a currently unfunded $ 1.5 trillion per decade .
Not only does continued , increased government borrowing ever more sap our economy but also , as the baby boomers retire , we will move from the recent statistic of four workers for each retiree to two workers for each retiree .
That means a weaker economy , as this smaller work force will not produce enough to support all of government 's costs -- even with massive and persistent tax increases .
And if , as seems possible , sometime in the next decade the world resists lending our government sufficient money ( because our economy will be too small to produce enough to pay the ever - growing interest on the debt ) , then we finally will be forced to make choices of what to buy and what to forgo .
Maybe only subsidized pain pills rather than medical treatment for old people ?
Only 50 percent payment of Social Security benefits ?
Default on federal debt payments ?
Or what the Chinese already are worried about : monetizing the debt , leading to hyperinflation ?
But the Roman Republic 's experience hints at an even more profound danger .
The political tasks flowing from the growing demands of the republic 's empire were of a magnitude and type that could not be managed by its form of government .
However , the Roman Republic was prepared neither to give up its growing empire nor to modify its government to deal with such challenges .
Similarly , for the United States today , we are not prepared to forgo what all this soon - to - be- unavailable deficit spending can buy us ( health care , bank bailouts , defense spending , food stamps , etc. ) .
Nor can our governments ( and the publics who elect them ) stop the spending .
In Rome , eventually a contradiction arose between Romans ' concern for the tasks that needed to be performed and their concern for their form of government .
The contradiction was resolved and the problems solved at the price of their republic : Came Gaius Julius Caesar .
Surely ( presumably ? ) , for the next decade , the United States will bungle onward with both our form of government and our deficit spending .
But sometime soon after 2017 , when Medicare 's trust fund will begin to be depleted ( or earlier , if the world stops buying our bonds ) , the shocking reality of being forced to do without borrowing will shape -- and probably misshape -- both our way of life and our form of governance .
Online Gaming regulation solution
WebPicID verifies the identity of online customers .
Identity theft losses are eliminated .
Organizations using WebPicID are compliant with KYC and AML regulations .
Allow any online gaming site to apply for a federal licence in every country that it wants to operate .
They must have a bank account in the country to hold funds belonging to players .
They pay income tax based on the revenue from revenue generated for that country ?s citizens .
They must provide a list of the beneficial owners of the gaming site .
Update this list within 1 week any time changes are made
They must provide a list of the directors of the corporation that owns the gaming site .
Update this list within 1 week any time changes are made
A list of the websites the organization operates .
There is a fee per website and a licence for each website .
All payments purchasing chips or casino credits are subject to a luxury tax .
The tax rate % can be decided by the government .
Historically ; individuals who gamble online will easily pay a 5 % currency exchange fee for chips .
A 5 % luxury surcharge tax would be taken in stride .
Divide the luxury tax between the provinces and the states that sign on to the online gaming act agreement as follows
50 % to the federal government
15 % to all of the states and provinces equally not on a per capita basis
If you have 50 states each state get 1/50th or 10 provinces and 3 territories then they each get 1/13 of the revenue .
15 % to the states and provinces and territories that sign the online gaming act agreement for each resident that gambles .
10 % to the department that regulates and over sees the gaming industry .
10 % to the country of foreign nationals that agree to a reciprocal agreement with the federal government .
If the country of the foreign national is not a participant they the funds are held by the federal government and disbursed annually internally to the federal and state or provincial governments .
The process for identifying players
VISA and MasterCard credit cards can be used by anyone one with the card .
For AML purposes the online casino must verify the identity of the individual making a purchase every time .
Yes this will slow don the process .
It will not lose any customers that the casino wants and all casinos must be compliant .
Anyone can get a credit card ; the basic or primary card holder just adds a name for a supplementary card holder .
This person does not need to exist and can be a pet in some cases .
ID is not shown to the credit card company when the person applies for the card .
This is the easiest way to launder money .
In Canada credit cards are exempt from FINTRAC reporting and identification guidelines .
In other countries there are no guidelines about identifying credit card users .
The idea is to avoid the embarrassment of a 14 year old wining a $ 1 million dollar online poker tournament .
The customer must prove their identity every time the make a purchase .

Who does n’t love a little friendly competition ?
The National Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) this month launched Smarter Cities , a multimedia Web site and interactive mapping tool that shows how U.S. cities stack up against each other across several indicators of “ environmental stewardship and sustainable growth , ” which are visually displayed on a CityGrid .
As a new media resource , smartercities.org [ looks like they have n’t quite switched domains , yet ] is a destination site for all who have a stake in their city ’s future — from students to policy makers and city planners , from business leaders to community groups and urban dwellers — to learn about best practices and initiatives , share ideas and innovative solutions , and post news , events and opportunities .
For now , Seattle comes out on top across all categories ( i.e. air quality , energy production and conservation , green buildings , etc . )
But when you drill down to specific categories , the rankings start to shift .
San Jose has the highest standard of living .
Portland has the most green space .
And San Francisco has the best transportation .
You can also view rankings for “ medium ” and “ small ” cities , if huge metropolises are n’t your thing .
The site allows people to sign up as a “ Citizen Reporter ” on sustainable urban issues for the OnEarth.org network of blogs .
Kaid Benfield , director for NRDC ’s Smart Growth Program , is a main contributor .
There are also photo galleries , “ city IQ ” quizzes that test you on things like urban sprawl and renewable energy , and directories of where to find “ smart ” resources , like local food products and solar panel installers .
What we need , as Bill Clinton aptly pointed out recently , is more cheerleading and less fear - mongering .
We elected Mr. Obama to be National Spirit Leader , not National Scary Storyteller .
If Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner , his Treasury Secretary , and Mr. Volcker , his well - respected advisor , and some real superstars like Warren Buffett and Jack Welch all came out and said , " The recession will end within 12 months .
We are sure of it , " the recession WOULD end within 12 months .
Can it be that as recently as 2006 , financial firms accounted for almost one - third of all the corporate profits in the United States ?
Or that money was so free - flowing that a single bat mitzvah party could be estimated to cost $ 10 million ?
That era is gone with the wind .
Now we face a severe recession , frightening jumps in unemployment , a breathtaking collapse of equity and real estate prices .
Now we face a major discontinuity with what has gone before — a real , grinding , 3 a.m. fear , replete with nightmares of bread lines .
The executive of an important company has immense responsibilities .
His or her time is precious .
To waste that time in an airport security line or dealing with flight delays is , quite frankly , a sin against the stockholders .
Flying on a private plane is not a decadent act -- it is just a way to move a very valuable asset around to maximize its productivity .
To keep executives from using these planes is as foolish as not allowing them to use cell phones or computers .
And I certainly never see the president , his cabinet members , or key members of Congress flying commercial jets .
Yes , I used the word " God . "
Pretend that it means " Going Out for Dinner , " which also may as well not exist these days .
I must admit that in this instance , the expression has a certain ring to it .
Dear GOD that man is an idiot .
Dear GOD
I did n't need to read that when I 'm trying to suppress my nacho / buttered popcorn habit .
Dear God , Ben Stein is an idiot !
First he goes on CBS to blame " Mr. Obama " ( it 's President Obama , just say it once ) for scaring us into wrecking the economy , because we 're not buying stock ( I am ) , and then he 's writing in the New York Times that he 's so scared because the barfing economy is all the fault of short sellers .
Geez , bread lines .
Way to inspire confidence , Ben .
His solution ?
End mark - to - market accounting , because short sellers selling securities as the securities plunge are driving securities down .
Yeah .
They 're making money hand over fist [ all five of them ] dumping collapsing securities , whose value was obviously inflated if they 're continuing to fall .
Right .
And if people would just stop wearing parachutes , no airplanes would ever crash .
They 're driving the planes down .
* Briefly leans forward into hand *
Okay , I 'm not knowledgeable enough to take on his suggestion to bring back the " uptick " rule because I do n't know much about it , and as for credit - default swaps - hell , I 'm just a civilian .
I 'm not into that level of investment yet , and I do n't think I 'd go for a scheme like that .
I do n't think I 'd ever go for a scheme like short selling .
But , MY GOD , what an imbecile !
I 'm beginning to think that there 's another reason , other than cowardice and belated embarrassment for his appearance in a snake - handler movie , why he cancelled his commencement address at the University of Vermont .
He was asked , after all , if he would confine his remarks to his so - called expertise : economics .
It sounds like his ability to articulate coherently any position in his own alleged field is severely compromised .
Oh .
And did I mention that a few weeks ago Stein made a rambling argument in favor of automaker CEOs hopping around the planet in private planes ?
( Can Al Gore be forgiven now ? )
Well , apparently no forgiveness for Al Gore - not from someone who expects the President of the United States to fly a commercial airliner ( and probably without a parachute to boot ) .
Idiot !
Are there any restaurants around here that serve late - night nachos ?
How about a $ 10 million bat mitzvah in Highland Park ?
A final word re stocks :
Do what you have to do , but save .
I 'm still buying stock , but I diversified my portfolio and may do so again .
I 've been hit hard , but I did n't expect to use this money any time soon , anyway .
I 'm sticking to my previous course , because I do n't see the disadvantage in buying stock on the way down when , eventually , the market will go back up .
By the time you 've figured out where the bottom is stocks will have risen to at least the point they were when you stopped buying them , anyway - or even higher - and you wo n't have as many shares as you could have .
This is not financial advice , just how I 'm approaching things .

A whole lot of assumptions are being made in this thread .
For a start , natural selection is about survival of the species and one assumption being made is that high IQ is going to be better for this .
I think Douglas Adams made amusing comments about this in the " hitchhikers guide to the galaxy " when all the " useless people " were banished to another planet with a disasterous outcome .
IQ tests are a measure of our ability to do IQ tests .
As has been shown , and acknowledged in some comments above , IQ is not wholly governed ( as was once believed by eminent psycholgists ) by genetics but can be changed by quite a large extent by environment and education .
There has been much work on how to correlate simple tests ( like IQ tests ) with success in life , but I wonder to what extent we weight these tests with what we perceive as important today .
I can think quite a few people who excel in their field of interest but are quite hopeless outside it and , in contrast , I can think of quite a few others who are generally very sensible and reliable but who do not have any outstanding talent .
Both groups undoubtedly have a fairly wide IQ distribution and both groups are valuable and necessary in a working society .
It may be interesting to think how a society 's demographics may be affected by a higher birthrate by sections of a community , but in discussing such issues it is worthwhile to try to step back and see these discussions from an " outside " perspective .
Here are a bunch of reasonably high - IQ people discussing how their view of the future will change for the worse if nothing is done to give them a breeding advantage over the " lesser beings " .
How similar is this to the ideas of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which led to the ideas of eugenics and the resulting genocidal consequences ?
As mudd1 says , we are probably approaching an era where we will be able to manipulate the genetic make - up of our offspring and that it will likely be yet another Pandora 's box full of enabling , scientific advancement but without any ethical guidelines to go with it .
I would not be confident that this will be of general advancement to the human race , at least not without setbacks , but I would agree it is likely to happen .
It may be a measure of the quality of our society in how well such advances are handled .
If such capability is limited and distibuted fairly we may have some chance of allowing more social interchange and reducing the problems resulting from class differentials .
If it is something restricted in availability to those who can afford it , we are in danger of exacerbating problems and creating a more divergent social structure .
With all the talk of free agency in the last month I started to remember some of my favorite former Cavs .
Awhile back our friend Zoner over at Pippen Ain’t Easy decided to do an All Ex-Bulls Team post that I really enjoyed .
So now I ’m taking a crack at it for our ( formerly ) beloved Cavaliers .
DeSagana Diop -C
DeSagana was one of four High School players that declared for the NBA draft in 2001 and was selected 8th overall by the Cavs .
Sadly , like most of Clevelands draft picks , Diop never lived up to the hype .
In four seasons averaged 1.6 ppg , 2.6 rpg , and 0.8 bpg while he averaged 10.8 minutes per game .
After spending 4 years with the Cavs , Diop moved on and signed with Dallas and finished last year in Charlotte .
Carlos Boozer - PF
Being the Duke fan that I am , I loved it when Cleveland made a steal when they selected Carlos Boozer in the second round of the 2002 NBA Draft .
Boozer averaged 10.0 ppg and 7.5 rpg during his rookie year and followed it up by 15.5 ppg and 11.4 rpg in 2003 .
After the 2003 - 2004 season the Cavaliers were able to retain Boozer for another year at $ 695,000 but decided to release him after the Cavaliers received a verbal agreement from Boozer that he would resign for 6 yrs and $ 39 Million .
However , Boozer decided to sign with Utah for 6 yrs and $ 70 Million .
Even though Boozer screwed us over in the long run and possibly cost the Cavaliers an NBA Championship , he was a great player and was loved by many fans .
Jason Kapono-SF
Losing Kapono is one of those moves that have bitten Cleveland in the ass .
Although Kapono only spent one year in Cleveland he led the Cavaliers in three point field goal percentage .
Since leaving Cleveland , Kapono has become the most accurate three point shooter in NBA history .
A NBA All - Star Weekend Three Point Shootout winner , Kapono is tied with Steve Kerr for Career 3pt percentage at .454 .
Larry Hughes-SG
In 2005 , Cleveland signed Larry Hughes to a 5 year / $ 70 Million contract .
Cleveland always had high hopes for Hughes , but injuries plagued Hughes for most of his stay in Cleveland .
In the 2006 - 2007 season Larry Hughes helped LeBron James lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history .
Since leaving Cleveland , Hughes has made stops in Chicago and New York .
Andre Miller-PG
Andre Miller was selected to the All - Rookie First team in 1999 after the Cleveland Cavaliers drafted him 8th overall earlier that year .
Miller only spent three years in Cleveland but put up big numbers .
He at least 10 ppg in all three seasons with the Cavs , and he was the only player in the NBA in 2002 to average double digit points and assists .
Miller also set a Franchise record for most assists in a season and was the first Cavaliers player to be named player of the week twice .
Miller is the best all - around point guard the Cavaliers have ever seen , and has been loved by fans for years .
Bench is after the jump .
Drew Gooden-PF
Drew was always a guy that I enjoyed watching play .
I always thought of him as a poor man ’s Boozer , without the attitude .
He was a loyal player and played hard every night .
I never understood why Gooden could n’t stay in one place .
He has double double ability and can hurt you inside the paint , when he ’s not throwing up off the wall shots .
Shannon Brown-SG
What can I say about Shannon Brown ?
Not much since he never really played much in Cleveland .
I was excited when we first drafted him .
I saw what he could do in college and I hoped to see that continue in the NBA .
Like many others , Shannon never really panned out for the Cavaliers .
Most of his ( little ) success has come with other teams , mainly the Los Angeles Lakers .
I never would ’ve guessed that Shannon Brown would have a Championship ring before LeBron James .
Ricky Davis-SF
Davis was a solid player when he was in Cleveland .
There ’s no doubt that his explosiveness made him a fan favorite .
However his selfishness and showboating sent him packing .
I remember when Davis was a rebound shy of his first triple double and in the closing seconds of a game Davis intentially missed a shot in hopes of recording his 10th rebound .
Instead , Davis was fouled and then fined by the Cavaliers following the game .
Flip Murray -G
I always liked Flip .
He brought great energy off the bench and could put up some points in a hurry .
He had a great shot on occasion , I love his ability to score off the bench , but when that would happen was anybody ’s guess .
He never was much of a team player but he made up for it with his occasional scoring .
“ Big ” Ben Wallace - PF
For as much as “ Big Ben ” pissed me off over the past couple seasons , I could n’t help but love the guy .
He was a team player , and he had great work ethic .
But that ’s about all he was while he was in Cleveland .
Years ago , Wallace was a BEAST on defensive .
Sadly , Cleveland was never able to see that side of Ben .
But that did n’t stop fans from loving him .
Matt Harpring-SF
Harpring was a quality player who only spent one year in Cleveland , but left quite the impression .
He came into a depleted Cavaliers team and put up good numbers ( 11.1 ppg and 4.3 rebounds in 56 games ) .
As much as I like Matt I was glad when we traded him for Tyrone Hil and Jumaine Jones .
Donyell Marshall -PF
I ’ll always remember Donyell for trying to enter a game wearing and Under Armour undershirt when he accidently removed his jersey while taking off his sweats .
In all seriousness , without Donyell the Cavaliers would n’t have made it to the NBA finals in 2007 let alone made it out of the Eastern Conf.
Semifinals .
His 6 three pointers in game 6 of the semifinals clinched the series against the New Jersey Nets .
BEIJING  When the United States ’ top energy and commerce officials arrive in China on Tuesday , they will land in the middle of a building storm over China ’s protectionist tactics to become the world ’s leader in renewable energy .
Calling renewable energy a strategic industry , China is trying hard to make sure that its companies dominate globally .
Just as Japan and South Korea made it hard for Detroit automakers to compete in those countries  giving their own automakers time to amass economies of scale in sheltered domestic markets 
China is shielding its clean energy sector while it grows to a point where it can take on the world .
Steven Chu , the American energy secretary , and Gary Locke , the commerce secretary , are coming here to discuss clean energy and global warming with Chinese leaders , and to see if progress can be made toward getting China to agree to specific targets for reductions in greenhouse gases .
Agreement proved elusive during the Group of 8 summit meeting last week in Italy .
But Mr. Chu and Mr. Locke arrive as Western companies , especially Europeans , are complaining increasingly about Beijing ’s green protectionism .

If Fairfield Greenwich Group partner Andres Piedrahita went through a period when he felt ashamed of blowing $ 7 billion of client money on Bernie Madoff , that period is apparently over .
Vicky Ward reports that Piedrahita is now in the Adriatic Sea , aboard his new yacht Oxygen .
He took delivery of the boat in June , Vicky says , and he paid about $ 30 million for it :
You'd think the family -- Mr Piedrahita , 50 , is FG 's founder , Walter Noel 's oldest son - in - law -- might be lying low , given the outrage of their ruined clients and the morass of lawsuits they face .
For most of them , this is so .
For Mr Piedrahita ?
Au contraire .
Look no further than the website of luxury yacht sellers Camper and Nicholsons to see pictures of " Oxygen " the new € 22,000,000.00 custom - made boat that Piedrahita , took possession of in June .
He is now cruising the Adriatic with wife Corina Noel and their children .
I am told he has plans to cruise around the Dalmatian coast and Corfu .
Recently he has been spotted in St. Tropez and in Venice .
Over the weekend I was with financiers who say they 've seen him out and about as if nothing ever went awry in his life .
Acquaintances believe this blatant vacationing is " a tremendous risk " -- no doubt referring to the very angry Latin Americans who allegedly gave him money to invest and could not legally declare it .
I have heard he would be unwise to set foot in certain places around the globe , people are so furious with him .
Having written the piece " Greenwich Meantime " for Vanity Fair magazine about Piedrahita and his family , I 'd call his current ostentatious act , stupid , shameless , and deeply offensive to all those ruined by the Fairfield Greenwich investment group .
A mutual friend told me while I was reporting the Vanity Fair piece that Piedrahita used to boast he'd " ruin his own mother if he needed to in order to make money . "
He is exactly the type of man who gives financiers an appalling identity at the worst possible time .
* UPDATE : FGG's PR folks weigh in with a clarification :
Vicky Ward ’s Huffington
Post item Monday about Andres Piedrahita – which you picked up – was incorrect and misleading in several ways .
Mr. Piedrahita is trying to sell the yacht to help raise funds for a potential settlement with the Madoff bankruptcy trustee , Irving Picard .
Mr. Piedrahita has been using the yacht to meet with prospective buyers .
He was not able to cancel his purchase or refuse to accept delivery of the yacht .
Valve 's big E3 announcement -- that last year 's hitwould be followed up with a PC and Xbox 360 sequel this year -- was a surprise coming from a studio that has never delivered a full sequel in such a short timeframe .
It was made even more notable by Valve 's oft - stated strategy of supporting its multiplayer games with new content and updates for many months or even years after their release , as exemplified by the ever - evolvingAt E3 , as part of a longer forthcoming interview , Gamasutra caught up with Tom Leonard , Valve developer and project lead on , to discuss the reason for the quick turnaround -- and the fate of the original " There 's definitely not a change in policy , " said Leonard in response to Gamasutra 's inquiries as to whether this move represents a new direction for Valve 's multiplayer efforts .
He pointed out that Valve has always experimented with different types of development and distribution .
" With the various things we 've done -- , the big splash game that takes forever ; or the episodic content ; or the [ ] updates -- as a company we try to explore different ways of delivering value to the customer , " he explained .
" For the team I 'm working on , it was perceived that the best way to provide value was to provide this big experience .
" Development onbegan almost immediately after the first game shipped , following a short break , but the idea of a standalone sequel was borne out of necessity and practicality .
"
The team got back together in early November , and we were all really excited to continue to expand theexperience , " Leonard recalled .
" We hit the white board and came up with ideas about how we could expand the experience -- new characters , new locations , new positioning on the timeline of the infection , new game mechanics . "
" As we started talking that through , it became clear that we were n't really talking about incremental updates ; we were talking about a whole experience .
And it would be hard to deliver that totality of experience in incremental bits .
"
" So I proposed to people , ' Why do n't we try to make a sequel and do it in a year ? '
Everyone thought I was crazy , but as I talked them through the strategy of how to do it , the team collectively said , ' Yeah , that 's interesting .
'" Leonard and the rest of the team discussed the idea with marketing VP Doug Lombardi and studio founder Gabe Newell , and were given the green light to proceed : " They said , ' Sounds great , if that 's what you want to do . '
Basically , the team was motivated to create an entire package .
" But what about , which some players expect to fall by the wayside in the wake of its sequel ?
Leonard declined to commit to there being more Valve - created content for the game , instead pointing out some upcoming functionality tweaks and the potential in user - created levels for the PC version .
" We are doing updates across the summer , adding new matchmaking features , and new features to facilitate user maps after the SDK is out , " he said .
" Certainly , user maps will be part of the ongoingexperience . " " Additionally , those maps can be transported into .
With regard to more content , it 's hard to say , because the timeline foris so sensitive , and the team has a head of steam right now for the game . "
West Australian police have uncovered ecstasy with a street value of more than $ 50,000 in a truck travelling from New South Wales .
Officers pulled over the truck in a routine traffic stop on Friday in Wundowie , 70 kilometres north east of Perth .
Police say the truck was travelling from Newcastle to Perth and the two men in the truck did not know there were drugs inside .
They were released without charge .
Sergeant Brendan Shanahan says 1000 ecstasy tablets were found hidden in the tyres of a child 's bike .
" From the packaging I could tell that it had been altered so I extracted the bike and its parts from there , " he said .
" From the bicycle there was the two tubes from the small bike quite clearly contained a hard substance so I extracted those substances and that was the ecstasy .
Sergeant Shanahan says the size of the haul suggests it is part of a large interstate drug operation .
" It was n't a tip off , we do target our activities in relation to drug trafficking and importation and we know and realise that the trucking industry the heavy vehicle industry is a part of that . "

Tegucigalpa , July 5 , 2009 --
The day started out full of joy , as thousands of Hondurans converged in front of the National Institute of Pedagogy , intent on marching about three miles to the airport to greet the plane that was supposed to bring deposed President Zelaya back to Honduras .
" Our president 's coming home today , this is going to be a great day " , said Jose Rodriguez , a campesino who came from Santa Barbara with his farmer 's group to join the anti-coup movement .
The military tried to stop them from getting to the capital , so they had to divide up and take local buses from town to town .
" It took us two days to get here , and we slept outside in the forest last night , but we had to be here " , said Rodriguez .
A group of young girls came with their church from Olancho .
They were determined to greet Zelaya , who they said was sent by God to be president .
" The Cardinal is against our president , but he does n't represent many of us in the religious community .
Our pastor is against the coup and so are we " , said Alejandra Fernandez , a 23 - year - old university student .
I asked why she supported Manuel Zelaya , or " Mel " , as his supporters call him .
" The government said he broke the law and is guilty of 18 crimes " , she said .
" Do you know what they are ? "
She pulled out her cell phone and started to read from a list :
He raised the minimum wage , gave out free school lunches , provided milk for the babies and pensions for the elderly , distributed energy - saving lightbulbs , decreased the price of public transportation , made more scholarships available for students . "
Suddenly a crowd gathered around us and started chiming in .
" He fixed the roads " , said one .
" He put schools in remote rural areas , like my little village , that never had them before " , added another .
" He let anyone go into the Presidential Palace and converted it from an elite residence to the people 's house " , said another .
" You see ? " , Alejandra smiled .
" He is guilty of even more then 18 crimes .
That 's why the elite classes can't stand him and why we want him back .
This is really a class struggle . "
The march wound its way through the streets of Tegucigalpa , gathering more and more people along the way .
The massive crowd sang and chanted slogans like " No somos cinco , no somos cien .
Prensa vendida , cuentenos bien " ( We 're not five , we 're not 100 , you sold - out press , count us well " ) -- referring to the fact that the mainstream press has been ignoring or grossly undercounting the movement that had been holding street demonstrations every day since the June 28 coup .
" I 've never had anything like this in my lifetime " , said an ecstatic Miriam Nunez , a 46 - year - old teacher from Tegucigalpa .
" Look around you - you can't even see the beginning or the end of this march !
It 's full of teachers , students , campesinos , union workers , indigenous people .
One thing the coup succeeded in doing is bringing together the social movements in a way that never exited before in this country . "
What made the march particularly exciting is that as it approached the airport , there were rows and rows of soldiers and police in riot gear blocking their path .
Each time the security forces tried to stop the crowd , there would be negotiations with the police , who would finally back down and allow the protesters to get closer and closer to the airport .
Luis Sosa , a university professor and anti-coup leader , was one of those negotiating with Police Commissioner Mendosa .
" Mendosa and I went to school together 20 years ago and we play soccer together every Sunday .
So he knows that if his men get rough with us , there will be hell to pay next Sunday " , laughed Sosa .
" But seriously , we 're trying hard to maintain discipline among our ranks -- taking sticks and rocks away from people who want to provoke violence -- and the police say that as long as we are peaceful , they 'll let us go all the way to the airport . "
Sure enough , the crowd made it to the airport peacefully and waited patiently for Zelaya 's plane to arrive .
Suddenly , a plane flew in low and circled around the airport .
The crowd went wild , cheering and jumping up and down , but became angry when they saw that the plane was not able to land .
Military vehicles and soldiers were on the runway , making it impossible for the pilot to maneuvre safely .
On the far end of the airport , a group of mostly young people tried to get through the fence to make their way to the tarmac .
According to Al Jazeera camera operator Alfredo Delara , some of them started throwing stones and bottles at security forces .
The troops responded by lobbying tear gas and then firing their weapons in the air .
Suddenly , at least one soldier pointed his weapon directly at the crowd .
" A young boy was hit right in the head , his brains gushing out .
He was killed instantly " , said Delara .
" His mother came running , screaming hysterically , ‘ My son , my son , they 've killed my son . ' "
Others in the crowd were wounded and it was reported that another person was killed .
Between the violence and the fact that President Zelaya was forced to fly on to El Salvador , the crowd became despondent .
The organisers tried to keep up their hopes .
" Perhaps the United Nations will send peacekeepers " , one of the leaders shouted through the sound system .
The crowd cheered and yelled , " We want the blue helmets , we want the blue helmets . "
" Can you believe this ? " , asked Indigenous leader Berta Caceres , her eyes welling up with tears .
" Now they are killing our people .
Where will this end ?
We need the international community to step in and stop the crazy people who have stolen our country . "
Meanwhile , another piece of news circulated -- that the government had just moved up the curfew from 10 pm to 6.30 pm .
The crowd rushed to disperse , fearing they could be arrested for violating the curfew .
But they vowed to keep up the fight .
" We will be marching again tomorrow , come join us " , the leaders announced .
" This struggle is not over . "
" If they think that were are going to give up , they are badly mistaken " , said Caceres .
" The events of today make us more determined than ever to overthrow this terrible coup . "

What a surprise .
Neocon and former Cheney advisor Mary Matalin thinks that Sarah Palin 's announcement that she is resigning as Governor of Alaska is just brilliant ... brilliant , I tell you .
In her world it 's a wonderful thing the Governor is cutting and running away from taking care of her state right now which is in a huge mess , and having some time to play politics for 2012 instead .
On the flip side , David Gergen and Ed Rollins think she 's toast .
I do n't always agree with either of them , but I 'd take their slant on how this is going to play out before Matalin 's any day of the week .
Matalin's hackery and the video of Rollins and Gergen below the fold .
MALVEAUX : I want to bring in Republican strategist and CNN political contributor , Mary Matalin -- Mary , what do you make of this ?
We 've been getting a lot of different feedback from Republicans , some who are scratching their heads , others who say this is going to damage the party .
And -- and there are others who are a little bit more open - minded about what this means for her chances in 2012 .
MATALIN : Well , I think it 's really brilliant , with two caveats , one being that there 's nothing else , ala the Sanford fiasco .
There 's nothing else that we do n't know .
If all that 's there is what we see right now , it 's brilliant .
And , secondly , that she has a plan and people have a plan to put up with the conventional wisdom , chatterati and the political class saying how stupid it is , because it 's brilliant .
On the substance , there 's the key economic issue -- I know everyone says -- thinks it 's health care , but it 's really energy .
And she 's the queen of energy .
And the second big issue for 2012 will be the role of government .
And she has a record of reform and ethics reform and making government smaller and reigning in spending -- all those issues that are getting increasingly important as Barack Obama expands on his agenda .
So -- and her delivery was incredible -- a charis -- a less charismatic person probably could n't pull it off .
But as -- as already referenced , she will be freed up and liberated in the way Mitt Romney is here to run around and raise money and get political chips by spending it and get political capital .
And she is still raising the kinds of crowds and money that she always did .
So at first blush , to people with -- tainted by the Beltway -- and I include myself .
My first reaction was what ?
And my second reaction -- because I 'm at my farm .
I guarantee you , if I go down to the Wal - Mart in the Shenandoah Valley , there will be a huge hoorah for this .
And normal Americans like that message of , you know , the price of public service should not be personal destruction ...
MALVEAUX : I want to ...
MATALIN : ... and the costs of that .
[....]
MALVEAUX : And , Mary , I want to bring you back in .
Do we know -- is there any suspicion that there is something that she might be hiding that we do n't know about , that the might be a problem for why she 's stepped down out of her position early ?
MATALIN : You know , we do n't know .
But one has to presume that -- and this is how , since she brilliantly raised this -- that these , you know , hoards , these killing locust hoards of APO research have come in there and dug through everything .
And what we would presume is that if there was anything else , we -- we would know it by now .
But I just -- the more I think about this , the better I think it is .
And she addressed the issue of why she 's stepping down quite well by delineating the record .
Again , I 'm not going to go through it -- but on energy and reform and ethics and small government .
She spoke right to that conservative base that wants the substantively smaller government , limited government .
And she spoke of Constitutionalism .
I mean , if I were these other candidates , yes , I 'd be sending out negatives on her already .
But she 's taken -- unlike those candidates who have -- potential candidates that are still in office , she takes that big target off her back with a good record to launch from .
Now , that presumes she 's going to use this time wisely , not just getting political chips , but , you know , getting deeper -- taking a deeper dive on foreign policy and those -- and the whole panoply of issues that you have to be expected to -- one expects that their presidential aspirants can go long , hard and deep on .
MALVEAUX : Mary Matalin , Peter Hamby , Mark Preston , thank you , all of you , for contributing .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can in one instant appear the diplomatic equivalent of damaged goods and in the next a confident leader whose bellicose speeches leave the West wondering how to deal with him and his perplexing nation now that he ’s won a much - disputed reelection .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev publicly greeted Ahmadinejad at a recent meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , but did not grant him a private meeting as he had the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
In Belarus , the Iranian leader was met not by President Alexander Lukashenko , but by the speaker of the upper house of parliament .
A similar pattern has emerged in the Middle East , where Arab regimes have long been wary of Iran ’s ambitions .
Authorities in Jordan withdrew licenses for two Iranian news organizations this week and the sultan of Oman reportedly canceled a trip to Tehran following the unrest after Iran ’s June 12 election .
Snubs and slights in the diplomatic world are common , sometimes almost imperceptible .
But as long as Ahmadinejad remains in power , with the support of Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , there are concerns about how the messy fallout over his reelection will influence diplomacy regarding Iran ’s nuclear program , regional stature and relations with the U.S. and Europe .

Tehran ’s crackdown on dissent and its accusations of Western meddling have led the Obama administration , which had sought to open dialogue with Iran , to toughen its tone .
The European Union is contemplating recalling its ambassadors unless Iran releases the last three of nine Iranian employees of the British Embassy arrested over the weekend .
Ahmadinejad ’s anti-Israel comments and Tehran ’s spats with U.N. nuclear inspectors have sparked anger in the West over the years , but the current crisis is evoking deeper criticism over Iran ’s tactics and intentions .
It is apparent that the West and Iran are peering through separate prisms :
As Britain argued for the release of its employees , a commander of the Revolutionary Guard threatened that Iran would pull out of talks over its nuclear program unless the European Union decided to “ apologize ” for interfering .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Iran ’s arrest of the embassy employees was “ completely contrary to the sort of good political engagement that Iran says that it wants . ”
European leaders are “ very troubled , and do n’t really know what to do .
They ca n’t excuse the Iranian regime , and they see that they have to try to avoid an Iranian bomb , ” said Hubert Vedrine , France ’s foreign minister from 1997 to 2002 .
“ With the Iranian elections , there ’s a feeling of discouragement that has settled in .
I find that absurd , because we could have never seriously imagined that Ahmadinejad would be beaten . ”

The question is how to engage Iran and Ahmadinejad .
The major powers have rarely been unified on this , but Europe and the U.S. cannot fully ostracize Iran given the importance of the negotiations over its nuclear program .
A new round of trade sanctions could bolster Ahmadinejad ’s claims of Western intervention and rally the Iranian public , diverting attention from opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi ’s pro-democracy movement .
On Thursday in Tehran , hard - line politicians renewed calls for Mousavi ’s prosecution over the recent protests and ensuing violence .
State - run Press TV reported that Iranian intelligence forces had arrested seven members of an anti-government group that had an “ active role in provoking ” postelection unrest .
“ The international community may mount only a weak response to the Iranian crisis , given competing U.S. and EU priorities and the traditional difficulty of organizing international action to defend democracy , ” according to Michael Singh , a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and former senior director for Middle East Affairs on the National Security Council .
A recent statement by the Group of 8 foreign ministers did not condemn Iran ’s postelection crackdown and showed the divisions among industrialized nations on how to respond to Iran .
France and Italy sought a toughly worded statement .
Russia , often criticized for violations of civil liberties , essentially did not question Iran ’s election results and opposed any outside effort at promoting democracy .
Medvedev may have snubbed Ahmadinejad at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting , but he did not question his return to power .

Iran ’s future relations with the world will depend on the “ regime ’s ability to recover from the deep separations that are currently present within its ranks , ” said Wahid Abdul Magid , a Middle East affairs analyst at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo .
“ If they manage to somehow retain stability , then relations with other countries will remain as they were before the latest elections .
It is also obvious that Ahmadinejad ’s attitude toward the West will be even more acute . ”
Ahmadinejad called off a visit this week to Libya , where President Moammar Kadafi had invited him to speak at the African Summit .
Iranian TV reported Iranian spokesman Hassan Qashqavi as saying that Ahmadinejad ’s “ busy work schedule ” prevented him from attending .
Instead , the president stayed home and met with an official from a nation that shares his anti-U.S. stance : Rafael Ramirez , the Venezuelan energy minister .
The conservative Mehr news agency reported that “ Ramirez , for his part , praised the massive voter turnout in the presidential election in Iran , saying the widespread support of the Iranian nation for [ Ahmadinejad ] in the election overwhelmed the world .
“ On the Western interference in postelection events in Iran , the Venezuelan minister said , it is evident to the world that the United States and Britain always try to foment divisions among nations around the world . ”

Special correspondent Devorah Lauter in Paris and Amro Hassan of The Times ’ Cairo Bureau contributed to this report .
This Wall St. Journal article also says that despite the cutbacks in teaching jobs even for programs like Teach for America , the number of students working toward teaching certifications is rising :
Jacqueline Frommer thought her career path was set when she landed her dream job last summer teaching fourth grade in Pompano Beach , Fla .
Last month , she got laid off .
Ms. Frommer , 25 years old , said in college she was told teaching was among the steadiest jobs around .
Now " there is no job security anymore , " she said .
In a sign of how severe the employment downturn is getting , even schoolteachers , an occupation once viewed as recession proof , are feeling the pain .
Education jobs grew steadily in recent years amid rising enrollment and government efforts to reduce class sizes .
Now the increase in teaching positions has leveled off as school districts struggle with budget pressures .
The demographic bulge caused by children of baby boomers -- the so - called echo boom -- has also begun to wane .
Los Angeles Unified School District laid off 2,500 teachers this spring .
Broward County , Fla. , Ms. Frommer 's district , cut 400 school jobs .
Rochester , N.Y. , laid off 300 teachers .
Other districts have avoided cuts by negotiating pay reductions and enacting furloughs and hiring freezes .
In June , education jobs actually ticked up 0.5 % nationally to just under 3.1 million on a seasonally adjusted basis .
But the number of education - related jobs has declined in six of the past 12 months , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
That contrasts with annual growth of about 3 % over the past 15 years in the education field .
In the past year , education jobs have grown at about half that rate .
Most in demand are teachers in math , science and special education .
College instructors have also been in high demand .
Many of the layoffs came in June as teachers prepared to say goodbye to their students for summer .
Union and state rules require schools to give teachers notice before the end of the school year if their jobs wo n't be there in the fall .
Heather Clutter , an elementary teacher in Desert Hot Springs , Calif. , learned 15 minutes before the end of the last day of school in early June that she was one of 200 teachers being laid off in the area -- just weeks after learning she was pregnant .
" You always think of teaching as a safe profession .
Once you get in , you 're there , you 'll be able to retire , " she said .
" Not so much right now . "

Footage from a 1993 evangelical video shows Hayford enthusiastically introducing and endorsing a talk during which his colleague C. Peter Wagner claimed that the early 1990's economic downturn of the Japanese economy was due to what Wagner depicted as a Shinto ritual in which Japanese emperors have sexual intercourse with a demonic sky - goddess being that , posited Wagner , may have been a succubus .
Wagner blamed slack Japanese stock prices on the alleged tryst .
As British religious scholar Richard Bartholomew notes , C. Peter Wagner 's treatment of the Shinto ceremony is factually dubious on a number of counts .
US GOP Senator John Ensign belongs to the 5 - 10 million member ( estimates vary ) denomination , the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel , which Church on The Way Pastor Jack Hayford has headed for 5 years .
Hayford gave the benediction at former president George W. Bush 's 2001 inaugural prayer service .
In 2006 Senator Ensign addressed the Foursquare Gospel International Church 's yearly convention via a videotaped message .
In 2003 , Ensign traveled to Philadelphia and addressed the yearly Foursquare Gospel convention in person .
Jack Hayford has also been one of the regularly featured speakers at Promise Keepers events .
The Promise Keepers , a men's ministry which John Ensign joined in college , held rallies during the 1990's with up to several hundred thousand participants and has promoted evangelists who practice demon deliverance , otherwise known as exorcism .
As Church On The Way head Hayford introduced Peter Wagner in the 1993 video ,
" Spiritual mapping is a recently adopted term to describe a new dynamic sphere of Christian ministry that is helping many as they seek to discern and break the real strongholds of the enemy : that is , in Bible terms , our enemy , the adversary The Devil and the demonic forces of Hell he commandeers .
In this lesson , Peter Wagner helps us see that Spiritual Mapping is Biblical .
This can great increase our readiness for pray and deepen our convictions that we 're on solid Bible - based turf as we adopt this means for prayer .
I think you 'll be especially moved as Dr. Wagner gives examples of how prayer targeted through Spiritual Mapping has helped spread the Gospel in many areas . "
During his talk , C. Peter Wagner claimed that Japanese emperors have sex with the " Sun Goddess " during a special Shinto ritual ,
" So , there is a spirit called a " harlot " , a principality who dominates nations , who dominates territories , who dominates people groups , very very clearly - to such an extent that she has fornication with kings .
And I can give you an example of how she does this .
Japan , as a nation , is one of the nations of the world which has consciously , openly invited national demonization .
And they do this through what 's called a Daijosai Ceremony where , when a new emperor comes in , and we had a new emperor about three or four years ago , when a new emperor comes into power this Daijosai Ceremony takes place , it is a Shinto based ceremony , and as a part of this ceremony the emperor goes to this specially chosen , specially built place - I think it cost them , I forget , something like 50 million dollars to put this thing on , to build these places .
He eats rice that has been planted and harvested and chosen through witchcraft , and at a certain time that night the Sun Goddess visits him in person and has sexual intercourse with the emperor .
It 's a very , very powerful thing .
So the emperor becomes one flesh with the Sun Goddess .
And that 's an invitation for the Sun Goddess to continue to demonize the whole nation .
And , Japan is under the power of the Sun Goddess .
The flag indicates that - the Land of The Rising Sun , the whole thing is glorifying the Sun Goddess ...
You ask , " is this physical or not ? " - it could be .
Because there is a certain spiritual phenomenon , succubus - it 's called succubus .
There is a documented physical relationship between human beings and demonic beings . "
Peter Wagner went on to outline the purported impact of the alleged imperial sex with the " Sun Goddess " , or succubus :
" Since the night that the present emperor slept with the sun Goddess , the stock market in Japan has gone down - never come up since .
This has been a disastrous year - first year the rice harvest failed , first year Japan has ever had to import rice .
For Japan to import rice is not just an economic disaster - they lose face .
For the Japanese it 's very serious .
The auto industry is falling apart because of the Yen - the Yen is becoming so strong against the Dollar they can't export anything or sell anything .
I mean , this country has really gone downhill from - check it .
Some people say it 's just a coincidence .
Okay [ chuckles ] .
We do n't think so .
We who are in spiritual mapping , we do n't think so ... "
[ image , right : a Medieval depiction of a succubus ]
Succubus - based economics is n't the only peculiar aspect of theological positions Jack Hayford has endorsed or championed .
The Van Nuys megachurch pastor has played a key role in promoting recently invented concepts and practices that are radically reinventing and redefining contemporary Christianity , on a worldwide basis .
A June 24 , 2009 AP story by John Christofferson concerned an uproar over a YouTube video , of footage taken ata Bridgeport CT church , which showed an apparent attempt to exorcise a " homosexual demon " from a 16 year - old boy .
But coverage of the subsequent outrage the video provoked uniformly failed to note that the exorcism attempt may well have been the product of a unified religious ideology promoted from Jack Hayford 's Church on The Way , from former NAE head Ted Haggard 's Colorado Springs New Life Church , and even at Sarah Palin 's most significant church , the Wasilla Assembly of God .
Pastor Jack Hayford 's 20,000 - plus Van Nuys , CA Church on The Way is one of the biggest megachurches in the United States .
During the 1990's the church was headquarters for a budding international ministry , Cleansing Stream Ministries , that specializes in teaching Christians to cast out their own demons , a practice that AP reporter Richard N. Osling , in a 2003 Associated Press story , dubbed " do it yourself exorcism . "
Hayford has authorized a book , now available in a free Internet version , that functions as a manual for self - exorcism .
[ see , Jack Hayford Introduces Peter Wagner Talk On Spiritual Mapping ]
One of the practices promoted by Cleansing Stream Ministries is the casting out , from Christian believers , of demons allegedly invited in by sexual " sins " such as homosexuality .
The exorcism of gay demons and the Jack Hayford - endorsed sex - with - demons economic theory are part of a new evangelical paradigm promoted in the 1990's and into the next decade from Ted Haggard 's Colorado Springs New Life Church that centers around practices known as " Spiritual Warfare " and " Spiritual Mapping " , in which believers seek to geographically map out and then expel demon spirits held to cause sickness and death , murder and violent crime , lack of church attendance , and traffic accidents , economic fluctuations and even environmental degradation .
As described in my recent Talk To Action story Jack Hayford Introduces Peter Wagner Talk On Spiritual Mapping , pastor Hayford has been a leading promoter of " Spiritual Warfare " and " Spiritual Mapping . "
Prior to the late 1980's , the former term had precedent within Christianity , but the latter , " Spiritual Mapping " , was coined quite recently , in the late 1980's , by George Otis , Jr. and refers to a set of practices pioneered by C. Peter Wagner , George Otis , Jr. , Cindy Jacobs , Ed Silvoso , Harold Caballeros , and other Christian evangelists during the 1980's and 1990's .
The ideological vision of creating a Christian theocratic earthly utopia by driving out demon spirits was for over a decade exported from Ted Haggard 's New Life megachurch .
During the late 1990's , Haggard 's church sent a team to Africa to `anoint ' , or spray down with cooking oil , entire cities in Mali such as Timbuktu in an effort to ward off demon infestations .
In the late 1990 's Haggard 's church sent teams of church members to walk the streets of Colorado Springs , to do what Ted Haggard dubbed " Grid Praying " .
Some teams prayed for city residents , others mapped out and tried to expel demon spirits allegedly infesting the city .
In the 1997 This American Life radio segment # 77 , " Pray " , public radio journalist Alix Spiegel described New Life Church 's Prayer Walking and demon-expulsion program .
Spiegel characterized the underlying outlook as " medieval " .
Prayer Walking has gained wide popular culture traction even to an extent on the American left .
But it is the pleasant , Jekyll - sided face of a wider agenda , a demon expulsion program .
Prayer - walkers pray for unknown city residents and they are also encouraged to map and and take notes on alleged ideological enemies , who are held to be under demon influence .
Together with Ted Haggard , Jack Hayford co-edited the 1997 book Loving Your City Into The Kingdom : City Reaching Strategies For 21st Century Revival ( Regal books ) , which presented a soft PR face to the demon the Spiritual Mapping / Spiritual Warfare paradigm , which effectively demonizes everyone on Earth who does not subscribe to Haggard 's and Hayford 's form of evangelical Christianity .
Components of the Prayer Walking and demon deliverance ideology are being incorporated into the police practices of Orlando , Florida and Peoria , Illinois , in novel and factually - challenged efforts that partner local Christian churches with police departments of those cities ; teams of church members , with police backup for safety , walk high - crime areas and try to pray down violent crime and murder rates .

The Obama administration has virtually abandoned plans to resettle in the United States some detainees from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , officials said , a recognition that the task had become politically impossible because of congressional opposition .
The shift came even as the administration announced Thursday that it had transferred six detainees from the prison , including four Chinese Muslims sent to Bermuda , as it tries to meet a one - year deadline for shutting down the controversial facility .
The administration had hoped to move some of the Chinese Muslims , known as Uighurs , to the United States as a signal to other countries that they were not dangerous .
But the swift backlash forced the administration to reverse course .
“ For now , ” a senior administration official acknowledged , releasing some Uighurs in the U.S. is “ not doable . ”

The administration now is scrambling to find countries willing to accept the Uighurs , who have been held since 2002 and were ordered released by a federal judge last year .
Underscoring the importance of the transfer , White House Counsel Gregory Craig and a top American diplomat , Daniel Fried , flew to Guantanamo and accompanied the Uighurs as they boarded a plane for Bermuda .
But the transfer set off diplomatic objections , both unexpected and expected .
America ’s close ally Britain expressed displeasure over the transfer to Bermuda , a British overseas territory .
Less surprising was the reaction of China , whose officials reiterated that they wanted the Uighurs repatriated to stand trial for separatist activities .
Administration officials played down the talk of diplomatic backlash , and said moving the Uighurs was an important step toward shutting down Guantanamo .

“ We want to close Guantanamo , not just talk about wanting to close it , ” said the senior administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .
The U.S. announced Thursday that besides the Uighurs , it also had transferred two other detainees .
On Wednesday , the U.S. transferred Iraqi detainee Jawad Jabber Sadkhan to his home country , and on Thursday sent Mohammad Gharani to his home nation of Chad .
Earlier this week , the Pacific island nation of Palau said it also had agreed to take some Uighurs ; and another detainee , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , was transferred to stand trial in federal court in New York .
Deadline nears

The flurry is a sign that the administration is painfully aware of its promise to close Guantanamo ’s prison within a year .
With only seven months to go , the U.S. has about 232 remaining detainees to either transfer to other countries , charge in federal courts or military commissions , or consider holding without trial .
The promise to close the prison came in the first week of the Obama administration .
But since then the White House has struggled to maintain the political initiative , and seemed caught unawares when Congress , in a series of votes , tried to ban former Guantanamo detainees from being brought to the United States .
Both the Senate and the House had voted to strip money for the closure of Guantanamo from a supplemental spending bill , but differences in their measures ’ language forced the two bodies to negotiate .
On Thursday night , House and Senate negotiators struck a deal that would prohibit the administration from freeing any detainees onto U.S. soil until Sept. 30 .
But the compromise would allow the administration to transfer to the U.S. any detainees it intends to try .
The deal to transfer the four Uighurs to Bermuda had been discussed for some weeks , but a final agreement was not struck until Wednesday night , the senior administration official said .

The official said the British were notified immediately afterward .
But the British Foreign Office and Sir Richard Gozney , the British - appointed governor of Bermuda , said that Bermuda ’s government should have consulted with London because taking the Uighurs had security and foreign policy ramifications .
Although the island nation is largely self - governing , Britain controls its security and foreign policy .
British officials were frustrated by the lack of consultation by the U.S. , and complained that they were informed of the transfer just hours before it occurred .
They made those concerns clear Thursday in a call with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
But U.S. administration officials said the British officials ’ displeasure was more with Bermuda than with the United States .
One official noted that the lack of notice may allow British diplomats to tell China they had no part in the deal .
China exerted diplomatic pressure on Albanian officials after they agreed to take five Uighurs in 2006 , and since then , finding countries to take the remaining Uighurs has proved difficult .

Background
The Uighurs belong to the Turkic Muslim minority that lives in the Xinjiang province of far western China .
The Uighurs say they are repressed by the Chinese government .
China considers the Uighurs a violent separatist movement .
The Uighurs held at Guantanamo were captured in Pakistan in 2002 .
They had received firearms training in Afghanistan , but fled after the U.S. began its military campaign there in 2001 .
Administration officials praised Bermuda for agreeing to take the Uighurs , as did attorneys for the four men .

“ Bermuda just stepped up and did it , God bless them , ” said Sabin Willett , a lawyer for the four men .
“ They have put the bigger countries to shame . ”
The four Uighurs will reside in Bermuda under a guest - worker permit .
Although they will be free to travel around Bermuda , they will not be able to leave the country until they are awarded Bermudan passports , which should occur in about a year , Willett said .
Even after they have passports , the Uighurs will not be able to enter the U.S. without the permission of the American government , U.S. officials said .
Miffed about reports that the U.S. was prepared to offer $ 200 million in aid to Palau for taking in detainees , the senior official said the U.S. would provide Bermuda with only about $ 100,000 to help defray the costs of taking in the Uighurs .

In a statement released by his attorneys , one of the four detainees said he was pleased with the resolution .
“ Growing up under communism , we always dreamed of living in peace and working in a free society like this one , ” Abdul Nasser said .
Thirteen Uighurs remain at Guantanamo .
Though Palau has agreed to take some of them , it is unclear exactly how many Uighurs will go there or when they might arrive .
Palau President Johnson
Toribiong said he had never even heard of Uighurs when , on June 2 , he was asked by Fried , an assistant secretary of State , if Palau might be willing to host a group .

A formal request came two days later from Clinton , Toribiong said .
“ The very fact that the invitation came from the United States meant that we must take the request seriously and if there is no good reason to reject it , we should accept it , ” he said , adding that he had not heard back from the United States .
OK ’d for transfer
More than 50 Guantanamo detainees including the remaining Uighurs have been approved for transfer .

The Obama administration has transferred one detainee to Britain and one to France .
European countries have said for months that they are willing to help Obama close Guantanamo by taking prisoners , but they have signaled that they want Washington to take the first step by accepting some detainees in the United States .
David Glazier , a Loyola Law School professor who has studied the judicial and security issues surrounding the proposed closing of Guantanamo , said the transfer of Uighurs to Bermuda and potential resettlements to Palau are intended to demonstrate to U.S. allies that they can safely take in the former prisoners .
“ It ’s helpful in that once some countries have taken people from Guantanamo , it becomes that much easier for other countries to make the decision to do the same thing , ” Glazier said .

BIRMINGHAM , Ala . 
Just when it seemed to have cooled off , the topic of hell is back on the front burner — at least for pastors learning to preach about a topic most Americans would rather not talk about .
Only 59 % of Americans believe in hell , compared with 74 % who believe in heaven , according to the recent surveys from the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
FAITH & REASON FORUM :
Do you believe in a literal hell ?
" I think it 's such a difficult and important biblical topic , " said Kurt Selles , director of the Global Center at Samford University 's Beeson Divinity School .
" There 's a big change that 's taken place as far as evangelicals not wanting to be as exclusive . "
At the recent annual Beeson Pastors School , Selles led two workshops to discuss " Whatever happened to hell ? "
He asked how many of the pastors had ever preached a sermon on hell .
Nobody had , he said .
" I think it 's something people want to avoid , " he said .
" I understand why .
It 's a difficult topic . "
The Rev. Fred Johns , pastor of Brookview Wesleyan Church in Irondale , Ala. , said after a workshop discussion of hell that pastors do shy away from the topic of everlasting damnation .
" It 's out of fear we 'll not appear relevant , " he said .
" It 's pressure from the culture to not speak anything negative .
I think we 've begun to deny hell .
There 's an assumption that everybody 's going to make it to heaven somehow . "
The soft sell on hell reflects an increasingly market - conscious approach , Selles said .
" When you 're trying to market Jesus , sometimes there 's a tendency to mute traditional Christian symbols , " he said .
" Difficult doctrines are left by the wayside .
Hell is a morally repugnant doctrine .
People wonder why God would send people to eternal punishment . "
Speakers said the seriousness of Jesus dying for man 's sins relates to the gravity of salvation vs. damnation , according to Johns .
" If you do n't mention God 's judgment , you are missing a big part of the Christian gospel , " Selles said .
" Without wrath , there 's no grace . "
Pope John Paul II stirred up a debate in 1999 by describing hell as " the state of those who freely and definitely separate themselves from God , the source of all life and joy . "
Although the pope was reflecting official Roman Catholic teaching , some U.S. evangelicals expressed misgivings about the implication that hell is an abstract separation from God rather than a literal lake of fire as described in the Book of Revelation .
The pope 's comments on hell stirred up the ancient debate about whether hell is a real place of burning fire or a state of mind reflecting a dark , cold emptiness and distance from God .
Evangelical Christians have traditionally offered a sterner view of salvation and damnation .
A Southern Baptist Home Mission Board study in 1993 estimated that 70 % of all Americans are going to hell , based on projected numbers of those who have not had a born - again experience .
Human ideas about hell were still in ferment as the Bible was being written .
The theological concept of hell has a rich cultural heritage , according to historian Alan Bernstein , author of The Formation of Hell .
The ancient Hebrews focused on the afterlife following their Babylonian captivity , when they experienced the torment of ungodly enemies who seemed to have an unjustifiably good life on Earth .
During the Babylonian exile , Jews were exposed to Zoroastrianism , which asserts there is an eternal struggle between good and evil , with good triumphing in the end .
The Hebrew concept of " Sheol " — the realm of the dead — may also have been influenced by the Greek mythology of Tartarus , a place of everlasting punishment for the Titans , a race of gods defeated by Zeus , Bernstein writes .
From about 300 B.C. to 300 A.D. , those influences combined with Hebrew speculation about an eventual comeuppance to the worldly wicked .
In translating the Bible from Hebrew to Greek , the Greeks used the terms Tartarus , Hades and Gehenna .
In Greek thought , Hades is not a place of punishment ; it 's where the dead are separated from the living .
The term Gehenna referred to a ravine outside Jerusalem that was used as a garbage dump .
It had once been a place of child sacrifice and became a symbol of pain and suffering , Selles said .
As a garbage dump , it was probably often a place of fire as trash was burned , emphasizing the symbolism of the flames of eternal damnation , he said .
Jesus never soft - pedaled the concept of hell , Selles said .
" It 's not metaphorical in Jesus ' mind ; it 's a real place , " he said .
In 410 A.D. , St. Augustine defined four states of afterlife : those so good they go to heaven ; those so bad they go to hell ; those who deserve some relief in their eternal torment ; and those who deserve to be lifted out of torment after repenting for their sins .
That set the stage for the doctrine of purgatory in 1237 A.D .
The Bible contains a litany of colorful images of hell as both fire and darkness , as in the Gospel of Matthew , which refers to " the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels " and " the outer darkness " where " men will weep and gnash their teeth . "
Either way , Selles said , pretending that hell does n't exist , or trying to preach around it , short - circuits the Bible .
" This is a doctrine , a teaching , that 's being neglected in churches , " Selles said .
" It needs to be preached .
It 's part of the Gospel . "
-- Greg Garrison writes for The Birmingham News .
Microsoft said it expected another tricky quarter .
Microsoft has reported disappointing results for the April to June quarter , with profits down by almost a third .
Net profit for the period was $ 3.1 bn ( £ 1.9bn ) , down by 29 % from the same period a year earlier .
Revenue came in at $ 13.1 bn , down 17 % from a year ago .
The results were worse than analysts had been expecting .
The world 's largest software maker said it had been affected by weakness in the global personal computer ( PC ) and server markets .
Cost cutting
In after hours trading , Microsoft shares fell more than 7 % , reflecting the market 's disappointment with the results .
" It looked like a pretty tough quarter for Microsoft .
The top line was very weak , " said Toan Tran at Morningstar .
The one bright spot was the company 's cost - cutting measures .
" In light of the environment , it was an excellent achievement to deliver over $ 750 m of operational savings compared with the prior year quarter , " said Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's finance chief .
Microsoft makes most of its profit selling the Windows operating system and business software such as Office .
However , demand has been hit by falling sales of PCs as consumers and businesses trim spending .
Microsoft - which became a public company in 1986 - has been looking at ways of cutting costs .
In January , it said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs over the next 18 months , including 1,400 immediately .
Increasing pressure
To make matters worse , the company is coming under increasing pressure from internet search engine Google , which recently announced a better - than - expected rise in second quarter profits .
Google is developing an operating system for personal computers in a direct challenge to market leader Microsoft and its Windows system .
Microsoft itself is poised to launch its new operating system , Windows 7 , this autumn .
Lets go back in time 10 years and look at 2 typical investors , Jack and Jill .
Both are in the same tax bracket , have worked hard and saved a lot of money , $ 250,000 .
Its their life savings .
Everyone says they should put their money in the market , where it will grow and fund their retirement .
So they did .
One thought they got the break of a lifetime and through a friend was able to invest with the one and only Bernie Madoff .
The other put half their money , $ 125 k , in a mutual fund that matched the performance of the Dow Jones , and half in a mutual fund that matched the performance of the Nasdaq .
Neither touched the money other than to cover the fees and any taxes , which for the sake of this example we will say were the same for both .
Who has more money today ?
The person who invested “ wisely ” or the person who invested with a crooked Ponzi Scheme ?
The mutual fund investor bought their Dow Jones Fund when the market was 9550 in Feb of 1999 .
That $ 125 k investment has shrunk to about $ 95 k .
They bought the Nasdaq Fund when the index was at 2342 .
Today that $ 125 k would be worth about $ 77 k .
Their $ 250 k nest egg of February 1999 is now worth $ 172,000 .
Thats bad , but not as bad as Madoff ’s sucker , right ?
Maybe not .
Because the Madoff investor had less than $ 500 k invested , there is a good chance that they could be protected by the SIPC , who is already sending out claim forms .
So when its all said and done , the Madoff investor could not only get all their $ 250 k back , but they are also elgible for a share of any funds recovered .
While that number may be miniscule , it could mean that SIPC elgible and paid Madoff investors actually made money over the 10 year period , while those that put their money in the market got hit very hard .
The sad thing is , that the same comparison could be made for many blue chip stocks that are down 50 , 60 , even 90 pct or more .
Which begs the question , who suffered more stress along the way ?
The market investor who has had to endure 10 years of ups and downs and ups and way down in the market , or the Madoff Ponzi investor who lived happily and stress free for 9 plus years and must now face the uncertainty of their SIPC and other claims to get their money back ?
The Scalp Industry
Although the origins of the practice of scalping may be lost in the nebulous hinterlands of the past , the industry of scalp hunting has a specific and documented history .
Although some of the particulars may be shrouded in rumors , the scalp bounty laws instituted a peculiar economic venture between the Mexican government and , primarily , American citizens .
Between 1835 and the 1880s , the Mexican authorities paid private armies to hunt Native Americans , paying per kill and using scalps as receipts .
The practice began when the Mexican government could no longer provide adequate protection to its citizens from the marauding Apaches and Comanches .
The natives rode down from the U.S. killing peons , kidnapping women , and stealing livestock and then would escape back over the border .
Because the Mexican military was unable to effectively ward off the threat over such a large expanse and because the Mexican farmers either could not afford or were forbidden to possess arms , the government had to look to alternative methods of suppressing native violence .
Bounty Laws
Sonora was the first state to enact a scalp bounty law ; in 1835 , offering 100 pesos for the scalps of braves ( with a peso roughly equal to an American silver dollar ) .
An American named James Johnson sparked the boom period in 1837 when he fired a concealed canon at close range on unarmed Apaches .
The blast tore into Apache warriors as well as women and children , and Johnson and his troops swarmed into the mass of natives , killing and scalping .
While this event occurred in Hidalgo County , New Mexico , the scalps were cashed in Sonora , and the entire incident proved how profitable scalp hunting could be .
It also flamed native animosity towards both Mexicans and Anglos , encouraging more raids and greater violence ( a cycle that continued throughout this era ) .
Soon afterward , Chihuahua enacted a similar law offering a graded bounty : $ 100 for braves ; $ 50 for squaws ; $ 25 for children under fourteen ( although the latter two were ostensibly for live captives ) .
While the callous nature of this business might have limited the number of participants , the Panic of 1837 had left many pioneers and miners strapped for money , and scalp hunting offered a quick profit for men trying to reach California , and the bounty of one Indian was worth more than many Mexicans or Anglos could earn in a year .
It also provided financial rewards for a conflict that had begun before a price had been set on Indian blood .
The system was temporarily abandoned , but in 1841 it was revived due to continuos raiding ; one Comanche raiding party killed 300 Mexicans and seized over 18,000 head of livestock ( as well as countless women and children ) .
The situation continued to worsen for the Mexican authorities , and some historians have suggested that the natives actually " harvested " victims , leaving behind enough survivors and resources so that they could raid again .
At one point , the situation had gotten so bad that Apaches were killing Mexicans on the streets of Chihuahua City during the middle of the day .
In 1843 the authorities in Chihuahua tried to pit natives tribes against each other and offered Apache tribes a stipend if they would take the knife to the Comanches and stop raiding the state .
This plan obviously failed - the Apaches did take the stipend , but began raiding Sonora instead ( essentially the Mexicans were paying the tribe to raid other Mexicans ) - however , it reveals the desperation of the Mexican government .
By 1845 , the scalp bounty had be reinstated yet again , and Gov. Don Angel Trias of Chihuahua put out a $ 9000 reward on the chief of the Apaches - Don Santiago Querque .
At this point Querque / Kirker began working for the government scalping the natives that recently had been his allies .
After the Mexican - American War
Ironically , the Mexican peoples finally received relief from the Apache and Comanche raids when the U.S. declared war on Mexico ; the U.S. soldiers spent their spare time chasing and hunting the natives .
However , without the protection of Kirker and the other Anglos , Chihuahua was again besieged and in 1847 raised the price of scalps to $ 200 .
After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , most of the Mexican states revived their scalping bounties again in preparation for more raids ( there is little mention of the discontinuation of these bounties - I would speculate though that after the immediate threat was gone they were repealed until the attacks resumed ) .
In 1849 , Chihuahua 's " Ley Quinto , " which would remain on the books until 1886 , passed setting a price of $ 150 for live women and children , $ 200 for the scalps of warriors , and $ 250 for live warriors .
Most professionals though felt that the extra $ 50 did not justify the increased risk and so traded in " receipts " only .
Durango passed similar laws the same year , and in 1850 Sonora set the price at $ 150 for warriors and $ 100 for women and children under fourteen .
By mid-1850 Chihuahua and Sonora had included the Seri Indians on their hit lists too .
The details of the scalp bounty laws reveal that this wretched business was indeed a business with its own self - policing practices .
States , to prevent fraud , defined " scalps " to include one or both ears or the crown ( a fresh scalp could be stretched before it was dried and cut into up to a dozen " scalps " ) .
Regulatory committees were also established to examine scalps , but these were often bought off so that the scalps of children were purchased as adults , etc .
( As a brief aside , a method of scalping and preserving the receipts was dictated by several of the scalp hunters .
In James Kirker 's party the duties were relegated to the Shawnees in the group who would cut around the crown and then sit with their feet on the shoulders of the victim and yank the trophy from its place of origin .
The scalps were then sprinkled with salt and tied to poles to dry so that they would not deteriorate before they could be sold . )
The rather liberal payment policies of the local authorities made the scalp industry highly profitable .
Indian hunters could keep any livestock or loot they recovered , civilians , soldiers , Mexican nationals , and foreigners were all eligible , and unquestioning inspectors all enticed unscrupulous men into this business .
Mexican scalps were just as good as Indians , the scalps of women and children were bought for $ 100 ( although the law made no provisions for this ) , and the bounties were advertised both in Mexico and North of the Rio Grande .
Many of the scalp hunters were former Texas Rangers or forty - niners searching for quick cash .
Some of the more famous include Major Michael Chevallie , James Kirker , Capt .
Michael Box , John Glanton , and John Dusenberry .
Other Americans also participated for a different type of payment ; the state of Coahuila promised land to groups of Seminoles and a group of run-away slaves led by John Horse ( Juan Caballo ) in exchange for their services as Indian hunters .
Boom Time
The years of 1849 - 1850 were the true boom time , but an industry like this can obviously get out of hand ( if it did n't begin by being out of hand ) .
From the accounts it seems that no one in the South - west was safe during that year .
The recent war with Mexico and the dark hair of the Mexican farmers made the peons easy targets when Indian scalps became scarce or too dangerous to acquire .
Scalpers also began slaughtering any natives they could run down , including peaceful tribes like the Pimas and Yumas .
Kirker and Box supposedly made rather large profits hunting agricultural tribes along the Rio Grande and Sierra Madre .
Groups would also masquerade as natives and raid local villages , an act that served a dual purpose .
It reinforced the necessity of the bounty laws and provided scalps that could be then sold to the governors responsible for protecting the village .
The authorities did begin to notice that whenever Glanton or other hunting parties passed through a region , Indian activity always increased ; a fact that led to many hunters being run out of Mexico and eventually helped to ruin the industry .
Scalping as a business peaked that winter when the natives were driven out of the mountains in search of food ; in one raid in the Big Bend country Glanton supposedly took 250 scalps ( a fact that does n't appear in Chamberlain 's account , so it may have been another scalper ) .
By that spring though , Chihuahua alone had paid out over $ 17,000 to scalp hunters .
Many of the Mexican states found that they did not have the money to pay the scalping parties or that the expenditures were growing to a point where they would soon be bankrupt - another element that helped bring an end to the trade .
Bust
Scalp hunting was a high risk industry beyond just the battles required to attain scalps , and it eventually took its toll on the hunters .
Some native chiefs began offering bounties for the scalps of Mexicans and Anglos as a retaliatory effort ; Chief Gomez set the price at $ 1000 each after a similar bounty was put on his locks .
Scalpers even began scalping other Indian hunters ; payment could be collected from the natives if the Mexicans would n't accept the scalps .
In one gruesome hunting party comprised of Mexicans and Kickapoo Indians , a dispute between the two constituencies arose , and the Mexicans scalped ( and redeemed ) all of their native hunting ( former ) allies .
By the spring of 1850 , the hunters were facing a depletion of their resources , and many were being run out for their indiscretions with the Mexicans they were supposedly protecting .
Glanton found a reward on his head in Chihuahua and relocated to Sonora before the Yumas killed him .
Both Kirker and Box were run out of Chihuahua and Durango and ended up in California .
Although the laws stayed on the books until the 1880s , the industry as such had run its course ; violent confrontation continued in the guise of the Indian Wars until most of the tribes were subdued and confined to reservations .
Last Saturday , Honduran soldiers marched into the presidential palace , bundled up President Manuel Zelaya and put him on a plane for Costa Rica .
The ouster had been ordered by the Supreme Court and approved by the Congress , as Zelaya was attempting an illegal referendum to change the Honduran constitution so he could run for another term .
Will someone please explain why this bloodless transfer of power to the civilian legislator first in line for the presidency , in a sovereign nation , is any business of the United Nations , the Organization of American States , Hugo Chavez , the Castro brothers or Barack Obama ?
For all have denounced the “ coup ” and demanded Zelaya ’s immediate return .
The hypocrisy here is astounding .
Chavez was imprisoned for his bloody coup attempt in Venezuela in 1992 .
And to have Fidel Castro ’s dictatorship of half a century denouncing a glitch in the democratic process of a Western Hemisphere republic is beyond parody .
What percentage of the 200 member nations of that septic tank of anti-Americanism , the United Nations , are democracies ?
How many leaders of its member states came to power through free and fair elections ?
And what happened to the idea of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Western Hemisphere republics ?
At this writing , Honduras is not buckling .
“ We have established a democratic government , and we will not cede to pressure from anyone .
We are a sovereign country , ” said Roberto Micheletti , who was named caretaker president to serve out Zelaya ’s term , which ends this year .
Unlike Tehran , where hundreds of thousands protested the election , the streets of Tegucigalpa have remained calm .
No one has been shot , beaten with clubs or run down by thugs on motorcycles .
Just whose side is Barack on in Latin America ?
Though elected as a center - right candidate , Zelaya has moved into the orbit of Chavez , whose idea it was to change the Honduran constitution to get Zelaya another term .
Hugo even provided the ballots .
In Latin America , term limits have been written into constitutions to prevent a return to the time of the dictators and presidents - for - life .
The folks who put Zelaya aboard that plane are friends of the United States .
Why are Obama and Hillary Clinton meddling in the affairs of a friendly country , to dump over a friendly government , to reinstate a friend of Hugo ’s , whose goal is to bring Honduras into his anti-American “ Bolivarian Revolution ” ?
Like Barack ’s strange behavior in Trinidad , where he grinned away as Chavez handed him an anti-American tract , then listened for an hour to Daniel Ortega berate us for cruelty to Castro ’s Cuba , without protest or retort , Obama is coming off as one who shares the international left ’s view of the United States .
There is another issue raised by Obama ’s denunciation of our friends in Honduras .
Does he put ideology ahead of U.S. national interests ?
Does he prefer hostile democracies to friendly autocrats ?
What comes first with Obama ?
“ He may be an SOB , but he ’s our SOB , ” FDR said of one Latin dictator .
What FDR meant was that , in those grave times when Adolf Hitler , Benito Mussolini , Joseph Stalin and Japanese militarists ruled most of Eurasia , America must take her friends where she could find them .
In World War II , we welcomed the alliance with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , and the neutrality of the autocrats of Madrid and Lisbon .
We partnered with Stalin . Gen. Eisenhower cut a deal with Vichy ’s Adm. Darlan to get GIs safely ashore in North Africa .
From 1961 to 1979 , Park Chung - hee was an authoritarian ruler of South Korea who sent 50,000 troops to fight beside ours in Vietnam .
Was he not a better friend than Olof Palme of Sweden , Pierre Trudeau of Canada and Willy Brandt of Germany , who burnished their democratic credentials by scoring points off the United States ?
For most Cold War presidents , U.S. national interests always trumped democratist ideology .
Ike preferred the Shah to the democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh .
Richard Nixon preferred Gen. Pinochet to the elected Salvador Allende .
Even George Bush , who had pushed for Palestinian elections and insisted on Hamas ’ inclusion , perhaps because he thought they would lose , did a somersault when Hamas won .
How to explain the universality of the attacks on Honduras — when few United Nations members outside the West condemned Tehran and Hugo Chavez rushed to congratulate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — other than the fact that this “ coup ” removed an adversary of the United States ?
Anti-Americans stand by their own , no matter how they came to power , or retain power .
Only in the West do we seem always prepared to abandon our flawed friends who do not measure up .
This is a formula for eventually not having any friends .
That Obama finds himself in camp with Castro ’s Cuba , Ortega ’s Nicaragua and Chavez , who is openly threatening Honduras , should tell him something about where his ideology is taking him , and us .
One day , Obama is going to have to decide whether he wishes to be the darling of the international left or the unapologetic leader of the nation that is most resented and reviled by the international left .
Some might call it an enormous floating Prius , but others will call it a step in the right direction :
A new hybrid electric engine for US Navy ships that promises to save up to 12,000 barrels of oil a year per ship .
The folks who brought you the Predator unmanned flying aircraft , General Atomics , this week got $ 32.7 million to develop a proof - of - concept Hybrid Electric Drive ( HED ) system for a full - scale demonstration on board the Navy 's DDG 51 Class destroyers .

DDG 51 destroyers are powered by General Electric gas turbines capable of moving the ships along at over 30 knots or about 35 mph .
The General Atomics system would meld into this system and let the ship use electric power for slow - speed maneuvers .
The engines would provide more power as the ship needed to go faster .
Hybrid technology is n't as wild looking as adding football - sized kites to big ships , like the Beluga SkySails ship does , but it could do the job .
The Navy talked about the hybrid system in congressional testimony in July as a way to reduce costs in the destroyer program .
Such equipment would more fully interconnect the mechanical - drive components on each ship , producing a hybrid propulsion plant , the Navy said .
The addition of this equipment would reduce DDG - 51 ship fuel use by about 16 % .
This option would have an engineering cost of $ 17.1 million and a recurring cost ( including both equipment cost and installation cost ) of $ 8.8 million per ship , the Navy stated .
The Navy has paid a lot of attention to the DDG - 51 ships of late .
This month signed Boeing to a five - year , $ 42.9 million contract to upgrade and support the Gigabit Ethernet networks it is building on its guided missile destroyers .
The Navy 's Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System ( GEDMS ) upgrades the current 100 M bps fiber - based backbone network to a 1 Gbs redundant Ethernet mesh , bringing enhanced multimedia capability to the ships , the Navy said .
The GEDMS is the heart and soul of the guided missile ships and basically handles ship - wide data transfers and supports navigation , combat , alarm and indicating , and damage control systems .
It also is the underlying communications mechanism for the Aegis missile system which uses a system of radars to track and destroy targets .
According to the Navy , GEDMS was designed to replace the miles of point - to - point cabling , signal converters , junction boxes , and switchboards associated with conventional ship 's cabling .

Stephon Marbury , who becomes a free agent again today , believes star players should be cautious about signing with the Knicks because of Mike D’Antoni ’s offensive scheme and the way the organization treats people .
KNICKS MAY STRUGGLE TO GET POINT GUARDS

“ I would n’t want to play in that system , ” Marbury told The Post .
“ That system ca n’t win championships .
You ca n’t win championships if you do n’t talk about defense .
In Boston , the coaches even play defense . ”
Marbury said he believes being exiled for four months “ mentally damaged ” him and effected his Boston performance .
“ I knew it was n’t about money , ” Marbury said of his exile .

“ They spent 3 million on a 29th pick .
They could ’ve given $ 3 million to Anucha ( Browne - Sanders ) .
I knew it was personal .
It ’s about ego and power .
I ’ve never been so happy to be out of someplace .
The way I was treated , lied to , grown men doing this that have stature . ”
“ When Larry Brown saw me in Charlotte when we played them , he said , ‘ It looks like you died and went to heaven , ” ’ Marbury added .
“ I told him , now I know what you went through . ”
Marbury , who still does n’t have an agent , hopes to re-sign with Boston , though he ’s talked to his former coach , Washington ’s Flip Saunders .
Marbury also did not rule out Europe .
“ They get first dibs , ” Marbury said of the Celtics .
“ They did something for me , showed the NBA they won a championship and still brought someone in who was supposed to destructive to the locker room . ”
After his Knick buyout negotiations that dragged nearly four months , Marbury joined Boston in late February and never once got on the court together with his former mate , Kevin Garnett , who missed the playoffs .
The Celtics were eliminated in seven games by Orlando in the second round .
“ With Kevin coming back , the chances are the same , ” Marbury said .
“ If Kevin would ’ve been there , the outcome would ’ve been different .
Not taking anything away from the Lakers .
They ’re a great team as well . ”
The Celtics coaches loved Marbury ’s work on defense but never played free on offense .
Marbury said his rust was too much to overcome physically and he never could find his swagger .
“ Mentally , what I had to deal with , the process with D’Antoni , the president ( Donnie Walsh ) , it was mindboggling , ” Marbury said .
“ Two people ca n’t make a decision and they have to go above them to Mr. Dolan .
Mentally I was damaged and did n’t even realize it .
“ Going back next year , I ’ll be free .
When you ’re weathering the storm , you ’re not thinking how bad the storm is .
You ’re just holding on , trying to get through the finish . ”

Leo Tolstoy - Bees , from War and Peace
Leo Nikolayevich
Tolstoy , 1828 - 1910 , beekeeper , pacificist , writer , and philosopher , enjoyed beekeeping to such an extent that his wife sometimes worried about his sanity .
She should have realized that he was engaged in research for a book .
War and Peace : Chapter 20
Meanwhile , Moscow was empty .
There were still people in it , perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained , but it was empty .
It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty .
In a queenless hive no life is left , though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives .
The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives ; from a distance it smells of honey like the others , and bees fly in and out in the same way .
But one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it .
The bees do not fly in the same way , the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same .
To the beekeeper ’s tap on the wall of the sick hive , instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed , and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound , the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive .
From the alighting board , instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom , and the warm whiffs of crowded life , comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey .
There are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised , and ready to die in defense of the hive .
There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity , like the sound of boiling water , but diverse discordant sounds of disorder .
In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily .
They do not sting , but crawl away from danger .
Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive , and they flew out empty ; now they fly out laden .
The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in .
Instead of black , glossy bees - tamed by toil , clinging to one another ’s legs and drawing out the wax , with a ceaseless hum of labor - that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive , drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive .
Instead of a neatly glued floor , swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings , there is a floor littered with bits of wax , excrement , dying bees scarcely moving their legs , and dead ones that have not been cleared away .
The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super .
Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm , he sees the skillful complexstructures of the combs , but no longer in their former state of purity .
All is neglected and foul .
Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs , and the short home bees , shriveled and listless as if hey were old , creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers , having lost all motive and all sense of life .
Drones , bumblebees , wasps , and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight .
Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard .
Here and there a couple of bees , by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells , with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it .
In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting , or cleaning themselves , or feeding one another , without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent .
In a third place a crowd of bees , crushing one another , attack some victim and fight and smother it , and the victim , enfeebled or killed , drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather , among the heap of corpses .
The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells .
In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation , he sees hundreds of dull , listless , and sleepy shells of bees .
They have almost all died unawares , sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more .
They reek of decay and death .
Only a few of them still move , rise , and feebly fly to settle on the enemy ’s hand , lacking the spirit to die stinging him ; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales .
The beekeeper closes the hive , chalks a mark on it , and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean .
So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon , weary , uneasy , and morose , paced up and down in front of the Kammer - Kollezski rampart , awaiting what to his mind was a necessary , if but formal , observance of the proprieties - a deputation .
When Dr. George Tiller was gunned - down while attending church in May , Operation Rescue ’s Troy Newman was quick to issue a statement decrying the assassination and insisting that Tiller ’s murderer “ has never been a member , contributor , or volunteer with Operation Rescue . ”
In the days that followed , Newman made it clear that OR , which had been targeting Tiller for years , was not going to give up its anti-choice activism , saying “ Operation Rescue will not stand by and act as if this organization ’s Pro-Life message has been silenced by [ this ] egregious act ” and proclaiming that the organization “ will continue to advocate for the sanctity of human life , born and unborn . ”
Tiller was one of only three physicians in the country who performed the types of procedures that made him the focus of the anti-choice activist ’s protestations and harassment .
One of the others is LeRoy Carhart , the man at the center of the 2000 Supreme Court case Stenberg v. Carhart in which the court held that “ Nebraska ’s statute criminalizing the performance of ‘ partial birth abortion [s ] ’ violates the Federal Constitution . ”
So with Tiller now dead at the hands of an assassin , it looks as if Operation Rescue is now focusing its efforts entirely on Carhart :
A coalition of four pro-life groups have sent a letter to Nebraska Attorney General Jon Buning asking him to open a “ comprehensive ” investigation into late - term abortionist LeRoy Carhart and his Bellevue abortion clinic .
Signing the letter were Troy Newman of Operation Rescue headquartered in Wichita , Kansas , Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition in Washington , DC , Larry Donlan of Rescue the Heartland in Omaha , Nebraska , and Ann Bowen of Nebraskans United for Life , also of Omaha .
The group expressed concerns about the legality of certain aspects of Carhart ’s abortion business as well as concerns about the condition of Carhart ’s run-down abortion clinic that was damaged by an accidental fire earlier this year .
Carhart has indicated that he wants to begin doing risky third trimester abortions at his Bellevue clinic .
“ There is concern that this decision will create an unacceptable safety risk to women , ” the group stated in their letter dated July 6 , 2009 .
“ The safety of the public is our paramount concern , thus we are requesting the most comprehensive investigation of Carhart and his Nebraska abortion business as soon as possible from the Attorney General ’s office , and that your investigation not be limited solely to the concerns listed in this letter .
Women ’s lives and future health literally depend on it . ”
Troy Newman moved OR ’s “ offices to Wichita , Kansas in 2002 , where he began an intensive campaign to close George Tiller ’s abortion mill . ”
Any bets on how long it is before we see OR announce that it is relocating its offices to Bellevue , Nebraska ?
In East Java , Indonesia lies Kawah Ijen volcano , 2,600 meters tall ( 8,660 ft ) , topped with a large caldera and a 200 - meter - deep lake of sulfuric acid .
The quietly active volcano emits gases through fumaroles inside the crater , and local miners have tapped those gases to earn a living .
Stone and ceramic pipes cap the fumaroles , and inside , the sulfur condenses into a molten red liquid , dripping back down and solidifying into pure sulfur .
Miners hack chunks off with steel bars , braving extremely dangerous gases and liquids with minimal protection , then load up as much as they can carry for the several kilometers to the weighing station .
Loads can weigh from 45 to 90kg ( 100 - 200 lbs ) , and a single miner might make as many as two or three trips in a day .
At the end of a long day , miners take home approximately Rp50,000 ( $ 5.00 u.s. ) .
The sulfur is then used for vulcanizing rubber , bleaching sugar and other industrial processes nearby .

The Government was facing a growing credibility gap over green jobs last night as environmental campaigners and trade unionists united to fight the closure of Britain 's sole major wind turbine plant .
Only last week , ministers proclaimed a green employment future for the UK involving 400,000 jobs in environmental industries such as renewable energy – yet this week they are declining to intervene over the forthcoming closure of the Vestas Wind Systems plant on the Isle of Wight , with nearly 600 redundancies .
Workers at the Newport factory , which makes wind turbine blades , were last night staging their third night of occupation of the plant in an attempt to prevent the closure which is scheduled for 31 July .
In an alliance not seen before , they were being helped by climate - change campaigners who have set up an ad hoc camp outside the factory and yesterday helped to get food to the occupiers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Vestas , a Danish company which is the world 's biggest wind energy group , announced in April it was pulling out of the UK , citing the difficulties of getting wind farms built in Britain in the face of local " Nimby " opposition campaigns and the slowness of the planning system .
" A problem we are facing is our inability to get planning consent , " said a senior company executive .
" We needed a stable long - term market and that was not there in the UK .
We have made clear to the Government that we need a market .
We do not need money . "
Several weeks before the closure announcement , Vestas bosses led by the chief executive , Ditlev Engle , went to 10 Downing Street for a high - level meeting attended by the Energy and Climate Change Secretary , Ed Miliband , where they made specific demands for more direct government support .
When this was not forthcoming , the closure was announced .
While the Government may not have felt able to respond to what were in effect threats from a private manufacturing company , the consequence of allowing the country 's major wind energy manufacturing plant to fold has attracted ferocious criticism from the green movement .
This was not least because of the prospect that the 7,000 or so wind turbines Britain will install over the next decade to help meet its climate - change targets will have to come from abroad , even though last week both Mr Miliband and the Business Secretary , Lord Mandelson , launching the Government 's climate strategy , went to great lengths to stress the green business opportunities of Britain becoming a low - carbon economy .
" Last week Labour promised Britain would install thousands of wind turbines in the coming years .
Are ministers really now saying they 'd rather buy those turbines from abroad than make them here in the UK ? " said Robin Oakley , head of the Greepeace climate campaign .
" Letting this factory close is like a football manager saying he 's up for the cup then dropping his only goal scorer .
It just does n't make sense .
" It is factories like this and engineers like the ones occupying it that Britain desperately needs if ministers are serious about launching a green industrial revolution . "
Caroline Lucas , the Green Party leader and the Isle of Wight 's MEP , sent a message of support to the workers and called for immediate government intervention to save the factory from closure .
" The decision to close the facility represents a spectacular failure by government ministers to adequately promote green industries , and protect the future of manufacturing in this country , " she said .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , said : " This closure exposes the hollow truth of Labour 's climate change strategy . "
Five Labour MPs have already signed a Commons motion protesting against the closure .
A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the company had taken a commercial decision to reduce its production capacity across northern Europe .
She acknowledged there were " cultural and planning issues " behind the construction of wind farms , but promised they would be tackled by the climate strategy .
She said : " We are hopeful Vestas will go ahead with their plans for a research and development facility on the Isle of Wight which could provide up to a further 300 jobs and also help develop and test products that are suitable for the UK offshore market . "
Vestas erected a fence around the site in response to the protest .
Workers claimed it was being put up to stop food or drink being sent in .
One said : " We are convinced this is against the Human Rights Act because we are being denied humanitarian aid . "
Three protesters were arrested outside the site .
Hampshire Police said a 28 - year - old man from Southampton had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and a 49 - year - old man from Portsmouth was arrested on suspicion of a breach of the peace .
A London man , aged 38 , was arrested on suspicion of a breach of the peace and later released without charge .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I received an email this morning from Townhall.com entitled , “ ObamaCare Equals Government Funded Euthanasia ” with the above image .
I ’m sort of curious why they could n’t have just shown a picture of Obama with a gun to the baby ’s head .
It would have been more effective at getting their message across .
But then again , they might be concerned about losing the white male gun owner vote – ’ cause after all , its hard to maintain that Obama is both a liberal pansy ( who ’s the next Hitler and therefore is going to take away your guns ) and that he carries a Glock around so he can take out any infants he sees .
But I take this email to demonstrate that the right is now stepping up its blizzard of lies about the Democratic health care reform bill over the August recess .
Here ’s some context for the photo :
Everyone knows that nationalized healthcare is a terrible idea but everyday we unearth even more awful details in what is in the proposed government - run plan .
A nation of Terri Schiavos with a National Euthanasia Bill ?
In 2005 , a COURT ordered the removal of a feeding Tube from Terri Schiavo .
It outraged a nation .
If the Government takes over health care , bureaucrats will decide who lives and dies in America .
In the name of “ creating efficiencies , ” they will delay – or deny – treatment to critically ill patients because it costs too much .
We will have a NATION of Terri Schiavo ’s , with a faceless Federal Bureaucracy pulling the plug instead of a Court .!
Sound crazy ?
It happens every day in Great Britain .
You can STOP what will in effect be government sponsored euthanasia in America if you ACT NOW .
If you care about the Sanctity of Life , the proposed Government Takeover of Health Care is an attack on your values .
It ’s quite interesting that Town Hall would bring up Terri Schiavo – the pinnacle of right - wing overreach that helped alienate libertarians from the Republican camp – and that led the public to near unprecedented levels of agreement over the matter .
62 % of Americans favored removing the feeding tube – and 82 % of Americans believed that Congress and the President should have stayed out of the matter .
Yet Town
Hall – speaking only to its base – sees Schiavo as a rallying cry .
And not just to their base – they claim that the removal of the feeding tube , “ outraged a nation . ”
I wonder what it accomplishes to lie to your base and tell them that they are the real majority , aside from radicalizing them and alienating them from the American system .
But getting back to the substance of what they are claiming , they bring up a repeated right - wing canard – that :
If the Government takes over health care , bureaucrats will decide who lives and dies in America .
In the name of “ creating efficiencies , ” they will delay – or deny – treatment to critically ill patients because it costs too much .
So many inaccuracies – as , to start , the Democratic health care reform does n’t lead the government to take over health care .
At worst , it would lead to a government - provided health insurance .
And any health insurance – private or public – will deny treatment on occasion due to expense .
The problem with our status quo is that rationing occurs both by cost – depending on what insurance plan you have and by health insurance company bureacrats whose job it is to deny as many treatments as possible and / or to rescind your policy if they ca n’t deny the treatments .
That sounds a lot less like rationing and more like a war that health insurance companies are waging against the sick of America – a war in which their goal is to maximize their profits regardless of the cost to society or their paying customers .
As to the Democratic health care reforms endorsing government - funded abortion and euthanasia , I truly wonder who actually buys this load of crap .
Clearly , it is an attempt by Town Hall to manufacture outrage – but who is stupid enough to believe this ?
Too many people , I ’m sure .
Edit :
On reddit , criswell improves the image , writing :
Man , look at his eyes !
Obama sure hates that baby !
That pic is all kinds of win… .
But it could be better …
It may be too subtle for your average American …
It needs … something ….. Hmmmm ….

Four galaxies are involved in this pile - up 280 million light years from Earth .
The bright spiral galaxy at the center of the image is punching through the cluster at almost two million miles per hour .
That speeding galaxy may be what is causing the curved swath of X - rays , shown in blue near the center of the image , which were captured by NASA 's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory .
The three other yellowish galaxies in the collision are optically visible and were imaged by the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope on the summit of the dormant Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii .
The fifth , bluish galaxy on the lower left of the group is actually in the foreground of the image , around 40 million light years away from Earth , and not involved in the collision .
All together , the galaxies are known as Stephan 's Quintet , named after astronomer Édouard Stephan who discovered them in 1877 .

VIENNA , Jun 26 ( IPS )
While industrialised countries struggle to switch from climate - damaging , carbon - based energy to greener energy sources , much of the world is desperately energy poor , with 1.6 billion people having no access to electricity and 2.4 billion relying on wood and dung for heat and cooking .
“ Over 1.6 million deaths a year are attributed to indoor use of biomass for cooking and heating , ” Kandeh Yumkella , director - general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation ( UNIDO ) , told more than 600 participants from 80 countries at the Vienna Energy Conference this week in Austria ’s capital city .
The conference concluded with a recommendation to create a 20 - year plan to end energy poverty by 2030 .
Women and children in many parts of the world have little choice but to spend hours each day in search of firewood , trapped in a vicious cycle of deforestation that increases erosion and reduces the fertility of their land .
“ Energy interacts with all of the development challenges we face , ” said Yumkella .
The developing world – and especially those without access to electricity – must be part of the new green energy revolution , he said .
“ We ca n’t leave people out .
We must have climate justice and energy justice , ” he told IPS in an interview .

Just days after the BPI 's Geoff Taylor said that the industry screwed up in its handling of Napster , Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich indicates he has no such regrets , declaring his pride for his hand in the destruction of the file - sharing pioneer but giving credit to the Napster management for painting the band as greedy luddites .
In recent times it ’s become something of a trend in the music industry to admit that its handling of Napster left a lot to be desired .
Of course , everyone was telling them this exact same thing 10 years ago .
While some , such as the BPI ’s Geoff Taylor , have shown at least some sign of regret ( although not necessarily backed up by actions ) , others are adamant that crushing the file - sharing pioneer was the right thing to do .
Despite making some uncharacteristically pragmatic comments about P2P last year when his album ‘ Death Magnetic ’ appeared on the Internet , and despite trying file - sharing himself fairly recently when he downloaded the album using BitTorrent , Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has no regrets over his part in the neutering of Napster .
Ulrich and Metallica generated years of hate with their aggressive anti-Napster stance in the early part of the century , after discovering their entire back catalogue was available through the service .
But now , speaking with Kerrang ! , Ulrich says he did the right thing in bringing Napster down , standing firmly behind his decision , expressing pride where others today are expressing cautious regret .
“ Being right about Napster does n’t mean that much to me .
I do n’t find any particular glory in being proved right about it , ” he said .
Turning to Napster ’s management , Ulrich said he admired them for managing to paint the band as greedy rock stars who were behind the times , although it hardly seems fair to give Fanning and friends all the credit for that – the band did more than enough to nurture that impression too .
“ You have to give props to the other side because they did run a brilliant campaign , and they did portray me and Metallica as being greedy rock pigs and luddites who were completely behind what was happening technologically , ” said Ulrich .
“ But I am proud of what we did , and what we stood up for , ” he added .
Indeed , today ’s file - sharing community owes a debt of gratitude to Ulrich and Metallica , because without their efforts to destroy Napster there would n’t have been the massive effort by others to create the many improved replacements available today .
Sony ’s Patrick Seybold , Senior Director of Corporate Communications & Social Media for SCEA , has responded to the June NPD that released earlier tonight .
In his response , he claims that , “ PlayStation is delivering an unmatched caliber of content for the back half of the year ” and he is confident that the PlayStation brand is , “ on pace for another tremendous year ” .
“ Coming out of E3 , there ’s no doubt PlayStation is delivering an unmatched caliber of content for the back half of the year .
With positive momentum of PS3 hardware over the past two months , and continued enthusiasm for breakout exclusive games like inFAMOUS , we ’re on pace for another tremendous year across our platforms .
We ’re remaining focused on providing great entertainment to consumers and are confident in delivering again on that promise this year . ”
inFamous managed to sell 192k copies , only a month after its release , while Fight Night Round 4 sold a respectable 210 k copies in only a week of recorded sales .
On the hardware side , the PS3 sold 167k consoles , while the PSP and the PS2 sold 163k and 152k , respectively .
The 167k sold represents a 59 % drop over last June ’s numbers .
However , many critics fail to realize that the phenomenal Metal Gear Solid 4 release last June , bringing with it a plethora of new PS3 owners .
Compared with last month ’s numbers , which represented the month of May , the PSP sold 63,100 more units this month , while the PS3 and PS2 , respectively , sold 33,700 consoles and 35,700 consoles more this month .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military is rigging up satellite television service and distributing Sudoku puzzles in Guantanamo prison cells even as the Obama administration works toward a goal of emptying them of detainees .

The amusements are aimed at providing mental stimulation for the 240 remaining captives , whom human rights monitors and defense lawyers have said were being driven mad by years of isolation at the U.S. prison for suspected terrorists .
Plans were made as long as two years ago to add television and group recreation facilities , said Navy Commander Jeff Hayhurst , who led journalists on a tour on Sunday of the remote prison located on a U.S. naval base in southeast Cuba .
But because of logistical challenges at the prison , some of the plans are just now being implemented as the clock ticks down toward President Barack Obama ’s January deadline to shut down the detention operation .
“ Construction here is very difficult , ” said Hayhurst , who functions as the deputy warden .
All materials must be brought by barge to the sun - baked base and there is only a small pool of laborers available to do the work , he said .
Communist - ruled Cuba has long condemned the presence of the U.S. base on its soil as illegal .
Obama , who has called Guantanamo a blot on America ’s human rights record and an al Qaeda recruiting tool , sent a team of investigators to check out the detention camp in February .
Their conclusions echoed what the International Committee of the Red Cross has been saying for years -- that prisoners in the one - man cells needed more opportunities for social interaction and mental stimulation .
Eighty or so well - behaved captives who live in group dorms now have the chance to watch live satellite television , choosing from among three sports channels , al Jazeera ’s English channel and another Middle Eastern channel , Hayhurst said .
Satellite TV will be extended to the medium and maximum security camps within a month , he said .
“ We vet all of our channels very , very closely to ensure there is nothing that would incite the individuals here , ” he added .
NEWSPAPERS AND SUDOKU
The group - camp captives have long been allowed to eat communal meals on picnic tables outside their dorms and play soccer and basketball together in a central recreation yard .
The medium - security camp 6 has recently been reconfigured to allow groups of prisoners to play soccer together outside and mingle at steel tables at the center of their cellblocks .
Journalists could see nine prisoners chatting and sipping water in one such area , unshackled , but under the watch of several guards .
About half of Guantanamo ’s 240 prisoners are now in some kind of communal environment , Hayhurst said .
In the maximum - security camp 5 , a concrete hulk with one - man cells , prisoners are now allowed occasional group “ feast meals , ” seated on the floor in adjoining outdoor recreation pens , Hayhurst said .
They are separated by fences , but are still able to dine and pray together .
“ If they have the choice between socializing and not ... they ’re probably not doing other things that we do n’t want them to do , such as assaulting guards , ” Hayhurst said .
Prisoners now have access to newspapers , albeit censored , choosing from among USA Today and two Arabic - language papers .
Some attend classes in Arabic , Pashto , English and art once or twice a week , often wearing ankle chains bolted to the floor .
All get sketch pads , colored chalk and puzzle books now , Hayhurst said .
Copies of a Sudoku collection compiled by New York Times puzzle master Will Shortz could be seen lying on the cots in some cells .
It is difficult to gauge the impact of the changes on the captives ’ behavior and journalists are not allowed to speak to the prisoners themselves .
Hayhurst said that for first time in 20 months , the camp recently went four whole days without any assaults on guards .
But the respite was followed by four assaults in a single day involving urine - feces cocktails , the weapon of choice among Guantanamo ’s inmates .
One group of maximum security prisoners in the outdoor recreation cages were clearly not feeling the new spirit of sociability as a group of journalists walked by with their military escorts .
“ All you are criminals .
Go away .
Go away , ” they shouted .
It ’s a nice idea , and to do it properly requires some knowledge of option theory as developed by the economists Fischer Black of Goldman Sachs , Myron S. Scholes of Stanford and Robert C. Merton of Harvard .
You type into some formula the current stock price , and this tells you how many shares to hold .
The market falls and you type the new price into the formula , which tells you how many to sell .
By 1987 , however , the problem was the sheer number of people following the strategy and the market share that they collectively controlled .
If a fall in the market leads to people selling according to some formula , and if there are enough of these people following the same algorithm , then it will lead to a further fall in the market , and a further wave of selling , and so on  until the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index loses over 20 percent of its value in single day : Oct. 19 , Black Monday .
Dynamic portfolio insurance caused the very thing it was designed to protect against .
This is the sort of feedback that occurs between a popular strategy and the underlying market , with a long - lasting effect on the broader economy .
A rise in price begets a rise .
( Think bubbles . )
And a fall begets a fall .
( Think crashes . )
Volatility rises and the market is destabilized .
All that ’s needed is for a large number of people to be following the same type of strategy .
And if we ’ve learned only one lesson from the recent financial crisis it is that people do like to copy each other when they see a profitable idea .
Such feedback is not necessarily dangerous .
Take for example what happens with convertible bonds  bonds that can be converted into stocks at the option of the holder .
Here a hedge fund buys the bond and then hedges some market risk by selling the stock itself short .
As the price of the stock rises , the relevant formula tells the fund to sell .
When the stock falls the formula tells it to buy  the exact opposite of what happens with portfolio insurance .
To the outside world  if not necessarily to the hedge fund with the convertible bonds  this mix is usually seen as a good thing .
Thus the problem with the sudden popularity of high - frequency trading is that it may increasingly destabilize the market .
Hedge funds wo n’t necessarily care whether the increased volatility causes stocks to rise or fall , as long as they can get in and out quickly with a profit .
But the rest of the economy will care .
Buying stocks used to be about long - term value , doing your research and finding the company that you thought had good prospects .
Maybe it had a product that you liked the look of , or perhaps a solid management team .
Increasingly such real value is becoming irrelevant .
The contest is now between the machines  and they ’re playing games with real businesses and real people .
An atheist group is planning to recruit school kids to teach them how to damage religious activity in schools .
Children will be encouraged to undermine the role of Christian assemblies and the way RE is taught .
They will also be trained to lobby local authorities about these issues .
The National Federation of Atheist , Humanist and Secular Student Societies ( AHS ) will launch the recruitment drive in the summer .
It will coincide with an atheist summer camp for kids .
The move has the backing of prominent atheists , Richard Dawkins and AC Grayling .
News of the atheist recruitment drive was broken by The Sunday Telegraph ’s religion correspondent , Jonathan Wynne - Jones .
Richard Dawkins attacked the story on his blog , richarddawkins.net , accusing Mr Wynne - Jones of “ Lying for Jesus .
Not for the first time . ”
He said he could find no evidence that the AHS were launching an initiative in schools .
But later , the AHS confirmed that they were intending to target schools .
To which Mr Dawkins said he was “ delighted ” .
The AHS is also actively working on University campuses .
The group claims to be aware of 25 atheist societies at colleges – up from seven a year ago .
Chloë Clifford - Frith is press officer of the AHS .
She is concerned that Christian Unions in schools and universities are teaching young people about creation and saying homosexuality is wrong .
She said : “ We want to point out how silly some of these beliefs are and hope that these groups will help to do that . ”
AC Grayling , the philosopher and writer , said : “ As well as making the case for reason and science , it is great to know that the AHS will be standing up against religious privilege and discrimination .
“ The AHS shows that increasing numbers of young people are unwilling to put up with it . ”
The Christian Institute ’s Simon Calvert responded : “ Atheists are becoming increasingly militant in their desperate attempts to stamp out faith .
“ It is deeply worrying that they now want to use children to attack the Christian ethos of their schools .
“ Many parents will also be anxious at the thought of militant atheists targeting their children . ”
July 1 , 2009  --
If a U.S. Food and Drug Administration expert panel has its way , prescription pain killers , like Vicodin and Percocet that contain acetaminophen will be eliminated from the country 's formularies .
Yet , the very same panel voted to keep over - the - counter combination pills containing acetaminophen on the shelves .
Those recommendations are only two of 10 concerning acetaminophen the panel made , including one to lower the maximum dosage of over - the - counter pain medications that contain acetaminophen , like Tylenol .
A joint panel of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee , Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee , and the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee voted on the issues after two days of considering ways to reduce the liver damage risk of acetaminophen , the most commonly used painkiller in the country .
The recommendations are not binding , but the FDA usually adopts them .
It 's no clear when the FDA will announce a final decision .
The panel voted 24 to 13 against a proposal to remove over - the - counter combination drugs from the shelves .
This would save drugs that combine acetaminophen and other drugs like caffeine like Excederin , and a wide variety of popular cough - and - cold combinations .
About 42,000 people visit emergency departments each year with acetaminophen overdoses , half of which are accidental .
They often occur when a consumer unknowingly takes more than one acetaminophen product .
Doctors were largely split in their opinions over the votes -- and the fault lines appeared to follow their areas of expertise and the kind of patients they treat .
Liver disease experts largely applauded the recommendations .
Dr. William Lee , chair of the liver diseases department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas , said he was " highly gratified " by the outcome of the votes limiting acetaminophen use .
Doctors Differ on Acetaminophen Recommendations
" Acetaminophen kills more people annually in the United States than all other prescription drugs combined , " Lee said .
" That it is [ available ] over - the - counter , sold in quantities up to 1,000 tablets , and has been advertised for years as being remarkably safe never made sense .
However , some pain management doctors voiced their confusion over the seemingly contradictory recommendations .
" I think that combo products are generally a bad idea -- that is , the idea of giving two or more drugs in fixed ratios , " said Dr. Elliot Krane , director of the Pain Management Service at Stanford University 's Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital .
But he said that he remains baffled as to why the panel would not recommend eliminating acetaminophen from over - the - counter ( OTC ) combo products as well .
" I 'm puzzled by the ' no ' vote here , if 10 percent of [ overdoses ] come from these products , " Krane said .
" That 's a substantial fraction .
Why would they not extend the same safety measure to OTC products ? "
Other pain physicians noted similar confusion .
" The inconsistency is that they do n't address the over the counter combination products -- the ' all - in - one ' combinations of cough , ' congestion ' and ' fever ' products that have acetaminophen , and only reveal the amount of acetaminophen in really small print on the back , " said Dr. Timothy Collins of the Pain and Palliative Care Clinic at Duke University Medical Center .
" These products are the ones that have given me concern with my own patients , because many patients are not aware that their ' cold , cough and fever ' product has acetaminophen in it , and take it along with their pain medications . "
Meanwhile , family practitioners and rheumatologists -- those who regularly prescribe acetaminophen - containing medicines to their patients -- expressed some concerns over the recommendation that would eliminate medicines like Vicodin and Percocet .
" I do not think eliminating combination products is necessary and that the vote to do so goes too far , " noted Dr. Randy Wexler , assistant professor of clinical family medicine at the Ohio State University Medical Center .
" Combination products , especially in caring for patients with chronic pain , are important . "
Panel Suggests OTC Acetaminophen Combos Remain Available
At the press conference that followed the votes , members of the FDA panel had the opportunity to address the question as to why they would recommend eliminating prescription acetaminophen combos , but not their OTC counterparts .
" It seems to me that the problems with [ prescription ] opioid combinations are really more prevalent , " said Dr. Gerald Dal Pan , director of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology , for the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ( CDER ) .
" The data presented shows that here were many deaths annually in this country from the prescription of combination acetaminophen products , whereas the number of deaths that can be clearly related to the over the counter products appears to be much more limited . "
Because the split on the prescription acetaminophen combo vote was so close , it is unclear whether the FDA will adopt the recommendation , as the FDA does not have to follow the advice of its advisory committees .
But if it did , some options would be eliminated for pain patients .
For instance , patients taking Vicodin would not have an acetaminophen - free option because there is no hyrdocodone - only formula .
Black Box May Be Imminent for Acetaminophen
What is far less uncertain is that the advisory panel 's votes could mean big changes for acetaminophen .
In particular , the panel voted 36 to 1 to recommend a " black box " warning for prescription medications that combine acetaminophen with another drug .
If the FDA follows the advice , it would slap its strictest warning on prescription pain medications that combine acetaminophen with hydrocodone ( Vicodin ) , oxycodone ( Percocet ) , or codeine ( Tylenol 3 ) .
Meanwhile , a less - than - overwhelming 21 to 16 majority voted to recommend that the FDA lower the maximum daily dose for acetaminophen below its current 4,000 mg .
It also voted that to lower single adult dose to 650 mg .
While there is a 650 mg extended - release acetaminophen tablet , the most common is the 325 mg pill , so patient would be instructed to take no more than two at a time .
Company Disagrees With Dose Recommendations for Acetaminophen
The committee voted 24 to 13 to recommend making the 500 mg pill available by prescription only .
So , in order to get former maximum dose of 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at one time , a patient would need a prescription .
The dosage restrictions prompted dismay from McNeil Consumer Healthcare , the makers of Tylenol .
" McNeil Consumer Healthcare strongly disagrees with the committee 's recommendation , " the company said in a statement .
" McNeil Consumer Healthcare believes that this recommendation is likely to lead to more serious adverse events as consumers shift to other over - the - counter products such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) in search of pain relief . "
No matter the final outcome of the recommendations , however , consumers will still be able to get acetaminophen .
Twenty - nine billion extended units ( tablets / capsules / milliliters ) of prescription and over - the - counter , acetaminophen - containing products were sold through retail and non-retail pharmacies in 2005 , according to the FDA .
The FDA has struggled with the issue of acetaminophen 's safety since at least 1977 , when an agency committee suggested that labels for pain relievers contain a warning that they can damage a patient 's liver .
Mark Cavendish ’s hopes of winning the green jersey were dealt a severe blow when he was relegated to last place in the bunch at the end of stage 14 to Besançon .
The Isle of Man sprinter went into the day just five points adrift of Thor Hushovd ( Cervélo ) , but a frantic and confusing finale saw the Columbia - HTC team miss out on two fronts .

Early in the day , before the first intermediate sprint , Cavendish got in a break but decided not to persist with it .
Later a 12 - man break got clear , with his team - mate George Hincapie in it .
The break ’s lead went up to more than 10 minutes with Hincapie the best - placed , 5 - 25 minutes down on Rinaldo Nocentini .
The gap came down slowly , offering Hincapie a chance of taking the jersey .
Serguei Ivanov surged clear of the break to win the stage alone , and Hincapie crossed the line 16 seconds later in eighth place .
Then all eyes were on the clock .
And boy , was it going to be close .
The thing was , Columbia also needed to set up the sprint for Cavendish for him to gain points on Hushovd .
He needed to win the bunch sprint for 13th place , and hope that Hushovd slipped up .
But Columbia also wanted to stall the pace in the bunch to give Hincapie a chance of a day of glory .
Cavendish won the bunch sprint , crossing the line in 13th place .
For Hincapie , they crossed the line six seconds too soon .
Rinaldo Nocentini kept yellow .
However , in the final metres Cavendish drifted slightly to his right as he was looking over his left shoulder , expecting Hushovd to try to pass him on that side .
His movement steered Hushovd into the barriers and the Norwegian had to brake as he crossed the line to finish 14th , shouting at Cavendish as he did .
Cervélo complained and the race jury agreed .
Cavendish was relegated to 154th place and therefore won no points .
Now Cavendish trails Hushovd by 18 points with precious few oportunities to make up the deficit .
In a statement released by his team , Hushovd said ; “ [ Cavendish ] tried to push me in the barriers .
I could pass him , and when he saw me coming , he pushed me into the barriers .
That ’s not fair game .
I am really tired of this .
That ’s why we put in a protest , so I hope he is going to be disqualified on the stage . ”
“ It was the first time today , when I saw what happened , I could n’t believe it .
Today I can not accept it .
That ’s not correct what he did today .
I had to brake .
I could have passed him , but I had to brake .
It ’s OK if he ’s faster than me , I accept it , when he does n’t follow the rules , then that ’s not good . ”
Cavendish said nothing in public .
He got in the Columbia bus immediately , although it ’s a safe bet to say he ’s livid .
His team mate and lead out man Mark Renshaw said on his Twitter feed ; “ We sprinted in line with the barrier , Its not our fault the barrier was uneven on the right .
Come on ASO , make them even in the last 1 km . ”
The Briton is now playing catch up .
There are intermediate sprints to fight for , but with Hushovd riding so strongly the chance of narrowing the gap significantly in the Alps is very slim .
Friday ’s stage to Aubenas has a second - category climb near the finish and the way Hushovd has been riding , he could get over it and score more points .
If the gap remains 18 going into the final stage to the Champs - Elysees , Cavendish will have to win and hope Hushovd is outside the top ten .
It ’s a very tall order .
It is now conceivable that Cavendish could win five stages of the Tour but fall short in the green jersey competition .

( CNN ) -- A 6.7 - magnitude earthquake hit near the Greek island of Crete on Wednesday , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
It struck at 12:30 p.m. ( 5:30 a.m. ET ) , the USGS said .
It was centered about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) off the city of Iraklion on Crete , the USGS said .
An earthquake with a 6.7 magnitude is capable of causing significant damage , especially in areas of poor construction .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
A staff member at Iraklion Airport told CNN they did n't feel the earthquake .
Similar reports came from staff members at hotels just outside Iraklion and in western Crete .
A spokesman at the Greek Ministry of Health in Athens , 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) from the epicenter , also said he did n't feel the quake .
David Booth , a seismologist at the British Geological Survey , explained that the earthquake happened deep below the sea , leading to little risk of tsunami and reducing the likelihood that people would feel tremors .
-- CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Krsna Harilela in London , England , contributed to this report .
He did , posting a time of 3:28 .
Nadine Rihani of Nashville ran her first marathon at age 61 , taking walk breaks .
Her running friends urged her to adopt more traditional training , and she was eventually sidelined by back and hip pain .
So she resumed run -walk training , and in April , at age 70 , she finished first in her age group in the Country Music Marathon , coming in at 6:05 .
“ My friends who were ‘ serious ’ runners said , ‘ You do n’t need to do those walk breaks , ’ ” she said .
“ I found out the hard way I really did . ”
Dave Desposato , a 46 - year - old financial analyst , began run -walk training several years ago after excessive running resulted in an overuse injury .
He finished this year ’s Bayshore Marathon in Traverse City , Mich. , in 3:31:42 , cutting 12 minutes off his previous best .
“ I run enough marathons now to see everybody totally collapsing at the end is very , very common , ” he said .
“ You wish you could share your experience with them , but they have to be willing to listen first . ”
Another unconventional element of walk - break training is the frequency  typically just three days a week , with two easy runs of 20 to 60 minutes each and a long run on the weekend .
The walk breaks allow runners to build up their mileage without subjecting their bodies to the stress of daily running , Mr. Galloway said .
Many runners take their own version of walk breaks without thinking about it , he says : they slow down at water stations or reduce their pace when they tire .
Scheduling walk breaks earlier in a run gives the athlete control over the race and a chance to finish stronger .
While I ’m planning to use run -walk training to complete my first marathon , I ’ve heard from many runners who adhere to a variety of training methods .
So later this week , the Well blog will have a new feature : the Run Well marathon training tool , with which you can choose any of several coaches ’ training plans and then track your progress .
“ Joel Fights Back , ” proclaims the website for Joel Tenenbaum , the Boston University grad student standing trial for copyright infringement this week in a federal courtroom .
But today , when he took the stand at his closely watched copyright trial , he did n’t .
Instead , over and over , Tenenbaum admitted under oath that he used KaZaA , LimeWire , and other peer - to - peer software to download and distribute music to others unknown .
“ This is me .
I ’m here to answer , ” said Tenenbaum .
“ I used the computer .
I uploaded and downloaded music .
This is how it is .
I did it , ” he testified before a packed courtroom , whose spectators included an all - star cast of Harvard Law School copyright scholars : Lawrence Lessig , John Palfrey , and Jonathan Zittrain .
“ Are you admitting liability for all 30 sound recordings ” on which the record labels brought suit , asked the plaintiffs ’ attorney Tim Reynolds .
“ Yes , ” said Tenenbaum .
Tenenbaum then admitted that he “ lied ” in his written discovery responses , the ones in which he denied responsibility .
“ Why did you lie at that point ? ” asked Tenenbaum ’s attorney , Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson .
“ It was kind of something I rushed through , ” responded Tenenbaum .
“ It ’s what seemed the best response to give . ”
At the time he gave the admittedly false discovery responses , Tenenbaum testified that he was being advised by his mother Judith , a family law attorney who works for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .
A directed verdict ?
Given Tenenbaum ’s clear - cut admissions , plus the other evidence linking the defendant to the alleged infringement , plaintiffs moved at the end of their presentation for a directed verdict in their favor under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 on the issues of copyright ownership , liability , and willfulness .
Judge Nancy
Gertner gave every indication that she will grant the motion as to ownership and liability , taking away from the jury the basic issue of whether Tenenbaum infringed the plaintiffs ’ copyrights .
“ For all intents and purposes , the ownership and liability issues have been conceded , ” she said , suggesting wilfullness was a closer call .
Judge Gertner promised a ruling on all three issues Friday morning .
Later Thursday , Judge Gertner , " out of an abundance of caution , " denied the plaintiffs ' motion for a directed verdict on the issues of liability and wilfullness , leaving them to be decided by the jury .
She did grant their motion as to copyright ownership , which Tenenbaum never disputed .
During Tenenbaum ’s testimony , plaintiffs ’ attorney Tim Reynolds walked Tenenbaum methodically through the evidence , extracting scores of one , two , and three - word admissions that he did exactly what plaintiffs have accused him of doing .
“ You used KaZaA to download music , right ? ”
“ You used LimeWire to get music without paying for it , right ? ”
“ Your goal was to obtain the maximum amount of music with the minimum amount of wasted effort , right ? ”
“ Yes . ” “ I did . ”
“ Yes , I did , ” Tenenbaum said calmly , over and over and over , in response to Reynolds ’ questions .
Tenenbaum admitted that the screenshots captured by MediaSentry in August 2004 , showing over 800 song files in his KaZaA shared folder , were accurate representations of the contents of that folder .
He admitted that he listened to his copies of all 30 songs he is accused of downloading and distributing — negating Nesson 's suggestion that some of them were actually fake files , “ spoofs ” put on peer - to - peer networks by copyright owners to frustrate users trying to obtain music for free .
And Tenenbaum accepted all of the conclusions of plaintiffs ’ computer forensics expert , Dr. Douglas Jacobson , as true .
“ I trust he ’s a competent professional , ” said Tenenbaum .
Under cross-examination by his own attorney , Tenenbaum was more expansive .
He recounted his long - time love of music and growing up in a family where all members played an instrument .
“ They forced us to play piano , ” he said of his parents .
And Tenenbaum insisted he never had any intent to harm the record labels , and certainly not the artists themselves , for whom he expressed great affection .
Tenenbaum smiled broadly as he recounted the joy of first encountering Napster : “ It was great It was like this giant library in front of you with all sorts of songs ...
It ’s all up there ...
It ’s like the Google of music ...
You have this list of songs , and you can get them really easily . ”
Did he consider whether it was legal ?
“ I guess it was n’t foremost in my mind ...
Now I ’m thinking a lot more about whether it ’s illegal , " he replied .
Plaintiffs wrap things up
After Tenenbaum left the stand in the early afternoon , plaintiffs called Ron Wilcox , an attorney and long - time digital music executive now at Warner Music Group , who guided the jurors through the industry ’s efforts to sell music on the Internet , from the early days of MusicNet and Pressplay , through iTunes , and to what he sees as an all - digital future .
“ Our total focus and attention is on ” digital distribution , said Wilcox , who was called to counter the defense ’s suggestion that Tenenbaum ’s use of peer - to - peer was justified by the labels ’ alleged failure to provide legal alternatives .
“ There ’s no fear of technology , ” said Wilcox , who spent 25 years at Sony Music before joining Warner early this year .
But the digital marketers are “ always in a position of chasing free . ”
Rounding out the day was Warner Music attorney Silda Palerm , who spent less than ten minutes on the stand confirming WMG ’s ownership of such songs as Green Day ’s “ Minority , ” which was found in Tenenbaum ’s KaZaA shared folder .
With that , plaintiffs rested their case .
Defendants have said they intend to call to the stand Tenenbaum ’s mother and Dutch computer scientist Johan Pouwelse .
But it is unclear what purpose either of these witnesses would serve , given the concessions made by the defense today .
In any event , Tenenbaum ’s attorneys said they would finish their presentation by mid-morning Friday .
Then , following closing arguments and jury instructions , the five men and five women of the jury will be sent off to deliberate .
The only tough issue left for the jury to decide will be damages , which could range from $ 750 per work up to $ 30,000 per work , or up to $ 150,000 per work if they find that Tenenbaum ’s infringement was willful .
In yet another blow to the defense , Judge Gertner said she will instruct the jury that “ willful infringement is that committed with knowledge of or ‘ reckless disregard ’ for the plaintiffs ' copyrights , ” rejecting a heightened standard urged by Tenenbaum that would have required a showing of Tenenbaum ’s intent to profit commercially .

The bill 's chief sponsor , Sen. Floyd Prozanski ( D - Eugene ) , had this to say after the House vote :
" I am glad that Oregon has joined the list of states that have agreed that American farmers should have the right to re-introduce industrial hemp as an agricultural crop .
By passing SB 676 with strong bi-partisan support , the Oregon Legislature has taken a proactive position to allow its farmers the right to grow industrial hemp , to provide American manufacturers with domestically - grown hemp , and to profit from that effort . "
American manufacturers are indeed profiting from hemp .
Oregon 's own Living Harvest ( hemp milk , ice cream , and oil ) this month was named the third fastest growing Oregon company by the Portland Business Journal ( article subscription only ) .
Living Harvest 's CEO , Hans Fastre , on the Oregon bill 's passage :
" We are looking forward to the opportunity to invest in hemp processing and production locally .
This bill represents another step towards heightening the hemp industry 's profile within mainstream America and making hemp products more accessible to businesses and consumers . "
The Hemp Industries Association ( HIA ) estimates current North American annual retail sales of hemp food and body care products to be $ 113 million - 2008 annual retail sales of all hemp products in North America are estimated to be about $ 360 million .
When , not if , farming industrial hemp is re-recognized by the federal government as legitimate , these numbers will soar - to the direct financial benefit of US farmers , companies , and workers .
The Obama administration ought to take notice .
With a nimble shift in policy on something as innocuous as hemp , Obama can help pave the way for an important component to the nation 's green economic and agricultural recovery .
Updatex2
Thanks to all - first time on rec list - feels good !
And , thanks for amplifying the word on industrial hemp , helping to carry the momentum forward .
For past pieces with background on industrial hemp , go here and here .
To sum up the legal status quo in the US , Oregon 's hemp bill builds upon the pressure states are applying to the federal government - via passing legislation - to shift its current policy banning viable industrial hemp seeds since 1970 .
Under the Controlled Substances
Act the seeds are included in the definition of " marihuana " - a Schedule 1 controlled substance .
All it would take is the Obama administration re-interpreting " marihuana " to not include industrial hemp and leave it to states to regulate this important crop .
States demanding this change , and all other efforts , can only help thereby hastening a shift in the current , very absurd US industrial hemp paradigm .
Please consider supporting HIA and Vote Hemp 's efforts .
Worried about a harrowing , inflation - ridden future , Scott Van Steyn has found the answer in a batch of glittering one - ounce gold coins .
In fact , they make up a large chunk of the physician ’s assets .
“ There ’s 2,000 years of history to show that gold is the best thing to own during bad inflation , ” says Dr. Van Steyn , a 45 - year - old orthopedic surgeon in Columbus , Ohio .
“ People used to laugh at me for buying gold .
They do n’t anymore . ”

“ Rand predicted what would happen 50 years ago , ” says Mr. Allison , who notes that his bank was forced to take the money , which he labels “ a rip - off . ”
“ It ’s a nightmare for anyone who supports individual rights . ”
But as cringe - inducing as the government ’s actions may be for objectivists like him , there is a silver lining : sales of “ Atlas Shrugged , ” which Ms. Rand considered her definitive work , are better than ever .
In the first six months of 2009 , Penguin Books shipped more than 300,000 copies of the book , which opens with the famous question , “ Who is John Galt ? ”
That ’s 25 percent more than in all of 2008 .
“ It ’s just gone through the roof , ” said Kara Welsh , publisher for the New American Library , a division of Penguin .
There ’s even a renewed effort to make a miniseries out of the book .
The studio Lionsgate , along with the producers Howard and Karen Baldwin , hope to begin shooting as early as next spring .
“ It is incredibly timely , ” said Michael Burns , vice chairman of Lionsgate .
While book sales have n’t translated into a flood of new converts to objectivism , Yaron Brook , president of the Ayn Rand Institute , said attendance at this year ’s Objectivist Summer Conference in Boston  where Mr. Allison delivered his speech  was the best yet for an East Coast event .
( Attendance at conferences on the West Coast , where the institute is based , tends to be 25 percent higher , he says . )
Among the participants was Dr. Shira Miller , who became interested in Ms. Rand ’s writing in college .
She says objectivism continues to provide her with “ a moral philosophy for how to live a good and happy life . ”
Dr. Miller , who practices age - management medicine in Los Angeles , does n’t accept Medicare or health insurance so there can be no third - party interference with her individual rights or those of her patients , she says .
“ Medicine is a product just like any other , ” says Dr. Miller , likening it to toasters , computers or legal advice .
“ I should have the right to sell or trade it on my own terms , just like any other business owner . ”

At some point , every language design has to end .
The design of Java , for example , includes constructs from for loops to inner classes , but does not include a foreach construct , a lex / yacc - style parser - generator form , call - by - reference methods , or many other constructs .
Macro systems let programmers continue where language designers left off and extend languages with new constructs .
Furthermore , macro- extended languages continue to work with the basic tool chain in contrast to lex - and yacc - style language extensions , for example , which require modified code generators , makefiles , and the like .
Finally , if the macro system uses patterns to specify language extensions , macros are easily defined and understood in terms of a simple rewriting process .
One apparent drawback of pattern - based macros is that they cannot express interesting language extensions , such as new forms of variable binding or new forms of control .
Macros in C are certainly limited in this regard , but pattern - based macros can be considerably more expressive in principle .
In this article , we show how pattern - based macros in Scheme can express interesting language extensions , such as a call - by - reference extension of a call - by - value language .
A second drawback of macros in general is that they interact poorly with programming tools , such as type checkers and debuggers , which have difficulty correlating a program 's original source and its macro- expanded version .
Again , C macros certainly exhibit this problem , but Scheme macros play well with source - correlating tools , and they play well for much the same reason that they can implement interesting language extensions .
Scheme macros thus provide a foundation for building little languages that fit neatly into existing programming environments .
Pattern - Based Macros
Most programmers are familiar with C - style pattern - based macros .
In general , pattern - based macro definitions include pattern variables that match syntax fragments in a macro use .
To expand a macro use , each pattern variable in the macro's template is replaced by the matching syntax fragment .
For instance , in the ever - popular swap in Example 1 ( a ) , the swap( x , y ) part is the pattern , x and y are pattern variables , and the {int tmp=y ; y=x ; x=tmp ;} part is the template .
Example 1 ( b ) matches the pattern swap( x , y ) , where x is matched to c.red and y is matched to d-> blue .
Expansion proceeds by substituting c.red for x and d-> blue for y in the template , producing Example 1 ( c ) .
Although C macros are easy to understand , they have a deservedly poor reputation in that expansion is the only way to understand the macro .
In particular , Example 1 ( d ) expands to Example 1 (e ) , which does not actually swap the values in tmp and other .
The underlying problem is that the macro system manipulates plaintext instead of structured syntax fragments .
As a result , the macro cannot implement your true intent , which is to have a private temporary variable , and it cannot help programming tools accurately relate the original source and its macro- expanded version .
These problems with C macros are absent from Scheme 's macro system .
Scheme Macro Basics
For simple tasks , Scheme macros look similar to C macros .
The C macro header in Example 2 ( a ) translates to Scheme as in Example 2 ( b ) .
The syntax - rules part of the definition indicates that the macro takes " arguments , " just as the parentheses after swap in C indicate a macro with arguments .
A C macro with arguments matches only one pattern a certain number of comma-separated elements within parentheses .
In contrast , a Scheme macro can match multiple patterns , and each pattern can have a specific structure , such as auxiliary keywords or nested parentheses .
Therefore , syntax - rules in a macro definition is followed by a sequence of auxiliary keywords ( to distinguish them from pattern variables ) , then a sequence of pattern - template pairs .
For swap , you have no keywords and you have only one pattern , as in Example 2 ( c ) .
A use of swap such as in Example 3 ( a ) roughly expands to Example 3 ( b ) , which is Scheme notation for introducing a local variable tmp 1 , then assigning y=x and x=tmp 1 .
In other words , let acts like a new block for variable bindings , and set !
acts like " = " for assignment .
The macro system adds the subscript in tmp 1 to indicate that tmp was introduced by the macro , and it has no relationship to other existing syntax .
Thus , even if swap is used with a variable named tmp , as in Example 3 ( c ) , this use of swap behaves as expected because the variables tmp and tmp 1 are different in the expansion ; see Example 3 ( d ) .
Introducing subscripts , as in tmp 1 , ensures that language extensions play well with the lexically scoped base language .
Avoiding unintentional capture by introduced variable declarations , as in Example 3 ( d ) , is only half of the problem , however .
The macro system must also prevent unintended capture of introduced variables , as in Example 3(e ) where ( define ( f x ) ... ) is Scheme notation for defining a function f that takes a single argument , x .
The body of the function contains a local macro definition , swap - with - arg , followed by a block with local bindings of z and x and a body that uses swap - with -arg .
The local macro swap - with - arg swaps a variable 's value with the value of f's x argument .
Even if x has a different binding in the context where swap - with - arg is used , the x introduced by the macro expansion always refers to the function argument .
In other words , in expanding the aforementioned definition , the second x must be renamed to preserve lexical scope ; see Example 3 ( f ) .
In general , the macro system adds subscripts and superscripts as necessary to preserve lexical scope for the original identifiers .
Matching Multiple Patterns
A natural generalization of swap is the rotate macro , which rotates the values of a set of variables to the left .
For example , ( rotate bucket box bin ) moves the value of box to bucket , the value of bin to box , and the value of bucket to bin .
The rotate form should also work on four variables , as in ( rotate n e s w ) , or any number of variables .
Rotating a set of variables is the same as swapping the first two , then rotating all but the first variable .
Rotating a single variable has no effect .
Based on these two observations , you can implement the rotate macro as in Example 4 ( a ) .
The first pattern , ( rotate a ) , matches when a single variable is supplied , and the expansion is the nonoperational ( void ) expression .
The second pattern , ( rotate a b c ... ) , contains ellipses that allow any number of matches for cincluding zero matches .
Thus , the macro use ( rotate n e s w ) matches the second case , and expands to Example 4 ( b ) , which in turn expands to Example 4 ( c ) , and so on , ending with Example 4 ( d ) .
The Scheme begin form combines and orders statements , so the expansion in Example 4 rotates n through w by bubbling n's value through the other variables .
Instead of bubbling one value through all of the variables , you can define a rotate macro that directly moves each value to its target .
The new rotate uses a helper macro , and it shows how ellipses can be placed after any subpattern or subtemplate to generate multiple instantiations of the subpattern or subtemplate ; see Example 5 ( a ) .
Using these definitions , ( rotate n e s w ) expands to a kind of parallel assignment in Example 5 ( b ) , which in turn expands to Example 5 ( c ) .
The use of ellipses after the subtemplate ( set! to from ) causes to and from matches to be paired up and instantiated together .
The shift - to macro fails if the number of from matches is not the same as the number of to matches , but the use in rotate always creates the same number of each .
Identifier Macros
The C macro system supports two kinds of macrosfunction - shaped macros like swap , and identifier - shaped macros that match only the macro name .
For example :
# define MAX_INT 0x7ffffff
defines a macro MAX INT so that it is replaced in any context with 0x7 ffffff .
A syntax - rules macro is always a swap - style macro .
A syntax - id - rules macro is more like MAX INT , but the identifier 's expansion can be made sensitive to the way that it 's used as the target of a set !
assignment , immediately after an open parenthesis , or as an immediate expression .
( In Scheme , the position after set !
or after an open parenthesis is generally special . )
For example , the definition in Example 6 causes clock to act like a normal Scheme variable , but assignments and uses of the variable are implemented through a set - time !
mutator function and a get - time accessor function .
With this macro , clock expands to ( get - time ) , while ( set! clock 5 ) expands to ( set - time ! 5 ) .
The middle case in the macro causes ( clock 8 ) to expand to an error because applying clock as a function is useless .
For other macros , the middle case is useful .
In fact , the syntax - rules form could be considered a special case of syntax - id - rules with only the middle case .
Macro-Generating Macros
Macro -generating macros let you create new forms for defining other macros .
For example , suppose you want to convert many sets of mutator - accessor functions to pseudovariables like clock .
Instead of copying the definition of clock and replacing the names , you would instead prefer to write Example 7 ( a ) .
The define - get / set - var form can be implemented as a macro - generating macro , as in Example 7 ( b ) .
The ( ... ...) combination in a template produces a plain ... in the macro expansion .
In other words , the first ellipses escape the second ellipses so that the macro- produced macro contains pattern - and template - duplicating ellipses .
Extended Example : Call - by - Reference
The swap and rotate examples are special cases of call - by - reference functions .
Using only the pattern - based macro tools described so far , you can implement an extension of Scheme for defining call - by - reference functions .
Our new define - cbr form allows programs such as Example 8 ( a ) .
Since f is a call - by - reference function , the swap in f swaps the values of the x and y variables passed to f in the example call .
The expansion of define - cbr consists of two parts .
The first part introduces a do-f call - by - value function that acts like a call - by - reference version of f .
Instead of accepting f's arguments directly , it accepts accessor and mutator functions .
In particular , the f definition in Example 8 ( a ) expands to 8 ( b ) .
Where the original function had two arguments , a and b , the expanded function has four arguments : get 1 and set 1 , which are functions to get and set a ; and get 2 and set 2 , which get and set b.
Inside the function , a and b are mapped to the accessor and mutator functions using our define - get / set - var macro .
The other half of the transformation affects uses of f .
The use of f in Example 8 ( c ) expands to a call to do-f , where the arguments x and y are replaced with functions that get and set the values of x and y ; see Example 8 ( d ) .
The lambda keyword in Scheme means " anonymous function , " and ( lambda ( ) x ) is an anonymous function that accepts no arguments and returns x .
Similarly , ( lambda ( v ) ( set ! x v ) ) is an anonymous function that accepts one argument and puts it into x .
The key to connecting the definition of f to uses of f is that define - cbr is a macro - defining macro .
It defines f as a macro that expands to uses of do -f .
In other words , the ( define - cbr ( f a b ) ( swap a b ) ) definition actually expands to Example 8( e ) .
Our task , then , is to implement a define - cbr macro that expands as above .
Half of this macro is straightforward ; see Example 9 ( a ) .
The ??? part turns out to be more complex .
If define - cbr allowed only a single arg for the defined function , then ??? could be simply Example 9 ( b ) .
To support multiple arguments , however , you must generate many distinct get and put names to go with many args .
To generate the names , you can exploit the way the macro expander adds subscripts to introduced variables .
The idea is to take one arg at a time and introduce a corresponding get and set , leaving the rest of the args to further expansion .
Each expansion then adds a unique subscript to the just - introduced get and put .
The name - generating sequence of expansions requires a helper macro , which we name define - cbr - as - cbv , so that the ??? in define - cbr is replaced with Example 10 ( a ) .
Then the extra ( ) in this template provides a place to accumulate generated names .
Initially , Example 10 ( b ) expands to 10 ( c ) , but after two expansions , this code changes to 10 ( d ) , at which point it is easily converted to the final definition of do-f , since a is grouped with get 1 and set 1 and b is grouped with get 2 and set 2 .
The implementation of define - cbr - as - cbv in Example 11 implements both phases of this translation .
Beyond Patterns
With the definitions of the define - get / set - var , define - cbr , and define - cbr - as - cbv macros , we have added call - by - reference functions to Scheme , using only 33 lines of pattern - based macro definitions .
For many purposes , the implementation is complete , though it suffers some obvious limitations :
Call - by - value functions in Scheme are higher order , which means that they can be passed to other functions or returned from other functions .
Our call - by - reference functions are first - order , which means they can only be used in a direct call .
When arguments are not variables , as in ( f 1 2 ) , the result is a set !
syntax error .
In most languages with call - by - reference functions , nonvariable arguments are effectively placed into a fresh dummy variable at the call site .
These problems cannot be solved using only pattern - matching macros in Scheme , and many other kinds of language extensions fall outside the capabilities of pattern - matching macros .
Nevertheless , the ideas behind Scheme 's pattern - matching macros provide a solid foundation for more elaborate macro systems .
The next level of macro sophistication in Scheme is the syntax - case macro system .
A syntax - case macro can perform arbitrary computation ( using Scheme ) on the results of a pattern match .
For example , a syntax - case macro can distinguish call - by - reference calls that have variable arguments from those that do not , and it can produce a different expansion in each case .
A syntax - case macro does not manipulate plain text , or even plain symbols and lists ( as does a Lisp macro ) .
Instead , the macro manipulates syntax objects , which encode the lexical context and source locations of program fragments .
Consequently , just like a syntax - rules macro , a syntax - case macro respects the lexical structure of the source program ( by default ) and it plays well with source - correlating tools .
Syntax objects enable the implementation of most any little language or language extension .
Using syntax - case , we have implemented a Java - like class system for Scheme , lex - and yacc - like forms for building parsers , and constructs for defining and linking program components .
Programmers using these constructs do not reason about them in terms of their expansion .
Instead , syntax objects allow the expansion to be hidden behind abstract definitions of the constructs , just as the inner workings of any compiler are hidden behind a language definition .
A language 's concrete syntax need not be parenthesized to make use of syntax objects .
In particular , we are currently developing implementations of Java and ML for our programming environment , DrScheme ( see " Fostering Little Languages , " DDJ , March 2004 ) .
Since our parsing tools produce syntax objects , we can treat Java and ML like macro extensions of Scheme .
These macro implementations resemble typical Java - to - Scheme and ML - to - Scheme compilers , but little additional work is needed to adapt our entire programming environment to new languages .

As deflation continues to run its course , debt destruction goes on , and people seek save haven investments Foreign demand for long - term US securities rises :
Foreign demand for long - term U.S. financial assets rebounded in June even though China and Russia trimmed their holdings .
The Treasury Department said Monday that foreigners purchased $ 90.7 billion more in long - term U.S. securities than they sold in June .
That ’s a significant rebound from May when they sold $ 19.4 billion more than they purchased .
“ There is little evidence in recent ( Treasury ) reports to suggest that foreign investors are growing weary of buying U.S. securities , ” Jay Bryson , a global economist at Wells Fargo Securities , wrote in a note to clients .
The increased appetite for Treasury securities was partly because their yields rose in early June , he added .
The Treasury is auctioning record amounts of debt to cover what it estimates will be a $ 1.85 trillion budget deficit this year .
If overseas buyers do n’t continue purchasing U.S. debt , some economists worry that would mean falling demand at Treasury debt auctions and rising interest rates .
China , the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities , trimmed its holdings , to $ 776.4 billion in June from $ 801.5 billion in May .
Russia also reduced its holdings 3.7 percent to $ 119.9 billion in June .
China ’s holdings are a direct result of the huge trade deficits the U.S. runs with the emerging Asian power .
The Chinese take the dollars Americans pay for Chinese products and invest them in Treasury securities .
[ smartads ]
American manufacturers argue that gives China unfair trade advantages by keeping the dollar overvalued against the Chinese currency , which makes U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers and Chinese products cheaper here .
Both the Bush and Obama administrations have argued that China should allow its currency to rise faster in value against the dollar , but the yuan has stopped appreciating against the dollar in recent months .
Japan , the second largest holder of U.S. Treasury securities , increased its holdings 5.1 percent to $ 711.8 billion in June .
And the United Kingdom , the third largest holder of Treasuries , increased its holdings nearly 31 percent to $ 214 billion .
Foreign governments purchased $ 22.5 billion of Treasury bonds and notes , the department said , after selling $ 21.8 billion in May .
Overseas governments sold $ 5.9 billion in bonds issued by mortgage giants Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and other government agencies .
Private foreign investors purchased $ 78 billion in Treasury bonds and notes in June , the department said , up from sales of $ 800 million in May .
Today yields on ten year notes are currently at 3.49 percent .
I am still as bullish as I have been before on Treasury Notes and Bonds :
Back in November 08 I called for significantly lower Treasury Yields between 2 % amd 2.5 % .
They then fell from 3.09 % to just below 2.5 % in January 09 .
I then expected for technical reasons that they will move higher to the upper end of the range which would be around 3.3 % .
They actually overshot and went as high as 3.99 % .
I then said that Treasurys are a good call again .
Yields have since then fallen to around 3.30 % : Click on image to enlarge .
I think Treasurys will continue to act well .
There maybe some upward pushes here and there so long as inflation expectations pop up once in a while , but the mid-term trend remains unchanged :
It is likely that yields are headed for new lows .
Just recently someone commented as a response to my post on consumer prices :
Bullish long term treasuries ?
If so , I think your arguments should directly go to the trash .
Even though private lending is not increasing , it is currently being replaced by government debt or money .
Yes stocks are risky , but the dollar is even riskier .
Maybe I am wrong and there is a flaw in my thinking .
If so , then nobody has successfully pointed it out yet .
Statements like the above reflect the commonly spread notions of the public who does not like to bother with details and easily falls for simple platitudes .
This just reaffirms my beliefs .
But we shall let reality be the final arbiter .
I believe that Treasury yields are headed lower for the remainder of this year .
As far as my thoughts on the Yuan :
In 2005 the Chinese government ended the peg against the US dollar and switched over to a currency basket .
From 2005 though June 2008 , the value of one Dollar dropped from RMB 8.28 in 2005 to about RMB 6.83 by June 2008 .
Since then , it seems , the fall of the dollar has stopped and the Yuan / Dollar exchange rate remained suspiciously stable .
This has gone on through right now .
The chart below illustrates this :
The stabilization of the Dollar against the Yuan has almost coincided the reversal of the Dollar ’s fall against other major currencies .
It thus appears as if , since mid 2008 , the Yuan / Dollar peg has been reinstated and continues to be in place as these lines are written .
What is also noteworthy is that the US current account deficit has been declining sharply since then .
A first look at the above chart leads one to believe that Chinese and US authorities aimed at putting an end to the fall of the Dollar , and thus intervened accordingly .
However , another possibility which I would like to propose is that the Dollar had fundamentally and truly begun to stabilize at the level of RMB 6.83 at that point and was actually in for a major revaluation upwards .
Thus the current intervention by Chinese authorities could actually be aiming at a stabilization of its own currency at a higher level than the market would mandate .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Californians have fewer places to redeem IOUs issued by the cash - strapped state .
At least three major banks , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , stopped accepting the IOUs after Friday .
More than 60 credit unions , however , continue to accept the paper .
State Controller John Chiang started issuing the IOUs on July 2 to conserve cash , while lawmakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tussle over closing a $ 26 billion budget gap .
Friday also marked the start of a mandatory third furlough day for most state employees .
The state , the world 's eighth largest economy , has issued more than 90,000 IOUs worth nearly $ 355 million .
Also called registered warrants , the IOUs pay an interest rate of 3.75 % and can be redeemed on Oct. 2 or earlier if divided state officials reach a budget deal .
Recipients will include state contractors , social service agencies and those owed income tax refunds .
Banks will work with customers on an individual basis to assist them , perhaps offering them home equity lines or short - term loans , said Beth Mills , spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association .
But the institutions are also hoping to send a message to Sacramento .
" What 's ultimately in the best interest of everyone will be for the state to act quickly and resolve the budget impasse , " she said .
Bank of America 's decision stems from its experience in 1992 , the last time the state issued IOUs amid a financial crisis .
The bank , along with Wells Fargo , were among the first to stop accepting the IOUs .
A budget was signed about a month later .
" The longer the registered warrants were accepted , the longer it took the legislature to resolve the matter , " said Britney Sheehan , a Bank of America spokeswoman .
" We do not want our acceptance of registered warrants to deter the state from reaching a budget agreement as soon as possible . "
Customers at participating credit unions can continue to redeem the IOUs .
The institutions are bracing for a crush of people looking to turn the warrants into cash .
" There are options , " said Daniel Penrod , senior industry analyst at the California Credit Union League .
" If people look for those options , they 'll realize they are not stuck past the July 10 deadline . "
IOUs to be regulated
Some people actually want to get their hands on the registered warrants , posting ads on online marketplaces such as Craigslist .
Several postings offer to buy the paper for 85 cents on the dollar , while another listing is looking to sell the IOUs for 95 cents .
This practice , however , has heightened fears that desperate IOU holders might be taken advantage of and that counterfeiters might make copies of the warrants .
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer last week said that warrant buyers must obtain a notarized bill of sale from the recipient when purchasing the IOUs .
This will help ensure that the person redeeming the IOUs is the legitimate owner , said Bill Dresslar , Lockyer 's spokesman .
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said that the IOUs are securities and are subject to federal anti-fraud provisions .
The agency also issued an investor alert warning both buyers and sellers to be careful when trading the warrants .
" If you hold an IOU and wish to sell it prior to maturity you should consider whether you think you are getting a fair price , " the alert said .
Investors who wish to buy IOUs should also understand who the seller is .
If you are buying from a third party , ask if the person is registered to do this business .
The SEC 's action has both positive and negative impacts on IOU recipients , experts said .
It should cut down on scams because the warrants would have to be traded through registered brokers , said Joseph Fichera , who heads Saber Partners , a financial consulting firm for governments and corporations .
Sellers would have to provide disclosure and make sure they are marketing the products properly .
This , however , would also make it harder to offload the IOUs , which could frustrate recipients in need of cash .
" The SEC is trying to provide some sort of framework for investor protection in the middle of uncharted territory , " Fichera said .

Under current laws , TV ads must not exceed the loudest peak in a show — but anyone who has ever been scared half to death by Billy Mays exploding onto the screen for Oxi Clean knows that is generally unacceptable .
Naturally , broadcasters and advertisers want to set their own standards — they even have their own plan to reduce ad volume set to take effect within a couple of months .
Many believe that the Congressional bill with pass , but it may not be necessary if the broadcasters set acceptable limits .

[ digg - reddit - me ] About a week ago , I got an email from Mitch Stewart , the Director of Organizing for America , the organization that is tasked with marshalling the remnants of Obama ’s campaign organization to create grass roots pressure for change .
It read almost as if it were a campaign email :
Joseph –
The fight to pass real health care reform will come down to one thing : you .
That ’s because the efforts in Washington , D.C. , to fix our broken health care system and provide affordable coverage for all Americans are only part of the battle .
By teaming up with your friends and family and organizing for real reform in your community , you can make the difference in this debate .
Together , we ’ll make sure the President ’s plan succeeds across the country …
In communities around the country , folks will be knocking on doors , making phone calls , and doing all they can to seize what may be our last opportunity to change health care in America forever – as the President has said , reform needs to “ happen this year , or not at all . ”
The goal of the email was to get people to buy “ Health Care 09 ” t- shirts .
But unlike the campaign emails – which often led to me buying whatever they were hawking to demonstrate my support , reading up on the issue ( if I had not already ) and blogging about it , this email prompted me to no action .
A few months ago , I wrote about this issue in a post about the “ Paradox of Organizing for America . ”
The problem I saw then was that while “ Obama for America ” had a clear , singular goal – electing Barack Obama president – and citizens were faced with the motivating factor of being directly involved in achieving this goal – voting , and convincing others to vote as they were – neither of these factors which were essential to the success of Obama for America are present for Organizing for America .
But this email demonstrates another problem , a problem inherent in the legislative - centered approach to policy that Obama has taken in general – and his rugby - scrum strategy for achieving health care reform in particular .
How can he motivate the grass roots to back him if there is no clear bill or idea to rally behind ?
Clearly , their strategy is to make this a binary question :
Are you for or against health care reform ?
Everyone is for health care reform – as our system is quite obviously unsustainable .
But there are many , many valid questions critics and supporters of the various progressive - type health care reform plans have :
Will this reform be sufficient to “ bend the curve ” ?
Should medical malpractice awards be capped ?
Should we be moving towards a single - payer system ?
Would non-profit insurance organizations be a better approach ?
On policy grounds , many of those who support health care reform disagree about how it should be done .
Now , Organizing for America is asking them to push for reform , with details unrevealed and undecided .
What they are asking for is , simply , a leap of faith – to trust that the Obama administration knows what they are doing , and that they will do the best they can .
They key fact that the Obama administration and Organizing for America are pushing is that this is the time .
As the email quotes Obama : “ [ R ] eform needs to ‘ happen this year , or not at all . ' ”
The grounds for this claim are political rather than policy - oriented .
As a matter of reflective policy - making , it would undoubtedly be better to gradually experiment with different approaches , testing them to see which are successful and gradually building support for a wholesale reorganization of health care .
But politically , this is untenable .
First – with the retirement of the worst generation of Americans and the exponential rise in health care costs , our federal deficit is set to explode in the next thirty years .
The longer we wait , the harder it will be to reign in costs and “ bend the curve . ”
This is a problem that should have been dealt with while the Baby Boomers were in power , when the problem first became evident – but , as usual , they abdicated their responsibilities .
Second , Obama now has more going for him domestically than he likely will at any other point , including if he were to win a second term .
Obama ’s popularity is high ; he has 60 Democrats in the Senate and a sizeable majority in the House ( and the president ’s party has traditionally lost seats in the first midterms after the presidential election ) ; he has several key Republicans willing to compromise – and various business and other interests willing to support some legislation .
The difficulty Organizing for America faces is motivating the many policy - oriented and otherwise savvy Obama - supporters to support the administration on this issue without having set its position in advance .
Organizing for America seems to have a clear idea of what it wants from the grass roots : pressure for the idea that we need reform now .
What ’s less clear is how to get the grass roots to buy into their part of the strategy .
Buying t- shirts is what you do after you buy into the strategy – not before .
It ’s not clear to me that Organizing for America has realized its job is no longer to preach to the converted – but to convert bystanders into activists .

PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) --
A man toting an assault rifle was among a dozen protesters carrying weapons while demonstrating outside President Obama 's speech to veterans on Monday , but no laws were broken .
It was the second instance in recent days in which weapons have been seen near presidential events .
A man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against President Obama on Monday in Phoenix , Arizona .
Video from the protest in Phoenix , Arizona , shows the man standing with other protesters , with the rifle slung over his right shoulder .
Phoenix police said authorities monitored about a dozen people carrying weapons while peacefully demonstrating .
" It was a group interested in exercising the right to bear arms , " police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill said .
Arizona law has nothing in the books regulating assault rifles , and only requires permits for carrying concealed weapons .
So despite the man 's proximity to the president , there were no charges or arrests to be made .
Hill said officers explained the law to some people who were upset about the presence of weapons at the protest .
Watch the rifle being legally carried at rally »
" I come from another state where ' open carry ' is legal , but no one does it , so the police do n't really know about it and they harass people , arrest people falsely , " the man , who was n't identified , said in an interview aired by CNN affiliate KNVX .
" I think that people need to get out and do it more so that they get kind of conditioned to it . "
Gun-toting protesters have demonstrated around the president before .
Last week , a man protesting outside Obama 's town hall meeting in New Hampshire had a gun strapped to his thigh .
That state also does n't require a license for open carry .
Do n't Miss Obama pledges increased support to war veterans
U.S. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan acknowledged the incidents in New Hampshire and Arizona , but said he was not aware of any other recent events where protesters attended with open weapons .
He said there was no indication that anyone had organized the incidents .
Asked whether the individuals carrying weapons jeopardized the safety of the president , Donovan said , " Of course not . "
The individuals would never have gotten in close proximity to the president , regardless of any state laws on openly carrying weapons , he said .
A venue is considered a federal site when the Secret Service is protecting the president and weapons are not allowed on a federal site , he added .
In both instances , the men carrying weapons were outside the venues where Obama was speaking .
" We pay attention to this obviously ... to someone with a firearm when they open carry even when they are within state law , " Donovan said .
" We work with our law enforcement counterparts to make sure laws and regulations in their states are enforced . "

Pygmy hippos are only found in West Africa , where they are now critically endangered .
Their primary threat is the loss of their forest habitat due to the timber industry .
They are also extensively hunted for their meat .
Darren McGarry , Animal Collection Manager at Edinburgh Zoo , who also sits on the European Endangered Programme ( EEP ) Committee for this species , said :
“ A pygmy hippo baby is an exciting addition for us .
This baby will be very popular with visitors to Edinburgh Zoo this summer .
Its birth will also contribute to the sustainable breeding of the pygmy hippo species both in UK and Europe .
Edinburgh Zoo is only one of a few zoos in the UK to care for this species and we have a particularly successful breeding record , having produced 16 hippo calves in less than 30 years .
“ Ellen is proving to be a great mum to Leishan .
The calf has gradually been gaining weight and she is now old enough to begin exploring her enclosure and can been seen by visitors . ”
Charles Taylor denies backing rebels during the civil war Liberia 's former president Charles Taylor has told his UN war crimes trial that he spent years fighting corruption before he took power .
He told judges in The Hague he joined the government in 1980 , but his anti-corruption stance made him unpopular .
Mr Taylor emerged victorious from Liberia 's civil war in the 1990s .
But the charges he faces are related to the civil war in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
He denies 11 charges including murder , terrorism , rape and torture .
Mr Taylor 's British lawyer , Courtenay Griffiths , is leading the former president through a reconstruction of his life and the circumstances of his 1997 - 2003 premiership .
Analysts at the UN - backed Special Court for Sierra Leone say the lawyer is trying to portray Mr Taylor as a virtuous leader and peacemaker , rather than the vicious warlord prosecutors say he is .
' Deceit , deception , lies '
Mr Taylor appeared in the witness box for the first time on Tuesday , two years after his trial began .
CHARLES TAYLOR CHARGES Violation of humanitarian law : Conscripting child soldiers Crimes against humanity : Terrorising civilians , murder , rape , sexual slavery , enslavement War crimes : " Violence to life " , cruel treatment ( including hacking off limbs ) , pillage
Preacher , warlord , president Q&A : Trying Taylor Taylor 's defiant testimony
He dismissed the case against him as " lies " .
An estimated 500,000 people were killed , mutilated or suffered other atrocities in the civil war in Sierra Leone , which lasted from 1991 until 2002 .
Some of the worst crimes were committed by child soldiers who were drugged to desensitise them .
Mr Taylor is the first African leader to be tried by an international court .
He told the court on Tuesday he had wanted to bring peace to Liberia 's West African neighbour .
He denied being involved in atrocities committed by Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) rebels during the civil war .
" I am not guilty of these charges , not even a minute part of these charges , " he said .
" This whole case is a case of deceit , deception and lies . "
Prosecutors have called 91 witnesses in pressing their case that Mr Taylor provided arms , money and support to Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for diamonds .
Mr Taylor is the first of 249 witnesses the defence has said it may call .
The trial was moved to the Netherlands from Sierra Leone 's capital , Freetown , amid fears it could create instability there and in neighbouring Liberia .
A verdict in the case is expected in 2010 .

A new DKos poll is out .
It appears that the Republicans in Congress are about as popular as genital herpes :
The numbers :
Something has gone awry -- some would say everything has -- in the federal government ’s effort to reestablish the population of Mexican wolves , North America ’s most endangered mammal .
Beginning with an initial release of 11 wolves in 1998 , the Mexican wolf population in the Southwest was projected to reach at least 100 by 2006 .
Three years beyond , the number of wolves in the wild is half that .
Wildlife managers -- following the program ’s often punitive rules -- have contributed to the deaths of more than 25 wolves through shooting , trapping , sedating , penning and relocating the notoriously skittish animals .
A wolf slated for capture died of hyperthermia after a helicopter chase .
At least eight wolves died of stress in holding pens .
Six pups were killed when placed in the care of another captive pack .
The program ’s most - photographed wolf -- Brunhilda , a young female in the first pack -- died after federal biologists captured her to perform a routine check ; the animal became stressed and overheated during the examination and died .
Advertisement
On paper , Gila National Forest was the logical place to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf .
The 3.3 million acres of densely treed slopes , spare grasslands and desert scrub in the nation ’s first designated wilderness area are stocked with plentiful elk and deer that make up the bulk of wolves ’ diet .
But endangered - species biology plays out on a complicated landscape of emotion , politics and power -- never on paper .
Critics of the program , including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials who designed it , say the Mexican wolf reintroduction has been a dismal failure , falling short of most of its goals .
Pup survival rates are far lower than expected , adult wolf mortality higher than projected , and the recovery program is way behind the timeline that federal biologists established .
“ We are witnessing the second extinction of the Mexican wolf in the wild , ” said Michael Robinson , a conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity , one of several groups suing the federal government for “ failing to recover ” the wolf .
Advertisement
“ It ’s the worst - case example abrogation of Endangered Species Act responsibility that I ’ve seen , in many regards , ” said Jamie Clark , the former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and now executive vice president of the conservation group Defenders of Wildlife .
“ Everybody knows what ’s wrong , ” she added .
“ Nobody will lead their way out .
No one is taking responsibility . ”
Benjamin Tuggle , the Southwest regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque , said there was much he disliked about the program he inherited .
“ We ’ve made some mistakes on our own , ” he said .
“ We ’ve cost the lives of wolves .
I do n’t want you to think that I am comfortable with where we are in handling these wolves , because I ’m not .
Advertisement
“ What I ’m looking at , however , is a system that is not functioning at its optimum potential . ”
Endangered species
Gray wolves once roamed widely throughout the Southwest and Mexico , but decades of government extermination programs to support livestock interests rendered the species functionally extinct .
The Mexican gray wolf was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1976 .
By the 1990s , when the recovery program was conceived , there were fewer than 200 Mexican wolves remaining in North America , nearly all of them in zoos or research facilities .
Trappers managed to capture seven wild wolves in Mexico , and those animals became the genetic forebears of the current population .
Advertisement
The first year of the reintroduction set the tone for a troubled program .
The first wolf released was illegally shot and killed .
Four more met the same fate .
The first Mexican wolf pup born in the wild in more than 70 years was presumed dead after its mother was shot .
By the end of the year , the Fish and Wildlife Service recaptured the rest of the released wolves and penned them for their own safety .
For a decade , the gray wolf program has limped along , undone , critics say , by measures that penalize the animals for behaving as wolves do .
For example , wolves that stray out of the designated recovery area along the New Mexico - Arizona border are captured , penned and relocated elsewhere in the recovery zone , where the animals then must relearn the geography and locate food and water sources .
Ninety - three wayward wolves were “ translocated ” through 2008 .
Perhaps the most controversial policy is the so - called three - strikes rule that was formalized in 2005 , when the Fish and Wildlife Service allowed officials in Arizona and New Mexico to set wolf policies .
Advertisement
Under the rule , any wolf that has killed three cows or calves in one year must be “ removed ” -- shot or placed in captivity indefinitely .
Wolves killed 22 cows and calves in 2007 , according to Fish and Wildlife .
Policies such as these have created a revolving door that shuttles wolves from holding pens to the wild and back again , hampering adaptation , breeding and pack dynamics .
Those results run counter to the intentions of a captive - breeding program , which ideally should leave wolves able to fend for themselves in the wild without human assistance .
Periodic independent studies commissioned by Fish and Wildlife have consistently criticized the system .
Advertisement
One reviewer remarked : “ Frequent social disruption via mortality , recaptures and re-releases have altered the natural territorial behavior of packs .
. . .
These manipulations may be interfering with pack formation . ”
“ Heavy - handed management from now to forever is not a goal that we should be seeking in this program , ” said David Parsons , who led the Fish and Wildlife Service ’s Mexican wolf recovery program from 1990 to 1999 .
“ There is a price to pay when you are doing a lot of capturing and handling of animals .
The idea is to put an animal back into nature and allow [ it ] to exist like any other animal in nature . ”
Changes coming
Advertisement
Tuggle , the Fish and Wildlife regional director , said changes were coming .
“ I understand the concept of manipulation , ” he said .
“ Where we have done those things , they have been disruptive .
They have affected the pack dynamics .
I ’m not a proponent of managing them at the same level that we have been managing them . ”
But Tuggle will have to face a powerful interest group -- the region ’s livestock industry , which vigorously opposed wolf reintroduction .
Caren Cowan , executive director of the New Mexico Cattle Growers ’ Assn. , said her organization estimated that 1,500 cattle had been killed by wolves in the 11 years since reintroduction .
Advertisement
“ Some people say in 11 years that ’s not a lot of cows , but multiply that by $ 1,000 per animal , and that ’s a lot , ” she said .
Defenders of Wildlife compensates ranchers as much as $ 3,000 for each animal killed by wolves , and biologists say cattle make up only about 4 % of wolves ’ diet .
The wolf - livestock conflicts persist because , as designed , the gray wolf recovery program placed the animals in harm ’s way -- smack into an area where federal land is leased for year - round cattle grazing .
In contrast , Canadian wolves released into the Yellowstone ecosystem are thriving , roaming an area that includes national parks and extensive wilderness free of humans and cattle .
Advertisement
Further , the northern Rockies wolf program requires ranchers to dispose of livestock carcasses to discourage wolf scavenging .
The Mexican wolf program does not .
The presence of cattle carcasses in Gila National Forest attracts wolves to livestock areas , tantalizing the packs with the option of killing slow - footed cattle , rather than having to chase fleet elk through rough country .
Ranchers insist that collecting dead cows on their federal grazing allotments is not possible , Cowan said .
Tuggle agreed that the socioeconomic landscape for the wolves is less than ideal .
“ You ’ve got these diametrically opposed forces :
This predator that has a right to be in this space , and the other is this prey base , cattle , that has a right to be in this space , ” he said .
“ It does n’t take you long to cook that formula and come up with a pretty explosive situation . ”

As special interests and bureaucrats hash out their differences , Maggie Dwire , assistant wolf recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service , hauls a wheelbarrow carrying a road - kill elk into pens at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge , a spare slice of the Chihuahuan Desert south of Albuquerque .
The wolves in the half - to 1 - acre enclosures were bred in captivity and are being prepared for release into the wild .
Dwire and veterinarian Susan Dicks say they limit their interactions with the wolves so they retain their natural fear of humans .
“ That ’s good .
We like to see that , ” Dicks said , watching three slender gray wolves run in circles and pant nervously as she and Dwire entered a pen with the elk carcass .
Their reaction to humans will protect them , Dwire said .
Advertisement
She shrugged when asked about the morass that lies ahead for wolves .
“ What has been a success in this program is that captive - bred wolves have shown they can be released into the wild and know what to do , ” Dwire said .
“ They know how to be wolves .
It would be good if we could ever let them do that . ”

I grew up watching Bugs Bunny , Tom and Jerry , and Popeye cartoons , because they were regularly shown on the independent stations here in St. Louis .
( Disney cartoons were n’t readily available unless the Sunday night Wonderful World of Disney show featured one of them . )
Those cartoons helped develop my love of classical music .
( Sorry , Mom .
You were a huge musical influence , but not quite as much as Bugs Bunny ! )
While the vast majority of the cartoons of the 1930s - 1950s made excellent use of popular music and original compositions , they also used classical music to great effect , creating some of the finest animated masterpieces of all time .
Rossini ’s overtures were popular with cartoonists , as were Liszt ’s Hungarian rhapsodies and Brahms ’ Hungarian dances .
In cartoon - land , Beethoven ’s Moonlight Sonata became synonymous with quiet , moonlit scenes , while the opening notes to his Fifth Symphony were used to introduce Nazis during World War II .
The final movement of Liszt ’s Les Preludes frequently introduced some cartoons .
Any favorites you ’d add to this list ?
Enjoy !
10 The Band Concert 1935
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErXg5kBXXg
Music : Rossini ’s William Tell Overture
Made before the William Tell Overture became identified as The Lone Ranger ’s theme , The Band Concert features bandleader Mickey leading an outdoor performance .
While the band plows through the overture , Donald Duck continually interrupts by playing “ Turkey in the Straw ” on his recorder .
9 Pigs in a Polka 1943
Music : Brahms ’ Hungarian Dances # 5 , 7 , 6 and 17 ( they appear in that order )
The familiar story of the three little pigs was a popular vehicle for cartoonists .
This Warner Bros. version cleverly syncs the action with Brahms ’ music , so much so that the music seems like a fifth character .
8 Baton Bunny 1959
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPode_oj-A
Music : Von Suppe ’s A Morning , Noon and Night in Vienna
Bugs is the conductor of a musician - less orchestra .
He performs Von Suppe ’s “ Morning , Noon and Night in Vienna , ” but with a twist :
He turns part of it into a cowboys and Indians saga , using his ears as props .
7 Magical Maestro 1952
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va2YVwH5J3E
Music : Largo al factotum aria from Rossini ’s Barber of Seville opera
This famous aria was never showcased better in a cartoon than in this Tex Avery romp ( although Long - Haired Hare comes close ) .
After a two - bit magician fails to convince Poochini , the “ world ’s greatest baritone , ” to let him into the opera singer ’s act , the magician uses his wand to make life quite difficult for Poochini .
It ’s one of Avery ’s absolute best .
It ’s often cut these days because of some unfortunate racial stereotypes , but you can still find the uncut original .
Note : Watch for the fantastic bit where Poochini “ breaks the fourth wall ” and plucks a hair from the “ film . ”
6 Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl 1950
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxeihhIQtU
Music : Johann Strauss II ’s Die Fledermaus
Tom is the conductor of an orchestra of cats .
Naturally , Jerry wants in on the act , and of course , Tom repeatedly shoes him away .
Excellent choreography in this one .
And both Tom and Jerry look pretty sharp in those tuxes .
5 A Corny Concerto 1943
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sukE_rhsv2Y
Music : Tchaikovsky ’s Piano Concerto # 1 , Strauss ’
Tales from the Vienna Woods and The Blue Danube
Warner Bros. frequently poked fun at Disney , especially considering many animators migrated from Disney to Warner Bros. ( and MGM ) .
A Corny Concerto rips on Disney ’s Fantasia ( see # 2 ) , starting with Elmer appearing as an unshaven Stokowski introducing the two segments .
The first segment is a wild romp in the Vienna woods with Bugs , Porky and an unnamed dog .
The second is more standard fare of a duck protecting a family of swans from a vulture .
4 The Cat Concerto 1947
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqLX8x3tJA
Music : Liszt ’s Hungarian Rhapsody # 2
The Cat Concerto won the Academy Award for Short Subjects - Cartoons in 1946 .
Warner Bros. released a nearly identical cartoon the same year , Rhapsody Rabbit , which had many of the same gags .
Both MGM and Warner Bros. accused the other of plagiarism , but nothing official came of it .
It ’s a toss - up as to whether The Cat Concerto or Rhapsody Rabbit is the better cartoon .
Also watch Rhapsody in Rivets , an Oscar - nominated Warner Bros. cartoon that features the construction of the “ Umpire State Building ” while the foreman / conductor leaders the show .
3 The Rabbit of Seville 1950
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cjvcD2svaM
Music : Rossini ’s Barber of Seville Overture
Bugs does Rossini in a beautifully timed and written masterpiece .
Elmer chases
Bugs into a theater .
Bugs and an unwilling Elmer act out Rossini ’s “ Barber of Seville , ” with Bugs giving Elmer a full head manicure .
Best part : Bugs uses his ears to massage Elmer ’s bald head .
Some of the lyrics : “ Hey you !
Do n’t look so perplexed / why must you be vexed / ca n’t you see you ’re next ?
Yes , you ’re next .
You ’re so next ! ” and this one : “ There !
You ’re nice and clean !
Although your face looks like it might have gone through a machine . ”
( Note :
The music here is from the overture , while the music from # 7 is from the famous aria of the opera . )
The film quality is not good but this is the only English language version I could find on youtube .
2 The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice 1940
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8HDta7Z_4
Music : Dukas ’
The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice
Fantasia is one of Disney ’s greatest films .
It ’s a safe bet to say that more people saw the segments of Fantasia as one - off cartoons on TV than actually saw the movie in the theater .
The best part ( and probably best - known ) is the Sorcerer ’s Apprentice , with Mickey as the apprentice who literally gets in over his head .
The rest of the music featured in Fantasia was : Bach ’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor , Tchaikovsky ’s Nutcracker Suite , Stravinsky ’s The Rite of Spring , Beethoven ’s Sixth Symphony , Ponchielli ’s The Dance of the Hours , Mussorgsky ’s Night on Bald Mountain , and Schubert ’s Ave Maria .
1 What ’s Opera , Doc ? 1957
Music : Wagner ’s Ring Cycle
Bugs and Elmer Fudd do Wagner in this Chuck Jones masterpiece .
Some may have put Fantasia first , but this Bugs Bunny short is consistently ranked as the best Bugs Bunny cartoon of all time , and usually the best of all cartoon shorts .
Jones reduces Wagner ’s whole Ring saga to 6 ½ minutes in a hilarious parody — and it ’s one of the only times Elmer actually “ gets ” Bugs .
You ’ll never listen to “ Flight of the Valkyries ” again without hearing Elmer sing , “ Kill the wabbit , kill the wabbit , kill the wabbit ! ”
For whatever reason ( most likely the fact that viewing is easier than reading ) , films do n’t seem to get the same kind of cultural respect as books do .
Which is a shame because excellent movies can be just as entertaining , mind - expanding , and life changing as good books .
Scenes , characters , and quotes from the greatest movies stay with us long after we view them .
Their ability to transport you to different times and exotic locations , to completely absorb you in the story , make movies one of the closest approximations of real magic we have in this world .
And for better and for worse , film has had a huge impact on masculinity in the 20th Century .
Movies have produced archetypes of manliness that many men judge themselves against today .
To view how male characters of cinema have been portrayed over the decades , is to see clearly the ways in which our perception of masculinity has changed and continues to change .
Thus it seemed only proper that The Art of Manliness take a stab at creating a list of essential movies every man should see .
We did n’t want to make a list of movies that consisted solely of violence and gratuitous T and A that make up most guy movie lists .
Nor did we want to create a list of just independent avant - garde movies that while culturally or cinematically significant , are n’t very entertaining .
We wanted to create a well rounded list of films that have something to say about manliness .
Some of the movies speak poignantly about what it means to be a man .
Others give examples of true manliness in action .
Some are lessons in how not to be a man .
And others are simply entertaining movies that are just plain manly .
But the common thread that runs through all of them is that they ’re great movies that have stood the test of time .
Let us know in the comments which movies you loved , which ones you hated , and the movies you think every man should see before he dies .
Without further ado , we present The Art of Manliness 100 Must See Movies for Men .
This group of Allied POWS fought the enemy the best way they could – by bustin ’ out of prison .
Based on a true story , the film has been hailed as one the greatest escape movies of all time .
Despite its length ( 172 minutes ) , the movie maintains interest through the engaging relationships of the prisoners .
Each individual contributes their skills and personality to the effort , even the self - interested American ( played by Steve McQueen ) .
I guess his skill would be making killer motorcycle chase scenes .
Best line : “ I ’m going … out . ”
Based loosely on the real lives of Western outlaws Robert Leroy Parker ( aka Butch Cassidy ) and Harry Longabaugh ( aka the Sundance Kid ) , Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is a classic movie about two buddies trying to make it in a changing world .
What ’s funny about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is that you forget that these guys were hardened criminals who robbed banks and trains for a living .
The easy going charm Robert Redford and Paul Newman bring to their roles makes you like the characters despite their choice of profession .
Their clever hijinks and humor make the movie an enjoyable ride .
Best line : “ Boy , I got vision , and the rest of the world wears bifocals . ”
Cops that wo n’t let anything – even the law – stand in their way of catching the bad guy may have become a Hollywood cliché , but when Dirty Harry first pulled out his .44 magnum it was a brand new story .
Harry Callahan stops at nothing as he hunts down the Scorpio , a serial killer that picks people off with a sniper rifle .
The plot is n’t bad , but it ’s Clint Eastwood that drives the entire picture .
His rebel good - guy cop set a high mark for others to try and follow .
Best line : “ You ’ve got to ask yourself one question : ‘ Do I feel lucky ? ’
Well , do ya , punk ? ”
Working 60 hours a week sucks .
I mean , it really sucks .
The idea of travelling around the world to exotic spots with the simple objective of surfing every chance you get is about the most enticing thing on the planet .
In step Mike Hynson and Robert August .
Famed documentary director Bruce Brown follows the pair around the world as they chase the summer and whatever waves they can ride .
If you ca n’t surf , or you ca n’t take the time off work to surf – live vicariously through this movie .
This movie is great for many reasons – of which , I cite two : 1 ) Kevin Costner can actually play baseball , instead of looking like a moron as do many other actors trying to swing a bat .
2 ) Tim Robbins character wears lingerie when he pitches – which is completely classic .
Besides these , there are many other elements that make the movie relevant : the mentor / mentee , the old vs. the young , fighting for the woman , baseball .
But ultimately it ’s about a bunch of guys trying to make their mark on life – which we can all certainly relate to .
Best line : “ Charlie , here comes the deuce .
And when you speak of me , speak well . ”
Do nice guys always finish last ?
Not necessarily .
The Apartment is a true gem of a movie that does n’t seem get the attention it deserves .
Both dramatic and funny , the film is a dark comedy about a corporate drone who finally gets tired of being constantly walked on , mans up , and becomes a mensch .
Things do n’t always work out when you do the right thing , but sometimes they do .
Best line : “ Shut up and deal . ”
Nobody wants to die alone .
Especially gunslingers .
In a haunting portrayal that foreshadowed his own fate , John Wayne plays J.B. Brooks , an aging gunfighter dying of cancer who resigns himself to live out his days in private .
But skeletons from his past prevent him from fading away , so he decides to go down the only way he knows – with his six gun blazing .
Best line : “ I wo n’t be wronged .
I wo n’t be insulted .
I wo n’t be laid a - hand on .
I do n’t do these things to other people , and I require the same from them . ”
At its core , Hoosiers is about redemption – basketball is just the vehicle .
The story revolves around a basketball coach that has fallen from grace and finds himself at a small rural town in Indiana .
He ruffles feathers and fights to earn the respect of his players , the town , and a doubtful teacher .
The team chases glory , while others in the town remember what it is like to win .
Not only is it one of the most inspiring movies of all time , it has one of the most hardcore stoics in all of sport movie history .
Jimmy = Clutch .
Best line : “ You know , most people would kill … to be treated like a god , just for a few moments . ”
This movie set the standard for war epics of the modern era .
Few are its equal .
A Mohican father and his son , along with their adopted son , attempt to maintain their neutrality amidst the French - Indian War in colonial America .
The men are pulled into the fray after rescuing two daughters of a British Officer during a skirmish and escorting them to their father ’s fort .
As the impending battle builds around them , the men remain devoted to the daughters , going to great lengths to preserve them .
From the opening sequence of Uncas and Hawkeye sprinting through the dense forest , to the final scene on the promontory , the movie is gripping and powerful .
Additionally , they play lacrosse in this movie – that fact alone secured its place on this list .
Best line : “ Someday I think you and I are going to have a serious disagreement . ”
An Italian Neo-Realist classic , The Bicycle Thief tells the bleak story of a man in impoverished post - war Italy whose bicycle , which he needs to work , is stolen .
Father and son hunt all over Rome to find the bike , with no one to help them and ultimately no success .
And thus the father is faced with a classic philosophical problem : is it okay to steal to feed your family ?
Realistic and honest , this movie provides one of the best glimpses into the nature of the father / son relationship .
Best line : “ Why should I kill myself worrying when I ’ll end up just as dead ? ”
To what lengths would a person go for a chance at reconciliation ?
If it is for your ( dead ) father , most of us would do anything .
Field of Dreams is Ray Kinsellas ’s journey of reparation with his father .
Ray , an Iowa farmer , erects a baseball field in his cornfield after a voice tells him , “ If you build it , he will come . ”
The voice continues , and after a series of mysterious and supernatural events , he is able to make amends .
It is quite possible that a game of catch can heal most wounds between a father and son – even death , I suppose .
Best line : “ If you build it , he will come . ”
Starring dapper dude , Cary Grant , North by Northwest is classic Alfred Hitchcock .
Grant plays a hapless New York advertising executive mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies , and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive .
The problem is the government thinks he ’s a spy , too , and they ’re on the chase as well .
Talk about a bad day .
Best line : “ I do n’t like the way Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me . ”
The film adaption of SE Hinton ’s famous novel perfectly captures the tumultuous nature of teenage angst .
The well - to - do Socs and blue collar Greasers hate each other ’s guts , and when Johnny the Greaser kills a Soc , a series of dramatic and tragic events are set in motion , including an old fashioned rumble .
The film is a star - studded affair , filled with the likes of Rob Lowe , Emilio Estevez , Matt Dillon , Tom Cruise , Patrick Swayze , Ralph Macchio , and Diane Lane , many before they were household names .
And best of all , it was shot on location in my home city of Tulsa .
Best line : “ Stay gold , Ponyboy , stay gold . ”
The more weighty issues in First Blood are usually overshadowed by the gratuitous action .
Understandably so , but the movie is built on Rambo ’s struggle to return to society after the Vietnam War .
A Medal of Honor recipient , Rambo is kicked out of a small town and then arrested for vagrancy .
The sheriff and his deputies go overboard with torture and Rambo reverts back to what he does best .
Nothing good can come from pissing off a guy named Rambo .
Best line : “ They drew first blood , not me . ”
A Cold War classic starring Frank Sinatra in probably his best movie performance .
The film was so controversial that it was banned from further release after JFK ’s assassination .
The Manchurian Candidate focuses on the way in which propaganda and the manufacture of political views can influence one ’s perception and behavior in the most provocative of ways .
The story follows several former Korean War soldiers who have been brainwashed by the military .
Follow them as they try to unravel the source of the reoccurring nightmares .
A real thriller .
Do n’t bother with the Denzel Washington version .
The original is still the best .
Best line : “ There are two kinds of people in this world :
Those that enter a room and turn the television set on , and those that enter a room and turn the television set off . ”
Virgil Tibbs ( Sidney Poitier ) , a respected detective from up North , is thrown into a murder investigation in the small town of Sparta , Mississippi .
While he initially does n’t want any part of the case , Tibbs exemplifies manly resolve as he sticks around , staring down bigot after bigot while searching for the murderer .
The film is famous for a scene in which Tibbs , after being slapped by a white man , slaps him right back .
The screenplay originally called for Poitier to simply take it , but the actor found this passive response degrading and insisted he be allowed to hit back .
That my friends , is being a man .
You slap me in the face , I ’ll slap you right back , Sucka .
Best line : “ They call me MISTER Tibbs ! ”

Shane tries to stay out of the disputes , but keeps being drawn in and is finally compelled to put his six shooter back on to protect his adoptive family .
Perhaps the most touching part of the movie is the relationship Shane develops with the farmer ’s son .
Best line : “ A gun is a tool , Marian ; no better or no worse than any other tool : an axe , a shovel or anything .
A gun is as good or as bad as the man using it .
Remember that . ”
Perhaps the greatest American contribution to the film noir style , Double Indemnity is dark rumination on greed , manipulation , and betrayal .
Barbara Stanwyck plays a classic femme fatale who uses her womanly wiles to lure insurance salesman Walter Neff into a plan to kill her husband for the “ double indemnity ” payout .
But Neff is not a guileless victim after all .
Palatable tension , suspense , and snappy dialogue make this film a true classic .
Best line : “ How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle ? ”
Politics of euthanasia aside , living is so much more than just breathing .
Based on the life of Ramón Sampedro , the movie examines the fight to end his own life after 30 years of being paralyzed from the neck down .
Despite his desire to end his life , through his courage and self awareness , he inspired others to embrace their own .
The Maltese Falcon is filled with ambiguities in morality .
Sam Spade , played by Humphrey Bogart , is a hardened and cynical man .
But underneath his rough exterior is a man with a sense of idealism .
Spade lives by a code of honor that does n’t let him take the corrupt and easy solution to life ’s problems .
The Maltese Falcon forces us to answer a simple question : when push comes to shove , will we stick to our own code of honor or will we sell out ?
Best line : “ [ It ’s the ] stuff that dreams are made of . ”
Das Boot puts you inside a stranded and submered German U - Boat and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid , terrifying realism .
Holding it all together , under harrowing conditions , is a single man .
The captain is a scruffy , mildly cynical , bastion of strength .
He deals calmly with almost any situation , drawing on a seemingly unlimited store of courage .
Best line : “ You have to have good men .
Good men , all of them . ”
Star Wars ( The Original Trilogy )
The reason Star Wars became a cultural phenomenon was n’t because of the special effects .
It was the story .
Star Wars simply put a futuristic spin on the archetypal story of heroic good vs. evil that men have been telling around fires for millennia .
Stick with the original trilogy .
They ’re still the best .
Mainly because manly man Han Solo is in it .
If CGI effects was all it took to make a good movie , then we would have all loved Jar Jar Binks .
Best line : “ I am your father . ”
Rudy , a scrappy blue collar kid , has a dream of playing football with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame .
While Rudy was n’t blessed with the talent or the body to be a star athlete , he ’s a got a lot of heart and determination .
When you ’re feeling like the underdog in life , just plop down and watch Rudy .
You ’ll be ready to “ Play Like a Champion ” afterwards .
Best Line : “ You ’re 5 foot nothin ’ , 100 and nothin’ , and you have barely a speck of athletic ability .
And you hung in there with the best college football players in the land for 2 years .
And you ’re gonna walk outta here with a degree from the University of Notre Dame .
In this life , you do n’t have to prove nothin ’ to nobody but yourself .
And after what you ’ve gone through , if you have n’t done that by now , it ai n’t gonna never happen .
Now go on back . ”

The tension builds , leading up to the final gun battle .
Best line : “ Do n’t shove me Harv .
I ’m tired of being shoved . ”
It is impossible to capture the life of any man in one film , much less the life of a man who saw and did as much as Mahatma Gandhi .
Thus the filmmakers who tried to capture his life on the silver screen sought not to give a blow by blow account of Gandhi ’s life , but instead to capture his spirit in what they did show .
The film begins with Gandhi ’s assassination and then starts the retrospective of his life , beginning with his being thrown off a train for being Indian , and through his non-violent efforts to win Indians their rights and then their independence .
One man truly can free an entire nation , if not change the entire world .
Best line : “ They may torture my body , break my bones , even kill me , then they will have my dead body .
NOT MY OBEDIENCE ! ”
When people think about James Dean , they typically picture him in his role in Rebel Without a Cause .
Even though it ’s over 50 years old , Rebel Without a Cause still captures the feelings of modern teenage angst : nervous , confused , and feeling lost in a world that is changing .
James Dean plays Jim Stark , a juvenile delinquent who moves into a new town .
Jim clashes with other teenagers and his parents , whom he feels simply do n’t understand him .
The movie often points a finger at weak or absent fathers as the cause of teenage rebellion .
Jim father ’s always backs down to his wife when they argue , leading Jim to ask , “ ” What do you do when you have to be a man ? ”
Best line : “ You ’re tearing me apart ! ”
The French Connection is based on the true story of the Turmanio Case - a large heroine smuggling ring that linked the New York mob with a French mob in Marseilles .
Two NYC cops busted the ring using tactics that were morally and ethically questionable .
In The French Connection , the names have been changed , but the overall story stays the same .
Legendary actor Gene Hackman plays Popeye Doyle , a ruthless cop who ’ll do anything , legal or not , to get the job done : wiretaps , shakedowns , theft distribution of heroin to informants , extortion .
You get the idea .
The French Connection is thus a Machiavellian film .
It forces the viewer to ask themselves if the ends really do justify the means , even if the end is noble .
Oh , and a porkpie hat never looked so bad ass on a man as it does on Gene Hackman in this film .
Best line : “ All right , Popeye ’s here ! ”
Filled with iconic scenes and memorable ( but often misquoted ) lines , Casablanca is a love story that you can watch with your girlfriend , while still feeling manly because it has Humphrey Bogart in it .
Bogart plays Rick Blaine , a bitter American ex-patriate living in Casablanca during World War II .
One day his old flame and the woman who turned him cynical , Ilsa Lund ( Ingrid Bergman ) walks into his club with her husband .
An awkward and tense love triangle commences .
In the end Blaine has a decision that many men face in their life : get what you want or sacrifice for the greater cause .
Best line : “ Here ’s looking at you kid . ”
Cinema often glorifies the Old West as a mythic time when good guys wore white and the bad ones wore black .
In Unforgiven , director / actor / producer Clint Eastwood shines a light on the dark , violent , and morally ambiguous aspects of life in frontier America .
Clint Eastwood plays William Munny , a once notorious and violent killer .
Now , he ’s just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still mourning his dead wife .
But Will ’s old life comes back to haunt him when he ’s asked to do a hit on a cowboy who slashed the face of a prostitute .
Will is transplanted from his farm in Kansas to a town in Wyoming where he meets Sheriff Little Bill Daggett ( Gene Hackman ) , a mean son - of - a- bitch who is determined to not let the hit go down , no matter what it takes .
Hold onto your hats , partners .
This is n’t your grandpa ’s Western .
Best line : “ Hell of a thing , killing a man .
You take away all he ’s got and all he ’s ever gonna have . ”
Animated films often do n’t have much to offer a man , packed as they are with zany animal sidekicks and pop culture humor .
But The Iron Giant is not so much an animated film as it is a film that happens to be animated .
It ’s a beautifully drawn , intelligent , and thoughtful film in which a giant robot falls from space and is befriended and taken care of by a boy .
It ’s 1957 , and Cold War paranoia is running high , making the robot a target of government suspicion .
I wo n’t give the ending away , but the story is an emotional tale about doing the right thing and sacrifice .
A real masterpiece .
Best line : “ You are what you choose to be .
You choose .
Choose . ”
General Maximus Decimus Meridius represents all that is good in a man .
He loved his family , he loved his country , he knew how to lead , and he kicked some serious ass .
This movie has everything a man would want in a flim : epic battle scenes involving huge swords and a protagonist who is fighting for what is right .
If you ever need a film to pump you up for something , watch Gladiator .
Best line : “ What we do in life , echoes in eternity . ”
Jimmy Stewart plays a small town scoutmaster named Jefferson Smith who is picked to fill an empty U.S. Senate seat .
The scheming politicians and party boss who foisted this office on Mr. Smith had plans to control this naive country bumpkin as a cog in their political machine .
Little did they know , they picked a man filled with integrity , honor , and ideals .
The filibusterer scene is classic .
Mr. Smith spoke for 23 hours straight , beseeching his fellow Congressman to listen to their consciences , only to faint out of exhaustion at the end .
Hokey ?
Maybe a bit .
But in a world where corporate and political corruption runs rampant , men like Mr. Smith can inspire all men everywhere to stand up for what is right .
Best line : “ Because of just one , plain , simple rule : Love thy neighbor .
And in this world today , full of hatred , a man who knows that one rule has a great trust .
You know that rule , Mr. Paine , and I loved you for it , just as my father did .
And you know that you fight for the lost causes harder than for any others .
Yes , you even die for them , like a man we both knew , Mr. Paine . ”

He wants to crush his opponent .
Eddie ’s relentless drive eventually becomes his undoing as his winning streak turns to defeat .
But Fast Eddie is tenacious .
He musters up some more cash and challenges Minnesota Fats again .
The Hustler is about more than pool .
It ’s about winning and losing , greed , self - respect , and redemption .
Best line : “ You know , this is my table , man .
I own it . ”
During the time of Prohibition , when it seemed the whole country could be bought and sold by ganglords , a small group of men stood firm and fought the storm that raged around them .
The movie follows Eliot Ness , a U.S. Treasury Agent , and his group of hand picked men that brought down the infamous mob boss , Al Capone .
Sean Connery is perfect as Jim Malone , the gritty Irish street cop who taught us never to bring a knife to a gun fight .
Best line :
You wanna know how to get Capone ?
They pull a knife , you pull a gun .
He sends one of yours to the hospital , you send one of his to the morgue .
* That ’s* the * Chicago * way !
Based on John Steinbeck ’s famous novel , The Grapes of Wrath follows a group of “ Okies ” during the Great Depression on their westward trip to a California in search of a better life .
Henry Fonda plays the story ’s main protagonist , Tom Joad , a man who has to hold his family together as the high hopes they began the journey with collide with a far colder reality .
The film softened Steinbeck ’s political overtones and gave the story a more hopeful ending , yet it ’s still a movie of real thought - provoking substance .
Best Line : “ I ’ll be all around in the dark – I ’ll be everywhere .
Wherever you can look – wherever there ’s a fight , so hungry people can eat , I ’ll be there .
Wherever there ’s a cop beatin ’ up a guy , I ’ll be there .
I ’ll be in the way guys yell when they ’re mad .
I ’ll be in the way kids laugh when they ’re hungry and they know supper ’s ready , and when the people are eatin ’ the stuff they raise and livin ’ in the houses they build – I ’ll be there , too . ”
Steve McQueen is the man and Bullitt puts his rugged manliness on full display .
The film is raw and edgy and changed the way detective movies were made in Hollywood .
The best thing about this movie ?
The epic car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco .
It was and still is the best car chase scene in film history .
A 390 GT Mustang never looked so good .
Best line : “ You work your side of the street and I ’ll work mine . ”
Although we remember World War II as “ the good war ” , the one where the soldiers did n’t complain much about the hell they went through , GI ’s from the Big One had the same rough time transitioning back to home life that all soldiers did and do .
And The Best Years of Our Lives is a rare movie that honestly captures that experience .
The film follows 3 servicemen who hitch a ride together back to the same town .
Each has a very different life he is coming home to , and each has their own struggles to fit back into that life .
Best line : “ You know , I had a dream .
I dreamt I was home .
I ’ve had that same dream hundreds of times before .
This time , I wanted to find out if it ’s really true .
Am I really home ? ”
With believable characters and deft touches of humor supplementing the blow em up plot , Die Hard reigns as one of the greatest action films of all time .
John McClane , played by Bruce Willis , is an off - duty cop who gets caught up in a fight when sophisticated bank robbers crash his wife ’s company Christmas party .
He picks them off one by one , and even survives their attempt to blow up the building .
I ’d hate to see what John McClane would have done if he had his shoes on .
Best line : “ Come out to the coast , we ’ll get together , have a few laughs … ”
An underground martial arts tournament , drugs , prostitutes , revenge , some sick Kung Fu , mirrors – is there anything this movie does n’t have ?
The first Kung Fu flick to come out of Hollywood was , sadly , the final one from Bruce Lee .
Hailed as one of the most financially profitable films of all time , Enter the Dragon capitalized on the insane ability of one of martial arts ’ prodigies .
The story follows Lee on a journey to avenge his sister ’s death and bring honor back to his master and Shaolin Temple .
Throw in a secret island , some hookers , maybe a little international espionage and … let ’s face it , we do n’t really watch these kinds of movies for the plot .
Bruce Lee is ridiculously awesome and that ’s all I really need to say .
Best line : “ Do n’t think .
FEEL .
It is like a finger pointing away to the moon .
Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory . ”
American culture has unfortunately and simplistically rendered the history of the civil rights movement as a battle between Martin Luther King Jr. , the good guy who got it right , and Malcolm X , the bad guy who got it wrong .
The story is of course much more complicated , as is Malcolm X himself .
You owe it to yourself to get a fuller picture of the man by reading his autobiography , and watching this film which also goes a long way in showing both his faults and his too often forgotten virtues .
Best line : “ A man curses because he does n’t have the words to say what ’s on his mind . ”
A validation of self - worth can be a powerful element to sustain a man .
After an injury caused James Braddock to plummet from the top of the boxing world , he struggled to survive and provide for his family through the Great Depression .
At nearly the breaking point , he gets a chance to fight again .
Everyone expected him to be an easy opponent , but a desperate and hungry man can be extremely dangerous .
He wins the fight and continues to win , leading him to fight in the heavyweight championship .
Braddock ’s true story is about more than boxing ; his rise , fall , and dream of redemption mirrored the whole nation ’s hopes .
Best line : “ I have to believe that when things are bad I can change them . ”
From the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the space flights of the Mercury 7 astronauts , the movie provides an inside look at the American side of the space race .
The flaws and reality of the program are exposed along with those of the astronauts .
They were human – which makes them all the more heroic .
Best line : “ What Gus is saying is that we ’re missing the point .
What Gus is saying is that we all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first .
Well , none of us wants to think that they ’re gonna send a monkey up to do a man ’s work .
But what Gus is saying is that what they ’re trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey ’s work .
Us , a bunch of college - trained chimpanzees ! ”
As westerns go , is there any greater than those starring John Wayne – and here the eye patch only makes him more hardcore .
Hired by a young girl to track down the man that killed her father , Wayne takes on the role of Rooster Cogburn , the marshal with “ grit ” enough to bring the man to justice .
Despite his failing health , John Wayne played the ailing law man to an Oscar - winning performance .
Best line : “ Well , a gun that ’s unloaded and cocked ai n’t good for nothin’ . ”
Sometimes people are just barely hanging on to their sanity .
Those around them can either talk them off the ledge , or push them over it .
Case in point : Blanche Dubois .
Now this chick may have been a few cards short of a deck to start with , but at least she was holding on .
Stanley may be the perfect example of how a man should never treat a woman .
If the man had any ounce of sympathetic understanding to replace his uber - brutish machismo , Blanche may have turned the corner into the land of the functional .
Instead he humiliates her , rapes her , and then has her committed .
Best line : “ Stella ! ”
Hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time , the film captures a man ’s descent from sanity as the effects of his acrophobia prevent him from saving the woman he came to love .
Of course , the movie would n’t be a Hitchcock classic if there were n’t some crazy twists thrown in there .
The character played by Jimmy Stewart suffers from an intense fear of heights and strange events continue to unfold as a result .
Mix in some shadowy women , a little murder and you ’ve got one of the greatest mystery films ever made .
Moral of the story : get over your fear of heights before people start dying .
Best line : “ You should n’t keep souvenirs of a killing .
You should n’t have been that sentimental . ”
All Quiet on the Western Front is the godfather of modern war movies .
Almost all pay homage in their execution or effect .
The film is from the eyes of German soldiers fresh to the front lines in WWI .
The story follows Paul as he and his buddies question the politics of war and other atrocities they face .
As those in the group continue to die , even when they are supposed to be out of harm ’s way , the futility of war becomes ever more apparent .
A glimpse into the mind of those that fight , the film was groundbreaking in its intense portrayal of the frontlines .
Best line : “ You still think it ’s beautiful to die for your country .
The first bombardment taught us better .
When it comes to dying for country , it ’s better not to die at all . ”
Several themes run deep in this adaptation of Stephen King ’s novella .
Not to get too philosophical on you , but I could spend days digging through all the elements this movies presents .
Andy , a banker , ( Tim Robbins ) is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her boyfriend .
In prison he develops a friendship with Red ( Morgan Freeman ) , and they do whatever it takes to survive .
In the morally bankrupt world of the prison , Andy maintains his integrity and relies on his unfounded hope in the world .
I guess I probably should n’t use the word “ redemption ” to describe the movie because it ’s actually in the title , but it ’s how this redemption is achieved that makes the story shine .
Hands down , a movie for the ages .
Best line : “ Get busy living or get busy dying . ”
At first glance , this movie seems like just another slacker anti-establishment movie , and maybe it is , but what makes this movie great is the layers of interpretation that can be applied to it .
Luke ( Paul Newman ) is sent to prison camp for vandalizing parking meters and faithfully resists whatever authority is thrown at him .
Though gaining the admiration of his peers with his non-conformist attitude and escape attempts , the prison officials brutally punish Luke to break his spirit .
Eventually they do and Luke is abandoned by his admirers .
One last escape attempt leads Luke to a final confrontation .
Take whatever path of interpretation you want , religious to existential to just about anything – Cool Hand Luke speaks to the rebel in all of us .
R.I.P. Paul Newman .
Thanks for all the manly times .
Best line : “ What we have here is a failure to communicate . ”
Gladiator / Slave revolts – does it get any more inspiring ?
You ’re forced to fight some dude for no reason , they take the woman you love , the crap just keeps piling up and there ’s really no other choice – let ’s take on the most powerful empire on the planet .
Sounds crazy , but Spartacus almost pulled it off .
Rallying the oppressed around him , he led one of the largest revolts of all time .
In one of the most memorable scenes in movie history , while facing certain death , his men stand up and proclaim “ I am Spartacus ” to preserve their leader from crucifixion .
That ’s some serious loyalty , gentlemen .
Best line : “ I am Spartacus . ”
Based loosely on the true story of the murder of 3 civil rights workers in 1964 , Mississippi Burning follows the FBI ’s attempts to bring the perpetrators of that crime to justice .
The film centers on two of the Bureau ’s agents , Alan Ward ( William Dafoe ) and Rupert Anderson ( Gene Hackman ) .
Ward wants to conduct the investigation by the book , while Anderson , who is from Mississippi , understands that using more , let ’s say loosely legal tactics , is the way to go .
Like threatening the deputy sheriff with a deadly straight razor shave .
Nice .
Best line : “ With an old man who was just so full of hate that he did n’t know that being poor was what was killing him . ”
Who would have thought stealing water would lead to such craziness ?
Nicholson is at his hardcore finest as a private eye that sheds light on a huge scandal involving real estate , dams , water , some unsuspecting senior citizens , and even incest .
That ’s a really random list , but it clearly worked for a lot of people – it was nominated for 11 Academy Awards .
Best line : “ Forget it , Jake , it ’s Chinatown . ”
Nothing brings people together like football and desegregation .
In the early 1970 ’s , two schools in Virginia ( One of black students and one of white students ) are forced to combine in order to comply with federally mandated desegregation .
Herman Boone ( Denzel Washington ) is selected as the head coach of the football team over the current successful white coach .
The town goes crazy .
The team goes crazy .
The coaches go crazy .
But the team comes together and they play a dream season for their new coach .
I love this movie .
I forget how much I love it until it comes on TV , and I ca n’t change the channel .
I seriously wish Denzel Washington was my football coach .
I would have destroyed everyone .
Best line : “ This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg .
Fifty thousand men died right here on this field , fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today .
This green field right here , painted red , bubblin ’ with the blood of young boys .
Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies .
Listen to their souls , men .
I killed my brother with malice in my heart .
Hatred destroyed my family .
You listen , and you take a lesson from the dead .
If we do n’t come together right now on this hallowed ground , we too will be destroyed , just like they were .
I do n’t care if you like each other of not , but you will respect each other .
And maybe… I do n’t know , maybe we ’ll learn to play this game like men . ”
Mistake # 1 : Primae Noctis ?
Are you crazy , Long Shanks ?
Mistake # 2 : Slicing up William Wallace ’s woman ?
Are you asking to get your fort burned down ?
Never hack off a Scotsman .
Mel Gibson ’s portrayal of the battle painted warrior poet William Wallace is easily one of the greatest heroes in all of movie history .
I refrain from commenting on historical accuracies , but The Battle of Stirling is one of , if not the best battle scene of all time .
I can say no more .
Best line : “ Every man dies , not every man really lives . ”
Citizen Kane is not only a classic film frequently ranked as the very best of all time , it ’s also a handy primer on how not to be a man .
Do n’t let power corrupt your soul ; do n’t let pride crush your relationships ; do n’t push everyone away until you die alone , an arrogant jerk with his just desserts .
And do n’t get so hung up on childhood memories that you can never build a life for yourself .
Best line : “ Maybe Rosebud was something he could n’t get , or something he lost .
Anyway , it would n’t have explained anything …
I do n’t think any word can explain a man ’s life .
No , I guess Rosebud is just a… piece in a jigsaw puzzle … a missing piece . ”
It ’s the story of longshoreman and ex-boxer Terry Malloy ( Marlin Brando ) who is blackballed and savagely beaten for informing against the mobsters who have taken over his union and sold it out to the bosses .
During the film we see Malloy become aware of his personal power to fight and eliminate the corruption that surrounds him .
It ’s a classic story of one man defying insurmountable odds to fight for what ’s right .
Best line : “ You do n’t understand !
I coulda had class .
I coulda been a contender .
I could ’ve been somebody , instead of a bum , which is what I am . ”
I truly believe , that deep in our hearts , all men want to be assassins .
I do n’t know if it is the mystique , the weapons , the fact that you are a killing machine , or whatever ; assassins may very well be the top of the food chain .
But what makes the Bourne movies so watchable , is that they do n’t rely solely on Jason Bourne kicking the crap out of people .
Of course that element is present , but Matt Damon is able to bring the character to the forefront .
It is the relationships that Bourne builds with himself and others that keep the films from crossing over into the cliché .
That and killing guys with pens and / or magazines .
Best line : “ I can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside .
I can tell you that our waitress is left - handed and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself .
I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside , and at this altitude , I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking .
Now why would I know that ?
How can I know that and not know who I am ? ”
I love a good underdog story , and Rocky is the king of them all .
The movie poster ’s tag line sums up the movie pretty well : “ His whole life was a million - to - one shot . ” Sylvester Stallone plays Rocky Balboa , a two bit working class boxer from Philadelphia who gets the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion of the world .
The training montage with Rocky running up the stairs of the library at the end is a cultural icon and still inspires men to get off their butt and start exercising .
Cue “ Eye of the Tiger . ”
Best line : “ I just want to say hi to my girlfriend , OK ?
Yo , Adrian !
It ’s me , Rocky . ”
I do n’t think you could dream up a worse situation : stuck in a tin can , floating around in outer space with no power and running out of oxygen .
The now famous line “ Houston , we have a problem , ” is definitely an understatement .
Three guys trapped in a disabled shuttle after a trip to the moon goes horribly wrong , and all they have to save them are some of the greatest minds on the planet .
Using some killer brain power and whatever junk they can find around the ship , NASA tries to bring these boys back home .
Best line : “ With all due respect , sir , I believe this is gonna be our finest hour . ”
Overcoming prejudice , the men of the 54th Massachusetts become one of the first units in the US Army to be made of up African American volunteers .
In the face of a decree claiming that any black man caught fighting for the Federal Army would be hanged and any white officer leading those men would also be executed , the group fights to prove themselves to their own Union Army as well as the enemy Confederates .
Lead by Col. Robert Gould Shaw , the unit makes a valiant but unsuccessful attempt to take Ft. Wagner – losing half their men in the process , but gaining respect and admiration for their bravery .
Best line : “ Give ’em Hell ’ 54 ! ”
In an Oscar - winning performance , Jack Nicholson plays the part of criminal who pretends ( or is he ? ) to be crazy in order to placed in a mental hospital instead of prison .
The patients there are under the oppressive , icy watch of Nurse Ratched .
R.P McMurphy ( Nicholson ) sets out to give the patients some optimism , happiness , and freedom , while also driving Nurse Ratched crazy .
There ’s no big action scenes or special effects , almost the entire movie is set in the hospital , and yet the characters and McMurphy ’s rebellion against the soul - sucking nature of the institution makes for a story that will stick with you for a long time to come .
Best line : “ But I tried , did n’t I ? Goddamnit , at least I did that . ”
I am hard pressed to think of a saying with more philosophical depth and insight than “ Wax on , Wax off . ”
It ’s too bad that doing chores does n’t really teach karate .
I would be a grand master by now – but that ’s beside the point .
Daniel - san and Mr. Miyagi create one of the most memorable underdog stories as they take on the Kobra Kai at the All - Valley Karate Tournament .
Plus , Daniel - san gets a car and the girl , Alli with an I .
Will Smith ’s ten year old son is slated to star in a remake of the Karate Kid , constituting the greatest sacrilege in film history .
Best line : “ Wax on , wax off . ”
The things a man will do at the insistence of a woman .
Poor Charlie Allnut ( Humphrey Bogart ) gets suckered into going after a German gunboat by the feisty Rose Sayer .
When her brother is killed by the invading Germans in East Africa , she recruits Charlie , the captain of the African Queen , to take down the offenders .
I guess Katherine Hepburn can be pretty persuasive because despite the craziness and certain death that awaits them , Charlie gives in .
It works out pretty well for him because they get married and he gets to blow up the bad guys .
Best line : “ Well , yeah , but I never tried shooting myself in the head neither . ”
A classic caper movie set in 1936 Chicago .
Two Chicago con artists ( Newman and Redford ) set out to avenge the murder of a mutual friend , only to find themselves in a high - stakes game against the master of all cheating mobsters ( Robert Shaw ) .
The dialogue Between Newman and Redford is fresh and entertaining .
Art of Manliness readers may appreciate the format of the film .
The movie ’s sections are divided by old - fashioned title cards with lettering and illustrations rendered in a style reminiscent of the Saturday Evening Post .
The Sting also breathed new life in to “ The Entertainer , ” a piano rag written by Scott Joplin .
Best line : “ Sorry I ’m late .
I was taking a crap . ”
How much do you believe in yourself ?
And maybe more importantly , what are you willing to do to stand up for what you believe ?
Two men from the British track team vie for Olympic glory in 1924 .
Both run the 100 meters and both have extremely different reasons for running .
One must overcome prejudice and Anti-Semitism , the other risks everything to stay true to his God .
Best line : “ Then where does the power come from , to see the race to its end ?
From within . ”
If you inherit a bunch of money , and you want to be charitable and buy poor people farms so that they can work and provide for themselves , and your financial advisor calls you crazy , and they end up putting you on trial to judge your sanity – what do you do ?
Start punching people in the face , that ’s what .
Best line : “ People here are funny .
They work so hard at living they forget how to live . ”
One man ’s eyes are opened to the brutality of the surroundings he once embraced .
Though far from a perfect man , Oskar Schindler did all he could to preserve the lives of Jewish workers as the “ Final Solution ” threatened them all with extinction .
Risking his life and using his personal wealth , he was able to save the lives of close to 1,100 people .
Moving , brutal , and beautiful ; it ’s hard to watch but must be .
A masterpiece .
Best line : “ It ’s Hebrew , it ’s from the Talmud .
It says , “ Whoever saves one life , saves the world entire . ”
With newspapers fighting to survive , it ’s great to watch a film about how essential good journalism really is .
The film follows Woodward and Bernstein as they shed light on the break in at the Watergate Hotel and a trail of illegal activity that led to the White House .
Talk about some gutsy reporters .
Watchdogs , indeed .
This movie has all the trimmings of the finest mystery thrillers – but it actually happened .
I bet this movie makes Nixon wish he would have changed that whole “ freedom of the press ” business while he was in office .
Best line : “ Listen … I ’m tired of your chickens * *t games !
I do n’t want hints …
I need to know what you know . ”
The Victoria Cross is awarded to any person under military command for “ most conspicuous bravery , or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self - sacrifice . ”
It is the highest military decoration awarded by the British military , and the battle at Rourkes Drift saw eleven awarded – the most in a single engagement .
140 British soldiers guarding a supply dump faced an overwhelming Zulu army of 4,000 .
They defended themselves and nearly a third of their men that were sick in the infirmary from the onslaught .
The movie is ominous as the stage is set for the battle and urgency takes over as the battle ensues .
Although the movie takes liberties with the elements of the true battle , little is diminished in its inspiring effect .
Best line : “ A prayer ’s as good as bayonet on a day like this . ”
What do you get when you cross a crazy man with a military genius ?
George S. Patton .
Old Blood and Guts .
Patton was an American tank commander who was a main factor in the Allies victories in North Africa and Italy during WWII .
Patton is n’t so much about WWII than it is about this larger than life man .
Even if you have n’t seen this film , you ’ve probably seen the famous speech scene in front of the American flag at the beginning of the movie .
Best line : “ Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country .
He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country . ”
It seems we hear about guerrilla warfare in the desert almost every day in the news .
Maybe we should take some cues from our good buddy Larry of Arabia and turn this war around .
The film follows T.E. Lawrence , an officer in the British army during WWI , as he rallies the Arab people in fighting the British enemies .
Lawrence overcomes crazy odds and impresses the locals with his tenacity and skill .
Best line : “ The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . ”
The Godfather ( I and II )
The Godfather is more than just a shoot em up mobster movie .
It ’s a cinematic masterpiece that touches on themes that are universal to the human condition : family , honor , the choice between good and evil , and revenge just to name a few .
We get a first hand look at the inner-conflict that Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino ) faces as he chooses between leading a normal life or taking part in the family business .
Best line : “ I ’m gonna make him an offer he ca n’t refuse . ”
And a hundred others .
A young disadvantaged boy is charged with murder , and the case against him seems overwhelming .
While all the jurors are ready to convict the kid so they can get back to their lives , one man stands up for justice and gives the kid the fair trial that he deserves .
Despite the social pressure to put in a guilty vote , juror # 8 slowly persuades his fellow jurors that not enough evidence exists to convict the defendant .
Best line : “ We may be trying to let a guilty man go free , I do n’t know .
Nobody really can .
But we have a reasonable doubt , and that ’s something that ’s very valuable in our system .
No jury can declare a man guilty unless it ’s SURE . ”
Sure , most of the characters are mythological creatures like hobbits and dwarfs , but that does n’t mean we can’t gleam some lessons on manliness from them .
In this action - packed and beautifully filmed trilogy we see examples of loyalty , duty , and bravery displayed by the characters .
And the story ’s main protagonist , Frodo Baggins , teaches us that we often do n’t choose our calling in life , it chooses us .
And when it does , give it all you got .
The story is so good you ca n’t help but watch all three back to back in a 9 hour mega marathon .
Gangs of New York takes viewers back to the mean streets of 19th century New York City .
It was time when waves of Irish immigrants poured into New York City every day and the city was rife with political corruption .
Irish American Amsterdam Vallon ( Leonardo Di Carprio ) returns to his old New York neighborhood to avenge the death of his father at the hands of the murderous , knife wielding nativist , Bill the Butcher ( Daniel Day Lewis ) .
The costume design and art direction in this film are amazing and Daniel Day Lewis does an impeccable job in creating one of the most interesting , evil , and strangely sympathetic characters in all of movie history .
He totally got robbed of the Best Actor Oscar .
Best line : “ Thank God .
I die a true American . ”
The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly is the last in Sergio Leone ’s trilogy of “ spaghetti westerns . ”
Despite being the last , it has come to stand on its own .
Even if you have n’t seen the film , you probably know something about it .
Most likely you ’ve heard the iconic theme song with it ’s spooky “ wha wha wha ” shouts .
And you ’ve probably seen images and scenes of Clint Eastwood wearing a poncho and smoking a cigar .
The film follows three cowboys during the Civil War who try to double cross each other in search of Confederate gold .
There ’s not much of a deep message in this film .
It ’s just a lot of fun to watch .
Best line : “ When you have to shoot , shoot .
Do n’t talk . ”
To live deliberately .
This idea is central to the awakening of a group of young preparatory school students inspired by their new English teacher .
Robin Williams plays the role of John Keating , the brazen new teacher at a conservative all boys private school .
He inspires them to view the world differently and suck the marrow out of their lives .
The boys take on their teenage world armed with new perspectives and courage to live their lives with purpose .
Sadly , their tightly controlled lives clash and their new insight is challenged .
The movie is heartbreakingly inspiring and truly encourages one to seize the day , despite the overwhelming opposition .
Best line : “ Carpe diem , seize the day boys , make your lives extraordinary . ”
Directed by the legendary John Ford , John Wayne gives his most intense acting performance of his career as the dark and vengeful Ethan Edwards , who vows to kill the Comanche raiders that murdered his beloved sister - in - law , brother , and took captive two of their daughters .
Wayne does a fantastic job in embodying a conflicted , complex man whose racism and desire for revenge sets up a situation far more morally ambiguous than Cowboys vs. Indians .
Best line : “ That ’ll be the day . ”
The Iron Horse ’s talent and tenacity made him a legend .
His courage in the face of a debilitating disease made him a hero .
Lou Gehrig was one of the classiest baseball players America has ever had and who better to play him than Gary Cooper .
If you ’re not tearing up at the famous “ Luckiest man ” speech , you my friend , have no soul .
Best line : “ Today , I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth . ”
Hailed as the greatest war movie ever made , Saving Private Ryan immerses the viewer in the horrors of the Allied invasion of Europe .
While the battle scenes are great , the story and the underlying question it poses are even better .
Tom
Hanks plays an army captain who leads a small squadron to find and send home a soldier who lost all three of his brothers in war .
Why risk the lives of several men , just to save one ?
That ’s the question that we ’re left asking ourselves during the movie .
The answer ?
It ’s just the decent thing to do .
The end scene will leave you crying like a baby and with a new found respect for the brave men who sacrificed everything for our freedoms .
Best line : “ James , earn this … earn it . ”
Meet Lester Burnham ; a man who feels like he ’s completely dead inside .
His wife and daughter despise him and do n’t show him any respect .
His big corporate job and the demands of modern life have emasculated him .
But Lester starts waking up from his emotional comma after he meets his daughter ’s good looking friend .
Sadly , Lester ’s awakening leads him down a path of immaturity that results in tragic consequences for him and his family .
American Beauty is a beautifully filmed movie that sheds light on the dark side of the American Dream .
We learn from the messed up characters in this movie that happiness ca n’t be bought and that the suburbs can kill your manhood if you let it .
It ’s the Death of a Salesman for the 1990s .
Best line : “ Both my wife and daughter think I ’m this gigantic loser and they ’re right , I have lost something .
I ’m not exactly sure what it is but I know I did n’t always feel this … sedated .
But you know what ?
It ’s never too late to get it back . ”
Seven Samurai is probably one of the most influential films ever made .
Countless westerns were inspired by this 1954 Japanese classic .
The Magnificent Seven being one of them .
Set in feudal Japan , a peasant village hires seven medieval mercenaries to defend it from marauding bandits .
The bravery the seven samurai show will inspire any man to stand up for injustice .
Line : “ This is the nature of war .
By protecting others , you save yourselves . ”
From Here To Eternity is probably best remembered for the famous beach love scene of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr , but there ’s a lot more to this legendary film .
Based on the novel by James Jones , From Here to Eternity is about the life of an American soldier stationed in Hawaii before the bombing of Pearl Harbor .
The film considerably tones down the controversial topics in Jones ’ book .
However , it was still groundbreaking in its depiction of topics that were taboo in the 1950s : serial adultery , alcoholism , and a U.S. military teeming with corruption and incompetence .
The film focuses on two professional soldiers : Prewitt ( Montgomery Clift ) , a hard - headed ex-boxer given ‘ the treatment ’ by his commanding officer to force him to fight in the regimental boxing championships and the company ’s Top Sergeant ( Burt Lancaster ) , who is having an affair with the officer ’s frigid wife ( Deborah Kerr ) .
From
Here to Eternity reminds you that sometimes life ’s a messy thing and does n’t always have happy endings .
Best line : “ A man do n’t go his own way , he ’s nothing . ”
No other movie better portrays the powerful bond between man and canine .
No other movie better drives home the message that becoming a man sometimes means doing things that hurt .
Best line : “ He was my dog .
I ’ll do it . ”
Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch , a small - town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two , who passionately defends a black man accused of raping a white woman .
The courtroom scenes have inspired many a legal career .
In addition to being an inspiring lawyer , Atticus Finch is an inspiring father .
If you ’re a dad or a dad to be , watch To Kill a Mockingbird and take some notes .
Best line : “ If you can learn a simple trick , Scout , you ’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks .
You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view , until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it . ”
The first James Bond film and quite possibly the best .
007 ( Sean Connery ) is sent on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the murder of a fellow MI - 6 agent .
Action , intrigue , and sexually suggestive named women are mixed in to make this a stellar guilty pleasure .
Best line : “ Bond . James Bond . ”
An American soldier ( Robert Redford ) goes west to escape the Mexican War and becomes a mountain man .
A grizzled old trapper takes Johnson in and teaches him how to survive harsh winters , bears , and Indians .
After accidentally violating an Indian burial ground , he loses his new Indian wife and their adopted child to vengeance , and a vendetta between him and the Crows ruins his idyllic life as a fur trapper .
For about half the movie we get to see Jeremiah Johnson take on surprise attacks by Crow Indians with nothing but his fists and a Bowie knife .
The film is actually based on the real life of mountain man Jeremiah Johnson
Best line : “ Where you headed ? ” “ Same place you are , Jeremiah : hell , in the end ”
A River Runs Through
It follows an older brother ’s attempt to save his talented brother from self - destruction through the healing power of fly fishing .
Set in Montana ’s beautiful Blackfoot River country , the viewer is presented with stunning shots of nature .
Director Robert Redford ’s commentary and narration engages the viewer to ponder important life questions .
From the story we learn that sometimes the people we love the most are the hardest to help .
Best line : “ It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us . ”
A group of British prisoners of war during WWII are ordered to build a bridge for the Japanese Burma - Siam railway .
Instead of sabotaging the bridge , the men build the bridge under the command of Colonel Nicholson .
The bridge becomes a metaphor for the futility and insanity of war , egotistical pride , a belief in saving “ face , ” and stubborn , inflexible obedience to class , military codes and rules .
Best line : “ Do not speak to me of rules .
This is war !
This is not a game of cricket ”
“ I swear I ’m not a racist but … ”
So many people have no idea what their true feelings toward people are until their foot is shoved in their mouth .
In the film , Phil Green ( Gregory Peck ) poses as a Jewish man in the cultured society of New York and Connecticut to gain information for a magazine article .
His eyes are opened to the world of bigotry that often goes unnoticed .
Best line : “ I ’ve come to see lots of nice people who hate it and deplore it and protest their own innocence , then help it along and wonder why it grows .
People who would never beat up a Jew .
People who think anti-Semitism is far away in some dark place with low - class morons .
That ’s the biggest discovery I ’ve made .
The good people .
The nice people . ”
At first blush , Fight Club just seems like another violent movie with guys beating each other to a bloody pulp .
The fighting , however , is just a vehicle to explore and critique the sad state of modern American masculinity .
Everything about Fight Club is amazing - the story , the cinematography , the acting , everything .
Edward Norton plays a nameless narrator whose life has been hollowed out by his job and his desire to own all the contents in the IKEA catalog .
His life changes when he meets soap salesman , Tyler Durden .
I wish I could go on , but I can ’t .
The first rule of Fight Club is never talk about Fight Club .
Guess you ’ll have to see the movie yourself .
Best line : “ You ’re not your job .
You ’re not how much money you have in the bank .
You ’re not the car you drive .
You ’re not the contents of your wallet .
You ’re not your f**** ing khakis . ”
Indiana Jones ( Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade )
The hat , the whip , the legend .
There are n’t too many films that inspire adventure today .
The problem with most current action movies is that there ’s too much emphasis on the action and not enough time spent on developing a good story .
Indiana Jones strikes a perfect balance of action and first rate storytelling .
Watching an Indiana Jones movie will take you back to your boyhood dreams of fighting Nazis , getting the girl , and swinging from beams with your trusty bullwhip .
A perennial Christmastime favorite ( mainly because the copyright was n’t renewed in 1975 and TV stations could air it for free ) .
We often think of It ’s a Wonderful Life as a heart warming and inspiring film .
But if you take a step back , you ’ll see that there ’s an underlying darkness to it .
George Bailey ( Jimmy Stewart ) had dreams of traveling , going on adventures , and being an architect in a big city .
But his responsibilities to his family and his community kept him from leaving his small town .
After the savings and loan he owns goes bust , Bailey considers suicide ( pretty heavy for the 1940s ) , only to be shown what life would be like without him .
In the end , he learns that happiness is found not in pursuing big dreams but through family , friends , and fulfilling responsibility to those around you .
Best line : “ Strange , is n’t it ?
Each man ’s life touches so many other lives .
When he is n’t around he leaves an awful hole , does n’t he ? ”
Is A Raisin in the Sun about racism ?
Obviously .
Is it about family and dreams and identity ?
Of course .
But it ’s also about being a man .
About becoming a man .
Walter Lee Younger makes mistakes , he ’s stubborn , and he has his dreams dashed .
But he ’s not defeated .
He finds the humility to unite with his family and the pride to stand up for his convictions .
He mans up in the end .
Best line : “ ” He finally come into his manhood today , did n’t he ?
Kind of like a rainbow after the rain . ”
When we think of mythic heroes , we often think of characters from classical history like Achilles or Agamemnon .
In The Natural , we see the archetype of the epic and mythological hero transposed from the battlefields of ancient Greece to the baseball diamonds of 1920 ’s America .
Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs , a baseball player whose promising career was cut short in his youth by a deadly dame .
16 years later , Roy is back to fulfill his dream to play major league ball .
Just as Achilles had his mythological armor made by the gods , Roy wields his mythological bat , aptly named “ Boy Wonder , ” made from a tree struck by lightning .
When you get down to it , The Natural is about re-birth and going after a dream no matter what it takes .
Beautifully shot and masterfully scored , you ’ll be bawling like a baby by the time the credits roll .
Best line : “ You ’ve got a gift Roy … but it ’s not enough – you ’ve got to develop yourself .
If you rely too much on your own gift … then … you ’ll fail . ”
I hold a special place in my heart for Ghostbusters .
When I was a kid , I was obsessed with the movie .
I watched it over and over , played the video games , and had all the Ghostbusters toys .
Moreover , from the ages of 4 until 6 , I demanded that my family call me Peter Venkman and not Brett .
Back then I loved the movie primarily for the cool special effects and proton packs .
20 years later , I still think the proton packs are cool .
But I ’m finally starting to appreciate how incredibly funny Ghostbusters is .
There ’s no deep meaning you can take away from Ghostbusters , it ’s just a really entertaining and fun movie .
When you ’re looking for something to watch after a long day at work , you know who to call .
Best line : “ Ray , when someone asks you if you ’re a god , you say ‘ YES ! ' ”
Two words : Chariot Race .
Before CGI and all the other wires and fancy tricks , they had real guys doing crazy stuff that most filmmakers today wo n’t even dream about .
And man , does it pay off for this picture .
The chariot race is probably the most remembered event in the film , but it is certainly not the guts of the story .
Family , the futility of revenge , inner peace , and a host of other themes lay the foundation for the character arc of Judah Ben Hur .
One of Charleton Heston ’s greatest roles .
Best line : “ You can break a man ’s skull , you can arrest him , you can throw him into a dungeon .
But how do you control what ’s up here ?
How do you fight an idea ? ”
On it ’s surface , Groundhog Day is just another comedy .
But if you delve deeper , you ’ll find a story that drives home some profound messages .
Bill Murray plays Phil Connors , a cynical egotistical weatherman who , for some reason , must live the same day over and over .
That day just happens to be Groundhog ’s Day .
We never learn how long Phil is stuck in this purgatory of repetition .
It could have been a month or maybe even a thousand years .
While the repetition provides some funny gags , it also sets up a backdrop for Phil ( and the audience ) to be hit with a heavy dose of anagnorisis .
From
Phil ’s plight we learn the only real change in life can only come from within us .
Best line : “ I ’m a god . ” “ You ’re God ? ” “ I ’m a god .
I ’m not * the * God … I do n’t think . ”
Another childhood favorite .
Remember how I forced my family to call me Peter Venckman for two years after I saw Ghostbusters ?
Well , after I saw Top Gun in Kindergarten , they were calling me Maverick .
In the role that made him a blockbuster star , Tom Cruise plays cocky navy pilot Pete “ Maverick ” Mitchell who is selected to train with the best of the best at the prestigious Navy flight school called “ Top Gun . ”
Yeah , the story is sort of cheesy and yeah , some of the battle scenes were n’t all that realistic , but Top Gun entertains from beginning to end .
Plus , it has a killer Kenny Loggins theme song .
What more can you ask for in a 80 ’s flick ?
Best line : ” I feel the need … the need for speed ! ”
We ’ve all had moments in our life when our self confidence has been completely obliterated .
Nothing goes right and it seems as though nothing will .
But with time and some help from our buds , we get our swagger back .
To me , that ’s what Swingers is all about .
John Favereu plays
Mike , a crestfallen 20 - something living in LA who was recently dumped by his girlfriend .
His confidence hits an all time low , but with the help from his smooth talking buddy , Trent ( Vince Vaughn ) , Mike slowly starts to come out of his shell .
Swingers has some of the best dialogue I ’ve ever seen in a film and is full of memorable quotes you can pull out when your buddy is feeling down on himself .
Best line : “ You ’re so money and you do n’t even know it . ”
June 6 , 1944 – the invasion of the Allied soldiers on the beaches of Normandy .
One of the turning points in all of history .
The film tells the story from both sides – Axis and Allies .
For both it will be the longest day .
Best line : “ You ca n’t give the enemy a break .
Send him to hell . ”

Born in 1896 , Henry Allingham was the world 's oldest man and one of the last surviving first world war servicemen
Henry William Allingham , the world 's oldest man and one of the last surviving first world war servicemen , has died at the age of 113 .
Born in 1896 to an ironmonger 's wife in a corner of north - east London , the veteran , whose life spanned three centuries and six monarchs , was 67 when John F Kennedy was assassinated and 73 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon .
He died this morning at the St Dunstan 's care home in Ovingdean , near Brighton , East Sussex .
Allingham was 18 when the war broke out .
His mother begged him not to join the military , but a year after her death in 1915 he signed up .
The teenager could not have guessed he would became a symbol of the sacrifice of a generation .
At the time of his death , he was the last surviving founder member of the RAF , the last man to have witnessed the Battle of Jutland and the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service .
When asked recently how he had lived so long , Allingham , who held the Legion d'Honneur , said : " I do n't know if there is a secret , but keeping within your capacity is vital .
I 've had two major breakdowns , one during the war and one after , but both when I was trying to do the work of three men .
The trick is to look after yourself and always know your limitations . "
It was his experiences during the war that defined the man , but for more than 80 years he refused to speak about it .
After the war , Allingham went into the motor industry , eventually joining the design department at Ford before retiring in 1961 .
He was finally persuaded to talk about the past by Dennis Goodwin who , as founder of the First World War Veterans ' Association , organised reunions and trips for old soldiers .
" He 'd answer the door and not let me in , " recalled Goodwin , his carer and the ghost writer of his memoirs .
" He 'd say , ' I want to forget the war , I do n't want to talk about it ' .
But I sent him letters about the reunions and gradually he let me in and we got talking .
Eventually I got him out of his flat in Eastbourne and took him to the pier .
He met other veterans and started to think , ' I could do this ' .
It was a very slow process – he 's essentially a very private man . "
Once Allingham started talking , it became clear that the scenes he witnessed of soldiers waiting to go over the top at Ypres never left him .
" They would just stand there in 2ft of water in mud - filled trenches , waiting to go forward , " he said .
" They knew what was coming .
It was pathetic to see those men like that .
I do n't think they have ever got the admiration and respect they deserved . "
He remembered spending a night in a shellhole in Flanders .
" It stank , " he said .
" So did I when I fell into it .
Arms and legs , dead rats , dead everything .
Rotten flesh .
Human guts .
I could n't get a bath for three or four months afterwards . "
In recent years , Allingham attended remembrance events at home and abroad , gave interviews to the media , visited schools to talk to children at least 100 years his junior and completed an autobiography , published last October .
He and his wife , Dorothy , were together for more than 50 years .
" I 've only ever kissed one girl : my Dorothy , " he said .
" We met in 1915 and married in 1918 .
She died in 1970 .
I never gave my cherry away when I went to the front .
I know a lot of men who did . "
Allingham leaves a family that includes five grandchildren , 12 great - grandchildren , 14 great - great grandchildren and one great - great - great grandchild .
Until the end of his life , Allingham 's memory was sharp .
Born the year the first modern Olympics were held and Queen Victoria 's became the longest reigning monarch in British history , he was able to recall times that are long lost history to most of us .
" When I was 15 , I came downstairs one morning , picked up mother 's newspaper and , oh , what a shock !
The Titanic had gone , " he recalled .
" The ' unsinkable ' ship – but it had gone down so simple . "
The former Ford worker remembered a time when cars were a rarity .
" People drive fast today , " he said .
" When I was born the speed limit was two miles an hour .
They 'd only just repealed the law where a man had to walk in front of every motor car waving a flag . "
He had two explanations for his longevity .
The first , which proved age had not dimmed his sense of humour , was " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women " .
The second , however , was perhaps more thoughtful .
" How have I lived so long ?
I never worried .
In the 20s there were millions of men out of work .
You could n't get a job anywhere .
I was n't worried .
I 'm not worried now , " he said .
" I was cycling along Rotten Row one day when I saw George V come along on his horse .
I took my cap off , and the King tipped his riding crop .
And I said , ' Give me a job , sir , I 'll do anything for you . '
But it was lost in the clatter of the hooves . "
Max Arthur , author of the first world war oral history Last Post , had yet another explanation : " He was a very dignified , very gentle man .
He was so surprised to survive the first world war that he saw whatever came next as a reward .
He made the most of his life .
It does exemplify in my mind that , whatever age you are , never give up , and when in doubt , sing , which is what he still does .
Sheer defiance is the reason he keeps going . "
Last month , Allingham seemed to agree : " I 'm not the kid I used to be , but I still get around .
You make your own happiness , whatever age you are .
Seeing the funny side of life is useful , and I 've always had a sense of humour .
People ask me , what 's the secret of a long life ?
I do n't know . "
• This article was amended on 20 July 2009 .
The original said that Henry Allingham was 14 when the first world war broke out .
This has been corrected .
Here in New York City , Rooftop Films is " celebrating " the awfulness that was Troll 2 with two nights of special screenings in Williamsburg , Brooklyn .
Tonight , they screen the actual 1990 " horror " movie , Troll 2 ; and Friday , they 'll screen the documentary Best Worst Movie , which explored the fandom that has sprung up around the film and tracked down the people who were a part of Troll 2 in the first place .
But is Troll 2 really the " best worst movie " ever made ?
That 's something that we can readily debate .
Of the thousands of feature films produced every year , there are many that aim squarely for our collective funny bones .
Some hit the target , such as this year 's The Hangover .
Others miss the mark , for one reason or another , and do n't get widespread appeal ( Land of the Lost ; I Love You , Beth Cooper ; Miss March ) .
But every so often , a film comes along that -- whether it's a casing of trying too hard , or clearly not trying hard enough -- fails on all levels in a way that actually makes you want to watch it over and over again .
Usually , these were not meant to be comedies .
It just " worked " out that way .
The Room ( 2003 ) : Lindsay Robertson ( late of Videogum , always at Lindsayism ) has made quite the argument for Tommy Wiseau 's opus , and you can the Videogum 's full report on The Room , and even Charlie Gibson at ABC News anchored a report suggesting this 2003 gem as a diamond in the roughest .
Showgirls ( 1995 ) : When Showgirls came out in 1995 , it was meant to be Paul Verhoeven 's dramatic look inside the world of Las Vegas showgirls -- we were meant to imagine his hit Basic Instinct , but even more edgy and daring .
Instead , the vehicle made us look at Elizabeth Berkley , and swimming pool sex , in a whole new light .
We watched it to mock it .
Even they know it now , coming out with a V.I.P. edition of the film with its own party games for viewers to play along .
The Warriors ( 1979 ) : Whenever this movie appeared on TV , it freaked the freak out of me .
Could n't figure out what was happening , why there were gangs in funny costumes creating mayhem in the streets of New York City , and determined never to ride the subways again .
Of course , I was just a kid .
Now that I 'm growns up , and everyone else is , too , we all want to dress up as these guys for Halloween and say " Warriors , come out to pla-ay ! "
Naturally , it has become a videogame , and someone is trying to remake this , and it will just plain suck the second time around , instead of being the movie we love because of its awfulness .
Then again , maybe New York City was really like this in 1979 ???
Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) : The " original " midnight movie has a fan site and all sorts of rules for viewers to obey , plus groups devoted to keeping the movie 's spirit and screening alive .
You do n't want to mess with them by suggesting another film is more worthy of midnight madness , do you ?
Snakes on a Plane ( 2006 ) : This could be the first movie that was a best worst movie , even before it made it to the cinemas , as the Internet picked up on the simplistic concept -- people are scared by snakes and planes , so they 'll be doubly scared with snakes on a plane ! -- and ran with it .
I remember going to a midnight screening , where everyone was so supercharged and ready for madness , only for everything to get weird when we all realized just how bad this movie was .
Even with Samuel L. Jackson 's line readings .
Clash of the Titans ( 1981 ) : How could a movie with Sir Laurence Olivier and the Gods of Olympus be on this list ?
Perhaps the cheesy dialogue and stop- motion animation had something to do with it .
First Burgess Meredith helps Rocky , and now he 's aiding Harry Hamlin , with a robotic owl ?
Even as a child first watching this , I could n't stop cracking up .
Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) : When I first saw an appendage crawling across the floor to attack Bruce Campbell , and found out it was his own severed hand , I knew I was seeing something special .
Although with a 98 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes , can Sam Raimi 's horror film even be on this list ?
Or maybe , just maybe , that 's what makes this the best of the worst movies ?
The Beastmaster ( 1982 ) : One of the great things about cable television is its ability to find bad movies and play them repeatedly , in just the right time slots for impressionable young minds to see them and latch onto them .
Marc Singer can talk to animals ?
Tanya Roberts skimps around in next to nothing ?
Perfect fodder for adolescent boys everywhere .
In fact , I think it was on as much during the mid-to - late 1980s as Law & Order is on today .
And that finally prompted a couple of sequels in the 1990s that nobody cares about as much as the original .
Flash Gordon ( 1980 ) :
It has a great theme song from Queen ; it had a future James Bond in Timothy Dalton , and Max Von Sydow as the villain .
What could go wrong ?
Everything .
And yet , it 's also awesome in every way .
If you were to tell me it was on TV right now , I would watch it .
And here , is a look at Troll 2 .
Of course , you probably have your own favorite films that you love for their awesome horribleness .
Plan 9 From Outer Space , anyone ?
And as I 've written previously , there are groups out there willing to help you enjoy how bad some movies are with their live mock screenings , including the Raspberry Brothers and the many spawn of MST3K .
Feel free to weigh in with your input , additions , subtractions , and theories as to why horrible movies can do as much for the comedy genre as actual comedy films .

The electronic cigarette and other battery - powered devices are designed to provide the physical sensation and flavors similar to inhaled tobacco smoke .
The Food and Drug Administration , recently granted the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug , is taking aim at electronic cigarettes — battery - powered cigarette look - alikes that deliver nicotine and produce a puff of odorless vapor .
Tests show that e-cigarettes contain " known carcinogens and toxic chemicals , " including diethylene glycol , an ingredient used in antifreeze , officials announced Wednesday during a teleconference .
The FDA notes that the products have no warning labels .
Over the past year , the FDA has seized 50 shipments of e-cigarettes , which the agency considers to be combination drug / medical devices , says the FDA 's Michael Levy .
Companies were marketing the products illegally , because they had n't gotten FDA approval for new drugs or medical devices , says Joshua Sharfstein , principal deputy commissioner of the FDA .
The FDA is reviewing the new tobacco law and considering a range of enforcement actions , which could include recalls or even criminal sanctions , Levy says .
E- cigarette makers say their products can be used anywhere and do n't produce secondhand smoke .
In April , one maker , Smoking Everywhere , filed a federal lawsuit against the FDA , claiming the agency does n't have the jurisdiction to regulate its products .
Health advocates , however , say that e-cigarettes are being marketed to kids .
By adding flavors such as bubble gum , e-cigarettes could get children hooked on nicotine and serve as a gateway to tobacco , says Jonathan Winickoff , chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics ' Tobacco Consortium , who spoke at the FDA 's teleconference .
He notes that the products are sold online and at shopping malls , where their marketing videos are seen by children and teens .
Ads make e-cigarettes look sexy and grown - up , says Matthew McKenna of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
And seeing adults use them in public places that are normally smoke - free could make kids think that smoking — of any kind — is normal and safe , he says .
On its website , the Electronic Cigarette Association denies marketing to children .
It notes that the $ 100 cost of an e-cigarette starter kit — and the added cost of refill cartridges — make them unaffordable for kids .
Ron MacDonald , president and CEO of Crown7 e-cigarettes , says he 's just trying to give smokers an alternative to tobacco .
" The bottom line is that if a smoker wants to smoke , they are going to smoke regular cigarettes , " he says .

Remember that New York Times slideshow we pointed to this weekend ?
The Old Grey Online Lady sent out a pro journalist to capture picture of housing ruins all over America .
They were nice pics .
But now they 've taken it down because some sharper folks than us discovered they were digitally altered .
PDNPulse ( via Gawker ) shows instance after instance of manipulation , which is all really sad and ridiculous , since it should n't be so hard for a pro photographer to take great shots American ruins .
If we were the NYT we'd sue the guy , since it can't have been cheap to send him all around the country for these snapshots .
Seriously .
Says PDNPulse :
Working from a copy of the Times Magazine , PDN has identified evidence of manipulation in three of Martin 's six published photos .
A blogger first noticed the project was suspect based on a photo that ran online only .
In all four cases , unlikely repetitions of elements suggest that they are composites or have had some elements covered up .
One picture shows an evenly - lit room in an unsold mansion in Greenwich , Connecticut .
The room appears near - perfect in its symmetry , down to have two identical thermostats and light switch plates facing each other on opposite walls .
There are also repeating patterns in the leaves on the floor .

Structural image editing .
Left to right : ( a ) the original image ; ( b ) a hole is marked ( magenta ) and we use line constraints ( red/ green / blue ) to improve the continuity of the roofline ; ( c ) the hole is filled in ; ( d ) user - supplied line constraints for retargeting ; ( e ) retargeting using constraints eliminates two columns automatically ; and ( f ) user translates the roof upward using reshuffling .
Abstract
This paper presents interactive image editing tools using a new randomized algorithm for quickly finding approximate nearest neighbor matches between image patches .
Previous research in graphics and vision has leveraged such nearest - neighbor searches to provide a variety of high - level digital image editing tools .
However , the cost of computing a field of such matches for an entire image has eluded previous efforts to provide interactive performance .
Our algorithm offers substantial performance improvements over the previous state of the art ( 20 - 100x ) , enabling its use in interactive editing tools .
The key insights driving the algorithm are that some good patch matches can be found via random sampling , and that natural coherence in the imagery allows us to propagate such matches quickly to surrounding areas .
We offer theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm , as well as empirical and practical evidence for its high quality and performance .
This one simple algorithm forms the basis for a variety of tools � image retargeting , completion and reshuffling � that can be used together in the context of a high - level image editing application .
Finally , we propose additional intuitive constraints on the synthesis process that offer the user a level of control unavailable in previous methods .

A senior Bank of England official today compared the banking system over the last 20 years to the South Sea bubble of the early 18th century and said bankers had merely " resorted to the roulette wheel " to keep up with each other .
The Bank 's executive director for financial stability , Andy Haldane , said in a speech in Chicago that having been stable over much of the 20th century , returns in the banking system relative to the wider stockmarket shot up after 1986 until 2006 .
" Banking became the goose laying the golden eggs .
There is no period in recent UK financial history which bears comparison , " he said .
He said bankers and policymakers became seduced by the excess returns available : " Banks appeared to have discovered a money machine , albeit one whose workings were sometimes impossible to understand .
" One of the South Sea stocks was memorably 'a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage , but nobody to know what it is ' .
Banking became the 21st - century equivalent . "
He said banking returns over the period were magnified by leverage as banks borrowed excessively , he said .
Returns on banking shares relative to the wider market
" During the golden era , competition simultaneously drove down returns on assets and drove up target returns on equity .
Caught in this crossfire , higher leverage became banks ' only means of keeping up with the Jones's .
Management resorted to the roulette wheel . "
He noted that the 80 % slump in bank shares since the credit crunch hit meant that returns from the sector were now back in line with their longer - run average ( see graphic above ) .
The market capitalisation of global banks has fallen by $ 3tn ( £ 1.8 bn ) since the crisis began , he said .
" We should aspire to a financial system where there is greater market and regulatory scrutiny of future such money machines .
In achieving this , there is a role for some body – a systemic overseer – which is able to detect incipient bubbles and fads and , as importantly , act to correct them .
This role is about removing the punchbowl from future financial sector parties . "
He said that in future there would have to be a greater distinction between management skill , which improves return on assets , and luck , when return on equity can be magnified by leverage .
" Good luck and good management need to be better distinguished .
Put differently , returns to investors and managers need to be more accurately risk - adjusted if the right balance between risk and return is to be struck for individual firms and for the financial system as a whole . "
A second lesson , he added , was that there would have to be much stricter system - wide limits on leverage , particularly among big banks whose stability is crucial to the whole financial system .
" For a number of diseases , 20 % of the population account for around 80 % of the disease spread .
The present financial epidemic has broadly mirrored those dynamics , " he said , adding that the failure of a core set of large , interconnected institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and AIG contributed disproportionately to the spread of financial panic .
" Epidemiology provides a second key lesson for financial policymakers – the importance of targeted vaccination of these ' super - spreaders ' of financial contagion .
Historically , financial regulation has tended not to heed that message . "
He welcomed a recent move by US authorities to bring the trading of credit derivatives , which were at the heart of the crisis , on to exchanges so they could be better understood and controlled .
" This is a bold measure and one which deserves international support . "
Haldane 's speech was part of a growing debate among global policymakers to try to build a better system of regulation and control of the financial system to prevent such crises as the current one from occurring again .

Freedom at risk
|PIC1| Thus , many Christians around the world are paying close attention to the E.U. ’s so - called “ Equal Treatment ” Directive .
This Directive extends “ discrimination ” law based on sexual orientation , religion or belief , to the provision of goods , facilities and services .
Included within the parameters of discrimination is something the directive calls harassment .
Unfortunately , the Equality and Human Rights Commission recently endorsed the harassment provision of the proposed Directive .
In doing so , the EHRC gravely threatens freedom of speech and the free exercise of religious conscience in the United Kingdom .
“ Harassment , ” as vaguely defined in the Directive , allows an individual to accuse someone of discrimination merely for expressing something the individual allegedly perceives as creating an offensive environment .
For example , once someone decides to perceive an offer of prayers or words of comfort by a hospital chaplain based on his faith as offensive , that person can bring legal action against the chaplain and the hospital , even if the chaplain at the hospital intended no offense .
To further chill fundamental freedoms , the burden of proof then shifts to the chaplain to prove that the accuser was not offended .
Discussions about faith or sexual ethics , during the provision of a service to the public or commercial service , provide endless opportunities for individuals to allege offence – and to silence those whose views are informed by ancient sacred tenets .
Censuring an idea simply because the idea is informed by a religious worldview , prevents thousands of years of wisdom from informing the civic ethic .
A citizen who attempts to inform the civic ethic should not be punished or persecuted simply because the citizen ’s ideas are informed by sincerely held Christian truths .
In a democracy , freedom of expression is not needed to protect the ideas of people with whom those in power agree – it is needed to protect people who express ideas with which those in power do not agree .
Thus , the test of a functioning moral democracy is not whether the government protects speech with which it agrees – it is whether it will protect expression which is against its own viewpoint .
Instead of censuring or punishing speech , good governance always allows more speech .
Selective enforcement and punishment of expression sends a bitter chill throughout the citizenry in a democracy .
Institutional integrity cannot exist without personal virtue .
Good governance and civic institutional integrity rest on the virtue of its citizens .
Christian ideas support and nurture this virtue and should , therefore , always be permitted within the marketplace of ideas .

Japan has had its fair share of UFO sightings over the years , but few encounters have been as peculiar as the one involving the mini-UFO captured in Kochi prefecture in 1972 .
Photograph of mini-UFO captured in Japan , 1972
The strange encounter took place in the Kera area of Kochi City .
On the afternoon of August 25 , 1972 , a 13 - year - old junior high student named Michio Seo sighted a strange object flying above a rice field while walking home from school .
From a distance he watched the small , mysterious object zigzag quickly around the field like a bat chasing insects .
Later that day , Michio told his friends about the curious flying object .
" UFO " had yet to become a household word in Japan in 1972 , but the boys were intrigued nonetheless .
At around 7:00 PM , four of them set out for the rice field in search of the object .
About an hour later , they spotted the object flying over the rice field , lighting up the night with a pulsating silver light .
When one of the boys tried to approach to object , it suddenly made a loud " pop " sound and started to glow blue .
Frightened , they turned and fled without looking back .
Over a week later , at 9:30 PM on September 4 , several of the boys once again saw the bright object in the rice field .
And two days after that , on September 6 , the boys and a few of their friends found the object on the ground in the field .
It appeared to have crash - landed .
One of boys -- a 14 - year - old named Hiroshi Mori ( 14 ) -- picked the object up with his hands and carried it home .
The silver , hat - shaped object weighed 1.3 kilograms ( 3 lbs ) and measured roughly 7 centimeters ( 3 in ) tall and 15 centimeters ( 6 in ) in diameter .
The bottom surface was perforated with an array of tiny holes and imprinted with designs depicting what appeared to be a bird , some waves , and another flying object .
Something rattled around inside the object when shaken .
That night , Hiroshi wrapped the curious object in a plastic bag and placed it inside his backpack .
Later , however , the object mysteriously vanished without a trace .
Before long , the boys encountered the object again .
They once again captured it , but it soon vanished .
This happened about five or six times over the next two weeks .
On one occasion , the boys decided to pour water into the holes on the bottom .
The object emitted a loud cicada - like buzzing sound and glowed brightly inside .
Later , when they ran some wire through the holes and dangled the object upside - down , the top and bottom sections of the object became slightly separated .
Through the opening , they could see what appeared to be electronic components .
On the night of September 22 , Hiroshi was riding his bicycle with the object in the basket when it suddenly disappeared .
They never saw it again .
In 2007 , 35 years after the incident , the Japan Space Phenomena Society ( JSPS ) conducted a new investigation into the case .
According to Kazuo Hayashi , head of the JSPS Osaka chapter , all of the witnesses still stand by their original story .
The mini-UFO of 1972 was not the last that would be encountered in Kochi prefecture .
Nearly four years later , on the night of June 6 , 1976 , a 9 - year - old girl named Sachiko Oyama in the village of Agawa ( now called Niyodogawa - cho ) stepped outside to look for her family cat .
She noticed a bright yellow luminous object in the eastern sky .
When she went to the street for a better view , the object suddenly descended into the surrounding woods , struck a nearby tree , and landed at her feet .
It made no sound when it hit the pavement .
The silver , hat - shaped object appeared to be about 15 centimeters ( 7 in ) in diameter .
Curious , Sachiko touched it with her index finger .
The object was constructed of solid material , but it was covered in a slimy substance that stuck to her finger .
She suddenly felt afraid started to run home .
Over her shoulder , she saw the object start to glow yellow , spin counter - clockwise three times , and shoot quickly back into the sky .
What could explain these mysterious mini-UFO sightings ?
Perhaps there is a rational explanation -- or maybe they were hoaxes .
It 's also possible the encounters were the products of overactive imaginations .
Or perhaps , as suggested by JSPS head Kazuo Hayashi , these flying objects temporarily lost their way after slipping into our realm from another dimension .

Because the French Open and Wimbledon have been available on the BBC website I ’ve been watching a lot of tennis recently .
And as I do so I ca n’t help thinking about whether mathematics has anything to say about the tactics that the players should adopt in various situations .
And the more I think ( or rather , idly muse ) about this question , the more it becomes clear that the modelling problem it presents is a pretty hard one .
Most of this post will be a discussion of questions rather than a serious attempt to supply answers .
Just to make the discussion more concrete , here are a couple of more specific questions , which I ’ll come back to later .
The first one is fairly simple .
1 . It is generally held to be a slight advantage to serve first in a set .
The reasoning goes like this .
Let ’s suppose ( for simplicity ) that the game goes with serve till 4 - 4 .
If you are serving first , then you will be in a very dangerous position if your serve is broken , since you will then have to break back immediately or lose the set .
However , at least you wo n’t have lost .
By contrast , if you are serving second and the score is 4 - 5 , then you ca n’t afford to be broken — if you are broken then you lose the set and do not get even a small chance to redeem yourself .
And if you have just broken your opponent so that it ’s 5 - 4 , then you still have the task of serving for the set .
However , a simple model would suggest that this reasoning is flawed .
If you have a probability of winning a game on your serve and a probability of winning it on your opponent ’s serve , then over the next two games you have a probability of winning both , of winning one , and of losing both , and the order the games are played in makes no difference .
I ’ll come back to the ( not particularly interesting ) solution of this “ paradox ” in a moment , but before that let me turn to a second and rather general piece of conventional tennis wisdom .
2 . It seems pretty obvious that different circumstances call for different styles of play .
For example , if you are a break up and 40 - 0 on your serve , then it feels as though you can afford to take a few risks , whereas if you are serving a second serve at match point down , then you should play it a little bit safe , since a double fault would cost you the match ( and similarly , if you are going for a winner , you should n’t aim too close to the line , and so on ) .
But a very simple argument suggests that a different piece of tennis wisdom , the one that says , “ Forget where you are in the game and just take things point by point ” must be correct .
After all , the best strategy cannot be anything other than to maximize the probability that you win the point , so if it ever makes sense to serve a reasonably powerful second serve and risk serving a double fault , then it makes sense even if you are match point down .
I have more mathematics - of - tennis questions that I want to mention , but first let ’s dispose of these two , by thinking about what the model is that underlies the second argument in each case and what important factors it fails to take into account .
It is a model much loved by setters of questions in elementary probability : on each point , if player A is serving then there is a probability that A will win and a probability that B will win , whereas if player B is serving then these probabilities are and .
Moreover , the outcomes of all the points are independent .
If that were a realistic model , then there would indeed be no advantage in serving first , and one should play the same tactics on every point .
However , there are two ( at least ) very important things that it does not take into account .
One is that the probabilities change according to how nervous a player is ( and also , it has to be said , appear to ebb and flow during a match for no apparent reason ) .
So for example it might be a good strategy to serve a rather lame second serve when you are match point down , since if you do a normal one then nerves are more likely to cause you to mess it up , and your opponent ’s nerves may cause them to mess up their return even if under normal circumstances they could hit a winner off it .
Similarly , the pressure of serving at 4 - 5 down is greater than the pressure of serving at 5 - 4 up , so perhaps there really is some justification for the belief that serving first is an advantage .
Unfortunately , there does n’t seem to be an easy way of realistically incorporating players ’ psychological states into a model , so let ’s set that question aside ( unless someone feels like having a go at it ) .
But there is a second consideration that does lend itself to a mathematical analysis , and that is the fact that if you play precisely the same tactic every point , then you will be handing an advantage to your opponent .
For instance , you may win the point with probability if you serve out wide , and with probability if you serve near the T , but if you serve out wide every time , then your opponent can take advantage of this by standing wider , at which point the probability of winning the point will no longer be but something lower that may well be less than .
I think ( without having checked ) that one can deal with the second consideration by defining a strategy to be something that tells you not what shot to play at each stage , but what probability distribution to choose your shot from : e.g. , it might tell you to serve out wide 50 % of the time , for the T 30 % of the time , and straight at the body 20 % of the time .
And the optimal strategy would be the probability distribution that maximized your overall probability of winning the point .
That sounds to me like fairly standard game theory .
A third factor I wo n't discuss here is conservation of energy — not the basic law of physics , but the more homely physical principle that says that if you run around too much then you will get tired later on .
That might tell you that if you can just get a shot back by running all the way across the court , but can't do anything with it when you do except gently pat it over the net straight at your opponent , then it might be better not to bother , even if it increases your chances of winning the point from 0 to 1/100 .
There 's one more question I want to mention , and it's the main one I wondered about .
It is how one should model the tactical decisions that are made during a rally .
As a warm - up , here is a special case .
It 's your first serve .
Is it better to go all out for an ace , or should you try for a serve that has a slightly higher chance of going in and still leaves you in a very strong position ?
Under suitable assumptions , that question is pretty easy once one puts some numbers in .
Let 's suppose that if you go for an ace , then you 'll serve one with probability and you 'll serve a fault with probability .
( That ignores the possibility that your opponent might occasionally be able to get your serve back , but let us indeed ignore that . )
And let 's suppose that if you go for a serve that is merely very hard to return , then you 'll succeed with probability and serve a fault with probability , and furthermore that if you succeed then your opponent will give you the opportunity to smash , and that your smash will win the point with probability ( which is very close to ) and will go out with probability .
Then if you go for an ace , you win with probability , and if you go for a win on your second shot then you win with probability .
After that trivial calculation , the question that remains is whether is likely to be higher or lower than , and rather boringly I do n't have any idea .
By roughly how much do professional tennis players increase their first - serve percentage if they make their serves very slightly slower , or very slightly less close to the lines ?
And how much can they afford to do that before their serves become easy to return ?
Obviously it depends a lot on who is playing , so a different question might be whether it is in fact the case that there are professional tennis players who are trying for aces when it is clearly not the best strategy .
( Of course , the mixing - it - up principle could complicate this question and lead to the conclusion that one should sometimes try for an ace and sometimes go for a good first serve that leaves one in a strong position in the ensuing rally . )
Another simple question : is it conceivable that it might sometimes be good tactics to attempt first - serve - type serves all the time ?
For instance , if you are Ivo Karlovich on a good day and your first - serve percentage is 75 % ( as happened at times during Wimbledon ) , and if you are winning 95 % of the points when your first serve goes in , then your probability of losing the point if you go for first serves every time is , which is , which is 19 /20 times 15 / 16 , which is certainly at least 7/8 .
That gives your opponent almost no chance of winning a game .
Maybe I should change that question to a related one : why is it that nobody ever plays that tactic , except perhaps on the occasional point ?
This is a fairly simple question .
Let 's suppose that with my best strategy , if I have just one serve left then I have a probability of winning the point .
And now suppose that it is in fact my first serve .
Let 's suppose that I can choose the probability that my first serve goes in , and that there is some function , which tells me the probability that I will win the point if I do a probability - serve .
So for example , if I go for an ace , then may be fairly low , but , whereas if I go for a safer first serve then is higher and correspondingly lower .
If I have just one serve left , then I have a very simple optimization problem : I just need to maximize , and we are assuming that its maximal value is .
But if I have two serves left , then the quantity I am trying to maximize is .
What difference does that make ?
Well , we are assuming that is a decreasing function of .
If is chosen to maximize , then , at least if is differentiable , decreasing by a small will decrease by ( since the derivative of at is zero ) but will also increase by .
Therefore , the maximum of will occur at a lower value of , which corresponds to a riskier serve .
( I 've made various assumptions there that I can't be bothered to make explicit . )
Finally , here is the general case of the question that intrigued me most .
It is to try to find a model that would justify the following piece of reasonable - sounding tennis advice : that if you are in the middle of trading groundstrokes with your opponent , then you should not go directly for a winner , but should instead try to play yourself into a stronger and stronger position until you can hit a winner with less risk .
That advice may not be universally applicable , but it does appear to be the case that some players sometimes go for winners when they would have been better advised to be patient .
( Equally , if you are playing Roger Federer , you may realize that you have no hope of winning a long rally so you are more or less forced to go for a risky shot that will be a winner if it comes off . )
How does one even think about such questions mathematically ?
I 'm more concerned about that than about the actual answers that a model might yield .
One might try something like this .
In any given situation , you have a range of shots you can attempt .
They have various probabilities of success , and if they do succeed then your opponent has a range of possibilities that depends on the shot you do .
It is natural to simplify the model as follows .
In any given situation , you have a function like the one discussed earlier .
That is , you can choose a shot that will go in with probability , and if it goes in you will win the rally with probability .
But hang on , how do we have any idea what is ?
Well , by hitting your probability - shot you give your opponent a choice similar to yours : a function that says " If I hit a probability - shot then I will win the rally with probability . "
But things are more complicated , because depends not just on but also on how risky your shot was — that is , on .
In other words , your aim is clearly to maximize , but this can be broken down further as a wish to maximize .
We can take this further .
Let measure the riskiness of the shots and let denote my probability of winning if I chose to play a - shot , you chose to play a - shot , and so on .
( This is a slight change because it focuses on my probability of winning and saves me having to write " " . )
Then it looks as though my best strategy is to maximize , which is the same as maximizing , where , which is the same as maximizing , and so on .
Let me just write out the th version of this expression in full gory detail .
My probability of winning appears to be ( I have n't checked this carefully ) if is even and a similar expression ending with if is odd .
But is n't bounded , so it seems as though we need to take some kind of limit as tends to infinity .
Does anyone have any idea what sort of thing that limit is ?
It makes my head spin like the ball on a heavily sliced second serve .
And that is just the question of modelling the situation in the first place : actually solving the optimization problem given the function looks pretty unpleasant .
So are there simplifying assumptions that would at least allow one to justify some of the advice given to players about when to attack , when to go for winners , and so on ?
One final remark : I do not for one moment think that anything in this post , even when fully developed , would be of the slightest use to a tennis player .
I just thought I 'd better make that clear .

Russians to Drill Melting Arctic with Nukes
July 9th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Whats even dumber and more shortsighted than drilling the melting arctic for the last drops of oil ?
Drilling the melting Arctic for those last drops of oil using nuclear power .
In a cavalier act of ecological vandalism , and driven by frank Russian acknowledgement of imminent peak oil in heartland Siberia , the imposingly named The United Industrial Corporation , is planning to build a series of floating power stations to circle the arctic with nuclear - powered oil drilling capability .
According to nuclear experts , oil mining companies like Gazprom ; Russia ’s biggest company – will use the Russian - built floating nuclear reactors to extract oil and gas offshore in some of the remotest oil and gas fields in the world in the Barents and Kara seas .
Officials said this week that the world ’s first floating nuclear power plant The FNPS will go into operation on Russia ’s eastern coast by the end of 2012 .
The United Industrial Corporation O.P.K. is building the plant on a ship 472 feet long and 98 feet wide to accommodate a pair of 35 megawatt reactors .
While rendering land - based NIMBY objections moot , putting reactors at sea is likely to raise questions about safety under the extreme weather conditions found at sea , vulnerability to terrorism , and disposal of radioactive waste .
It ’s unlikely the Russians give a damn about NIMBYs :
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , the Russian Federation dumped radioactive waste from more than 160 decommissioned nuclear submarines into the arctic .
In 1993 , per Nuclear Power Daily 16 nuclear reactors and 10,000 containers of nuclear waste were dumped in the Kara and Barents sea .
During the Cold War , the Soviet arctic was a nuclear test zone with pollution from the Soviet military program leaving a “ slow - motion Chernobyl ” in excess of 3 billion curies of radioactivity .
( By comparison , Chernobyl itself released only 100 million curies )

British conservationists are to launch an ambitious project to safeguard the future of a colony of Galapagos finches which inspired Charles Darwin to formulate his radical theory of evolution .
There are now only about 100 individuals left of the Galapagos mangrove finch , the rarest of the 14 closely related finch species that Darwin encountered when he visited the islands in 1835 as the naturalist on board the survey ship HMS Beagle .
All of these species evolved from a single common ancestor to fit different niches in the ecosystem , and when Darwin realised this once he was back in Britain , it helped to trigger his insight that completely new species could come into being through the process of natural selection .

The mangrove finch has shown the most extreme evolution of all : it inhabits only the narrow strips of mangrove swamp that are found in just a few parts of the Galapagos coastline .
Black rats which infested the holds of pirate ships have been identified as the chief culprits behind the destruction of the finches .
The rats are thought to have arrived on Isabella , the largest of the Galapagos islands , on pirate vessels perhaps as early as the 16th century .
Pirates used the archipelago , which is around 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean , as a hiding place before sailing off to the Spanish shipping lanes in search of boats carrying treasure .
The scarcity of its habitat means the mangrove finch has probably never been numerous .
In recent times it has been rapidly heading towards extinction , and is now one of the rarest birds in the world .
However , a British - funded conservation programme has spent three years investigating its decline , and is now about to spend another three years attempting to reverse it by moving some of the birds from the western side Isabella to the eastern side where there is another small area of mangroves .
The project is being led by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , the Jersey - based charity which specialises in saving endangered species , in partnership with the Charles Darwin Foundation , the international research organisation for the Galapagos , and the Galapagos National Park , which is run by the Government of Ecuador .
Britain's Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) is funding the programme under its international wildlife grants scheme , the Darwin Initiative , which has spent nearly £ 75 m helping endangered species around the world since it was set up in 1992 .
" The mangrove finch is a quite remarkable piece of evolution , " said Glyn Young , the Durrell Trust scientist who is leading the effort .
" It 's evolved to live in this tiny habitat .
It 's not as though mangroves have disappeared from the Galapagos – there 's just never been much there in the first place .
It 's a brilliant example of natural selection , filling in this tiny niche . "
Dr Young and his colleagues hope to take 10 young birds a year for three years from the main colony , at Playa Tortuga Negra on the west coast of Isabella , and release them in mangroves at Bahia Cartago on the eastern side of the island , where a handful of birds is thought to be clinging on to survival .
The Galapagos mangroves are different from other mangroves around the world , Dr Young said , in that they do not grow directly at the edge of the sea but are separated from it by beaches , so piles of leaves and stalks build up underneath them – and it is in these than the mangrove finch forages .
Black rats are thought to have taken a steady toll of the birds .
Starting a project to bring the birds back in 2009 was very appropriate , Dr Young insisted , as this year is a double anniversary – the 200th of Charles Darwin 's birth , and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his ground - breaking revolutionary treatise , On The Origin Of Species .
" I think Darwin would have been very pleased , " he said .
Galapagos finches :
How they made Darwin 's theory take flight
* One day millions of years ago a flock of sparrow - sized birds of a single species , closely related to what is now the blue - black grassquit finch found along the Pacific coast of South America , flew out to sea and kept on flying westwards for 600 miles until they came to the Galapagos Islands .
There they found a home .
But as they bred and their numbers increased , they found they could survive better by specialising .
So some began to specialise in eating insects , while others began to specialise in eating seeds , or leaves , or flowers , or even in one weird case the blood of seabirds – and over time the shape of their bills changed to reflect their specialisations .
Gradually they evolved into 13 quite separate species , each exploiting a different niche in the ecosystem ( with a 14th from the same common ancestor having evolved on Cocos island to the north ) .
This process is now known as adaptive radiation .
When Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos Islands in 1835 he and colleagues collected many of the finches , but did not at first realise they were related and missed their significance .
It was not until he had returned to London that the ornithologist John Gould examined them and found them to be all subtly different but closely related members of a quite new family of birds .
It was this discovery that set Darwin thinking that they may all have evolved from a single common ancestor , and thus to start to understand the mechanism of natural selection , which enabled new species to evolve .

Why are we asking this now ?
The US government has been dragged into a bizarre legal battle between descendants of the Apache leader Geronimo and a secret society of Yale students called Skull and Bones , whose members allegedly raided his grave during the First World War .
Yesterday , the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed in February , on the 100th anniversary of Geronimo 's death , seeking to recover the legendary warrior 's remains and re-bury them near to his birthplace in the Gila Wilderness of southern New Mexico .
The legal action , by 20 descendants of Geronimo , claims a group of Skull and Bones members , including George W Bush 's grandfather , Prescott , took his skull from Fort Sill in Oklahoma in 1918 .
The artefact has allegedly been stored in a glass case at the organisation 's clubhouse in New Haven , Connecticut ever since .
The Justice Department became involved because Barack Obama and his defence secretary Robert Gates are named alongside the Skull and Bones society as co-defendants , due to the fact that Geronimo was initially buried on public land .

So who was Geronimo ?
For much of his lifetime , Geronimo was considered the greatest terrorist in America .
These days , he 's feted as a fearless guerrilla fighter , whose famously brave troops were the last American Indian force to hold out against the United States .
Born Goytholy , meaning " the one who yawns , " he took up arms when his wife , children and mother were massacred by Mexicans in 1851 .
His nickname stems from daring retaliatory raids , when he led men on cavalry charges , often into a hail of bullets .
Legend has it that victims would scream a plea to St Jerome ( hence " Jeronimo ! " ) as they died .
Geronimo evaded capture for more than three decades .
Though wounded countless times , he was never defeated , and his men are perhaps the most effective light cavalry force in military history .
They numbered no more than a couple of hundred at any one time , but are said to have killed more than 5,000 enemies .
Why did he fight ?
Geronimo was a member of the Chiricahua Apache tribe whose homelands in the deserts of New Mexico were annexed first by Mexico and later by the United States during its expansion into the south - west during the 19th century .
His insurgency was part of a wider rebellion by Native Indians against their treatment by white settlers , who carried out what in modern terms might be called ethnic cleansing : removing tribes from ancestral territories and ( in some cases ) placing a bounty on their scalps .
Geronimo's success was down to old - fashioned derring - do , and sheer good luck .
Because of repeated close shaves with mortality , many followers believed he was resistant to bullets .
His men were adept at using their opponents ' technology – including rifles and pistols – against them .
How was he captured ?
After more than 30 years the US General Nelson Miles tracked Geronimo to Arizona .
The rebels were exhausted after decades on the run , and their number had dwindled to just 36 men , many of whom ( including their leader ) had taken to heavy drinking .
In the autumn of 1886 , Geronimo negotiated a tactical surrender , agreeing to lay down his arms on condition that his followers would be allowed to disband and return home to their families .
But the US reneged on its promises , and promptly took Geronimo and his troops into custody .
They spent seven years in prison in Alabama before being transferred to Fort Sill , where they lived out the rest of their days in a form of open prison .
What became of him ?
Ironically , Geronimo's fame only grew during his year in captivity .
He became a local celebrity , charging visitors to Fort Sill to have their photo taken with him , and keeping a stock of autographed cards and other souvenirs to sell to tourists .
In old age , he was constantly interviewed ( for a small fee ) by the US press , and took part in Buffalo Bill Cody 's Wild West Circus , where performers recreated his most daring battles .
He was a star attraction at the 1904 World 's Fair in St Louis , and had a prominent place in Theodore Roosevelt 's inaugural parade in 1905 .
Having embraced capitalism , Geronimo also took up the white man 's religion , converting to Christianity saying he believed it to be " better than the religion of my forefathers . "
He joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903 , but was expelled four years later , apparently for gambling .
He died in 1909 , at the age of 79 .

What happened to his remains ?
Three members of the Skull and Bones society , including Prescott Bush , were stationed at an artillery school at Fort Sill during the First World War .
In a bizarre prank , they are rumoured to have dug up his grave , and taken his skull and femurs back to their alma mater .
Why does this matter ?
Although unproven , the alleged desecration of Geronimo 's grave carries significant political baggage .
Like Chief Sitting Bull , who defeated General Custer at the battle of Little Bighorn , Native Americans view him as a symbol of their people 's righteous rebellion against white colonialists .
Geronimo is also firmly embedded in the US psyche as a symbol of bonkers bravado .
Paratroopers shout his name after leaping from aeroplanes , apparently as part of a tradition that began in 1940 , when they prepared for their first mass jump by watching the film " Geronimo . "
In a scene based on one of its subject 's many narrow escapes – and mimicked by generations of schoolchildren – the movie's hero yells his own name as he leaps from a cliff into a river to escape capture by approaching soldiers .
What is the Skull and Bones ?
Adding to the intrigue is long - standing public fascination with the Skull and Bones society , an organisation of privileged Yale Students whose alumni include both Presidents Bush and John Kerry .
The club , founded at the Ivy League school in 1832 , selects 15 new members each year .
They are sworn in at the " Tomb , " a windowless campus clubhouse which is purported to hold the skulls of a range of famous figures , including Che Guevara .
During the initiation ceremony , recruits are apparently required to kiss the skull of Geronimo , which is said to be held in a glass case near the door , and take a solemn oath to support fellow members .
Since the society is secret – it has never clarified the exact contents of the " Tomb " – some regard it as vaguely sinister .
Others say it is a harmless networking organisation .
In this respect , it is perhaps best described as an upmarket version of the Freemasons .
What happens next ?
The lawsuit by Geronimo 's descendants was filed in a federal district court in Washington DC , and seeks : " to free Geronimo , his remains , funerary objects and spirit from 100 years of imprisonment at Fort Sill , Oklahoma , the Yale University campus at New Haven , Connecticut and wherever else they may be found . "
Presuming the case is n't immediately thrown out – and the political ramifications of doing so would be enormous – the court 's immediate next step must be to determine if the Skull and Bones society really does own Geronimo 's disputed skull .
Does the Skull and Bones society really have Geronimo 's skull ?
Yes
* The Skull and Bones has repeatedly refused to discuss the skull , still less surrender it for DNA testing
* A letter written in 1918 by a society member says it gained possession of it
* A history of the society written in 1933 claimed that Prescott Bush ' engaged in a mad expedition ' at Fort Sill to obtain Geronimo 's skull
No
* Geronimo's grave was miles from where Prescott Bush was stationed
* The exact location of Geronimo 's grave was unmarked at the time of the alleged theft
* Historians say that , while the Skull and Bones may very well have a Native Indian 's skull , it is unlikely to be that of Geronimo

Think Progress has James Inhofe taking DeMint 's " Waterloo " one further : killing healthcare reform will mean " a huge gain " for Republicans in 2010 .
Appearing on Janet Parshall ’s radio show yesterday , Inhofe argued that the defeat of President Clinton ’s health care reform “ started the demise of Bill Clinton that led to the 1994 Republican takeover of the House and the Senate . ”
He then added that he is now “ tracking the demise ” of Obama ’s health care plans and it is making him “ optimistic ” : INHOFE :
They ought to know , they ought to know from history .
This is a losing proposition for them .
And for those out there who believe , that would like to have something optimistic to look at , we are plotting the demise on a week by week basis of where Bill Clinton was in 1993 and where Obama is today and his demise ratio is greater than Clinton ’s was in 1993 .
So , he ’s trying to do the same things , except more extreme .
....
Inhofe also appeared on Hugh Hewitt ’s radio show yesterday , where he was asked if Republicans had the votes “ to block health care , the radical stuff in the Senate . ”
Inhofe said he thought they did : INHOFE : Oh , I think so .
I really do .
In fact , there ’ll be a lot of Democrats .
You know , I liken it to the cap and trade thing .
Now that ’s the one that I ’ve been kind of in charge of for ten years , and we know where we are on that now .
We know that if , as long as people keep talking the way they are right now , we ’re going to defeat it .
They only have 34 votes .
They need 60 votes .
I ’d say health care right now is somewhere in the neighborhood of , they have maybe 45 votes .
But every day , they lose votes , because people find out what it is , what it ’s going to do , and what it ’s not going to do .
When you tell people that the mortality rate in Canada is 25 % higher for breast cancer , 18 % higher for prostate cancer , you know , they say why in the world would we emulate a system like that ?
This is life threatening .
And so we have all the issues on our side on this thing , and I think , you know , I just hope the President keeps talking about it , keeps trying to rush it through .
We can stall it .
And that ’s going to be a huge gain for those of us who want to turn this thing over in the 2010 election .
He 's also brutally honest about why they 're trying to delay this thing :
“ If he is unsuccessful — which I anticipate and will predict he is — on getting a vote prior to the August recess , then I would say there ’s no way in the world they ’re going to get this done this year , ” said Inhofe .
“ And next year would not be any easier . ”
Two things here to note : delay is the Republicans ' best hope for killing reform .
Playing into that , as Reid appears to be willing to do by giving in now on meeting the August recess deadline , is just a free gift to the Inhofe / DeMint crowd , the Republicans that are so willing to play politics with our lives .
But the other consideration , from another Think Progress story : Republican opposition to this is n't monolithic .
" Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) is offering the opposite advice .
' If we do n’t do something on health - care reform , ' Grassley said , ' the voters are more apt to blame Republicans than Democrats . ' ”
Now , you 're not going to be hearing " GOP in disarray " stories from the traditional media , but a smart Democratic leadership in the Senate could be playing divide and conquer here .
Grassley , the key GOPer in health care reform , has basically cried " uncle " -- he sees how critical it is to 2010 .
Use that .
Senate leadership needs to use it by staying in session through August to get this done .
Some calls and e-mails to Harry Reid might help convince him of that .
And sign on to the FDL petition telling your representative that we must pass health care reform before the House takes a vacation .
Gar Ryness said he had the least marketable skill in the United States .
So when he and two friends took a hand - held camcorder into the backyard of his Los Angeles home last year , he hardly expected he would soon become a YouTube celebrity known as Batting Stance Guy .
Ryness has a singular talent : an ability to perform comically dead - on impressions of major league baseball hitters upon request .
Little Leaguers have been known to try to imitate their favorite ballplayers .
Ryness , 35 , a married father of two , can do the starting lineups of all 30 teams .
Views of his YouTube videos number more than a million , and he appeared last year on several teams ’ pregame shows .
Sony also hired him to perform his impressions while wearing movement - tracking electrodes , helping programmers make the company ’s MLB 2009 : The Show video game look more realistic .
Most recently , Ryness has made appearances on MLB Network ’s team preview shows , displaying his encyclopedic knowledge of batters past and present .
He has archived his body of work on a Web site , battingstanceguy.com .
Ryness never misses a habitual fidget or gesture , like David Wright ’s ritual of wedging his bat in his armpit while adjusting his batting gloves .
He does iconic stances , positioning his derrière the way Ken Griffey Jr. does before mimicking Griffey ’s graceful swing and follow - through .
Ryness even does impressions of batters taking pitches , like Derek Jeter ’s way of sticking his head out and nearly stepping across home plate as he looks an outside pitch into the catcher ’s glove .
On Asarah B'Tevet , the 10th day of the Jewish month of Tevet , in the year 3336 from Creation ( 425 BCE ) , the armies of the Babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem .
Thirty months later — on 9 Tammuz 3338 — the city walls were breached , and on 9 Av of that year the Holy Temple was destroyed .
The Jewish people were exiled to Babylonia for 70 years .
Asarah B'Tevet ( this year , December 25 , 2020 ) is observed as a day of fasting , mourning and repentance .
We refrain from food and drink from daybreak to nightfall , and add selichot and other special supplements to our prayers .
The fast ends at nightfall or as soon as you see three medium sized stars in the sky .

Two Americas exist side by side -- one where a tiny minority of the rich enjoys immense wealth , and another where the vast majority barely scrapes by , and sometimes not even that .
Leela Yellesetty describes the yawning gap between rich and poor in Seattle .
IT IS a typical gray day in Seattle , but the view of the city from Capitol Hill is still impressive .
On nicer days , the Olympic Mountains provide a stunning backdrop to the city 's signature landmark , the Space Needle .
To the south , on the edge of the city skyline , luxury condominiums crop up like weeds in various stages of construction .
I 'm standing in the parking lot of St. Marks Episcopal Church , talking with Charles " Mac " McGlinghey , who has been kind enough to show me his home .
" Go ahead and poke your head in and look around , " he says .
I peer inside , but it is too small to enter .
Taking up most of the space is a makeshift bed constructed from crates , with a layer of blankets on top to protect Mac and his wife from sleeping on the cold concrete of the church lot .
The rest of their things easily fill the small space on the other side of the two - person tent .
" That 's pretty much everything we own aside from what we have in a small storage space down in Kent , " he says .
With his big bushy beard making him look uncannily like Santa Claus , Mac sits calmly atop a crate outside , and points with his cane two tents down .
" That 's where my son lives , " he says .
Two Seattles , one for the rich and for the poor ( Jan Critchfield )
Mac 's stepson was abused so badly by his biological father that , at age 31 , he only has the mental maturity of a 10 - year - old .
The three of them have lived in Tent City III , a self - governed community of about 100 homeless people , for the past three months .
" We 're here because we can't get an apartment , " says Mac .
" Every time we apply for one , they say you need to make three times the amount of rent in income .
Well , that 's all well and good if I could work and had a job .
But where am I going to find a place for $ 210 a month ?
For three people ?
Considering all three of us collect SSI , and I collect Social Security disability , that 's what it comes down to .
There 's no way you can get a place on that . "
Mac has been on the list for Section 8 affordable housing for the past eight months and hopes it comes through soon .
But Nick , another man I meet at the camp , tells me he 's been on the list for two years .
He 's been homeless since a debilitating accident on the job cut off his livelihood as a carpenter three years ago .
Soft - spoken and shy about sharing his opinion , Nick says simply , " We need more housing .
You can't just get rid of the homeless .
You can't have rich people without poor people . "
What you can do The future of the Nickelsville tent city depends on convincing Gov. Gregoire that the homeless should n't be evicted from state land .
Tell her today your opinion of Nickelsville -- call 800-562-6000 , fax 360-753-4110 or e-mail [ email protected ]ov.wa.gov .
You can also sign a petition calling on the governor to let Nickelsville be left in peace .
Residents of Nickelsville are always in need of water , 2 - by - 4s nails , non-perishable foods and friendly faces .
You can find them at West Marginal Way SW & 2nd Avenue SW .
The organization Seattle and Housing Resource Effort ( SHARE ) is appealing for funds to help maintain its program of giving free city bus tickets to the homeless .
You can send a check or money order payable to : SHARE , 1902 2nd Ave. , Seattle , WA 98101 .
You can contact SHARE at 206-448-7889
If you 'd like to express your displeasure with Seattle Mayor Greg Nichols for cutting off city funds to SHARE , call 206-684-4000 .
Life - changing accidents seem to be a common theme among the stories at Tent City .
Mac has a dissociative disorder that has prevented him from holding a job for the past 30 years .
He traces its origins to an accident when he was in the Navy , decommissioning a ship after two tours in Vietnam .
" Something fell off the pallet , while I was down in the hole , " he says .
" It was n't up too high , but it fell about 10 feet and hit me in the head .
I was unconscious for about 15 seconds , and ever since that time , I 've had the problem .
The Navy never ' fessed up to it .
They 've acknowledged the fact that something happened , but they do n't know what .
And it 's not their fault .
That 's typical of the military , though . "
I ask Mac how many of the residents here are veterans .
" Alright , let 's start with the people out here , " he says , and points to five people among the 20 or so who are milling about the center of camp .
He estimates that at least 20 percent are vets overall .
" We had one gentlemen here for awhile who just got back from Iraq , " he says .
" You got people like me from Vietnam , and just about everyone else in between .
We all have our horror stories to tell .
Most of the vets , because of our experience , kind of look out for everyone else and keep the peace .
Bottom line , we 're tired of fighting .
But every day here is a fight . "
I came here to investigate the growth of tent cities as a result of the current economic crisis .
Stories on this topic have made headlines across the country , for the first time perhaps since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
But what strikes me as I 'm here is that there 's nothing new about these symbols of dire poverty in the world 's richest nation .
Tent City I was formed back in 1991 .
Many of the residents of the three tent cities in the Seattle area have been homeless for years .
As Ben Ehrenreich pointed out in the Nation magazine :
While recent media accounts portrayed Tent City 's incarnations as creatures of the recession -- reborn Hoovervilles for the laid off and the foreclosed -- shantytowns have been a periodic but permanent feature of American urban life for at least the past two decades ... Tent City tells the grueling back story to the current recession -- nearly 30 years of cuts in social services to the poor and mentally ill , the decimation of the industrial economy and the cruel underside of the housing boom .
AS MUCH as Seattle 's homeless are struggling in these tough economic times , they are n't the only ones with problems -- at least according to Seattle entrepreneur Andy Sack , who recently announced he 's starting up a support group for another group in need : multimillionaires .
Seattle is now home to the newest chapter of Tiger 21 , an exclusive New York - based network of clubs for the exceedingly wealthy .
To join Tiger 21 , you have to have at least $ 10 million in assets , not including houses , cars and other properties , and pay a $ 30,000 - a- year membership fee .
Nationwide , Tiger 21 has about 170 members with an average net worth between $ 30 million and $ 50 million .
Home to executives at Microsoft , Boeing , Starbucks and Amazon , not to mention a host of dot - com millionaires like Sack , Seattle should have no trouble attracting members .
In fact , it 's surprising the city did n't already have a club where the super - rich could help each other endure their predicament .
What predicament ?
Tiger 21 Managing Director Lewis Haskell says that finding people to relate to can be difficult for the superrich .
" People are either jealous or they can't understand you have problems , " Haskell says .
" They say , ' I should have such problems , ' or ' How hard can it be ? ' "
As an article about the group in the Seattle - based Xconomy puts it :
Think the super - rich do n't have problems ?
Try fending off friends and relatives who always want to borrow money , or raising spoiled brats who do n't take responsibility for their actions .
Not to mention the more obvious financial questions of how to manage such hefty portfolios -- especially in economic times like these .
( Granted , some of this might be viewed as insensitive at a time when local food banks are running out of food . )
Sack , who made his fortune investing in Web startups , writes a blog discussing the trials and tribulations of being rich , and dropping pearls of wisdom for those who aspire to his level of greatness .
Among his many astute observations : " In the game of business , success is measured by dollars .
It makes sense that people are motivated by selfishness and ' greed ' and the general desire to improve one 's financial standing .
This is n't a bad thing -- it 's what capitalism is based upon . "
Yet in a later post , Sack reflects ,
It 's not about the money .
So much of success in America is driven and measured by money .
Money is not and should not be the measure of success -- or happiness .
One of the best conversations I had this weekend was with someone who has been unemployed for two years , and spent nine months meditating .
He quit his 90 K per year job to elect for unemployment because he felt the job was killing the life in him .
Pretty fascinating guy .
He was amongst the happiest -- if not the " wealthiest " people I met .
TO INVESTIGATE whether the unemployed are truly the happiest people around , I made a trip down to Qwest Field , a taxpayer - subsidized stadium controlled by another Seattle titan , Paul Allen .
It also happens to be the location of Jobbernaut.com 's Greater Seattle Job Fair , held every three months .
" You should have been here in February , " says Jobbernaut promoter Troy Kleine .
" Because of all the layoffs from the holidays , there was a line going all the way around the building .
It made the front page of the paper . "
Kleine said the number who attended in February - - 7,326 - - was nearly double that of October .
He was n't sure exactly why the totals were lower this time around , but guessed that some people had simply given up .
" I 've been looking for work for about two - and - a - half months , and there 's nothing , nothing at all , " said job fair attendee Autumn Walker .
" If you do n't have any education , like a BA , there 's no way to get a job .
I 've been looking everywhere .
I 've been on Monster.com , Craigslist , NW Jobs .
I 'm a chef by trade .
I cook , but I do n't do fast food .
I 'm not working at McDonalds . "
I told her that another person I spoke to said even McDonalds was n't hiring , and she shook her head .
" It 's hard looking for a job right about now , " she said .
" Our economy 's shot .
I just think everyone has to sit back and wait for Obama to work his magic , because Bush messed up .
I know he's not going to be able to make it happen overnight for the whole country -- but at least a few more jobs out here for a few more people . "
Most people I spoke to were still optimistic about being able to find work eventually , and had faith that Obama would turn the economy around .
Being a temporary employee facing unemployment myself in a few months ' time , I want to believe it , too .
But the recent statistics are not uplifting .
Official unemployment in Washington state ( not counting those who are underemployed or have simply given up looking ) now stands at 9 percent , up from 4.7 percent last year .
A recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that there are an average of five job seekers for every available opening nationally .
And so far this year , more than a million homes have gone into foreclosure -- or about one every 13 seconds .
While the homeless have long existed in Seattle , their ranks are increasing -- a trend that will likely accelerate in the months to come .
The Seattle / King County Coalition on Homelessness ' One Night Count of January 2008 found 8,439 people homeless countywide .
Just over 5,800 had shelter through existing programs , but more than 2,600 were without -- a 15 percent increase over last year .
Use of food banks and soup kitchens are also on the rise across the region .
Seattle 's Cherry Street Food Bank recently saw 2,651 people walk through their doors in a single day -- an all - time record .
Back at Tent City , Adam Jama is one of the newest residents .
He was laid off from his job as an airport shuttle bus driver back in September , but only recently learned that he could have applied for unemployment benefits .
An immigrant , he also found out that in order to get another job , he must pay $ 340 to renew his work permit .
Like most of the newly homeless , Adam first stayed with family and friends until he began to wear out his welcome .
He heard about Tent City III from a man on the bus a couple weeks ago .
" It 's better than staying on the streets , " he says .
" They do n't turn people away , if there 's space available . "
There are only 100 slots available at Tent City III .
Once you 're in , you can stay as long as you abide by the rules .
If people turn up and there is no space , they are allowed to stay one night , but can't come back again for a week .
Adam tells me at least five people come through every night .
Of those fortunate enough to find a place to stay , many prefer places like Tent City III because unlike the shelters , the tent cities are democratically run by residents .
Couples are allowed to stay together , which is almost always denied in shelters .
They also allow for people to leave their things in a safe place , rather than being kicked out with all their belongings each morning .
This is even more important now since one of the few buildings open to the homeless during the day -- the public library -- recently passed new rules restricting large bags .
The tent cities offer a small measure of community and dignity in the face of the daily humiliations of surviving without a home .
Nonetheless , anyone here can tell you that living in a tent is no picnic .
And as if life were n't hard enough , the city of Seattle , far from offering assistance , is hell - bent on shutting down the tent cities .
The latest example : A group called Seattle Housing and Resource Effort ( SHARE ) provides shelter and other services for the homeless , including two free bus tickets per day .
This is a lifeline for Tent City residents , especially those who have jobs or are looking for one .
But the city is cutting off funding for the tickets , so SHARE will run out of money for the program by around the July 4 weekend .
The organization is planning a direct action to protest -- the homeless will head to the homes of the city 's political leaders ( first stop : Mayor Greg Nichols ) and sleep on the sidewalk outside .
TREATING THOSE who can't afford a place to live as an eyesore at best and a criminal element at worst is a time - honored tradition in Seattle .
In the 1930s , a massive Hooverville spang up south of the city , where Qwest Field sits today , swelling to a population of over 1,200 at its peak .
The city burned it to the ground .
When Tent City II was founded back in 1998 , the city council invited residents to meet and discuss more permanent options .
While the residents were at the meeting , the city bulldozed their encampment .
Through a series of legal appeals , Tent City III finally reached an agreement with the city to camp legally on private land , but the catch is they can only stay at one location a few months at a time .
The camp has moved more than 50 times since 2000 .
Nickelsville , a more recently formed tent city named after Mayor Nickels because of his cruel homeless sweeps , took a more aggressive approach by initially setting up on city property .
Residents were forcibly evicted by the police after four days .
Twenty - two people were arrested when they refused to move .
After a few other temporary locations , Nickelsville recently made what residents and supporters hope will be its last move , to a parcel adjacent to the city land it occupied last September .
Residents and organizers said that because they are on state land , Gov. Christine Gregoire can trump the mayor and let them stay .
" I will be arrested if I have to , " Nickelsville resident Bruce Beaver told King 5 News , " We need places to stay and shelters do n't always cut it . "
At the University of Washington , a public health class is taking on a campaign to bring Tent City III to campus .
At a campus forum on the topic , former tent city resident and homeless advocate Anitra Freeman pointed out that 330 people have died from being out on the streets in Seattle since 2000 - - 50 just in the last year .
As Freeman said :
The life expectancy during the Black Death was better than for homeless people today .
That is unconscionable to me ... People deserve better than tents , but they deserve at least tents -- they die without them .
Democracy is predicated on the assumption that we are all of equal value .
If we are letting people die on our streets , then we have no respect for humanity in this country , and we 're in serious trouble .
At the forum , I recognized James Wlos , who I 'd met over a year ago tabling at the International Longshore and Warehouse Union hiring hall .
Wlos had been picking up hours as a casual at the Port of Seattle , but right now , there 's no work , and he 's living out of his car .
He waved a stack of parking tickets in the air , explaining that you can't park your car anywhere through the night in the city without getting them .
" I can't even afford to be homeless , " Wlos says .
" All these corporations are taking money from me they do n't even need .
It does n't have to be like this .
If we work together , we can hire people to grow food , to build solar generators , whatever .
Imagine the possibilities .
Obama wo n't do it for us -- we have to do it ourselves . "
The solutions to the housing crisis should be obvious to anyone who thinks about it .
When newly constructed luxury condos are standing empty all around , there 's no reason people should have to live in tents , much less in cars or on the streets .
Instead , the people who were neglected in good times are expected to suffer even worse when times get tough .
As the crisis deepens , more and more people are at risk of becoming economic casualties .
On the chopping block in this year 's budget are funds for virtually every social service in the city , from mental health care to public transportation .
Five public schools are slated for closure , and 173 teachers just received pink slips .
The only budget item that remains untouched is for a new city jail , at a cost of $ 200 million .
I guess this is the politicians ' idea of a public housing program .
Meanwhile , in the other Seattle , the wealthy cope with the terrible burden of having more money than they know what to do with .
I have some ideas .
The Economic Opportunity Institute estimates that a 3 percent surtax on incomes between $ 200,000 and $ 999,999 and a 5 percent surtax on incomes over $ 1 million in Washington state could raise $ 2.6 billion immediately -- more than enough to stop the proposed cuts to public health , the General Assistance - Unemployable program , and basic education , and provide more relief to those who need it most .
Washington state has one of the most regressive tax structures in the country -- meaning that the wealthy pay proportionally less of their incomes in taxes .
According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , the poorest 20 percent of Washingtonians pay 17.5 percent of their income in taxes each year , while the top 1 percent pay just 3.3 percent .
Recent polls indicate a majority of people support making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes .
Yet the Democratic - controlled legislature and governor refuse to countenance the idea .
Many people in Seattle are beginning to conclude that we need to take our city back -- from the Nickelsville residents holding their ground , to the students organizing against budget cuts , to teachers ' union members protesting layoffs .
The Andy Sacks of the world may think their lives are tough , but here 's hoping things get a lot harder for them -- when the rest of us stand up to demand our fair share .

( Image credit : AFP )
The International Cycling Union ( UCI ) announced Friday that it suspended Spaniard Mikel Astarloza for failing a doping control June 26 , which was 25 days before he won the Tour de France 's mountain stage to Bourg - Saint - Maurice .
His Euskaltel - Euskadi team said that it had not seen any abnormalities in the team 's internal controls .
It said Astarloza will request the counter - analysis of the sample .
Until then , the press release stated , he will be considered innocent until proven guilty .
The Cycling Union announced that Astarloza tested positive for blood booster EPO in an out - of - competition control .
He is the second rider from Spain 's Euskaltel - Euskadi team to return a positive doping control in June .
Iñigo Landaluze was suspended in July after twice testing positive for EPO CERA .
The team condemned Landaluze and he took full responsibility for his positive tests .
Astarloza 's urine test was performed by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) and analysed in Madrid .
The Cycling Union received the results on Thursday .
The suspension is provisional until a Spanish Cycling Federation ( RFEC ) panel meets to examine the results .
" The hearing panel will make a decision on an applicable sanction for Mr. Astarloza , " said the Cycling Union in a press release .
The failed doping test is the first related to a rider who participated in the 2009 Tour de France .
There were eight riders who tested positive for doping in last year 's race .
Non ditemi che non vi siete mai fatti alcuna domanda sui led , non so “ chissà come cavolo fanno a funzionare ” oppure “ quali saranno le reali potenzialità di questi led ? ” , bhe tutte domande lecite , visto che molte notizie che girano intorno a questa tecnologia applicata all ’illuminazione sono spesso tarlate falsi miti intrinseci proprio nella novità che si portano dietro .
Certo diversi sono i modi per cercare di aver risposte a tutte le domande , prima tra tutte non fermarsi davanti alla prima versione dei fatti che viene data ( e questo è un po ’ lo spirito che sta dietro Luxemozione ) , soprattutto perchè le pincipali informazioni , in particolare quelle di natura tecnica , fuoriescono dalla documentazione che propongono le aziende produttrici , che naturalmente ( sarebbe stupido il contrario ) cercano tirare acqua al proprio mulino .
Certo , ma come fare a raccogliere dati utili sui led senza passare dall ’azienda che li produce o li assembla ?
Impossibile , il trucco sta nel raccogliere i dati e metterli a confronto .
Voglio segnalarvi oggi un evento molto interessante , dedicato interamente al mondo del LED , applicato sia all ’illuminazione che al mondo dei display , sto parlando di Opto & Display – LUMEN MI 09 , che avrà luogo a Milano il 25 marzo 2009 e vedrà riuniti le principali aziende protagoniste di questo settore .
L’evento , che avrà luogo presso Crowne Plaza Hotel di S.Donato , e che quest ’ anno si presenta nella sua quarta edizione ( la prima nel 2005 ) , sarà suddivisa in due ambiti principali : FORUM OPTO&DISPLAY , dedicato prevalentemente alle tecnologie per la visualizzazione e LUMEN per i competenti del lighting .
In particolare l’evento FORUM OPTO& DISPLAY – LUMEN prevede molteplici convegni e demo divulgativi e tecnici nel contesto di decine di postazioni / vetrine gestite dalle aziende che fanno parte della ‘ Electronic Opto Community ’ .
Un programma attuato in partnership con Opto - Vision ( XII° edizione nel Settembre 2008 a Parigi ) per offrire ai visitatori il know - how sugli attuali sviluppi e per articolare velocemente contatti tematici con gli esperti presenti .
I progettisti dei corpi illuminanti e più in generale i tecnici del mondo della visualizzazione potranno apprendere le nuove tecnologie in atto in un convegno dedicato , durante il quale aziende leader del settore presenteranno le migliori soluzioni proposte per migliorare ad esempio l’efficienza dell ’illuminazione a LED oppure la definizione di criteri chiari e definiti per l’indice di resa cromatica .
Ma la tecnologia non è la sola protagonista della giornata .
Architetti , urban e interior design e più in generale i professionisti dell ’illuminazione saranno l’uditorio privilegiato di un altro convegno , “ L’outing del LED ” , in cui si parlerà di illuminotecnica e Design , con particolare attenzione all ’uso dei LED per esterni dallo street lighting all ’illuminazione architettonica .
Quindi se deciderete di partecipare a quest ’evento preparatevi ad una vera e propria full immersion nel mondo del led , in particolare per LUMEN questo il programma della giornata :

Ciao e alla prossima
From the very moment Jay Phillips was born , his parents feared their biracial child 's life in British Columbia would be marked with epithets and slurs .
Now 38 years old and the recent victim of an assault police are investigating as a potential hate crime , Phillips is speaking out in hopes his own infant son's upbringing will be in a world far , far different from the one he 's experienced .
RCMP in the Vancouver Island town of Courtenay , B.C. , have arrested three men in the Friday night parking lot attack , video footage of which has since appeared on YouTube .
The three have now been charged with assault .
" There are elements or indicators that the offence was racially motivated , " said Const .
Tammy Douglas , adding the final determination on hate - crime charges wo n't be made until all the evidence has been gathered .
Douglas did n't know when that might be , since police are still hoping to speak to more witnesses as investigators try to further piece the altercation together .
Phillips , the son of a black father and white mother , was walking to the gym Friday when he says the assailants drove past him , shouting and hurling racial slurs .
" We 're going to lynch you , get out of our white town , " he alleges they said .
Phillips , not one to simply back down , cursed right back .
" They did n't like that so they came back , got out of the vehicle , surrounded me in a half - circle , took another step toward me , and the fight was on , " he said .
The YouTube video shows the outnumbered Phillips more than holding his own , at one point knocking a man down to the ground .
It is n't until Phillips loses his balance that the three men converge on him .
The trio can clearly be heard using racial epithets throughout the video .
Phillips , who later needed two stitches , said dealing with racism is nothing new for him .
He 's been subjected to strange looks , rude remarks and racial slurs since pre-school .
" I was four years old .
I had a female teacher and she said , ' Quiet down you little nigger , " ' he recalled .
" So I told my mom and she took care of it . "
His mom , Kirsten Phillips , described the parking lot attack as particularly " horrifying . "
" My son was on his way to the gym and it just can happen out of the blue , anywhere , " she said .
Jay Phillips said it 's important to bring the incident to light so that attacks that are alleged to be racially motivated can be stopped .
" We 're not going to be bullied ; we 're not going anywhere , " he said .
" I 'm going to do everything I can to wake up this world ... I do n't want anybody to have to walk down the street in fear . "
Kirsten Phillips said she and her late husband had the same concerns about their son being subjected to racism that Jay now has for his nine - month - old boy .
RCMP have not released the names of the three arrested males , but said they are aged 19 , 24 , and 25 .
Police , who say they 're preparing assault charges against the trio , have not identified who shot the YouTube video .
The Strathclyde Haskell Enhancement is a somewhat inglorious bodge , equipping ghc with automatic lifting of types to kinds , pattern synonyms , and some kit for higgledy - piggledy literate programming .

Note :
This package has metadata revisions in the cabal description newer than included in the tarball .
To unpack the package including the revisions , use ' cabal get ' .
The word " slut " appears in the first line of Margo Lanagan 's new book , Tender Morsels .
The next few paragraphs describe an unsettling sex scene between a witch and a dwarf .
For some parents this will simply be an upfront way of indicating the challenging content of an interesting novel for young people , for others it will signal the end of children 's literature .
The novel , published this month by Random House , is a lurid reworking of Grimm 's Snow White and Rose Red fairytale and also contains a gang rape and a frank description of a miscarriage .
Within the book industry , the new title from the Australian author is already being described as uncompromising and controversial .
Publication of Tender Morsels in this country is leading to renewed calls for a clearer system to let parents know about the nature of the books that their children are reading .
Anne Fine , a former children 's laureate , said : " If you look at online reviews , nearly all the parents think it is quite unsuitable .
Many of the children loved the book but among the girls , a lot of them found it frightening or even repulsive .
" I have to wonder generally whether a children 's publisher does not sometimes have a responsibility to stop and say that although a shocking new book will make money , and even be popular , it does not have what the Americans call ' redeeming social importance ' . "
Philip Pullman , author of the His Dark Materials trilogy , believes the front of a book should offer a good clue to the buyer .
" Book covers can tell you a lot , " he said .
" A book with a cover illustration by Nick Sharratt , who does many of Jacqueline Wilson 's covers , tells you a lot about what is inside , while a book cover by Ian Beck , one of my favourites , tells you this is a different kind of book . "
Designers at Random House have given Lanagan 's novel one cover illustration for younger readers , while another has been chosen for the adult edition being published by Jonathan Cape .
Pullman feels the mysterious cover portrait picked for a young audience is likely to draw readers in without giving much information .
He does not believe , though , that children 's writers should steer clear of tough material .
" I do n't think there should be areas that children 's books can't deal with .
Why should there be , given that children are likely to encounter much stronger subjects in real life , ranging from divorce - which once used to be something terrible and awful that you must not talk about - to drug trafficking and sex ? "
For Pullman , calls for censorship or for an age - related classification system are not the answer .
" This idea comes from a misguided fear and a murky sense of nostalgia about the way books used to be . "
David Fickling , the publisher of Tender Morsels , says he knows the content will be unpalatable to some readers and so there is a warning on the inside of the jacket .
He defends Lanagan 's gang rape scene because it is couched in a moral context .
" I can not believe anybody could read the gang rape scene and not be horrified .
Terrible things are out there in the world .
And in the real world they tumble into children 's lives in an unexplained way - items on the news , like the [ Jamie ]
Bulger case or killings in Helmand . "
Michael Rosen , the former children 's laureate , suspects that age guidelines would be pointless .
" If you have a book in a house that says it is for a nine - year - old , is that going to stop an eight - year - old picking it up ? " he asked .
" A book is a public place and you can't control it .
That is why we call it the republic of letters .
It was the Puritans who were worried about people 's private desires .
Attempts to control reading are the last tendrils of puritanism . "
Functional programming
Olaf Chitil
Abstract
In Benjamin W. Wah , editor , Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering , volume 2 , pages 182-196 .
John Wiley & Sons , Hoboken , NJ , January 2009 .
Functional programming is a programming paradigm like object - oriented programming and logic programming .
Functional programming comprises both a specific programming style and a class of programming languages that encourage and support this programming style .
Functional programming enables the programmer to describe an algorithm on a high - level , in terms of the problem domain , without having to deal with machine - related details .
A program is constructed from functions that only map inputs to outputs , without any other effect on the program state .
Thus a function will always return the same output , regardless of when and in which context the function is used .
These functions provide clear interfaces , separate concerns and are easy to reuse .
A small and simple set of highly orthogonal language constructs assists in writing modular programs .

Move over Bono , Coldplay is where it ’s at now – at least if you ’re Steve Jobs .
Jobs was spotted earlier this week at a Coldplay concert , marking the first time he ’s been seen in public since undergoing a liver transplant a few months ago .
Here ’s the scoop .
Two days ago , we came across the following tweet :
At coldplay … shoreline .
I just walked by steve jobs .
Geeked .
Steve Jobs was out and about at a Coldplay concert ?
Say what ?!
We wanted , nay , we needed to know more .
So we inquired a little bit futher and came up with bubkes .
Maybe it was just a phantom tweet meant to generate buzz and expose the suckers out there in the Twitterverse .
After all , it would n’t be the first time such a thing has happened – at this past years WWDC , for example , we almost fell victim to a joke tweeter who claimed that he had seen Steve Jobs secretly walk into the Moscone Center .
But yesterday , we came across Coldplay ’s official blog where one of the band ’s roadies delves into details about meeting Steve Jobs at the Shoreline Amphitheatre located just outside of San Francisco .
I ’ll be honest with you folks , the only thing that mattered to me tonight was the presence of one Steve Jobs .
I ’m a confirmed Apple devotee and I really cannot imagine doing the job I do now ( or even having got into this line of work ) without my Macbook Pro ( and all the Powerbooks that went before it ) .
Creating these tools and putting them into the hands of folks like me was the vision of this man .
I spot Steve chatting with Dave Holmes outside the dressing room and suddenly feel like a star - struck teenager .
In order to get the gall up to speak to the guy , I down a double espresso .
The mixture of caffeine buzz and feeling like a cheesy little fanboy means that all I can manage to say to him is “ Thank you so much ” .
I realise that I ’m quite simply making a tit of myself and so excuse myself as fast as I appeared .
Jobs , of course , is a big music aficionado with an appreciation for all things Dylan and Beatles .
He even dated folk singer Joan Baez ( who herself dated Dylan ) during the late 70’s and early 80’s .
In a certain regard , Jobs ’ presence at a Coldplay concert is n’t all that surprising .
Apple routinely uses Coldplay ’s music in its commercials , used the image of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin in ads for the now discontinued fat iPod Nano , and often plays their music during Apple keynote and WWDC events .
And finally , we ’d be remiss if we did n’t mention that Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin is married to actress Gwyneth Paltrow .
And what did they name their first child ?
Apple .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns boost their brain power through meditation and prayer , but even atheists can enjoy the mental benefits that believers derive from faith , according to a popular neuroscience author .
A Muslim prays during the festival of Eid-al - Fitr in Naghsh e Jahan square in Isfahan , 450 km ( 280 miles ) south of Tehran , October 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
The key , Andrew Newberg argues in his new book “ How God Changes Your Brain , ” lies in the concentrating and calming effects that meditation or intense prayer have inside our heads .
Brain scanners show that intense meditation alters our gray matter , strengthening regions that focus the mind and foster compassion while calming those linked to fear and anger .
Whether the meditator believes in the supernatural or is an atheist repeating a mantra , he says , the outcome can be the same - a growth in the compassion that virtually every religion teaches and a decline in negative feelings and emotions .
“ In essence , when you think about the really big questions in life -- be they religious , scientific or psychological -- your brain is going to grow , ” says Newberg , head of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania .
“ It does n’t matter if you ’re a Christian or a Jew , a Muslim or a Hindu , or an agnostic or an atheist , ” he writes in the book written with Mark Robert Waldman , a therapist at the Center .
NEUROTHEOLOGY
In his office at the University of Pennsylvania ’s hospital , Newberg told Reuters that “ neurotheology ” - the study of the brain ’s role in religious belief - is starting to shed light on what happens in believers ’ heads when they contemplate God .
Science and religion are often seen as opposites , to the point where some in each camp openly reject the other , but this medical doctor and professor of radiology , psychology and religious studies sees no reason not to study them together .
“ The two most powerful forces in all of human history have been religion and science , ” he said .
“ These are the two things that help us organize our world and understand it .
Why not try to bring them together to address each other and ultimately our world in a more effective way ? ”
Atheists often see scanner images tracking blood flows in brains of meditating monks and nuns lost in prayer as proof that faith is an illusion .
Newberg warns against simple conclusions :
“ If you see a brain scan of a nun who ’s perceiving God ’s presence in a room , all it tells you is what was happening in her brain when she perceived God ’s presence in a room .
“ It may be just the brain doing it , but it may be the brain being the receiver of spiritual phenomena , ” said Newberg , whose research shows the short prayers most believers say leave little trace on the brain because they are not as intense as meditation .
“ I ’m not trying to say religion is bad or it ’s not real , ” he added .
“ I say people are religious and let ’s try to understand how it affects them . ”
NO “ GOD SPOT ”
Another notion Newberg debunks is the idea there is a single “ God spot ” in the brain responsible for religious belief : “ It ’s not like there ’s a little spiritual spot that lights up every time somebody thinks of God . ”
Instead , religious experiences fire neurons in several different parts of the brain , just like other events do .
Locating them does not explain them , but gives pointers to how these phenomena occur and what they might mean .
In their book , Newberg and Waldman sketch out some of the “ God circuits ” in the brain and their effects , especially if trained through meditation as muscles are through exercise .
Meditation both activates the frontal lobe , which “ creates and integrates all of your ideas about God , ” and calms down the amygdala , the emotional region that can create images of an authoritative deity and fog our logical thinking .
The parietal - frontal circuit gives us a sense of the space around us and our place in it .
Meditation suppresses this sense , giving rise to a serene feeling of unity with God or the world .
“ Even 10 to 15 minutes of meditation appear to have significantly positive effects on cognition , relaxation and psychological health , ” the authors declare in the book .
Newberg , who grew up in a Reform Jewish family and has studied many religions , said his work might help both believers and atheists understand religious feelings , which he said were “ among the most powerful and complex experiences people have . ”
But he cautioned against expecting “ neurotheology ” to come up with surprising insights soon : “ As good as our techniques are , they are still incredibly crude .
We have a long way to go . ”
Singletons and their Problems in Python
The infamous Singleton design pattern is now widely seen as stupid and evil and also causes some hatred .
Fortunately singletons in Python are not that common and few people use it .
It seems to be a natural thing not to create a singleton class .
But beware .
Just because you do not implement the singleton design pattern it does not mean you avoid the core problem of a singleton .
The core problem of a singleton is the global , shared state .
A singleton is nothing more than a glorified global variable and in languages like Java there are many reasons why you would want to use something like a singleton .
In Python we have something different for singletons , and it has a very innocent name that hides the gory details : module .
That 's right folks : a Python module is a singleton .
And it shares the same problems of the singleton pattern just that it 's a little bit worse .
Namespaces
So let 's dive into the problems of Python modules by looking at a completely different language .
Let 's compare our beloved Python modules with C# namespaces for a moment .
If you do n't know C# , let me show you how they are declared : namespace MyNamespace { class MyClass { } }
So as you can see , a namespace in C# is something you specify explicitly .
On the surface that looks like the big difference between a Python module and a C# namespace .
However , that 's really just the surface .
The biggest difference is that a C# namespace is something like a folder .
You put stuff into it so that you can better organize it .
And the only stuff you can stuff into a C# namespace are classes , interfaces , other namespaces , enums and delegates ( something like a function prototype in C ) .
In Python a module is an object .
And that object is an instance of a class called module and it has as many attributes as you like .
You can put whatever you want on it .
What 's stored on there are usually the imported objects , the classes and functions declared in that module and other global variables or constants .
That means the big difference is that a Python module has the ability to store state , a C# namespace does not .
There is nothing you can store on a C# namespace that could change at runtime .
That means the only thing “ stored ” on a C# namespace is compiled code that was loaded from an assembly ( something like a .pyc file in Python , just more portable ) .
So what are the implications ?
There can only be one …
So I have already told you that modules in Python are simple objects with attributes .
So what happens if you write import meh ( Ignoring the obscure details about the Python import system ) ?
First the Python interpreter checks if the module was already imported and if yes , it 's using the already imported module , otherwise it 's creating a new module object and executes the code that creates it .
The already imported modules are stored in a special dictionary inside the interpreter .
sys.modules points to this dictionary , so you can access that from the Python code .
Each module that was already imported ( and also modules that are known to not exist ) are stored in there to ensure there will only be one .
So as you might have guessed , it 's what we call a singleton .
The second step , the execution of code to create the module attributes is the second “ problem ” here .
It 's what creates the shared state or what can create the shared state .
In order to not talk about irrelevant things , let 's have a look at one of the modules from the standard library , the mimetypes module .
Have a look : inited =
False def init ( files = None ) : global inited db = MimeTypes ( ) ...
This is actual code from the mimetypes module that ships with Python , just with the more gory details removed .
The point is , there is shared state .
And the shared state is a boolean flag that is True if the module was initialized or False if it was not .
Now that particular case is probably not that problematic ( trust me , it is ) because mimetypes initializes itself , but you can see that there is a files parameter to the init function .
If you pass a list of files to that function , it will reinitialize the mime database in memory with the mime information from those files .
Now imagine what would happen if you have two libraries initializing mimetypes with two different sources …
Now obviously , that 's a problem of the library that implements it not of Python itself .
Nobody should have shared state in module scope .
Unfortunately there are many standard library modules that have that ( cgi , logging , mimetypes , csv , … ) and it seems to be standard practice in Python world .
There is a lot of shared state in Django and nearly all modern frameworks , not just for the web .
Let it be None ?
Now before I ask for more than one , I want to ask for none .
Because this is the problem that freaks me out the most .
I 'm mainly doing Python webdevelopment and that means I have some long running processes that are managed by some external server I do n't really control .
Not only do I work with Python , I also obsessed by the idea to have extensible systems .
Which is why a project of mine has a plugin interface .
Users can upload new plugins in the web interface and activate and deactivate them .
What does all of that have to do with singletons and modules ?
Unfortunately too much .
I told you already that once a module is imported , it 's stored in that sys.modules thing .
Now imagine a user uploads a new version of a plugin , he upgrades it .
In order for the new code to load you would first have to shutdown the Python interpreter and restart it again .
Unfortunately there is no way for a WSGI application to request a restart from the webserver .
So how does one unload a module to reload a new version ?
There is no documented way for that , and the thing I 'm doing is dangerous , not portable , kills little kittens and you should never , ever do that .
The road to insanity or code reloading in Python :
Put your reloading code into a separate module , one with a special name ( zine .
_core in my case )
Have some sort of lock .
Acquire that lock , and do that when you 're sure no other thread is executing code from your package ( haha , good luck )
Clear all modules from sys.modules that belongs to your code , except the one that implements the reloader .
Import your package again and execute the code that sets up the application again .
This is dangerous and stupid .
Imagine what happens if a thread is still active in the old code and you kick away the modules it 's executing in .
Because of weak references you could get rid of the global scope ( the module one ) a called function is still weakly referencing and the function would break with an obscure error .
Currently there is no solution for that problem , and I do n't expect one to appear in Python anytime soon , at least not without breaking stuff .
Because what we would need is …
… more Singletons
If one singleton does not solve the problem , a second one could .
That 's the point where you should disagree with me and call me names , but let me explain myself first .
The problem is shared state , but why is shared state the problem ?
In Python development we seem to love shared state , a whole lot .
And it does make development simple and lets you learn and understand the language quickly .
The shared state is usually stored on modules or stuff stored on modules , so modules seem to be the root of all evil .
There can only be one version of a module , what does this mean for us ?
Imagine we have one running Python interpreter , the following things do not work : that interpreter runs application A and application B , A wants libfoo in version 1.0 , B wants libfoo in version 2.0 , both API incompatible
we can't reload code on the fly because we would have to tear everything down first and restart , we can't load the new version of the code and slowly moving over to it and get rid of the old code with the help of the garbage collector when it 's no longer needed .
we can't have two instances of the same application running in the same process that want different search paths for plugins loaded with the regular import API ( instance 1 loading the modules below app.plugins from / var / www / instance1 / plugins and instance 2 loading the modules from / var/ www / instance2 / plugins )
The funny ( and sad ) part is that all these nice things do not work just because of one single object : sys.modules , the übersingleton of Python .
But we can't get rid of it because our modules are objects and we want to get the same module back if we import it in two different modules .
So if we can't get rid of the singleton , add some more !
This solution would solve the problems of the three cases outlined above , but there would still be many problems left .
Also there is no way this could be implemented in a backwards compatible fashion in Python due to the fact how pickle imports objects and how we refer to objects , but this is how it could work :
Tagging sys.modules
Currently the key for the items in sys.modules is the name of the module .
In an ideal world , the keys would be tuples in the form ( module_name , tag ) where tag could be used for the following things : specify a specific version of the library ( like ' 1.0 ' )
) a secondary import of a library ( like mimetypes import for library B )
an random ad - hoc identifier to enforce fresh imports ( think about testsuites and benchmarks that need to work on clean imports of a library because of … well … shared state …)
How to express which tag to use ?
# a string literal as tag from sqlalchemy [ ' 0.6 ' ] import create_engine # the contents of a variable as tag from zine.plugins [ my_instance ] import myrtle_theme
What if no tag is provided ?
No idea man .

Hundreds of ultra-orthodox Jews have clashed with police in Jerusalem for a third consecutive Saturday over a car park which opens on the Sabbath .
Police said the protesters , wearing traditional Hassidic clothing , threw stones and jumped in front of vehicles .
The Sabbath is observed by religious Jews as a day of rest , when working , driving and trading are forbidden .
The protesters say the municipal car park will attract tourists and encourage business on the holy day .
Protesters , praying and chanting " Shabbes " - the Yiddish word for Sabbath - gathered at a police cordon at the entrance to the car park , near Jerusalem 's Old City .
Some lay in the road to prevent cars from entering .
" Hundreds of ultra -orthodox tried to overrun police barricades and threw stones at our men in several sectors of Jerusalem , " police spokesman Schmuel Ben Rubi , told the AFP news agency .
He said there had been no injuries or arrests so far .
However , television footage showed people in religious clothing being moved by police or put into police cars .
One man who had crawled underneath the wheels of a stationary bus was reported to have been taken away by police .
There were also clashes in the nearby ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Mea Shearim , where police had been deployed .
The car park was opened by the Jerusalem municipality last month to provide extra facilities for visitors to the city .
But the protesters are angry at what they see as a move which will " profane " the Sabbath .
The row has highlighted tensions between Jerusalem 's ultra-orthodox Jews , known as Haredim , and the majority secular population .
If cash is king , then barter might be a baron .
Cash is universal , trusted and very liquid .
Barter on the other hand , can be a reasonable option , economists say , but comes with inherent obstacles .
In an effort to keep as much cash on hand as possible during the recession , small businesses and individuals are increasingly looking to barter .
Craigslist , for example , has seen its barter listings grow 120 percent in the last year .
Trading on BizXchange , an online bartering network , has climbed 68 percent over the same period .
Straight bartering requires what economists call a double coincidence of wants , which means that unless two people have exactly that which the other wants ( not to mention in comparable amounts and at the same time ) , then there is no deal .
In that sense , says Frank Shorfheide , a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania , " Bartering is essentially inefficient . "
But online bartering exchanges are making the practice more efficient .
Bartering has been aided along by firms such as BizXchange , which supplements trades with a currency system and lines of credit that can be used for multiple trades with several participants .
Bob Bagga , CEO of BizXchange , says that the greatest appeal of new bartering is the real revenue and customers it draws to a business by allowing businesses to offload excess ability or stock while attracting otherwise untapped customers as well .
" If we were n't bringing in new and incremental revenue , all you 're doing is trading dollars , and that does n't make any sense , " Bagga says .
Instead , it is the new marketplace offered by the network that makes the service worth a company 's time , he says .
By instituting BizX dollars , for example , BizXchange eliminated some of the restriction caused by the double coincidence of wants .
" Barter can be just as efficient as having money , " says Peter Rousseau , a professor of economics at Vanderbilt University , provided that there is a large enough network of goods , suppliers and consumers .
And while this does make bartering much more practical , a company - invented currency will not likely approach the relative level of stability enjoyed by the dollar .
" It is definitely not necessary that these kinds of dollars are issued by the government , but on the other hand , it does give some backing and credibility . "

He is a confident , animated speaker , but he seems to be struggling with this particular point .
“ It ’s like … at my first job , ” he continues , “ I was stealing maybe a thousand bucks a month from that place .
And this kid , he was new , he got wise .
And he was going to turn me in , but before he got the chance I went to the manager and pinned the whole thing on him . ”
Now he is grinning widely .
“ Kid lost his job , the cops got involved , I do n’t know what happened to him .

It ’s supposed to hurt , right ?
But instead , it ’s like there ’s nothing . ”
He smiles apologetically and shakes his head .
“ Nothing . ”
His name is Frank , and he is a psychopath .
In the public imagination , a “ psychopath ” is a violent serial killer or an over - the - top movie villain , as one sometimes might suspect Frank to be .
He is highly impulsive and has a callous disregard for the well - being of others that can be disquieting .
But he is just as likely to be a next - door neighbor , a doctor , or an actor on TV ⁠⁠ — essentially no different from anyone else who holds these roles , except that Frank lacks the nagging little voice which so profoundly influences most of our lives .
Frank has no conscience .
And as much as we would like to think that people like him are a rare aberration , safely locked away , the truth is that they are more common than most would ever guess .

– Hare , Without Conscience : The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us
The word psychopathy dates back in an early form to the 19th century , but as a modern term it ’s primarily used in reference to the work of Canadian psychologist Robert Hare .
Hare ’s PCL - R tool ( Psychopathy Checklist – Revised ) was developed to test for a wide range of socially deviant behaviors and personality traits , the most important being the absence of any sense of conscience , remorse , or guilt .
The result of this combination is a destructive , self - serving , and often dangerous individual sometimes called “ the born criminal . ”
The psychopath ’s world is a strikingly skewed one in which the normal laws of human emotion and interaction do not apply⁠⁠ — yet it serves as reality for a sizable portion of humanity .
Spanning all cultures and eras , roughly one man in every 100 is born a clinical psychopath , as well as one woman in every 300 .
They are so common that every person reading this sentence almost certainly knows one personally ; indeed , a significant number of readers are likely psychopaths themselves .
Many potential psychopaths might not even realize they have the condition , nor has there traditionally been any easy way for others to recognize them .
The leading scientific test is Hare ’s PCL-R , but to be valid it must be performed by a qualified professional under controlled conditions .
For those who ca n’t be bothered with such expensive frills , we present the PCL - DI : an alternative , PCL - inspired test guaranteed to appear scientific .
Note :
This interactive was developed before mobile browsers were a thing , so it may not work well on small screens .
The concept of the psychopath is only the latest and most refined in a long string of attempts to account for a certain pattern of conduct .
In the 19th century , psychiatric clinicians began to notice patients in their care who fit no known diagnosis , but who nevertheless displayed strange and disturbing behaviors .
They were impulsive and self - destructive .
They had no regard for the feelings and welfare of others .
They lied pathologically , and when caught , they shrugged it off with a smirk and moved on to the next lie .
It was a puzzle⁠⁠ — because while there was clearly something unusual about these patients , they showed none of the psychotic symptoms or defects in reason thought necessary for mental illness at the time .
Indeed , apart from a tendency to follow foolish and irresponsible impulses that sometimes got them into trouble , they were coldly rational⁠⁠ — more rational , perhaps , than the average citizen .
Their condition therefore came to be referred to as manie sans délire ( “ insanity without delirium ” ) , a term which later evolved into moral insanity once the central role of a “ defective conscience ” came to be appreciated .
By the 20th century , these individuals would be called sociopaths or said to suffer from antisocial personality disorder , two terms that are still used interchangeably with psychopathy in some circles , while in others are considered distinct but related conditions .
The psychopath does not merely repress feelings of anxiety and guilt or fail to experience them appropriately ; instead , he or she lacks a fundamental understanding of what these things are .
When asked a question such as “ What does remorse feel like ? ” for instance , the typical psychopath will become irritated , deflect the question , or attempt to change the subject .
The following response from a psychopathic rapist , asked why he did n’t empathize with his victims , shows just how distanced such a person can be from normal human emotion :
“ They are frightened , right ?
But , you see , I do n’t really understand it .
I ’ve been frightened myself , and it was n’t unpleasant . ”
– Hare , Without Conscience : The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us
Arriving at a disaster scene , a psychopath would most likely gather to watch with the rest of the crowd .
He might even lend assistance if he perceived no threat to his own safety .
But he would feel none of the panic , shock , or horror of the other onlookers⁠⁠ — his interest would fall more on the reactions of the victims and of the crowd .
He would not be repulsed by any carnage on display , except perhaps in the same sense as serial killer Paul Bernardo when he described cutting up one of his victims ’ bodies as “ the most disgusting thing he had ever done . ”
He was referring to the mess it made .
Despite this emotional deficiency , most psychopaths learn to mimic the appearance of normal emotion well enough to fit into ordinary society , not unlike the way that the hearing impaired or illiterate learn to use other cues to compensate for their disabilities .
As Hare describes it , psychopaths “ know the words but not the music . ”
One might imagine that such a false and superficial front would be easily penetrated , but such is rarely the case , probably because of the assumption we all tend to make that others think and feel essentially the same way as ourselves .
Differences in culture , gender , personality , and social status all create empathy gaps that can seem almost unfathomable , but none of these is as fundamental a divide as the one that exists between an individual with a conscience and one without .
The psychopath ’s psychology is so profoundly alien to most people that we are unable to comprehend their motives , or recognize one when we see one .
Naturally , the industrious psychopath will find this to his advantage .
Some psychologists go so far as to label the psychopath “ a different kind of human ” altogether .
Psychopathy has an environmental component like nearly all aspects of personal psychology , but its source is rooted firmly in biology .
This has caused some researchers to suspect that the condition is n’t a “ disorder ” at all , but an adaptive trait .
In a civilization made up primarily of law - abiding citizenry , the theory goes , an evolutionary niche opens up for a minority who would exploit the trusting masses .
This hypothesis is supported by the apparent success many psychopaths find within society .
The majority of these individuals are not violent criminals ; indeed , those that turn to crime are generally considered “ unsuccessful psychopaths ” due to their failure to blend into society .
Those who do succeed can do so spectacularly .
For instance , while it may sound like a cynical joke , it ’s a fact that psychopaths have a clear advantage in fields such as law , business , and politics .
They have higher IQs on average than the general population .
They take risks and are n’t fazed by failures .
They know how to charm and manipulate .
They ’re ruthless .
It could even be argued that the criteria used by corporations to find effective managers actually select specifically for psychopathic traits : characteristics such as charisma , self - centeredness , confidence , and dominance are highly correlated with the psychopathic personality , yet also highly sought after in potential leaders .
It was not until recent years⁠⁠— in the wake of some well - publicized scandals involving corporate psychopaths⁠⁠ — that many corporations started to reconsider these promotion policies .
After all , psychopaths are interested only in their own gain , and trouble is inevitable when their interests begin to conflict with those of the company .
This was the case at Enron , and again at WorldCom⁠⁠ — and Sunbeam CEO Al Dunlap , besides doctoring the books and losing his company millions of dollars , would allegedly leave his wife at home without access to food or money for days at a time .
Hermann Goering
The thought of these people wearing suits and working a 9 - 5 job conflicts with most people ’s image of psychopaths gleaned from films like The Godfather and The Silence of the Lambs .
But it should n’t be surprising .
A lack of empathy does not necessarily imply a desire to do harm⁠⁠ — that comes from sadism and tendencies toward violence , traits which have only a small correlation with psychopathy .
When all three come together in one individual , of course , the result is catastrophic .
Ted Bundy and Paul Bernardo are extreme examples of such a combination .
“ Do I feel bad when I hurt someone ?
Yeah , sometimes .
But mostly it ’s just like … uh… ( laughs ) .
I mean , how did you feel the last time you squashed a fly ? ”
– Unnamed rapist / kidnapper
If psychopaths often appear where we do n’t expect them , neither does the clinical term always apply where we think it might .
Nazi Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering is thought to have met the diagnostic criteria , but Hitler ’s own behavior was frequently inconsistent with that of a psychopath .
Columbine killer Eric Harris fit the description , but his accomplice Dylan Klebold did not .
In total , only about 20 % of a typical prison population qualifies as psychopathic ( half of the violent offenders ) , and the difference from the general population is readily apparent to those who know them well .
Even the most hardened of normal offenders can find their psychopathic cellmates unnerving .
The same discovery awaits most anyone who becomes close to such an individual .
In romantic relationships , a psychopath may be charming and affectionate just long enough to establish intimacy with a partner , and then suddenly become abusive , unfaithful , and manipulative .
The bewildered partner might turn to friends and family with their story , only to be met with disbelief⁠⁠ — how could the warm , outgoing individual everyone has come to know possibly be guilty of these acts ?
All too often , the abused partner blames the situation on themselves , and comes out of the relationship emotionally destroyed .
But from a comfortable distance , the impression given off by a psychopath is often highly positive .
The same absence of inhibitions and honesty that makes psychopaths so dangerous also gives them unusual powers of charisma through self - confidence and fabricated flattery .
The aforementioned Sunbeam CEO Al Dunlap was a legend in business circles⁠⁠ — “ a corporate god , ” some called him⁠⁠ — precisely for his ruthless , results - oriented business style and in - your - face , furniture - hurling personality .
In social circles , psychopaths are often the most popular friends among members of both sexes .
And strikingly , in entertainment media such as films and books , it ’s not just the villains who tend to have psychopathic personalities ⁠⁠— it ’s the heroes , too .
One does n’t have to look far to find examples of this kind of protagonist .
James
Bond , the promiscuous , daring secret agent who can ski down a mountainside while being chased by armed attackers without breaking a sweat , is a textbook case .
Frank Abagnale Jr. , the charming con-man on whom the recent book and film Catch Me if You Can were based , is another highly likely candidate .
And nearly every character played by action stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone⁠ ⁠ — the ones who vow revenge on an enemy and rampage about while coolly spouting one - liners⁠⁠ — would qualify for a diagnosis .
“ I would n’t be here if my parents had come across when I needed them , ” he [ ‘ Terry , ’ imprisoned bank robber ] said .
“ What kind of parents would let their son rot in a place like this ? ”
Asked about his children , he replied , “ I ’ve never seen them .
I think they were given up for adoption .
How the hell should I know ? ” – Hare , Without Conscience : The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us
The reasons we look up to these conscience impaired people are unclear .
Recent Bond film Casino Royale did n't shy away from acknowledging Bond 's psychopathic tendencies
Most likely it has something to do with the confidence they exude , the ease they seem to feel in any situation⁠⁠ — a trait that comes easily in someone essentially incapable of fear or anxiety .
Maybe we ’re easily suckered in by their natural glibness and charm .
Or maybe on some level we envy the freedom they have , with no burden of conscience or emotion .
The psychopaths , for their part , will never know things any other way .
Most experts agree that the condition is permanent and completely untreatable .
It ’s been theorized that their situation is the result of a kind of inherited learning disorder : without dread or anxiety to deter them , psychopaths are unable to make the associations between behavior and punishment that make up the building blocks of a normal conscience .
That being the case , it is questionable whether a description such as “ evil ” ⁠⁠ — which is not uncommon in both the popular and scientific literature⁠⁠ — can really be applied to individuals incapable of understanding what it means .
But to those who cross their paths , this may be small comfort .
A federal appeals court , in the first decision of its kind , said Thursday that companies providing malware , spyware and adware blocking services are immunized by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 from lawsuits claiming unfair business practices .
A three - judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the CDA treats security software makers the same as internet service providers when they block material they find objectionable , granting them so - called " good Samaritan " immunity from civil lawsuits .
Like an ISP , such companies provide an " interactive computer service " because they pull updates from a central server , the San Francisco - based appeals court said .
" We conclude that a provider of access tools that filter , screen , allow , or disallow content that a provider or user considers obscene , lewd , lascivious , filthy , or excessively violent , harassing or otherwise objectionable is protected from liability , " the court ruled . ( .pdf )
The case concerned adware - maker Zango , which provided access to online videos , games , music , tools and utilities to web surfers who agreed to view advertisements while surfing the internet .
Among other charges , the Washington State company accused Kaspersky Lab of illegally blocking a toolbar program that displayed links to advertisers .
Zango also said Kaspersky users were prevented from installing Zango software altogether , if Kaspersky was already on the computer -– a situation that did not occur with other security software programs .
The court noted that Kaspersky , of Russia , had a good faith belief that it was blocking adware , and that its users could allow pop-ads if they wanted or unlock the toolbar .
The court noted that Zango was fined $ 3 million in 2006 for deceiving web surfers into installing its pop -up software .
Zango contended that immunity was meant to cover only internet service providers , not companies that provide access to tools for filtering content .
But the law , the court noted , " does not limit the definition of ' interactive computer service ' to services that provide access to the internet . "
Rather , the court said , " its singular requirement is for access by multiple users of a computer server . "
Security software is covered because it " enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server by providing its customers with online access to its update servers , " the court said .
The ruling could have a dark side , however , potentially opening the door for anti-competitive practices .
A browser - maker , for example , could choose to block access to competing websites , or filter out search engine results critical of the company .
That danger was not lost on the court , which wrote that " extending immunity beyond the facts of this case could pose serious problems if providers of blocking software were to be given free license to unilaterally block the dissemination of material by content providers under the literal terms " of the law .
The law might empower a software company to " abuse immunity to block content for anti-competitive purposes or merely at a malicious whim . "
The court urged Congress to clarify the statute .

Attention America :
If you find yourself without underwear , covered in mosquitoes , running from a charging pack of alligators while trying to read a romance novel through your goopy eye lashes ... you still might be living in a recession .
Via Economix , I 've stumbled upon Kiplinger 's list of 10 Quirky Economic Indicators , which range from not very quirky ( drop in theater attendance ) to truly bizarre ( more mosquitoes ? ) .
I do n't like some of them , so here are the five I 'll choose to monitor , somehow , in the next few months :
1 . More guys going commando
As I wrote here , hardly anybody actually sees your underwear , so it 's the first thing you stop buying in a recession .
That creates a lot of pent - up demand , so when underwear sales level off and start to increase , you could be seeing the beginning of a serious uptick in consumer demand .
2 . More cabs asking to drive Eliot Spitzer around
Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer complains ( via Catherine Rampell ) that the cabs in New York are all empty , because people are staying home , or using the subway , or heaven forbid , walking .
3 . More mosquito bites .
Kiplinger explains : " In Maricopa County , Ariz . , huge numbers of foreclosed or abandoned homes have vacant swimming pools and unattended ponds .
The stagnant waters - known as green pools -- are a hotbed for mosquito breeding , say local authorities .
Crews have treated more than 4,000 green pools already in 2009 .
During the same period in 2007 , before metropolitan Phoenix 's housing market collapsed , they had treated only 2,500 .
While most are on vacant properties , some also belong to residents who can't afford to maintain their pools and ponds . "

( CNN ) -- Frank
Hatley spent the past year in jail for being a deadbeat dad .
But there 's one problem -- Hatley does n't have any children .
And the " deadbeat " label does n't fit the 50 - year - old either , his supporters say .
Frank Hatley had been ordered to make back payments even after he learned a teenager was n't his son .
After a hearing , Hatley was released from the Cook County Jail in south Georgia Wednesday afternoon , with the help of the Southern Center for Human Rights .
Superior Court Judge Dane Perkins ruled that Hatley was indigent and should not be jailed for not being able to make child support payments .
Perkins postponed a decision on whether Hatley should have to make any more back payments on child - support for a child who is not his .
In June of last year , a judge ordered Hatley to jail for failing to reimburse the state for public assistance that was paid to support his " son , " who , as the court was aware , is not actually his son .
Hatley 's attorney Sarah Geraghty , who filed a motion for his release , called it a case of " blatant unfairness . "
Hatley is a hard - working man who demonstrated his desire to pay what the court said he owed , even making payments from his unemployment checks , Geraghty told CNN .
On top of that , " the state has no legitimate reason to pursue Mr. Hatley for child support -- he does n't have any children , " she said .
The story dates back to 1986 , when Hatley had a relationship with Essie Lee Morrison .
She became pregnant and gave birth to a son .
Morrison told Hatley that the child was his , but the couple ended their relationship shortly after the boy 's birth , according to court documents .
The couple never married and never lived together , the documents state .
When the boy turned 2 , Morrison applied for public support for her son .
Under Georgia law , the state can go after the non-custodial parent to recoup the assistance .
For 13 years ,
Hatley made payments to the state until learning , in 2000 , that the boy might not be his biological son .
A DNA test that year confirmed that there was no chance he was the father , according to court documents .
Hatley returned to court and was relieved of any future child support reimbursement but was ordered to pay more than $ 16,000 that he had owed the state before the ruling .
Latesha Bradley , an attorney who represented Hatley in that hearing , told CNN the argument for keeping Hatley liable for the back payments was that he had signed a consent agreement with the office of child support services .
The court agreed that Hatley had to comply with the consent agreement for the period that he believed the boy was his son .
Court documents show that Hatley for the most part continued to make payments .
He was jailed for six months in 2006 for falling behind on payments during a period of unemployment , but afterward he resumed making payments and continued to do so even after he lost another job in 2008 and became homeless , court records state .
Last year , he again became unable to maintain the payments and was once again jailed .
The circumstances of Hatley 's arrest did n't feel right to many , including Cook County Sheriff Johnny Daughtrey .

My Life Offline
Everyone wants to know how my month offline was .
They ask it casually , like “ How ’s work going ? ” or “ What ’d you do this weekend ? ”
But it ’s not a casual question .
It was a huge , incredible , transformative experience .
Those 30 days felt like six months .
My habits changed , my relationships changed , my identity changed , my personality changed — hell , the physical shape of my body changed dramatically .
I went through four legal pads trying to describe what it was like .
I ’m still not sure I really know .
One thing is clear , though : my normal life style is n’t healthy .
This does n’t seem like the kind of thing that requires a break to learn .
I imagine people with unhealthy lifestyles know they ’re unhealthy .
They come home after work and say “ I ca n’t go on like this , ” they cry randomly in elevators .
But I did n’t know .
Life online is practically the only life I know .
Sure , I guess things were different when I was very young — I remember , after getting my first email account , wishing someone would email me so I ’d have an email to answer ( even then I knew I ’d soon be missing those empty - inbox days ) — but for most of my life , this has been it : a jumble of interruptions and requests and jobs and people , largely carried out alone .
It never let up , so I never saw anything different .
How was I to know there was anything wrong ?
But the last few weeks have made it clear there was — is .
These weeks have n’t felt that different my other weeks online , really — same jumble of work and people and interruptions as always .
The usual sense that I ’m never really here , I ’m always worried about the million things around the corner : a todo list that goes for pages , a thousand emails to respond to , hundreds of blog posts to read , twenty open tabs , a dozen IM windows , a text message to answer , a Twitter stream to catch up on .
I never used to think about these things as a benefit or a distraction — I did n’t think about them at all ; they were just how life online was .
This was the era of multitasking and I was its child .
If I felt anything about it , it was pride — a kind of joy in ( mostly ) managing to handle a thousand different things thrown my way at once .
But I never knew what life was like when things were n’t constantly being thrown at you .
Until it stopped , I never knew how awful it really was .
I am not happy .
I used to think of myself as just an unhappy person : a misanthrope , prone to mood swings and eating binges , who spends his days moping around the house in his pajamas , too shy and sad to step outside .
But that ’s not how I was offline .
I loved people — everyone from the counter clerk to the old friends I bumped into on the street .
And I loved to go for walks and exercise in the gym and — even though there was no one around to see me — groom .
Yes , groom : shower and shave and put on nice clothes and comb my hair and clean up my nails and so on , all things a month ago I would have said went against my very nature , things I never did before voluntarily .
But most of all , I felt not just happy , but firmly happy — solid , is the best way I can put it .
I felt like I was in control of my life instead of the other way around , like its challenges just bounced off me as I kept doing what I wanted .
Normally I feel buffeted by events , a thousand tiny distractions nagging at the back of my head at all times .
Offline , I felt in control of my own destiny .
I felt , yes , serene .
When I was very young , my parents introduced me to a book called Flow .
It argued that people good at their jobs went into a sort of flow state — they were “ in the zone ” — where the normal stress of the world faded away and all their concentration was focused on the task at hand .
It was n’t “ fun ” the way ice cream or sex is fun — it did n’t make you smile , just look grimly determined — but it was somehow more than that .
It was fulfilling .
And that was even better than a smile .
I go into such states when programming or writing and they are indeed fantastic , but also weirdly hollow .
When you come out the real world — with its mundane stresses and distractions — comes crashing back in , and the moment of flow seems like just another temporary escape , an elusive dream .
And it ’s a hard one to get back .
I still had flow states while offline — stronger than ever , in fact : I spent an ecstatic afternoon and evening writing longhand in a trance , pouring out the first forty pages of the book I ’ve been researching ; afterward , I was on a bigger high than I ’ve ever had in my life — but they did n’t feel like escapes .
Normal days were n’t painful anymore .
I did n’t spend them filled with worry , like before .
Offline , I felt solid and composed .
Online , I feel like my brain wants to run off in a million different directions , even when I try to point it forward .
A friend asked me if I knew I was privileged to be able to take such a break .
It seemed a silly question : I feel privileged every day .
As I write , my best friend is broke and homeless , much of the world struggles just to stay alive .
I feel privileged to own a mattress , let alone take a break .
I realize everyone ’s lives are filled with work and people and distractions — the situation brewing at the office , the sump pump breaking down at the house , the family member who ’s fallen ill .
I realize it must seem like the greatest arrogance to think one could escape life ’s mundane concerns , like asking to live on a cloud , floating above the mere mortals .
But it was that arrogance that made me think I could contribute to adult mailing lists when I was still in elementary school , that arrogance that made me think someone might want to read my website when I was still just a teen , that arrogance that had me start a company as a college freshman .
That sort of arrogance — not bragging , but simply inwardly thinking I could do more than was expected of me — is the only thing that ’s gotten me anywhere in life .
I see no reason to stop now .
I do n’t know how I ’m going to carve a life away from the world ’s constant demands and distractions .
I do n’t know how I ’m going to balance all the things I want to do with the pressures and responsibilities they bring .
But after my month off , I do know one thing : I ca n’t go on like this .
So I ’m damn well going to try .

minimalism
omit needless code
Kevlin Henney
The appeal to " omit needless words " is made by Strunk and White [ Strunk +2000 ] concerning written composition : Vigorous writing is concise .
A sentence should contain no unnecessary words , a paragraph no unnecessary sentences , for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts .
This requires not that the writer make all sentences short , or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline , but that every word tell .
Whilst we may muse about engineering , architectural or craft metaphors for software development , there is no denying that , in essence , programming is writing .
It is a form of communication that has two distinct audiences : us and the machine .
Although there are times when it might not feel this way , the machine is easily pleased , demanding little more than well - formed code .
We , however , are a little more complex and discerning : we demand that our communication communicate .
As a discipline of composition much of what can be said for writing natural language is directly applicable to code .
There is no virtue in long - windedness and , by way of balance , there is also no virtue in code that is unreadably terse .
As ever the appeal is for well - written code .
Code that is simple and clear , brief and direct .
motivation
Minimalism was the subject and title of my ACCU Spring Conference 2001 keynote [ Henney2001a ] .
In reflection of the topic I dispensed with the usual parade of slides and detailed notes , making do with just two slides : the title and the agenda .
As with an iceberg , this was just the tip : I personally had no shortage of material .
Whether it was cool or not is another matter , but the feedback was good and I have had many requests for my notes or some written form on the topic .
This column is a response , albeit a little delayed , to those requests .
We encounter creeping featurism in software on a regular enough basis , most tangibly in our role as application users : many options , many ways to set them , many ways to lose track of them , many cunningly hidden defaults  many subtleties .
Sometimes we seem to be slaves to the application - fattening tedium of common but ineffective idioms .
My laptop , for example , is physically well designed : functional but appealing , lightweight but robust , minimal but complete .
Not a trace of surplus anywhere , and certainly the best laptop I have had to date .
But there 's always something that lets the side down .
At the time of the conference , the laptop was a very recent acquisition .
I had only just set it up ; there were still a few applications and personalisations outstanding when I went to give it its first public outing .
In performance it has been said that you should never work with animals and children .
You can add computers to that short list .
Part way through the keynote a dialog box cheerfully popped up to inform me that the batteries were now fully charged .
Of course , being the presenter  with my back turned to the projection 
I was in the privileged position of being the last to know .
However , it did serve to illustrate a point : the subtle difference between a feature and something that is useful .
What an astonishingly useless notification to have set up by default .
Why , in a logged - on existence already clogged with the dismissal of a seemingly never - ending procession of dialog boxes , would I want to be notified with any urgency that the batteries were full ?
Am I about to lose data ?
Has something crashed ?
Has a connection to a device or a network been established ?
Or dropped ?
Attention !
Attention !
Something not very significant has happened ! ... OK ?
( The standard , but intent free , appeal gracing the lone button on such junk dialog boxes . )
If you listen carefully enough , you can probably hear the late great Douglas Adams chuckling to himself in the background .
Well , yes , there is always the outside chance that I might find the information useful , but let 's stop and think for a moment about how outside that chance is .
Let 's do some design .
How is a laptop with a battery and power - saving features likely to be used ?
Typically either at a desk and plugged in or on the road and unplugged .
In the latter case you are going to need to plug it in again at some point .
If you are the just going to be sitting at a desk all day , you really do n't care when the battery fills up .
Why would you ?
You 're plugged into the mains concentrating on your work ( or avoiding it , as the case might be ) : the battery does n't matter .
And if it does , that 's why there 's at least one helpful battery indicator in clear view : on the laptop itself or the ( virtual ) desktop .
So there 's already enough display information for both the bored casual user and the twitchy concerned power user .
If you 're in a hurry and you need to pack up your bags and go , 97 % is as good as a 100 % .
The 100 % mark does not have the same ( show - stopping ) magic as 0 % , where the difference between 3 % and 0 % really is important .
After you 've been hacking away on a train for a couple of hours and have just turned up to a meeting to give a presentation  in a room fitted with such modern gimmickry as mains electricity  it is entirely likely that the battery charge is of no interest whatsoever .
As with over - helpful colleagues , it is more likely to be an irritating hindrance .
So , " battery full " notification is useful in perhaps a handful of situations and for a minority of people .
As demonstrated through the exploration of usage scenarios , it will be the exception rather than the rule .
It is certainly not a reasonable default .
However , now that its discovery had been thrust upon me , I was strongly motivated to disable the default ... but first I had to find it .
When I eventually found a moment for a get - to - know - your - laptop - better session , some rummaging around revealed that power management options were scattered across many different small applications , dialog boxes and menus .
Some of the available options seemed to complement one another , some seemed to contradict one another , and some just wanted to tell you their copyright details  " OK " ?
That 's the thing about features : if you do n't watch out , they creep .
Creep with all the coherence , supervision and elegance of most things on the planet that creep .
And no , that 's not " OK " .
There is a moral to all this , and it's not " do n't take new - born laptops to conferences " ( it proves to be quite difficult to test out a conference situation in the comfort of your own home ) .
Try to design for use rather than for features .
As a guideline this advice is especially useful when applied to the ordinary and everyday , as opposed to the novel and groundbreaking .
As an aside , there is a certain irony that the associated accessories web site for what is a highly usable laptop borders on the unusable .
In spite of its gloss and featurism , plain hand - written HTML with simple CGI usage  think classic mid-1990s style  would have been a marked improvement on the song and dance on offer .
It has been said that techies are not necessarily good web designers ; let the same be said of marketing departments .
Features are important , but in the absence of unbounded development resources , something often has to be sacrificed on the altar of schedule .
With the basic four variables you have to play with  scope , resources , quality and time  it is more reasonable to take the knife to features than either developers or quality , or indeed knocking over the altar .
Understanding the model of usage is what informs this selection .
So , given the choice , make specific common use simpler and more direct at the expense of generalised unproven utility .
Design to be used .
One consequence of making things more usable is that you work to identify and meet the need , thereby omitting the needless .
intent
My aim is not so much to explore software as executed as to examine software as written .
Tales from the end user are useful and their lessons can be redirected .
At a previous keynote , I offered a definition of design that I have found useful [ Henney1999 ] : " Design is a creational and intentional act : conception and construction of a structure on purpose for a purpose " .
In other words not only is design an act carried out with intent  whether at the keyboard , on a whiteboard , on the back of an envelope or wherever  it is also about embodying the structure with intent .
These are the two sides of the word intentional .
Programming is about expression , which is about intent , which is about meaning .
Hence clarity and brevity are significant .
Verbosity often represents a loss of intent , a loss of design information .
I have found that many verbose coding practices are justified by claiming simplified debugging .
It becomes the case that when programmers are so focused on debugging  what happens when things go wrong  that their attention is not focused on getting it right in the first place .
It is often said that prevention is better than cure .
No matter how laudable and well meant the cure is , choosing your practices is a matter of priority and perspective .
I recently read a list , from a GUI and software - development specialist , of top skills that should be required of developers : debugging was listed , but testing was not .
I believe that this is symptomatic of the industry as a whole .
Of course , debugging skills are not useless , but you will learn  and offer  a lot more from honing your unit - testing skills and understanding design by contract than you will sitting in a debugger .
I generally regard the use of this tool as a last resort ; to some degree an admission of failure .
This is not some kind of macho posturing ( " real programmers do n't need debuggers " ) but quite the opposite : there is an anti-intellectual machismo associated with reliance on stepping through code .
Intellectualism is far from being a virtue in its own right , but , given that programming can be considered a matter of applied thought , revelling in anti-intellectualism seems somewhat inappropriate .
I have heard the point of view supported by liberal use and abuse of the word practical .
Let me put it to you this way : bugs are not practical ; preventing them is more practical than finding them .
I would suggest that the debugger exists to solve a smaller class of problems than it is normally used to solve .
For example , consider the following code fragment :
if ( enabled == false ) { enabled = true ; } else { enabled = false ; }
And contrast it with the following :
enabled = ! enabled ;
This is not heavy number crunching code that requires a good understanding of advanced applied mathematics and numerical computing techniques .
This is simple Boolean algebra , the bread and butter of programming : the toggling ( or even , flipping ) intent is clearer in the second and shorter fragment .
It does not have redundant checks for equality against Boolean constants ( for consistency , surely the result of such a check should in turn be compared against true , and then that result in turn ... ) , expressing the idea of toggling directly and succinctly .
If programmers cannot work at this level , why should companies entrust them with anything as important as development that will affect their assets and future revenue stream ?
As programmers we learn to read through  by which I mean into more than I mean down  code to uncover the intent .
We get so used to such reading that sometimes we forget to question alternatives , drawn in by habit to uncover the intent at perhaps a lower level than is strictly necessary .
Consider loops .
They are both the dynamo and motor of almost all programs , whether explicit or hidden .
And oh how we love to write them :
std::vector<std::string > items ; ... // populate items for ( std : : size_t at = 0 ; at != items.size ( ) ; ++ at ) std::cout << items [ at ] << std::endl ;
In standard C++ , the received orthodoxy is that we should be writing in terms of iterators and not indices :
std::vector<std::string > items ; ... // populate items for ( std:: vector < std:: string >::iterator at = items.begin( ) ; at != items.end ( ) ; ++ at ) std::cout << * at << std::endl ;
Hmm , impressively less readable .
Certainly orthodox , but the intent now seems buried deeper beneath the debris of syntax .
When we " express coordinate ideas in similar form " [ Strunk +2000 ] we have the benefit of uniformity and ease of recognition .
For instance , the loop logic remains unchanged should we change the container type .
So why has this advice seemingly backfired ?
Pulling in std can make some difference , but not as much as you might hope .
Perhaps it is a matter of avoiding some obvious repetition , factoring out commonality in the form of a better type name :
typedef std::vector <std::string > strings ; strings items ; ... // populate items for ( strings : :iterator at = items.begin( ) ; at != items.end ( ) ; ++ at ) std::cout << * at << std::endl ;
Now , not only will the loop logic remain unaffected by a change in container , but the text of the loop will also remain unchanged :
typedef std:: set < std::string > strings ; strings items ; ... // populate items for ( strings : :iterator at = items.begin( ) ; at != items.end ( ) ; ++ at ) std::cout << * at << std::endl ;
But we can do better .
The main source of repetition is the source of repetition .
Part of the point about C++'s STL and those nested iterator names is that it is not really our job to spell out all the types : let the compiler do it for you .
Algorithm - based functions are templated to do just this .
They encapsulate loops and iterator types .
With the assistance of function objects , they can even make other type differences irrelevant .
Decoupling through templates can be applied all the way through , making the code more general .
Starting with the loop body :
class print { public : print ( std : : ostream &out ) : out ( out ) {} template < typename argument_type > void operator ( ) ( const argument_type &to_print ) const { out << to_print << std::endl ; } private : std:: ostream &out ; } ;
And then the loop :
std::vector<std::string > items ; ... // populate items std::for_each(items.begin( ) , items.end ( ) , print ( std : :cout ) ) ;
Something to notice : thanks to the idioms and names involved , the intent of the loop is clearer .
In fact , the loop housekeeping is hidden .
It 's irrelevant ; it does not clarify the intent .
Of course , if you do n't know STL , then what I have just said may not appear to hold water .
That too is irrelevant .
Why ?
I am writing it for an audience that can read STL .
If the reader is not in that audience , then they are not in that audience .
I am not writing it for C programmers , Visual Basic programmers , Java programmers or classic - C++ programmers .
Code is not written to be read by Everyman : it needs an audience , and will be better off for having one in mind .
Something else to notice : the code has been made more general and , in consequence , there is more up - front code to be written .
Is this a good thing ?
If the problem had been to generalise stream output as a function object , it is a fine solution ... but it was n't .
The challenge was to make the intent of the loop clearer .
Scope drift and overgeneralisation are common problems .
I happen to like the style of the print solution [ Henney2001b ] , but that 's the solution to a slightly different problem .
Let 's try again :
std::vector<std::string > items ; ... // populate items typedef std::ostream_iterator<std::string > out ; std::copy(items.begin( ) , items.end ( ) , out ( std: : cout , "
" ) ) ;
Now the code is short , without any up - front extras , and is both quite specific and sufficiently general .
This generality comes free with the standard abstractions we are using : we can work in terms of iterators independently of the container ( or non-container ) type .
We did n't have to write any extra code to achieve this generalisation , so it is a bonus .
The STL is general so that we can be specific .
To the STL literate the code captures the intent clearly and crisply .
compression
This sentence no verb .
The previous sentence is an example of compression .
It could not have been made more direct by adding anything as its structure is intimately bound up in its meaning .
In fact , its structure is its meaning .
Taking time out to add things would only weaken it and miss the point entirely .
This is compression ; it is about intent , it is about sufficiency , and it is about time it was considered a valuable property of code .
It is not a question of style versus substance : the style is the substance .
So what is the relationship between compression and that other popular code quality , abstraction ?
Well , first of all , what is abstraction ?
Jim Coplien 's response  " Abstraction is evil "  is perhaps provocative , but it is certainly thought provoking [ Milne2001 ] .
Jim Coplien can be found wielding this soundbite at many a conference .
It is a reaction to the devaluation the word has suffered  abstraction has just become another word for good , just another hype term  and an invitation to consider compression in contrast to abstraction .
In misuse , abstraction is often used as a hand wave to avoid necessary detail and specifics in the consideration of detailed code with a specific purpose .
" Abstraction is evil " is also a soundbite , and all soundbites are abstractions  a self - referential irony not lost on Cope .
More conventional answers to the question include " selective ignorance " and " omission of unnecessary detail " which are , like the title of this article and Cope 's slogan , fine soundbites , but are framed in the negative and are somewhat lacking in detail .
Useful iconic forms that act as placeholders for deeper understanding , but on their own are essentially useless for motivating or informing actual development .
Unlike technology , any advice that is insufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic .
Dijkstra offers perhaps the best motivation behind abstraction [ Dijkstra1972 ] :
In this connection it might be worthwhile to point out that the purpose of abstraction is not to be vague , but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise .
Compare this with Dick Gabriel 's description of compression [ Gabriel1996 ] : Compression is the characteristic of a piece of text that the meaning of any part of it is " larger " than the piece has by itself .
This is accomplished by the context being rich and each part of the text drawing on that context  each word draws part of its meaning from its surroundings .
A familiar example outside programming is poetry whose heavily layered meanings can seem dense because of the multiple images it generates and the way each new image or phrase draws from several of the others .
Thus compression complements abstraction , but is not necessarily its opposite .
Compression is often a result of appropriate identification and application of abstractions .
In other words , abstraction considered as an artefact rather than as a process .
For example , STL iterators and iterator ranges are abstractions .
As we have seen , iterators can result in compression ... or not .
The difference comes from the " appropriate identification and application " .
Even good abstractions will not automatically bless your code with clarity and grace .
We are back to intent and design : compression and abstraction are not just about leaving bits out , they are about expressing yourself with a directness , strength and clarity that could not necessarily be achieved by other means .
They are about effect , but without drama or melodrama .
Consider an alternative abstraction to iterators for position : integers as indices .
These work fine for array - like containers , such as std :: vector or std :: deque , but are quite inappropriate for linked lists or content - based containers , such as std :: list and std: :map .
And fully beyond their grasp is the ability to represent access to non-containers meaningfully , such as iteration over streams .
As an example , the common task of counting words in a text file or stream can be reduced to a single statement of executable C++ code [ Henney2001c ] when built on the appropriate abstractions :
typedef std::istream_iterator<std::string > in ; std::cout << std::distance(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) ) ;
Want to count characters instead ?
typedef std::istreambuf_iterator<char > in ; std::cout << std::distance(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) ) ;
Or lines ?
typedef std::istreambuf_iterator<char > in ; std::cout << std::count(in(std::cin ) , in ( ) , '
' ) ;
These fragments are all compact and fluffless , crisp and essential .
STL iterators are not the only appropriate abstraction ; different abstractions give rise to dissimilar constructs that can be similarly elegant and direct .
For example , language support for closures  such as block objects and lambda functions found in Smalltalk , L ISP , Ruby , Python and others  gives rise to an alternative , inverted enumeration method style of iteration [ Beck1997 ] .
With anonymous inner classes this style can be mimicked in Java , although not as cleanly and effectively as one might wish .
In C++ the convenience of this alternative style is inaccessible , although such inversion of control flow can still have a role to play .
In all fields of communication we must recognise the importance of idiom .
Compression appeals to common idiom ( e.g. the use of the + operator to represent addition or concatenation ) without resorting either to private language ( e.g. # define your own ' keywords ' and certain bizarre applications of operator overloading ) or to lowest common denominator baby talk  do n't write code for novices unless you are writing code for novices .
Operator overloading is a case in point : the fact that some people misuse it was the motivation for leaving it out of Java ; the fact that it is also used to make code clearer and briefer was ignored .
An example of solving the wrong problem that has disappointingly left Java with weaker powers of abstraction and compression for value - based concepts than either its immediate family , C++ and C# , or indeed scripting languages such as Ruby and Python .
The effect of operator overloading , or the effect of its absence , is particularly noticeable when working with objects of numeric , date or currency type .
Consider the merits of a + b - c versus a.add( b).subtract(c ) .
I do n't really want to focus on language design except where it significantly affects programmer expressiveness .
It is worth pointing out that children generally understand the use of - for subtraction before they can spell subtraction .
What happens to them between the years of early schooling and taking up a job as a programmer is anyone 's guess , but experience suggests that their ability to comprehend arithmetic operators does not fall below their ability to spell .
The utility of operator overloading has been recognised and perhaps this convenience will be added to Java in the future [ Gosling ] .
On inappropriate use of overloading there is also a lot you can say .
To counterbalance the elegance and minimalism of the STL one has to look no further in C++ than std::auto_ptr .
A triumph of subtlety over expectation , of obscurity over clarity .
Ordinary copying semantics make no sense for auto_ptr , so what look like copying operations  the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator  have been overloaded misleadingly as move operations [ Hyslop2001 ] .
Fundamentally different semantics dressed in sheep 's clothing .
For the problem being solved , this has led to a ridiculously complex and narrow design that has proven to be a hotspot for specification errors .
However , auto_ptr alone does not build a sufficient case for rejection of overloading in any of its forms .
It instead emphasises the necessity of respect for idiom : the distinction between feature and usage , mechanism and method .
Compression is neither an invitation to write WORN code ( Write Once , Read Never ) nor an incitement to write tightly coupled goo .
Quite the opposite .
The density arises from necessity , sufficiency and expression .
The result is a certain brevity , which " is a by - product of vigor " [ Strunk +2000 ] , the result of making it stronger .
Brevity is categorically not the same as obfuscation [ Henney 1995 ] : it should be no shorter than is strictly necessary .
If it looks like line noise  and you 're familiar with the language  then it's too short .

WASHINGTON  Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to closing the detention center for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay and moving some of the detainees to prisons on U.S. soil , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds .
By more than 2 - 1 , those surveyed say Guantanamo should n't be closed .
By more than 3 - 1 , they oppose moving some of the accused terrorists housed there to prisons in their own states .
The findings underscore the difficult task President Obama faces in convincing those at home that he should follow through on his campaign promise to close the prison in Cuba , especially in the absence of a plan of where the prisoners would go .
In many parts of the world , however , Gitmo has become a symbol of U.S. arrogance and abuse , and Obama has cited its closure as a way to lay the foundation for better relations .
He is scheduled to deliver a major address aimed at the Muslim world on Thursday from Cairo .
It is one of the few subjects on which most Americans side with the views of the Bush administration over its successor .
" Coming up on eight years after Sept. 11 , fear remains , and fear is politically potent , " says political scientist Paul Freedman of the University of Virginia , who studies public opinion .
" When it comes to the issue of terrorism … people are inclined to err on the side of that fear . "
Former vice president Dick Cheney said Monday that Obama made " a mistake " in promising to close the facility by the end of the year .
" I think it 's going to be very difficult , " he said at a National Press Club luncheon , given the reluctance of U.S. allies and citizens to accept its prisoners .
" These are bad actors .
These are the worst of the worst . "
In a speech last month , Obama said the nation 's " Supermax " prisons could be relied on to hold detainees .
Government lawyers are reviewing the status of the 240 prisoners at Guantanamo to determine whether they should be tried in federal court or before a military tribunal , released overseas or held without trial .
In the survey , Americans were inclined to accept the argument by Cheney and former president George W. Bush that the detention center had made the United States safer .
By 40 % - 18 % , they said the prison had strengthened national security rather than weakened it .
Those who want the prison to remain open feel more strongly on the subject that those who want to close it .
A 54 % majority of those polled say the prison should n't be closed , and that they 'll be upset if the administration moves forward to close it .
Last month , Senate Democrats stripped $ 80 million to close Gitmo from a spending bill and blocked transfer of detainees to U.S. soil , at least for now .
The survey of 1,015 adults , which was taken by landline and cellphone Friday through Sunday , has a margin of error of +/– 3 percentage points .

Multiple sclerosis patient Debbie Purdy has won her battle to have the UK ’s law on assisted suicide clarified .
The House of Lords – Britain ’s highest court – has ruled that it must now be specified when a person might face prosecution .
The 46 - year - old had her husband in mind ; to protect him should he eventually help her end her life .
“ All five [ Lords ] said the Director of Public Prosecutions has got to be clear and that British law has got to be understood , ” said Debbie Purdy .
British law says helping someone to commit suicide is a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison .
But since 1992 about 100 British citizens have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland .
The ruling is being seen as a legal turning point but others fear it could lead to more prosecutions by removing flexibility within the law .

Zombies are invading your home , and the only defense is your arsenal of plants !
Armed with 49 zombie - zapping plants like peashooters and cherry bombs , you 'll need to think fast and plant faster to stop 26 types of zombies dead in their tracks .
Obstacles like a setting sun , creeping fog and a swimming pool add to the challenge , and with five game modes to dig into , the fun never dies !
Key Features :
There was a time not so long ago when authors never had to worry about handing in their manuscripts on time .
Deadlines back then were a formality — something publishers took about as seriously in the course of contractual negotiations as they did the profit - and - loss statements they used to justify their acquisitions .
If an author hit their delivery date , great !
But if they did n’t , that was O.K. , too .
For the most part , that is still true .
But as book sales fall and publishing houses look for ways to cut costs , many literary agents are growing increasingly worried that publishers looking to trim their lists will start holding authors to deadlines and using lateness as an occasion to renegotiate advances and , in some cases , terminate contracts altogether .
“ Publishers are looking at their books and saying , ‘ O.K. , this book is two years late .
Do we want it anymore ? ’ ” said Eric Simonoff , an agent at WME Entertainment .
“ If the answer is no , they ’re saying , ‘ We do n’t want it anymore — we ’re calling our loan . ’ ”
He went on : “ Sometimes people have buyer ’s remorse , and it ’s a very convenient way of rectifying your buyer ’s remorse after the fact .
It ’s safe to say that delivery dates are more meaningful now than they ever have been before .
I think everyone ’s putting their clients on notice and saying , ‘ This is serious . ’ ”
Most publishers are well acquainted with the feeling of regret that comes with realizing that a book they signed up years ago is no longer worth publishing .
Sometimes this happens because the subject of the book has become irrelevant or the market for it has become oversaturated .
Sometimes it happens because the editor who bought it has left or been fired .
Other times it ’s because the sum that was paid for the book at the point of acquisition has come to seem exorbitant and ridiculous .
Historically , such regrets have led to action only in rare circumstances , as the practice of canceling contracts has been regarded in the industry as supremely unsavory and damaging .
Publishers by and large have been unwilling to risk earning a reputation among literary agents as being mercurial and untrustworthy .
( To this day , agents bristle when reminded of the great purge of HarperCollins , when in the summer of 1997 CEO Anthea Disney ordered 100 books canceled in an effort to “ clean house . ” )
But like so many other practices associated with the “ gentleman ’s business ” that the book business used to be , eating advances in the service of good humor has become a luxury most publishers do not indulge in as readily as they once did .
“ What has happened is that in the cold light of morning , publishers are looking at all these expensive deals they made based on the inflated marketplace , and now the bill is coming due and they do n’t want the contracts anymore , ” said one top agent , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ I buttoned up all my contracts — I amended all of them way before the due dates came .
Once the author delivers on time , then the publisher has to find something unacceptable in form and content , and that ’s a much more serious thing to do .
At that point there ’s a whole process that they have to go through , and it ’s much more challenging for them to find something in breach . ”
As a result , authors are under unprecedented pressure from their agents to stay on schedule .
Most of the literary agents interviewed for this article said they have tried to impress on their clients that if they want to make sure they do n’t lose their contracts and find themselves having to pay back an advance that in many cases they ’ve already spent , they had better be vigilant about turning their manuscripts in on time .
“ I do n’t want my authors to be in that situation , so I ’ve been reminding them all year long to not treat their deadlines lightly , ” said the independent agent David Kuhn .
“ Everyone ’s paying attention to their contracted deadlines more than they used to , for sure — at least publishers are , and therefore agents are , and therefore authors should . ”
“ Publishers are going to look at every opportunity to save money in this climate , ” said Simon Lipskar , an agent at Writers House .
“ Most of them are n’t being quite as venal as calling to cancel a day after the due date , but my standard recommendation to my authors at this time is to just deliver their books on schedule . ”
In so doing , Mr. Lipskar said , “ they remove one major contractual ‘ out ’ for the publishers . ”
None of the agents interviewed for this story would provide actual examples of late books that have been canceled recently on the basis of late delivery , even as they asserted with total confidence that the practice is becoming more common .
Many noted that cancellations are so traumatic and embarrassing for everyone involved that extra care is taken to prevent them becoming gossip fodder .
Publishers , for their part , are n’t copping to the charge ( at least not when The Observer asks them about it ) , and while many of the editors and executives reached for this story said they ’d heard about other houses canceling books because they were late , all of them emphasized that they themselves had not been party to any such incidents .
Speaking on background , though , one publishing executive at a New York house confirmed agents ’ fears , saying that authors — especially those without a rock - solid reputation — must be conscientious about honoring their contracts if they want to avoid the possibility of having to pay back their advance .
“ People ruin their writing careers by not taking this stuff seriously , ” the executive said .
“ Usually they decide to take legal advice from some friend who says the publisher will never ask for the money back .
Well , they frequently do .
And nowadays , repaying the publisher is going to be harder , because a writer ca n’t get the money from Condé Nast .
Now is the time for you to be really nice to your publisher . ”
The executive said the best thing authors who are having trouble can do is be honest with their editors about their progress ( or lack thereof ) , thus avoiding a situation in which a publisher has budgeted for a book on the assumption that it would come in on time .
“ Even if you ’re late , be collaborative and communicative , ” the executive said .
“ We just need to know what ’s going on , and if it ’s not coming , we need to know .
Because , you know what , sometimes people have trouble , and we can help .
But often when authors know they ’re late and they know they ’re in trouble , they hide .
And that ’s exactly the wrong thing to do . ”
Of course , authors with established track records and promising projects in the works do n’t have much to worry about .
Spiegel & Grau wo n’t be dropping Sara Gruen ’s long - delayed Ape House anytime soon , just as Doubleday was never going to cancel Dan Brown ’s follow - up to The Da Vinci Code .
As Mr. Simonoff said , “ The reality is , you do n’t have to worry about lateness if they want your book .
You only have to worry about lateness if they do n’t . ”

Arresting a dealer may lead to a power vacuum , the think tank says Drugs policing should switch focus to tackling the related violence rather than simply making seizures and arrests , a think tank report has said .
Raids can cause unforeseen problems , like turf wars , and a " smarter " policy is needed to protect communities , the UK Drug Policy Commission says .
Critics say tolerating dealing could " write off " some neighbourhoods .
The Home Office said : " Harm reduction underpins every element of our approach to tackling this complex issue . "
The commission 's chief executive Roger Howard insisted it was not calling for police to " tolerate " drug dealing but said they should target the most harmful drug activity .
" We are saying ... do n't be misdirected by just focusing on arrests and seizures .
That just tells you how busy the police are , it does n't tell you what impact they are having .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " Some drug markets are very violent , very harmful to local communities [ who ] are living under the cosh , " said Mr Howard .
Instead , the commission wants forces to focus on tackling issues like gun violence , sexual exploitation and use of children as look - outs or couriers .
It suggests forcing drug dealers away from residential areas , where children play and people may get intimidated , to areas like industrial estates .
This , it says , would not reduce the amount of drug dealing but would lessen its impact .
Trial schemes in Britain to offer low - level dealers treatment and support as an alternative to prosecution could be extended , it adds .
However , former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith , who founded the Centre for Social Justice think tank , said current drugs strategy was " a mess " .
He said allowing police to decide which communities most needed support , while tolerating dealing elsewhere , would leave other neighbourhoods " written off " .
" It follows like night follows day that the worst elements of people then arrive in that community and deal , " he said .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the " enormous " rise in cocaine use last year showed the " negligible " impact of current policy .
" We need to focus on what works to reduce the damage done by drug abuse , " he added .
' Power vacuum '
The commission accepts that police , together with the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) , are already trying to assess and tackle the problems the drug trade causes communities .
It claims a survey of 427 police and other enforcement agency staff provides support for its case to change focus .
About 90 % of respondents said it was " unlikely " the UK drug market would be wiped out in the near future .
Only 21 % said current targets - relating to arrests and seizures - were a good measure of the harms caused by dealing .
While the commission accepts limiting supply is important , its report claims that in the UK 's entrenched drugs markets , arrests can lead to damaging unintended consequences .
For example , the arrested dealer may be replaced by someone who is more violent .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If the right choice is to let drug dealing happen then the law should be changed to allow this Paul Banacks Arresting one king - pin drug dealer also raises the possibility of creating a power vacuum , with the resulting turf war and spike in violence , says the report .
Humberside Chief Constable Tim Hollis , the Association of Chief Police Officers ' drugs spokesman , said the police 's commitment to neighbourhood policing reflected a " desire to listen to community concerns and take action that will contribute towards improving the lives of local people " .
Soca director of intelligence David Bolt said impact on communities was already being taken into account .
He acknowledged " an intelligent combination of traditional law enforcement alongside new and innovative approaches " was needed to tackle the harm caused by the drugs trade .
The Home Office said " tough enforcement is a fundamental part " of their strategy but also acknowledged the complexity of the problem .
A spokesman said : " We are not complacent ; communities do not want to be blighted by the effects of drug misuse and drug dealing .
" That is why police , local authorities and communities must continue to work together so that our streets and communities can be free from the crime and anti-social behaviour they cause . "

I ’ve recently entered the beta for an upcoming DotA ( almost - ) clone called Heroes of Newerth ( HoN ) when I discovered through reddit giving away 100 of ’em for the most absurd names ( I submitted the Flying Spaghetti Monster of course ) .
I always wanted to play the DotA experience but I did n’t have Warcraft3 available and Demigod is quite different from it ( and a bit disappointing as well ) .
Plus , having a native GNU / Linux client was an offer I could n’t resist . 😉
But what does this have to do with the title above ?
Well one of the main issues that DotA has is the sheer number of elitist assholes who heave tons of abuse at people trying to learn the ropes or even just do n’t play perfectly .
I am talking total nerd - rage here .
Unfortunately , this mentality seems to have migrated to the HoN community , most likely because it ’s been marketed as the intellectual sequel to DotA ( Items and Heroes are almost the same ) .
While this general level of fucktardery is not such a big issue in a free mod such as DotA , for a commercial game with developers to pay and with big plans for the future , it might make or break their life - expectancy .
The less people that are interested in nurturing and increasing their “ newbie scene ” , the less people will stick around until they wo n’t be at a level where they suffer abuse simply for not having climbed the ( very steep ) learning curve .
As I was reading similar sentiments from other people in the fora , I got to thinking on how those who would like to help new players might overcome this obstacle and alleviate , if not reduce the rampart dickwadery .
While technical solutions might be proposed and coded , such as improving the match - making system , I think the solution lies in direct action and cooperation from the community .
Of course the community cannot take very good action without the game presenting at least some tools to combat the problem , which is incidentally why the DotA community is what it is .
Fortunately , even at this beta stage , the game has some controls that could be used for such purposes .
Permaban and Ignore .
If I understand the first one correctly , one can mark a specific account as always banned from games one hosts .
Ignore just …well , ignores chat messages from a particular player .
So how can these two be used for self - moderation ?
My idea was through a blacklist .
Lets say that a known newbie - friendly player ( lets call him / her a ‘ Mentor ’ ) while playing in a newb - only game , discovers that one of his team members is constantly ranting and cursing at the others for being worthless , n00bs , sucky and whatnot .
The Mentor then , grabs a few screencaps or a replay as evidence of this and adds the dickwad ’s alias to a blacklist he maintains .
This can be as simply as a blog with each new post being about a particular dickwad and a full list in a prominent location .
Now all the other people who have a likewise mentality , ie they like to promote a healthier community are subscribed to this blacklist .
Each time a new person is added to it , people judge the evidence and if solid , they add this account to their permaban and ignore lists .
If just a 10 % of the HoN people are subscribed to this blacklist , then the abusive players are going to quickly start running into problems joining games or talking to people .
The effects of this tactic would be akin to peer pressure in a normal social situation .
Suddenly the dickwads are going to find out that being a jerk online has some drawbacks .
Hopefully some might reconsider as generally , not being a dickwad is not so difficult .
They should be then given a chance to take themselves out of the blacklist ( probation time ? ) and who knows , maybe they ’ll join the other side for a change .
So why is this better than simply using system based changes ?
Well first of all because no programmed system is perfect , especially at catching such vague concepts as dickwadery .
Matchmaking may not work well enough and options to mark others as abusive ( say via a game function like permaban ) may in turn be abused themselves for griefing purposes .
On the other hand , a self - moderated solution avoids these issues .
Let ’s say for example that someone was added to the dickwads blacklist but some think this was wrong .
Perhaps his frustration was warranted , or there is not enough evidence and whatnot .
What would probably happen is that not all subscribers to the blacklist would add him as they would n’t feel he deserves it .
As such his “ pain ” would be much less .
Dialogue will be also had and perhaps more evidence requested .
Lets have another example where the Mentor goes on a power trip and starts adding people he does n’t like to the blacklist without evidence just because he expects to be trusted .
Seeing as this is not anything official , nothing would prevent people from calling him out on this , a new blacklist forked from the old under the supervision of another Mentor or even a collaboration of them and the old Mentor might quickly find himself in a prominent position in the new blacklist .
All of these then are ideas that might work to allow a game community to self - moderate itself to a healthy environment which is conductive to new people joining , without requiring any authoritarian measures on the part of the developers or the moderators .
Rather it would be based on direct action by the members themselves and as such far less prone to corruption , who would then get the community they deserve .
Who knows ,
If I stick around with HoN once it comes out ( curse my short attention span ) I might actually start this for the heck of it .
Just to see if a purely community driven initiative can make a difference .
It would be an interest test to put some of my principles under . 😉

Spring has come to recession - era America , which means that all across the nation , millions of old people are emerging from hibernation and hobbling out to their mailboxes in search of their long - awaited Social Security stimulus checks .
The first round of payments provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has just been mailed out .
So while the big banks may be raking in their trillions , U.S. elders–along with recipients of SSI and veterans ’ benefits –will soon have a whopping $ 250 to protect them from the ravages of the economic meltdown .
And it looks like we ’d better make it last , since it ’s the only increase we ’re likely to see for a long , long time .
For the first time in more than 30 years , according to forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office , there will be no cost - of - living adjustment ( COLA ) to Social Security next year .
In fact , because of low inflation , there probably wo n’t be a COLA before 2013 .
And it might not stop there , since the straw man of Social Security “ reform ” is yet again raising his scruffy head .
The phony crusade to “ save ” Social Security from bankrupting the country and destroying the lives of our grandchildren has gained new traction during the recession .
This manufactured crisis is already being used by conservatives ( apparently with some cooperation from the Democrats ) in a quest to cut old age entitlements –in effect taking money away from elders to pay for the Wall Street bailout .
A report released by the Trustees for Social Security and Medicare will surely add fuel to this manmade fire .
The report projects that the Social Security system will remain solvent for “ only ” 28 years –downgraded from 32 years in the previous report–due to a reduction in payments into the system ’s trust fund as a result of the recession ’s job losses .
This means that in terms of solvency , the giant government program is still running 28 years ahead of Citibank , Bank of America , and the other behemoth private financial institutions run by the high - paid geniuses of Wall Street ( and much longer , if you count the years when the bubble was expanding ) .
In addition , the Social Security trust fund is still in better shape than it was a decade ago , according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .
None of this , of course , will stop proponents of entitlement cuts from brandishing the new trustees ’ report as a weapon .
Within hours of the report ’s release , a new post on the Cato Institute ’s blog was warning that it “ shows that the program ’s financial crisis is growing worse while Congress has continued to duck the issue . ”
As for the proposed solution–even the financial meltdown that has decimated all of our 401 ( k ) s is not enough to avert Cato from its true agenda :
critics of personal accounts for Social Security have pointed to the decline in the stock market over the last few years as an argument against allowing younger workers to privately invest a portion of their Social Security taxes .
Yet as the new Trustee ’s Report shows , the same poor economy that hurts the stock market , hurts Social Security ’s ability to pay its benefits .
In the end , there are only three possible solutions to Social Security ’s problems .
Taxes could be raised ( and the Social Security payroll tax would have to be nearly doubled to keep the program afloat ) .
Benefits could be cut .
Or younger workers could be allowed to invest privately .
And there we have it :
In two easy steps , we ’ve returned to the most cherished –and most discredited –domestic policy objective of the Bush Administration , the privatization of Social Security .
The real worry now , however , is n’t the likes of Cato , but the Democrats ’ apparent willingness to succumb to the heated rhetoric of the phony crisis .
Obama has several times made references to “ entitlement reform . ”
And as Roll Call reported last week :
In a year already jam - packed with major legislative initiatives , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) is breathing new life into the idea of tackling Social Security reform … .
Hoyer signaled that Democratic leaders may take steps to act on Social Security reform in the fall after Congress advances its two biggest priorities : health care reform and climate change legislation .
“ Of our entitlement programs , I believe we would have the easiest challenge in reforming Social Security , ” Hoyer said .
“ Frankly , I believe Social Security is not very difficult mathematically .
It may be difficult politically , but not mathematically . ”
The Washington Post confirmed that Hoyer is looking to create ” a bipartisan consensus ” for “ overhauling the Social Security system . ”
Democrats , the Post reported , ” have found a willing partner in the Senate , ” where South Carolina ’s Lindsey Graham “ has stated his desire to work with President Obama to make changes to keep Social Security solvent . ”
Even Graham , a longtime supporter of Social Security privatization , is now admitting that dog wo n’t hunt .
Instead , he presents Social Security reform as a “ math problem ” : “ You can do a combination of things , give a little here and give a little there , and get it done , ” he said .
Anyone who supports the program that lifted millions of elders out of poverty should be concerned by the ongoing disconnect between the “ reform ” rhetoric and Social Security ’s actual fiscal soundness–and by where it all might lead .
Following Hoyer ’s announcement , the National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare commented :
given the long list of critical challenges this nation faces right now …it ’s hard to imagine why Social Security would share space at the top of the legislative priority list .
… Some worry Social Security will be used as a bargaining chip in the healthcare debate , others see this as part of ongoing efforts to balance the budget through entitlement program cuts .
William Greider , in his comprehensive takedown of the Social Security insolvency myth , issued a more explicit warning :
Governing elites in Washington and Wall Street have devised a fiendishly clever “ grand bargain ” they want President Obama to embrace in the name of “ fiscal responsibility . ”
The government , they argue , having spent billions on bailing out the banks , can recover its costs by looting the Social Security system .
By now , we ’re all used to witnessing these kinds of bait - and - switch tactics .
But according to yet another Washington myth , we ’re not supposed to see them coming from the Democrats .

Erupting Volcano Anak Krakatau
Credit & Copyright : Marco Fulle ( Stromboli Online )
Explanation : A volcano on Krakatoa is still erupting .
Perhaps most famous for the powerfully explosive eruption in 1883 that killed tens of thousands of people , ash from a violent eruption might also have temporarily altered Earth 's climate as long as 1500 years ago .
In 1927 , eruptions caused smaller Anak Krakatau to rise from the sea , and the emerging volcanic island continues to grow at an average rate of 2 cm per day .
The latest eruption of Anak Krakatau started in 2008 April and continues today .
In this picture , Anak Krakatau is seen erupting from Rakata , the main island of the Krakatoai group .

The daytime protests across the Islamic republic have been largely peaceful .
But Iranians shudder at the violence unleashed in their cities at night , with the shadowy vigilantes known as Basijis beating , looting and sometimes gunning down protesters they tracked during the day .
The vigilantes plan to take their fight into the daylight on Friday , with the public relations department of Ansar Hezbollah , the most public face of the Basij , announcing that they planned a public demonstration to expose the “ seditious conspiracy ” being carried out by “ agitating hooligans . ”
“ We invite the vigilant people who are always in the arena to make their loud objections heard in response to the babbling of this tribe , ” said the announcement , carried on the Web site Parsine .
The announcement could be the first indication that the government was taking its gloves off , Iranian analysts noted , because up to this point the Basijis , usually deployed as the shock troops to end any public protests , have been working in stealth .
Panel wants openly gay guardsman discharged Military
SAN FRANCISCO , CA - JUNE 28 : Celebrity Grand Marshals Lt. Dan Choi , a graduate of West Point and Actress Cloris Leachman takes part in the 39th annual gay pride parade June 28 , 2009 in San Francisco , California .
The parade drew hundreds of thousands of people to downtown San Francisco to celebrate gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender pride .

A military review panel recommended Tuesday that National Guard Lt. Dan Choi , the gay Arabic translator who became a national figure in fighting the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy after declaring his sexuality on television , be discharged from the service .
The four - member Federal Recognition Board of Army officers in Syracuse , N.Y. , had no recommendation Tuesday for how the 28 - year - old should be discharged .
It 's recommendation that the Army no longer recognize Choi as an officer must be approved by the First Army commander and the chief of the National Guard Bureau before Choi would be discharged .
Choi's attorney , Maj . Roy Diehl , said the process could take weeks or up to a year .
For now , Diehl said Choi , who was a grand marshal in Sunday 's Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco , will " continue drilling " with his New York National Guard unit .
Tuesday 's decision was especially painful to gay leaders after watching President Obama preach patience Monday at a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots that are considered the birth of the modern gay rights movement .
" I know that every day that passes without a resolution is a deep disappointment to those men and women who continue to be discharged under this policy - patriots who often possess critical language skills and years of training and who 've served this country well , " Obama said Monday .
He had continually pledged to overturn the law as a candidate .
" But what I hope is that these cases underscore the urgency of reversing this policy not just because it 's the right thing to do but because it is essential for our national security , " Obama said .
On Tuesday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Pentagon lawyers are trying to make the law more flexible until it is changed .
" And the issue that we face is , how do we begin to do preparations and , simultaneously , the administration move forward in asking the Congress to change the law ? "
Gates said .
Still , some analysts say Choi 's case is another example of how Washington leaders are n't showing much urgency - or leadership - in overturning " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
Obama has said he wants Congress to overturn the law ; congressional leaders have said that they are waiting for the president to take the lead ; and military leaders say they wo n't change the policy unless directed by Congress .
" It 's a hot - potato party , " said Nathaniel Frank , a research fellow at the Palm Center , a UC Santa Barbara think tank .
" Democrats have the mistaken impression that if they lead on something that smells like a culture war issue - or if they go against the military - they will get pounded .
But that 's not true .
Public opinion is with them . "
Last month , a Gallup Poll found that 69 percent of Americans would " favor allowing openly gay men and lesbian women to serve in the military " - up six percentage points from November 2004 .
The survey found that 58 percent of conservatives and 60 percent of weekly churchgoers felt the same way .
The Obama administration does n't want to repeat the mistakes of the Clinton administration , which took a major political beating when it tried to fulfill its campaign promise of overturning the gays - in - the - military ban shortly after Bill Clinton took office in 1993 , political analysts say .
That year , 44 percent of respondents to a Washington Post - ABC News poll said those who are openly gay should be allowed to serve in the military .
Choi became a national spokesman for gay rights when he said " I am gay " on Rachel Maddow 's MSNBC show in March .
At Tuesday 's hearing , he presented 150 letters and more than 250,000 signatures on a petition supporting him .

In targeted attacks , we 're see more and more attempts to obfuscate the hostname of the server to which the backdoors are connecting .
IT staff in many of the targeted organizations are fully aware of these attacks .
They keep monitoring their logs for suspicious activity .

A little dog has made a great big impression on many people around the country over the past few days .
Lilly , a charming Chihuahua - terrier mix , was born in North Carolina along with several other siblings .
But Lilly was born with something extra , a fifth leg .
Otherwise healthy , Lilly ’s extra rear leg would hang and drag , making it difficult for her to walk .
Her story caught the attention of a freak show promoter from Coney Island , New York .
John Strong , owner of the Freaks of Nature show , paid a $ 1,000 deposit for the pup , according to reports .
But when animal lover Allyson Siegel heard about the pending puppy ’s plight , she contacted the owner and paid $ 4,000 out of her own pocket for the puppy , sparing “ Precious ” a sad life in a freakish sideshow .
The Charlotte resident renamed the precious pooch Lilly .
Allyson is not the only person moved by this touching story of the tiny little dog .
The Charlotte community stepped up with a fundraiser and raffle to raise money and help defray costs incurred by Allyson .
And Dr. Neil Shaw , from the NYC Veterinary Specialists in Manhattan , heard about the story and volunteered to remove the pup ’s leg , at no cost .

After all the hoopla , little Lilly underwent a 90 - minute surgical procedure on Thursday to remove her extra leg and is recovering nicely .
And for the very first time in her young life , she can run and jump like any other four - legged pooch .
But freak show owner , Strong , is allegedly demanding the amputated leg be frozen in order for reattachment , according to a report from AMNY , and may be considering legal action .
Siegel plans to give Lilly to her twin sister , once the stitches are removed .
To find out more about Lilly ’s condition or see more of her in action , visit YouTube .
Update : John Strong has filed a $ 4,000 lawsuit against original owner Cavlin Owensby and the case is headed for TV court .
Judge Jeanine Pirro will hear the case and the show is expected to air September 21st , 2009 .

Before Paying More for the Brand Name
I wo n’t drink coffee unless it ’s from Starbucks .
They just make a better product .
Branding is very important in the retail business , because you can charge more per product and still outsell your competition .
When I was a salesperson and making long drives in an unknown city , I would always stop by a Starbucks whenever I ’m tired .
It ’s not that I thought the coffee was a notch above the rest either .
It was just that the experience was consistent and predictable .
I knew the setting , I knew what I wanted , how much it would cost and the product that I was getting .
If I went to local coffee shops , the predictability stops .
Do they sell ice coffees ?
Are credit cards accepted ?
Is it going to be too sweet ?
Sure , I can be adventurous , but I was n’t in the right mood after a full day of meetings and driving .
Is it worth the hassle when my main goal is to have good sales meetings ?
Not really .
Branding is an art - form that millions study .
With careful and clever advertising , consumers can be lured into paying ridiculously high prices for a certain product that cost nothing to produce .
Think of those t- shirts that cost 50 cents to make , or an pair of shoes that cost nothing more than a few dollars to produce .
As a consumer , brand name is expensive .
Yet , many of us will gladly pay extra for it .
Knowing when it ’s worth it really comes down to personal choices , but before you shell out another dollar of your hard earn cash , think of these few factors before you give the cashier the chance to ask “ credit or debit ? ”
Consumable vs Everlasting –
Is the product everlasting ( like a watch ) or is it really just a consumable ( like coffee ) ?
Is it really worth paying twice as much to consume a product that will be forgotten in 45 minutes ?
The Price Difference – Obviously , a $ 2 difference is n’t the same as $ 500 , but do you actually know how much the alternatives cost ?
Design and Value – Some products just lose value as time goes on .
Fashion and gadgets come to mind .
If this season ’s color is purple and you are still buying clothes that are silver and gold , you are a little out - dated .
Importance to You – Some of you probably rolled your eyes when I talked about the color nonsense , while others will completely agree .
Like I said , it ’s all a personal choice , because different people value products differently .
I could n’t care less whether I ’m wearing a red t- shirt or a blue sweater ( I could n’t even tell you what I ’m currently wearing ) , but paying more for the latest iPhone versus the other version is important to me ( if I was getting one ) .
Know what ’s important to you , and the decision becomes much more natural .
I Need More Help Deciding
Still stumped about whether you should pay more for it ?
Here are several ways to help you decide .
Bring an Expert – People who are really into fashion know that a Louis Vuitton hand bag is hand stitched and can last many years more than a regular no name brand .
Other brands of clothing use high quality garment that also helps it last for years .
Once you know the real differences , you can decide whether there ’s value in the higher price tag .
Add Ignorance – Another trick is to bring someone who has no interest in the product you are considering .
By not having the bias towards any brand , your friend can see quality with a much more objective eye .
Ask Around – Look for other people ’s opinion about a product .
Is it really all hype or is the higher price justified ?
My New “ No Name Brand ” Sunglasses
I finally ordered my pair of new glasses because my glasses popped out again ( this time , it happened while I was driving so that ’s the end of waiting . ) .
At first , I went to a store and the sales person kept pushing me high end spectacles .
After looking around for a while , I tried on a pair that I really liked , and it happened to be 20 % of what the other pairs cost .
I was so happy .
I forgot how pleasurable it was to find something I like at a price that ’s much lower than expected .
It was n’t a brand name , but it was just as nice , just as functional and best of all , it was much cheaper .
Think carefully before you pay for another brand name .
Prescription Medication and Nutrient Depletion
I came across an interesting study done in 2005 in Minnesota showing an increase in the use of prescription drugs as one ages .
The survey results are staggering .
Two - thirds of seniors in their 50’s are on prescription medication and the numbers get worse as one ages .
So those of us who are not on any prescription drugs are in the minority .
Drugs can produce undesirable and even tragic results , but we do n’t think often about the nutrients they deplete .

Bethlehem � Ma�an � Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will not remove its
West bank separation wall , rejecting a reported demand from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
" The separation fence will remain in place and will not be dismantled , " Netanyahu told members of Israel�s parliament , the Knesset , according to the newspaper Haaretz .
He also called the concrete barrier " a critical component of Israel 's security . "
Israeli media reported on Wednesday that Abbas� Palestinian Authority ( PA ) had relayed to US President Barack Obama a demand that the wall be removed since the security situation in the West Bank had improved .
The report appeared on the front page of the Hebrew - language Ma�ariv daily .
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters he had brought up the issue to the US .
" The Israelis know that the wall adds to the complexities .
It 's part of the problem and not part of the solution , " he was quoted as saying .
Netanyahu claimed that the reverse was true : " I hear they are saying today that because it 's quiet , it 's possible to take down the fence .
My friends , the opposite is true ...
It 's quiet because a fence exists . "
Designed to be more than 700 kilometers in length , the wall snakes through the interior of the West Bank , looping around Israeli settlements and cutting off Palestinian access to Jerusalem .
After spending billions of dollars on construction , the wall is still not complete , and has a number of gaps , particularly in the south .
Palestinians see the barrier as yet another method of confiscating land .
Residents of a number of Palestinian communities demonstrate every Friday against it .
Ab dem 1 . Juli sollten Computer in China nur noch mit der Filtersoftware Green Dam ausgeliefert werden dürfen .
Jetzt hat das Ministerium für Industrie und Informationstechnologie ( MIIT ) bekannt gegeben , dass die geforderte Installation des Jugendschutzprogramms erst einmal verschoben werde .
Laut der chinesischen Regierung sollte die Software verhindern , dass Minderjährige auf Pornografie und Gewaltdarstellungen zugreifen können .
Eltern hätten damit auch die Möglichkeit zu bestimmen , wie lange ihre Kinder online sein dürfen .
Kritisiert wurde , dass damit die Möglichkeit für politische Zensur eröffnet werde .
Überdies wurden von Wirtschaftsverbänden Zweifel an der Sicherheit , am Datenschutz und an der Systemzuverlässigkeit geäußert .
Beanstandet wurde auch , dass das Programm Berichte über die Webnutzung von einzelnen Internetusern weiterleiten kann .
Einige Unternehmen hätten erklärt , dass sie mehr Zeit bräuchten , hieß es nun zur Begründung , den Einsatz der Software vorerst auszusetzen .
Das Ministerium bietet nun ein kostenloses Download des Filterprogramms an , um damit Computer in Schulen und Internetcafes auszustatten .
Man arbeite aber weiter daran , die geplante Vorinstallation zu perfektionieren .

Boats carrying illegal migrants to Europe should be sunk Nick Griffin , the leader of the British National party , said yesterday .
In a provocative intervention , Griffin , elected to the European parliament last month , called on the EU to introduce " very tough " measures to prevent illegal migrants entering Europe from Africa .
" If there 's measures to set up some kind of force or to help , say the Italians , set up a force which actually blocks the Mediterranean then we 'd support that , " Griffin told BBC Parliament 's The Record Europe .
" But the only measure , sooner or later , which is going to stop immigration and stop large numbers of sub-Saharan Africans dying on the way to get over here is to get very tough with those coming over .
Frankly , they need to sink several of those boats .
Anyone coming up with measures like that , we 'll support , but anything which is there as a 'oh , we need to do something about it ' but in the end doing something about it means bringing them into Europe we will oppose . "
Shirin
Wheeler , the programme 's presenter , interrupted him to say the EU did not murder people .
" I did n't say anyone should be murdered at sea – I say boats should be sunk , they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya , " Griffin said .
" But Europe has , sooner or later , to close its borders or it 's simply going to be swamped by the third world . "
Griffin's comments were especially controversial because many thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempt to make the crossing to Europe on rickety boats during the summer .
Many land on Lampedusa , the Italian island less than 100 miles from Tunisia .
The BBC said 37,000 migrants landed on Italian shores last year , a 75 % increase on the year before .
Italy gave Libya three patrol boats in May to help control the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean .
The BBC reported that Roberto Maroni , the Italian interior minister , a member of the anti-immigration Northern League , had described the first 200 migrants returned to Libya as a " historic " moment .
Griffin also said the BNP failed to form an alliance in the European parliament with parties from other EU countries .
He said talks with the French National Front and Italy 's Northern League had broken down after the Italian party decided to sit with the UK Independence party .
" No one was prepared to commit themselves knowing that we had not got [ the Northern League ] on board , " Griffin told parliament.com .
" Even so , we will continue to work together with these other groups and share ideas . "
The securitization of mortgage loans has come in for some heavy criticism since our financial crisis began .
Unfortunately , most of this criticism is way too vague to be very useful .
And since our regulators are bent on reviving the securitization market , we need a much better understanding of what went wrong .
So here it is : the top tranches of the mortgage bonds were too big .
There ’s a compelling logic to the way subprime mortgages were securitized .
Bundling thousands of mortgages into a common pool should produce a reliable stream of income because exposure to unlikely events on the downside and upside should be limited .
Geographic diversity limits exposure to housing market bubbles .
Dividing the bonds into tranches allows investors to choose their level of risk and yield .
Mixing mortgages with low prepayment risk and those with low default risk can further ameliorate interest rate risk .
These innovations are good but only if they are done right .
The tranched nature of mortgage backed securities confuses a lot of people .
How can some tranches have more risk than others ?
Importantly , the risk of default on the underlying mortgages is the same for entire pool .
But that ’s not the risk a buyer of a MBS needs to worry about .
Instead , a buyer worries about the risk to his income stream , which depends on tranching .
The senior tranches only absorbed losses after the lower tranches .
In effect , the senior tranches were built on the leverage of the lower tranches , who received higher yields in exchange for greater risk .
What went wrong is rooted in investor demand for safety over yield .
The senior tranches were far more popular than the subordinate tranches .
There are lots of explanations for this but legislative prohibitions on certain institutional investors owning non-triple A rated investment played a large role .
This put pressure on investment banks — who then pressured ratings agencies to go a long with the scheme — to enlarge the size of the senior tranches .
And when the senior tranches grew too big , they were actually becoming far riskier than many understood .
To understand how the width of the senior tranche creates risk it helps to start with a very simple mental experiment .
Imagine a situation where 90 percent of mortgages in a pool default .
Now if there were a super - senior tranche consisting of only 10 percent of the total investment in the pool , that money would be safe .
But as the senior tranche grows , its exposure to losses increases .
Historical data about mortgage defaults and prepayment risk from before 2002 seemed to justify wide senior tranches .
Unfortunately , mortgage lending after 2002 had deviated from historical norms , which turned out to make historical data misleading .
This meant that the senior tranches were too broad , they included a greater percentage of investments in the overall mortgage pool than turned out to be justified by the risk .
In short , it was n’t the complexity of MBSs or CDOs that led to their meltdown .
It was the fact that demand for safety of senior tranches was so strong — and historical data from before 2002 misleading — that the pools were widened beyond warrant .
From the Detroit Free Press : Cash - for - clunkers program to be suspended ( ht Basel Too )
The U.S. government will suspend the popular cash - for - clunkers program after less than four days in business , telling Congress that the plan would burn through its $ 950 - million budget by midnight , several sources told the Free Press .
... auto dealers may have already arranged the sale of more than the 250,000 vehicles that federal officials expected the plan to generate .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Sources tell me ( no link ) that showroom traffic jumped by about 33 % at auto dealers over the last week to about the levels of last September .
See the following graph : This graph shows the historical light vehicle sales ( seasonally adjusted annual rate ) from the BEA ( blue ) and an estimate for June ( red , light vehicle sales of 9.69 million SAAR from AutoData Corp ) .
Light vehicle sales last September ( before the collapse in October ) were at a 12.46 million SAAR .
Of course this is just one week of July at that sales rate ... and the program is now suspended .
But that means July sales will probably be over 10 million SAAR for the first time this year .
Ken O’Brien was an NFL quarterback in the 1980s and 1990s .
Early in his career , he threw a lot of interceptions , so one clever team lawyer wrote a clause into O’Brien ’s contract penalizing him for each one he threw .
The incentive worked as intended :
His interceptions plummeted .
But that ’s because he stopped throwing the ball .
Years ago , AT&T executives tried to encourage productivity by paying programmers based on the number of lines of code they produced .
The result : programs of Proustian length .
Incentives are dangerous , and not just because people game them .
They often yield collateral damage .
Remember the tale of the Darwin Award winner who strapped a jet engine to his car , dreaming of a joyride for the ages , and then met his sorry end as a human flapjack on the side of a mountain ?
Incentives are like that jet engine .
There ’s no question the engine will take you somewhere , fast , but it ’s not always clear where .
Or what you ’re going to mow down on the way .
Yet incentives are still the first resort of most managers , perhaps because they all think they ’re smart enough to create the perfect carrot .
Take Merrill Lynch .
In the book Riding the Bull , author Paul Stiles describes his experience as a new trader at the venerable investment bank .
Merrill wanted Stiles , then 29 , to trade complex international bonds in volatile markets .
He tried asking advice of the seasoned traders , but they ignored him — a minute spent helping Stiles was a minute spent not adding to their monthly bonuses .
They kept barking into their phones for hours at a time and yelled at Stiles every time his shadow fell across their computer screens .
Eventually , Stiles was reduced to silently observing their behavior from a distance , like a rogue MBA anthropologist .
It surely never dawned on the person who set up Merrill Lynch ’s incentive system that the traders ’ bonuses would make training new employees impossible .
Why are we so bad at anticipating the effects of our well - intentioned incentive plans ?
The answer has to do with something that psychologists call a “ focusing illusion . ”
Behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman and management professor David Schkade surveyed Midwestern students and asked them to predict the satisfaction of students in California on several dimensions , such as “ job prospects , ” “ climate , ” “ personal safety , ” and overall life satisfaction .
They also asked the Midwesterners to rate their own satisfaction .
The professors then posed the same questions to actual California students and compared the answers .
The Midwest students correctly predicted that the Californians would be happier about their weather .
But the Midwestern students wrongly predicted that California students would be happier with their lives in general than Midwestern students .
The overall scores are identical .
Schkade and Kahneman showed that , in essence , the Midwestern students erred by focusing too much on a single variable .
When you ’re a Midwesterner contemplating a long , cold winter , you ca n’t help but think that Californians must be happier .
But you ’re ignoring the larger happiness portfolio , in which weather recedes to insignificance among the other things that may influence a Californian ’s satisfaction — good friends , terrible traffic , career opportunities , laundry , and a governor who compulsively repeats Terminator jokes .
Focusing illusions even distort our judgments about ourselves .
In another study , some college students were asked , “ How happy are you ? ” and then “ How many dates did you have last month ? ”
The researchers found a pretty weak correlation between the level of happiness and the number of dates .
But then ( hilariously ) the researchers flipped the order of the two questions .
Suddenly , there was a strong correlation .
Having just confessed to a lack of dates , students reported that their lives were joyless .
My goal with this blog is to generate dialogue about human population and all its myriad impacts .
It will not post news items about the deteriorating global scene ( even though there is much to post ) .
Instead , I want to get people talking , thinking about this immense problem .
We desperately need to find workable solutions .

He asserted that he had never met nor supported Osama bin Laden , though he said " yes " when Mr Piro mentioned two visits to Baghdad by an al - Qaeda ideologue , Abu Hafs al Mauritani , which included requests for " tens of millions of dollars " .

News
Over the past weeks , there have been some interesting additions to the EtoileFoundation framework to provide higher - order messaging facilities .
Higher - order messaging means having ( or at least : having the illusion of having ) messages that take messages as their arguments .
This can turn out to be quite handy at times .
For example , if you are using any class that descends from NSObject , thanks to Quentin you now have a - ifResponds method at your disposal , which frees you from the fear that you might send a message to an object that it does n't understood .
Borrowing an example from Quentin 's documentation of that method , suppose you have cats and dogs in your code zoo where your Dog class implements a - bark method , but the Cat class does n't .
The following naïve approach will then cause an exception to be thrown , because cat does not respond to - bark :
[ dog bark ] ; [ cat bark ] ;
If you send the message to - ifResponds , you can make sure that this does n't happen :
[ [ dog ifResponds ] bark ] ; [ [ cat ifRepsonds ] bark ] ;
This is neat , especially when you 're sending a message to an object that might or might not implement the method but do n't care about the case that the message is not understood .
Internally you are , of course , not sending a message to a message .
- ifResponds rather returns a proxy object that , upon a message send , will forward the message to the original object if it responds to it .
Otherwise it will simply return nil .
Another example of higher - order messaging at its best is the - inNewThread method from EtoileThread , which has been around for a while .
Any message you send to this will be executed in a new thread , meaning that your programme will only block when you try to access the return value .
Sometimes it can be really nice if you do n't need to wait for a lengthy operation to complete , especially if you are a hungry cat :
[ [ dog inNewThread ] takeForALongWalk ] ; [ cat feed ] ;
Higher - Order Messaging for Collections
The other addition , which I managed to squeeze into EtoileFoundation with much help and support from David and Quentin , is higher - order messaging related to collections .
These higher - order messaging methods make it really easy to manipulate the objects in a collection .
One of them is - mappedCollection , which allows you to send messages to every object in the collection , giving you a new collection with the manipulated objects .
Since EtoileFoundation provides the useful ETCollection protocol , which aggregates the collection classes from the GNUstep / Cocoa Foundation framework , this works indiscriminately with NSArray , NSDictionary , NSSet , NSIndexSet and their subclasses .
Even if you subclassed one of those yourself and have special needs on how to handle the elements in your custom collection you can still use the existing mechanism by implementing the two methods beginning with - placeObject : .
This is already used by some classes , as you can see in the ETCollection +HOM .m source file .
Consider the following example :
You have an NSArray named fruitBasket which holds several instances of a class named Fruit which implements a - peeled Fruit method to return an instance of its Peeled Fruit subclass .
How would one solve the problem of peeling all the fruit in the basket ?
The conventional way would be to enumerate all the objects in the array , sending the - peeled Fruit message to each and placing the object returned in a new array , yielding roughly between 5 and 15 lines of code , depending on whether you ( can ) use fast enumeration and how paranoid you are about sending the message to a wrong object .
- mappedCollection helps you to reduce that code to just one line :
NSArray * basketOfPeeledFruit = ( NSArray * ) [ [ fruitBasket mappedCollection ] peeled Fruit ] ;
If fruitBasket had been a mutable collection , you could also have used - map , which modifies the collection directly .
There is also another useful method using the same pattern :
The - filter method allows you to send a message returning BOOL to each element in the collection to determine whether it should remain in the collection or be removed .
This would , for example , allow me to make sure that there are no foul fruit in my basket prior to peeling them .
Unfortunately , - filter is only available in a variant that modifies the collection directly , so I have no way to keep the original basket and return a new collection .
Why ?
The problem with returning a new collection after filtering is , that , again , the whole higher - order messaging stuff is strictly speaking a con.
- mappedCollection , -map and - filter ( as well as - leftFold and - rightFold , see below ) in truth return proxy objects that forward the messages you send to them to each object in the original collection .
There is no such thing as higher - order messaging from the compiler 's perspective .
If you want to return a new collection , everything will work well as long as you only send messages to the proxy that return pointers to objects .
In the above case , the compiler would look at the return value of the method - peeled Fruit and allocate enough space to hold a pointer to a Peeled Fruit instance .
But the proxy object does in fact return an NSArray .
This is why you need to cast the return value appropriately , but that is no problem since both are pointers to some area in memory and thus are of the same size .
This is not the case if you send a message to a filter proxy .
It will return BOOL and the compiler will only allocate enough space for a BOOL return value .
If the filter - proxy did return a pointer to the filtered collection , it would not fit into the BOOL - sized portion of memory reserved by the compiler .
Terrible things could ensue , and that 's why it 's better not to do it .
So let 's assume our fruitBasket is in fact mutable and the “ Fruit ” - class implements - isNotFoul ( which returns a BOOL - value ) , we can remove the bad fruit from the basket and peel them afterwards by saying :
[ [ fruitBasket filter ] isNotFoul ] ; [ [ fruitBasket map ] peeled Fruit ] ;
The map operation can also serve as a substitute for the KVC method - valueForKey : .
Imagine that every month my phone company will send an array of records for the calls I 've placed and received ( named callLog ) .
Each record is an NSDictionary containing information about a single call :
The names and numbers of caller and callee , duration of the call etc .
If I want to get a list of the people I called , I have the following two options , one using higher - order messaging , the other using key - value coding :
NSArray * calledPersons = ( NSArray * ) [ [ callLog mappedCollection ] objectforKey : @ " calleeName " ] ; NSArray * calledPersons = [ callLog valueForKey : @ " calleeName " ] ;
Of course , the KVC - variant is arguably more concise , but I 'd like to demonstrate how higher - order messaging can help me to find out how much time I spent on the phone this month .
I simply extract the “ duration ” - field from each record :
NSArray * callDurations = ( NSArray * ) [ [ callLog mappedCollection ] objectForKey : @" duration " ] ;
( Again - valueForKey : could serve the same purpose . )
All I need to do now is compute the total of all objects stored in callDurations ; a task that can be immensely simplified by two other new methods : - leftFold and - rightFold , which repeatedly invoke a method with an accumulator and each element in a collection , building up the return value in the accumulator .
By “ left ” or “ right ” you can indicate in what order the elements shall be processed .
Since my Duration - class implements - durationByAddingDuration : I can easily find the total this way :
Duration * total = [ [ callDuration leftFold ] durationByAddingDuration : [ Duration nullDuration ] ] ;
The argument [ Duration nullDuration ] is used to set up an initial value for the accumulator .
I 'm setting it to an empty value , since I have no particular use for it .
Of course , since addition is a commutative operation , I could have used - right Fold as well .
It might also be worth noting that you should n't use nil as the initial value of the accumulator , at least for left folds .
In left folds the accumulator will be the receiver of the message you send to the proxy object , and if it 's set up to nil initially , no message can change that and nil will also be the return value of the operation .
This is nice and convenient , but might not be particularly speedy depending on your use case .
Since a message sent to the proxy object goes through the second - chance dispatch mechanism of the Objective - C runtime before it is forwarded to elements of the collection , there is some penalty associated with this initial message send .
The more objects there are in your collection , the less likely it is that you will notice it , but in performance critical code you might want to check whether that penalty is still significant .
Using Blocks
But there is also a second area where higher - order messaging might be found wanting .
If you are often doing various complex modifications of objects in collections , and want to use - map and friends , you might find yourself adding quite a few methods like - doComplexStuff : withFoo:andBar:andEvenMoreArguments : to your classes , even if you only use them once or twice .
If that is the case , and you are lucky enough to have compiled EtoileFoundation with clang ( passing the - fblocks switch and linking to the Objective C2 framework ) , you can also use the new blocks feature of Objective - C 2.0 to achieve something quite similar to higher - order messaging .
EtoileFoundation provides analogues to all collection higher - order messaging methods for use with blocks .
So we could rewrite the fruit peeling example as follows :
[ fruitBasket mapWithBlock : ^( id x ) { return [ x peeled Fruit ] ; } ] ;
Which , for this simple case , might seem to increase complexity , but is a lot more expressive since the block can include an arbitrary amount of code ( and it can even reference variables outside the scope of the block ) .
Additionally , since there is no proxy object needed to which arbitrary messages are sent , there is even a - filteredCollectionWithBlock : method , which is know to return a pointer to an object and wo n't cause any trouble .
It has been called the world 's second " oil war " , but the only similarity between Iraq and events in the jungles of northern Peru over the last few weeks has been the mismatch of force .
On one side have been the police armed with automatic weapons , teargas , helicopter gunships and armoured cars .
On the other are several thousand Awajun and Wambis Indians , many of them in war paint and armed with bows and arrows and spears .
In some of the worst violence seen in Peru in 20 years , the Indians this week warned Latin America what could happen if companies are given free access to the Amazonian forests to exploit an estimated 6 bn barrels of oil and take as much timber they like .
After months of peaceful protests , the police were ordered to use force to remove a road bock near Bagua Grande .
In the fights that followed , at least 50 Indians and nine police officers were killed , with hundreds more wounded or arrested .
The indigenous rights group Survival International described it as " Peru's Tiananmen Square " .
" For thousands of years , we 've run the Amazon forests , " said Servando Puerta , one of the protest leaders .
" This is genocide .
They 're killing us for defending our lives , our sovereignty , human dignity . "
Yesterday , as riot police broke up more demonstrations in Lima and a curfew was imposed on many Peruvian Amazonian towns , President Garcia backed down in the face of condemnation of the massacre .
He suspended – but only for three months – the laws that would allow the forest to be exploited .
No one doubts the clashes will continue .
Peru is just one of many countries now in open conflict with its indigenous people over natural resources .
Barely reported in the international press , there have been major protests around mines , oil , logging and mineral exploitation in Africa , Latin America , Asia and North America .
Hydro electric dams , biofuel plantations as well as coal , copper , gold and bauxite mines are all at the centre of major land rights disputes .
A massive military force continued this week to raid communities opposed to oil companies ' presence on the Niger delta .
The delta , which provides 90 % of Nigeria 's foreign earnings , has always been volatile , but guns have flooded in and security has deteriorated .
In the last month a military taskforce has been sent in and helicopter gunships have shelled villages suspected of harbouring militia .
Thousands of people have fled .
Activists from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta have responded by killing 12 soldiers and this week set fire to a Chevron oil facility .
Yesterday seven more civilians were shot by the military .
The escalation of violence came in the week that Shell agreed to pay £ 9.7 m to ethnic Ogoni families – whose homeland is in the delta – who had led a peaceful uprising against it and other oil companies in the 1990s , and who had taken the company to court in New York accusing it of complicity in writer Ken Saro - Wiwa 's execution in 1995 .
Meanwhile in West Papua , Indonesian forces protecting some of the world 's largest mines have been accused of human rights violations .
Hundreds of tribesmen have been killed in the last few years in clashes between the army and people with bows and arrows .
" An aggressive drive is taking place to extract the last remaining resources from indigenous territories , " says Victoria Tauli - Corpus , an indigenous Filipino and chair of the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues .
" There is a crisis of human rights .
There are more and more arrests , killings and abuses .
" This is happening in Russia , Canada , the Philippines , Cambodia , Mongolia , Nigeria , the Amazon , all over Latin America , Papua New Guinea and Africa .
It is global .
We are seeing a human rights emergency .
A battle is taking place for natural resources everywhere .
Much of the world 's natural capital – oil , gas , timber , minerals – lies on or beneath lands occupied by indigenous people , " says Tauli - Corpus .
What until quite recently were isolated incidents of indigenous peoples in conflict with states and corporations are now becoming common as government - backed companies move deeper on to lands long ignored as unproductive or wild .
As countries and the World Bank increase spending on major infrastructural projects to counter the economic crisis , the conflicts are expected to grow .
Indigenous groups say that large - scale mining is the most damaging .
When new laws opened the Philippines up to international mining 10 years ago , companies flooded in and wreaked havoc in indigenous communities , says MP Clare Short , former UK international development secretary and now chair of the UK - based Working Group on Mining in the Philippines .
Short visited people affected by mining there in 2007 : " I have never seen anything so systematically destructive .
The environmental effects are catastrophic as are the effects on people 's livelihoods .
They take the tops off mountains , which are holy , they destroy the water sources and make it impossible to farm , " she said .
In a report published earlier this year , the group said : " Mining generates or exacerbates corruption , fuels armed conflicts , increases militarisation and human rights abuses , including extrajudicial killings . "
The arrival of dams , mining or oil spells cultural death for communities .
The Dongria Kondh in Orissa , eastern India , are certain that their way of life will be destroyed when British FTSE 100 company Vedanta shortly starts to legally exploit their sacred Nyamgiri mountain for bauxite , the raw material for aluminium .
The huge open cast mine will destroy a vast swath of untouched forest , and will reduce the mountain to an industrial wasteland .
More than 60 villages will be affected .
" If Vedanta mines our mountain , the water will dry up .
In the forest there are tigers , bears , monkeys .
Where will they go ?
We have been living here for generations .
Why should we leave ? " asks Kumbradi , a tribesman .
" We live here for Nyamgiri , for its trees and leaves and all that is here . "
Davi Yanomami , a shaman of the Yanomami , one of the largest but most isolated Brazilian indigenous groups , came to London this week to warn MPs that the Amazonian forests were being destroyed , and to appeal for help to prevent his tribe being wiped out .
" History is repeating itself " , he told the MPs .
" Twenty years ago many thousand gold miners flooded into Yanomami land and one in five of us died from the diseases and violence they brought .
We were in danger of being exterminated then , but people in Europe persuaded the Brazilian government to act and they were removed .
" But now 3,000 more miners and ranchers have come back .
More are coming .
They are bringing in guns , rafts , machines , and destroying and polluting rivers .
People are being killed .
They are opening up and expanding old airstrips .
They are flooding into Yanomami land .
We need your help .
" Governments must treat us with respect .
This creates great suffering .
We kill nothing , we live on the land , we never rob nature .
Yet governments always want more .
We are warning the world that our people will die . "
According to Victor Menotti , director of the California - based International Forum on Globalisation , " This is a paradigm war taking place from the arctic to tropical forests .
Wherever you find indigenous peoples you will find resource conflicts .
It is a battle between the industrial and indigenous world views . "
There is some hope , says Tauli - Corpus .
" Indigenous peoples are now much more aware of their rights .
They are challenging the companies and governments at every point . "
In Ecuador , Chevron may be fined billions of dollars in the next few months if an epic court case goes against them .
The company is accused of dumping , in the 1970s and 1980s , more than 19bn gallons of toxic waste and millions of gallons of crude oil into waste pits in the forests , leading to more than 1,400 cancer deaths and devastation of indigenous communities .
The pits are said to be still there , mixing chemicals with groundwater and killing fish and wildlife .
The Ecuadorian courts have set damages at $ 27bn ( £ 16.5 bn ) .
Chevron , which inherited the case when it bought Texaco , does not deny the original spills , but says the damage was cleaned up .
Back in the Niger delta , Shell was ordered to pay $ 1.5 bn to the Ijaw people in 2006 – though the company has so far escaped paying the fines .
After settling with Ogoni families in New York this week , it now faces a second class action suit in New York over alleged human rights abuses , and a further case in Holland brought by Niger Delta villagers working with Dutch groups .
Meanwhile , Exxon Mobil is being sued by Indonesian indigenous villagers who claim their guards committed human rights violations , and there are dozens of outstanding cases against other companies operating in the Niger Delta .
" Indigenous groups are using the courts more but there is still collusion at the highest levels in court systems to ignore land rights when they conflict with economic opportunities , " says Larry Birns , director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington .
" Everything is for sale , including the Indians ' rights .
Governments often do not recognise land titles of Indians and the big landowners just take the land . "
Indigenous leaders want an immediate cessation to mining on their lands .
Last month , a conference on mining and indigenous peoples in Manila called on governments to appoint an ombudsman or an international court system to handle indigenous peoples ' complaints .
" Most indigenous peoples barely have resources to ensure their basic survival , much less to bring their cases to court .
Members of the judiciary in many countries are bribed by corporations and are threatened or killed if they rule in favour of indigenous peoples .
" States have an obligation to provide them with better access to justice and maintain an independent judiciary , " said the declaration .
But as the complaints grow , so does the chance that peaceful protests will grow into intractable conflicts as they have in Nigeria , West Papua and now Peru .
" There is a massive resistance movement growing , " says Clare Short .
" But the danger is that as it grows , so does the violence . "

Forgive me honey for I have sinned … I realize now that President Obama is not perfect .
I was wrong to suggest that Obama would rid the world of evil and walk on water while doing it .
I was wrong to believe he was the Messiah .
I can now say that he is not the smartest human to have ever lived and quite frankly he throws like a girl .
Whew .
That feels good to get off my chest .
I am a big enough woman to admit when I am wrong .
But there is one thing wrong with all of this .
I never said any of those things in the first place and neither did any Democrat I know .
I never said he was perfect .
I never expected him to solve all the problems of the world .
And I know lots of women who can throw a ball better than most men .
I recognize that he is human and I am sure most people in their right minds know that as well .
But you would never know any of this if you listen to Rush Limbaugh .
Evidently we Democrats are deaf , dumb and blind when it comes to Obama .
Bullshit .
I am not giving Obama a free pass .
I ’m giving him a chance .
He has four years to “ make it or break it ” as they say .
And considering what George Bush did to it , breaking it is the least of our worries .
Healthcare in the United State is broken .
Our reputation around the globe is broken .
The banks are broken .
The tax system … the school systems … the environment – all broken .
Someone needs to try and fix it .
So why not Obama ?
When George Bush was President I did n’t want him to fail .
I wanted him to stop acting like an idiot .
I wanted him to be honest and listen to the debate of the people .
I did n’t expect him to act like a Democrat .
I expected him to act like an American .
And I expected him to at least try to keep his campaign promises .
Instead what we got was a moron of a President who crawled up Dick Cheney ’s ass and lived there for 8 years .
If all Rush Limbaugh can do is wish for Obama to fail and talk about what is wrong with America , then what ’s the use of giving him airtime everyday ?
After 20 years has n’t he made his point ?
If he had been right about anything along the way then certainly he would appeal to more than just angry white men or at the very least been promoted to FM radio .
Yesterday the Rush Limbaugh Show suggested that Walter Cronkite was just another liberal journalist who was responsible , evidently , for the deaths of 10,000 American soldiers during the Vietnam War .
What in the world will it be tomorrow ?
Mother Theresa was selfishly hoarding food that otherwise could have ended world hunger ?
Seriously , Rush .
It ’s getting old .
Eventually the sky has to be blue in your world .
Or does it ?
Can you believe that 72 percent of Republicans have a favorable approval rating of Sarah Palin ?
The woman quit mid-stream and even that did n’t knock her off the pedestal .
I guess I should n’t be surprised , Margaret .
After all his listeners agree with him on healthcare reform .
Rush Limbaugh , a man who will never have to worry about the cost of insurance and admits to a prescription drug addiction , actually wants to challenge Obama on healthcare reform .
Really ?
I am just stunned .
And now they attack Walter Cronkite … the most trusted man in America… Uncle Walter .
I guess the Americans with Disabilities Act needs to be revisited again to include “ Republican ” as a form of mental impairment because this has gotten out of hand .
And I will gladly give up my mobility impaired classification and the great parking space that goes with it to make room for them .
Let me tell you about Walter Cronkite .
Besides being sexier than Rush will ever be , Cronkite was someone you could respect even if you did n’t agree with him .
He knew the difference between news and opinion and was quick to announce when he had switched from one to the other .
Each evening for years he brought millions of Americans together to know and better understand the world around them .
He was a man ’s man who was n’t offensive to women – unlike Rush who is an ass ’s ass who could n’t pay a woman to respect him … and I am sure he has tried .
In 1970 , Cronkite received a “ Freedom of the Press ” George Polk Award .
In 1981 , the year he retired , Jimmy Carter awarded Cronkite the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
In 1985 , Cronkite was honored with the induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame .
In 2006 Cronkite became the first non-astronaut to receive NASA ’s Ambassador of Exploration Award .
Cronkite ’s numerous awards included four Peabody awards for excellence in broadcasting .
Admittedly Cronkite was no Rush Limbaugh .
Thank God .
Rush has made an entire career out of never admitting when he is wrong , and I find that very funny because Rush is the biggest person I know .
Literally .
I mean it .
Really .
Helen , dear , we can certainly agree on one thing for sure .
Walter Cronkite was a very sexy man .
I tell you , he was the Anderson Cooper of his day .
He could melt my butter each and every evening .
He could toast my bread on both sides .
He could float my boat , row it out to sea , and wait for it to return with the tide any day of the week .
Although , I ’m not quite sure what that means , I do know that Walter Cronkite was a real man .
And , my dear Helen , that ’s the way it is …
It was humankind 's crowning achievement , with millions around the world glued to their television sets as US astronaut Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the moon 40 years ago .
But in the scientific equivalent of recording an old episode of EastEnders over the prized video of your daughter 's wedding day , Nasa probably taped over its only high - resolution images of the first moon walk with electronic data from a satellite or a later manned space mission , officials said today .
It means that the familiar grainy and ghosting images of Armstrong 's " giant leap for mankind " are all that remain from the mission , though the space agency has managed to digitally restore the footage into new broadcast - quality pictures that it released today .
" I do n't think anyone in the Nasa organisation did anything wrong .
It slipped through the cracks and nobody 's happy about it , " said Dick Nafzger , one of the last Apollo - era video engineers still working for the agency at Maryland 's Goddard Space Flight Centre .
In a technological feat that rivalled even putting Armstrong and his shipmate Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface , and one that has been largely overlooked since , a team of Nasa engineers and contractors fed live video from the moon , via a series of relay stations in Australia and the US , to homes around the world .
While Armstrong , Aldrin and Apollo 11 pilot Michael Collins trained for the mission , Nafzger and his partners were tasked with working out how to broadcast live from 240,000 miles away .
The images of Armstrong and Aldrin stepping on to the lunar surface and planting the US flag in the grey dust were seen by an estimated 600 million people .
The tape recordings , taken for backup , were an afterthought , Nafzger told reporters in Washington today .
" We all wish that somebody had said ' those tapes are special , let 's pull them aside ' , " he said .
Instead , their loss apparently went unnoticed for 35 years , until 2004 , when an archive in Australia alerted Nasa that it believed it had found the lost tapes from the Apollo 11 mission .
It shipped the tapes to Goddard , where Nasa maintains what officials say is the only machine in the world capable of reading the old tape technology .
The first tapes did not have moon footage , but touched off a massive search for those that did in archives stored in dusty basements across the world .
Nasa believed the original tapes might contain digital data sent from the moon that could be converted into much sharper pictures of the landing than those broadcast on the day , which were taken by a television camera pointed at a giant wall monitor at mission control in Houston - effectively a copy of a copy .
But a standard Nasa money - saving measure in those days was to reuse the 14 - inch tape reels after several years in storage .
Agency officials ultimately concluded that the original Apollo 11 tapes were buried among an estimated 350,000 that were recycled in the 1970s and 1980s and the data was lost for ever .
The newly released footage was taken from four copies , including one in a CBS television archive .
It is undergoing restoration by a firm that specialises in cleaning up old Hollywood movies .
" I do n't believe that the tapes exist today at all , " Stan Lebar , the designer of the original lunar camera , told America 's National Public Radio .
" It was a hard thing to accept .
But there was just an overwhelming amount of evidence that led us to believe that they just do n't exist any more . "
Lol !
Looks like he 's lovin ' it !
Corporate gatekeeper claims that showing a print out of an article on live TV , something which happens on every mainstream TV news network every day , equates to copyright violation

Monday , May 4 , 2009
You Tube has once again proven itself to be a corporate gatekeeper working to destroy free speech and the alternative media after it suspended the popular ‘ Alex Jones Channel ’ – primarily because Alex Jones showed a print out of a news article during a live show .
The Alex Jones Channel , started by a fan but since embraced as the “ official ” Alex Jones micro-site on You Tube , has routinely featured in the website ’s most popular ranking charts and has collectively attracted millions of views for videos painstakingly catalogued and uploaded over the past two years .
Those videos are now completely gone after You Tube bosses deleted the channel , primarily because the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette complained that Alex Jones had shown a computer print out of one of their articles about the Poplawski cop killer incident last month .
To claim that showing a print out of an article is a violation of copyright is of course completely insane – not a day goes by without TV news anchors showing newspaper stories on live television .
Indeed , C - Span ’s popular Washington Journal program almost entirely consists of the host showing clippings of newspaper stories every morning .
The real reason for the deletion in undoubtedly the fact that Alex Jones has been on the forefront of exposing stories that have later become major national scandals , such as the MIAC report .
Our coverage of the swine flu hoax has again propelled us to the top of the video ranking charts and this no doubt had You Tube ’s corporate owners Google running scared .
As we have previously documented – Google has intimate ties with the CIA and the military - industrial complex .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
To counter such egregious censorship , we are encouraging everyone to subscribe to and bookmark the new Infowarrior channel and alert people to the fact that this will be the new home for Alex Jones on You Tube ( at least until they invent a reason to pull that one too ) .
Visit the channel via this link .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
YouTube is engaged in a hunting expedition against Alex Jones and other truth tellers .
Truth is no longer acceptable on the site as it transforms itself into a pale reflection of Hulu , a site owned and operated by NBC Universal ( GE ) and Fox Entertainment Group ( News Corp ) , that is to say a joint venture by a corporation owned by a death merchant ( GE manufactures attack helicopters and jet engines ) and a disinformation platform owned by a notorious neocon , Rupert Murdoch .
In the Hulu-ized universe , there is no room for truth or alternative media — all channels will contain the same schlock and mindless pablum already available on cable and broadcast television .
YouTube , the emerging Hulu-ized version , has no use for Alex Jones and has specifically targeted him because his videos invariably draw a large ( in the millions ) number of people .
His message is not welcome in a commercial space dominated by Wall Street bankers and the “ entertainment ” transnational corporations they own , operate , and use to disseminate their opiated propaganda .
YouTube is owned by Google , the mega - internet corporation that has as its motto “ Do n’t be evil . ”
Of course , for Google evil is a relative matter , especially when it comes to the corporation ’s removal or omission of information from its services , especially in the totalitarian gulag of China .
Google is infamous for its politically motivated removal of information .
In February 2003 , Google stopped showing the adverts of Oceana , a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship operation ’s sewage treatment practices .
In October 2007 , Google banned advertisements from Maine U.S. Senator Susan Collins ’ reelection campaign because she criticized the Soros operation MoveOn.org .
In April 2008 , Google refused to run ads for a UK Christian group opposed to abortion .
In addition to taking down Alex Jones videos , YouTube has blocked videos produced by Wael Abbas , an activist who posted videos of police brutality , and the American Life League which is critical of Planned Parenthood .
YouTube has its agenda … and it fits in snugly with the agenda of the New World Order .
You Tube users vented their anger at the deletion of The Alex Jones Channel today .

L’AQUILA , Italy ( Reuters ) -
The G8 agreed on Wednesday to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent , but it failed to persuade China and India to join a bid to halve world emissions .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
With only five months until a new U.N. climate pact is due to be agreed in Copenhagen , climate change organizations said the G8 had left much work to be done and ducked key issues .
China and India resisted signing up for a global goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
Developing economies demanded rich nations commit to steeper short term reductions .
And while the 2 Celsius goal was adopted for the first time by the United States , Russia , Japan and Canada , it had already been agreed in 1996 by the European Union and its G8 members Germany , Britain , France and Italy .
The G8 statement also failed to pinpoint a base year for the 80 percent reduction -- saying it should be “ compared to 1990 or more recent years ” -- meaning the target was open to interpretation .
“ The world will recognize that today in Italy werecognize have laid the foundations for a Copenhagen deal that is ambitious , fair and effective , ” said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 2 Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) target , since pre-industrial times , was “ clear progress ” for the G8 .
The G8 backed the creation of a global carbon trading market and a fund financed by rich nations to pay for technological change , but it fell short of the $ 100 billion a year advocated by Britain ’s Brown and non-governmental groups .
“ While agreeing to keep temperature rise to below 2 degrees rise Celsius , without a clear plan , money and targets on how to do this the G8 leaders will not have helped to break the deadlock in the UN climate negotiations , ” said Tobias Muenchmeyer , Greenpeace International political adviser .
CHINA’S ABSENCE KEY
Temperatures have already risen by about 0.7 Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution ushered in widespread burning of fossil fuels , the main cause of warming according to the U.N. Climate Panel .
Many developing nations also view two degrees as the threshold beyond which climate change will reach danger levels , with rising seas and more heatwaves , floods and droughts .
The temperature target was due to be included in a statement from the 17 - member Major Economies Forum ( MEF ) , which groups the G8 plus major developing economies , which will meet on Thursday .
Last minute talks to convince MEF members to sign up to the goal of cutting world greenhouse gases by at least 50 percent by 2050 -- adopted by the G8 last year -- unraveled on Tuesday .
Delegates said the absence of Chinese leader Hu Jintao , who flew home to deal with an outbreak of ethnic violence in western China , dashed hopes of an eleventh hour breakthrough .
“ China ’s not here so they cannot move anywhere : there will be no agreement tomorrow in the MEF text on 50 percent .
We will take this up again at the G20 when China is present , ” said a senior European G8 source involved in the talks .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said emerging countries appeared willing to sign up to long - term emissions goals if rich nations would agree to tough targets by 2020 .
The G8 statement called for “ robust ” medium - target cutbacks , but gave no details .
“ Unless we get fusion to work in some fashion we are doomed , are n’t we ? ” argues Martin Fleishmann ( Image : Jon Cartwright )
For most researchers , any mention of cold fusion brings back memories of a shameful period in modern science .
Now , 20 years after Martin Fleischmann instigated this field , he tells Jon Cartwright that he could not have done anything differently , and that if we can not get fusion of some sort to work on a large scale soon , we ’re doomed
MARTIN FLEISCHMANN can still remember the morning he entered his lab and saw the terrific hole in the workbench .

Hold a UX Stand - Down and Operational Review
Look for opportunities to do things better , eliminate procedures and processes of dubious value … .
This is something I ’ve done in my management and leadership positions at Sage and Intuit .
I got the idea from the US Navy .
Periodically , certain naval air units examine and improve operational policies and procedures by standing down for a day and thoroughly reviewing how they do what they do .
They look for opportunities to do things better , eliminate procedures and processes of dubious value , and improve safety margins .
I ’m sure you have some cruft in your UX practice .
So , do yourself and your colleagues a favor .
Take a day where all you do is look at what you do , what you produce , and how you deliver your services .
It might help for you to pose some form of the following questions to yourself , regarding every aspect of your operation :
Is this activity or process still meeting the need for which it was originally designed ?
If it is n’t , why not ?
If it is , can you meet that need in a better , faster , or stronger way ?
Are you performing any activities or processes that do n’t meet any of your organization ’s needs ?
( And can you stop doing them right now ? )
Are there new needs your current activities and processes are not satisfying ?
There are many names for these types of activities .
One I ’ve heard in my corporate travels is the stop - start - continue exercise .
Whatever you call it , it ’s a good idea .
Do it !
Do n’t worry , I wo n’t punch you in the arm if you do n’t .
But if I see you at a UX conference or meetup , I will give you loads of Jewish - mother guilt .
Stretch Yourself Outside of User Experience
Temporarily assuming a completely different job or responsibility might make you love our little UX world even more when you return to it .
Our profession can be like a comfortable , well - decorated , and distracting gilded cage .
It ’s so comfortable , we are often loath to leave it .
Well , guess what ?
Temporarily assuming a completely different job or responsibility might make you love our little UX world even more when you return to it .
And you ’ll have the added advantage of bringing back an outside - in perspective of your field .
So , do yourself a favor .
Go do something else for 6 or 12 months — for example , take on a requirements analyst or business analyst role .
Be a product manager .
Work in the online marketing department .
If you have the chops , go write code .
Hell , you could even do QA for awhile .
( Although it seems to me that it takes a certain kind of focused craziness to geek out on testing and validation . )
But it ’s all good , and it ’ll pay dividends down the line .
Think About Your UX Career Path
This is the other side of the coin .
Who are you professionally ?
What is your UX specialty , your brand ?
Are you a strategic UX thinker — business oriented , big picture — or more tactical — testing , testing , testing ?
Are you a tool wizard — adopting the latest , greatest tools — a specialist — the forms guy or gal — or a cutting - edge Web 2.0 / social media wonk ?
Pick a persona and work it .
Specialization is not a bad thing , especially if you ’re seen as the go - to guy or gal for a particular class of problems .
Repurpose Your UX Assets
Here ’s a suggestion from John Rhodes , one of the truly talented marketing minds in the user experience industry .
He suggests taking reports you ’ve written for several clients and creating a meta report for sale on your Web site .
Another suggestion from John is to convert a whitepaper to an MP3 and post it as free download on your Web site or a podcast directory .
Use it for marketing or sales support .
Think your stuff is n’t worth the reuse effort ?
Think again .
Everything helps .
If your for - sale report does n’t sell like hotcakes , you ’ve got a ready - made piece of marketing collateral — or a portfolio piece , if you ’re looking to get employed by a company that likes to see work samples .
Departing from Script on User Research Visits
Invariably , the most interesting and important findings for my clients come from pursuing a line of inquiry that was n’t even part of the original research protocol .
Serendipity is the mother of discovery .
I have created dozens of user research studies and moderated hundreds of sessions .
Invariably , the most interesting and important findings for my clients come from pursuing a line of inquiry that was n’t even part of the original research protocol .
I ’ll fess up .
One of the major mistakes I made as an inexperienced user research practitioner was over - determining the session protocol .
In my younger days , I was too eager to cram the protocol full of tasks , questions , and opportunities for recounting critical incidents .
I did n’t realize that the best , highest - quality insights come from simply being attentive and open to the unexpected , then describing the phenomena you ’ve witnessed and offering some clever and penetrating analysis .
So , learn from my experience .
Loosen up your field - research protocol a bit .
Do n’t fill it with too many tasks and questions .
And be on the lookout for interesting phenomena , behaviors , or rituals .
They ’re your business - class ticket to insight city .
I ’m sure there are lots of other things that we , as UX professionals , should and could be doing .
I invite you to share your suggestions in the comments below .
A quick thanks to Susan Hura of SpeechUsability , Daniel Szuc of Apogee , and John Rhodes of Webword for their suggestions and ideas .

Holmes recently went to get his “ eighty millionth ” tattoo .
The numbers 561 , the zip code of his hometown in Florida , now grace the inside of his “ MVP arm . ”
Tone used the moment to totally beg for an ESPY this year .
Some players would be happy with a Lombardi trophy and Super Bowl MVP award , but Tone is n’t stopping there .
He ’s already promised his friends back home that he’d have an ESPY in tow as well , so y’all need to get your vote on in order for that to happen .
You can find the voting link here .
And if Tone wins an ESPY , I ’m calling him out that he needs to get the name Carmella Bella , or at least some small reference to her , tatted on his body .
Episcopal Church leaders in Los Angeles today nominated an openly gay priest and an openly lesbian priest as bishops , becoming one of the first dioceses in the national church to test a controversial new policy that lifted a de facto ban on gays and lesbians in the ordained hierarchy .
The nominations of the Rev. John L. Kirkley of San Francisco and the Rev. Canon Mary Douglas Glasspool of a Baltimore - based diocese are likely to further inflame theological conservatives in the U.S. church and their global partners in the Anglican Communion , who have repeatedly warned about the repercussions of such action .
The two are among six nominees who will face election for two assistant bishop posts at the diocese ’s annual December convention in Riverside .
The Diocese of Los Angeles , which represents 70,000 Episcopalians in six counties , is widely regarded as one of the most liberal in the U.S. church of 2.1 million members .
Its bishop , the Rt. Rev. J. Jon Bruno , is an outspoken advocate of gays rights in the church .
" I affirm each and every one of these candidates and am pleased at the wide diversity they offer this diocese , " Bruno said in a statement .
Dozens of traditionalist churches and four dioceses , including one in Central California , broke away last year over their opposition to the 2003 consecration of partnered gay bishop in New Hampshire .
U.S. church leaders had promised to exercise restraint before consecrating additional gay bishops in the aftermath of that contentious move .
But they reversed course at their convention in Anaheim last month , voting overwhelmingly to open " any ordained ministry " to gays and lesbians .
They also agreed to consider rites of blessing for same - sex couples .
In addition to Kirkley and Glasspool , the other nominees are : the Rev. Canon Diane M. Jardine Bruce of St. Clement ’s by - the - Sea Episcopal Church in San Clemente ; the Rev. Zelda M. Kennedy of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena ; the Rev. Irineo Martir Vasquez of St. George ’s Episcopal Church in Hawthorne ; and the Rev. Silvestre E. Romero of St. Philip ’s Episcopal Church in San Jose .
The action in Los Angeles followed a similar decision Saturday by leaders in the Diocese of Minnesota , who nominated a partnered lesbian as bishop .
The Rev. Bonnie Perry is rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Chicago and an adjunct professor at Seabury - Western Theological Seminary in Evanston , Ill .
Her longtime partner is a priest in the church .

It ’s official , trillion is the new billion .
No longer is government spending talked about in terms of a mere ten digits .
With the recent flurry of government spending , we are going to need another three zeros to make sense of it all .
One trillion dollars ; it ’s a number that few people can comprehend , let alone your standard nine digit calculator .
There have been attempts to put this number into perspective before .
A trillion dollar bills laid end to end would reach the sun or you spend a dollar per second for 32,000 years or one trillion dollars in pennies would weigh as much as 2,755,778 Argentinosauruses ( the largest known dinosaur ) .
Fanciful as this may be , the real story behind one trillion dollars is in its economic impact .
Let ’s investigate what one trillion dollars can do .

Recently a committee of the Dutch Parliament published a report on copyright legislation in which it made several false accusations against the Dutch - based BitTorrent site Mininova .
The Mininova team were insulted by the report and demanded a public rectification , which the parliament has now refused .
Mininova is now considering legal action .
In an advisory report to the Dutch Government , a committee consisting of four members of the Parliament looked into the ever - increasing online piracy rate and how this should be dealt with in the future .
The committee concluded that downloading should be criminalized once the entertainment industry has come up with sufficient legal alternatives .
Worryingly , the report also included some factual errors about Mininova that could potentially hurt the BitTorrent site in its ongoing court case against the local anti-piracy outfit BREIN .
Among other things , the parliamentarians wrote that in common with The Pirate Bay , Mininova does n’t allow copyright holders to remove torrents from the site upon request .
In fact , Mininova has a full notice and take down system .
In response to these and other statements , Mininova demanded a public rectification from the Dutch parliament .
“ We demand that the spreading of false information related to Mininova will be stopped .
In addition , we demand that the working group removes the name Mininova from the report and places a rectification on the website of the Dutch parliament and in several national newspapers , ” Mininova co-founder Erik Dubbelboer said .
“ We take this very seriously , ” Erik Dubbelboer said .
“ If these demands are not met , we ’ll consider to take legal steps , ” he added , in order to emphasize that their demands should not be taken lightly .
Legal threats or not , the committee announced today that it does not intend to rectify their earlier statements , even though they admit to having made a mistake .
The committee of the Dutch Parliament has , however , changed the original report based on ( some of ) Mininova ’s complaints .
Initially it stated that the torrent site had no “ notice and takedown ” policy to handle the complaints of copyright holders , but this has been corrected in an updated version .
In the updated version of the report the committee also added that Mininova ’s “ notice and takedown ” system is not sufficient , even though it follows European law .
Arda Gerkens , the head of the parliamentary committee said that Mininova ’s copyright policy is not very efficient , since Mininova demands that rights holders send the full urls of the torrents they ’d like to see removed .
This minor correction is of course far from what Mininova had demanded and they are not satisfied with the committee ’s handling of their complaint .
Mininova is currently discussing with their lawyers if and what legal action they are going to take against the Dutch Government .
" We considered that the portrayal of the priest and nun in a sexualised manner - and the implication that they were considering whether or not to give in to temptation - was likely to cause serious offence to some readers . "
What 's the secret to surviving during times of environmental change ?
Evolve …quickly .
A new article in The American Naturalist finds that guppy populations introduced into new habitats developed new and advantageous traits in just a few years .
This is one of only a few studies to look at adaptation and survival in a wild population .
A research team led by Swanne Pamela Gordon from the University of California , Riverside studied 200 guppies that had been taken from the Yarra River in Trinidad and introduced into two different environments in the nearby Damier River , which previously had no guppies .
One Damier environment was predator - free .
The other contained fish that occasionally snack on guppies .
Eight years after their introduction , the team revisited the Damier guppies to see what adaptive changes they might have picked up in their new environments .
The researchers found that the females had altered their reproductive effort to match their surroundings .
In the environment where predators were present , females produced more embryos each reproductive cycle .
This makes sense because where predators abound , one might not get a second chance to reproduce .
In less dangerous waters , females produced fewer embryos each time , thus expending fewer resources on reproduction .
Finally , the researchers wanted to see if these adaptive changes actually helped the new population to survive .
So they took more guppies from the Yarra , marked them , and put them in the Damier alongside the ones that had been there for eight years .
They found that the adapted guppies had a significant survival advantage over the more recently introduced group .
In particular , juveniles from the adapted population had a 54 to 59 percent increase in survival rate over those from the newly introduced group .
In the long run , survival of juveniles is crucial to the survival of the population , the researchers say .
The fact that fitness differences were found after only eight years shows just how fast evolution can work — for short - lived species anyway .
" The changes in survival in our study may initially seem encouraging from a conservation perspective , " the authors write .
" [ B ]ut it is important to remember that the elapsed time frame was 13 - 26 guppy generations .
The current results may therefore provide little solace for biologists and managers concerned with longer - lived species . "
The chart below was promptly whipped up after reading this report ( $ ) in today 's Wall Street Journal about just how fast Option - ARMs are souring as compared to subprime loans .
It 's not so much that the default rates for Option - ARMs have exceeded that of subprimes loans for three months running , but that the absolute numbers are so high .
More than one - third of all Option - ARMs ( called Pick - A - Pay loans below ) are in default and most of these are likely to make it to the foreclosure stage eventually .
Option ARMs were typically issued to creditworthy homeowners and allow borrowers to make a range of monthly payments .
The payment options include a partial - interest payment that adds the unpaid interest to the loan 's balance .
On many such loans , balances have risen while values of the underlying properties have plummeted amid the housing crisis .
As of April , 36.9 % of Pick - A - Pay loans were at least 60 days past due , while 19 % were in foreclosure , according to data from First American CoreLogic , a unit of Santa Ana , Calif . - based First American Corp .
In contrast , 33.9 % of subprime loans were delinquent , with 14.5 % of those loans in foreclosure , the figures show .
Payment - option mortgages are heavily concentrated in the worst - hit regions in the housing market , including California and Florida , making borrowers inordinately vulnerable to declining property values .
The deepening loan turmoil could mean higher - than - expected losses for Wells Fargo & Co. , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .'s own insurance fund .
" The realization of the issues related to option ARMs is just beginning , " said Chris Marinac , director of research at Atlanta - based FIG Partners .
If memory serves , the wackiest thing about Option - ARMs a few years ago was that banks could book the interest and principal payments as income even though they were n't actually receiving the money - the vast majority of borrowers were only making the lowest payment that did n't even cover the full amount of the interest due that month .
Shortly after she sat down at her desk on the third floor of LAPD headquarters Friday morning , Det. Stephanie Lazarus was told a suspect in the basement jail had information on one of her cases .
The 25 - year police veteran went quickly downstairs .
As Lazarus removed her firearm to pass through security , she unknowingly walked into a trap .
There was no suspect -- only questions about a terrible secret police believe she has been harboring for more than two decades .
Now disarmed , Lazarus , 49 , was confronted by homicide detectives and arrested on suspicion of the 1986 slaying of a woman who had married Lazarus ’ ex-boyfriend .
The dramatic break in the decades - old case sent shock waves through the tight - knit LAPD community , marking one of the few times in the department ’s history that one of its own officers has been accused of murder .
“ It ’s painful , ” LAPD Chief William J. Bratton said .
“ But murder is also very painful . ”

Calling it an apparent “ crime of passion , ” Deputy Chief Charlie Beck said Lazarus allegedly beat and fatally shot Sherri Rae Rasmussen , a 29 - year - old hospital nursing director , two years after joining the department .
Three months after they were married , Rasmussen ’s husband returned to their Van Nuys condominium on the evening of Feb. 24 , 1986 , to discover his wife ’s badly beaten body on the floor in the living room .
She had been shot several times , Beck said .
Days after the slaying , two men robbed another woman in the area at gunpoint .
Homicide detectives suspected that the pair had also killed Rasmussen when she came upon them burglarizing her home , according to news reports from the time .
Rasmussen ’s parents , newspapers reported , offered a $ 10,000 reward for the men ’s capture .
The search for the men led nowhere .
Like thousands of other homicides from the period , the case remained open and collected dust on storage shelves as detectives struggled to keep pace with L.A. 's dramatic surge in violent crimes .

But with homicides in the city falling to historic lows , LAPD detectives have had unusual freedom in recent months to revisit cold cases .
Detectives returned to the Rasmussen killing in February , testing blood or saliva samples from the crime scene and thought to have been from the killer .
The DNA tests showed that the attacker was a woman , disproving the theory that Rasmussen had been killed by a man .
Detectives scoured the original case file for mention of any women who could have been overlooked during the investigation .
Beck said they found a reference to Lazarus , who was known at the time to have had a romantic relationship with the victim ’s husband , John Ruetten .
Ruetten allegedly broke off the relationship and soon after became involved with Rasmussen , said sources familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly .
With suspicion falling on an LAPD cop , the case took on sensitive and explosive tones inside the department .
To minimize the chances that word of the reopened investigation would leak , only a small circle of detectives and high - ranking officials were made aware of it .
Last week , an undercover officer surreptitiously trailed Lazarus as she did errands , waiting until she discarded a plastic utensil or other object with her saliva on it , police sources said .
The DNA in her saliva was compared with the DNA evidence collected from the murder scene .
The genetic code in the samples matched conclusively , police said .

Lazarus was not pursued as a suspect at the time of Rasmussen ’s slaying , according to Beck .
The two homicide detectives originally assigned to the case have retired and had not yet been contacted by police , he added .
Beck declined to say why the detectives did not look more closely at Lazarus as a possible suspect .
Asked at an afternoon news conference whether Lazarus had been either deliberately or mistakenly overlooked because she was a cop , Beck said : “ I do n’t know the answer to that at this point . ”
Reached at his home in Arizona , Rasmussen ’s father , Nels E. Rasmussen Jr. , indicated that he believes so .
“ We are not surprised that the arrest was made , ” he said .
One of the original detectives in the case , Lyle Mayer , said he never interviewed Lazarus in the course of his investigation and continued to believe the burglary theory until his retirement in 1991 .
Police officials declined to comment on whether they believe anyone else was involved in the killing .
Lazarus was being held without bail and could not be reached for comment .

Officers responded with shock as news of the arrest spread through the department .
“ Never in my wildest imagination would I ever think she could do something like this , ” said one longtime officer , who socialized frequently with Lazarus .
“ We drank beers .
She was always quick to give you a hug or tell a joke . ”
The officer spoke on condition of anonymity .
Lazarus ’ current partner , Det. Don Hrycyk , refused to comment .
Lazarus joined the department in 1983 , a year after she graduated from UCLA with a degree in sociology , LAPD and university records show .
After several years as a rank - and - file patrol officer , she was promoted to detective and , in 2006 , landed a high - profile assignment with Hrycyk tracking stolen artwork and forgeries .
There are references in department publications to Lazarus earning public commendation for her work .
She hardly shunned the spotlight .
In a recent LA Weekly profile , Lazarus joked that all she knew about art was that it “ hangs on the wall ” and that “ after working here and seeing all the phony art , I said , ‘ I can do that . ’ ” Lazarus , who according to police has a young daughter and recently married another LAPD detective , told the newspaper that she had started taking oil - painting classes and had first become interested in art when she visited Europe as a teenager .
Last year , she gave interviews after helping capture two men convicted of a string of art thefts in the Wilshire area and in Beverly Hills .

Until her death , Rasmussen was director of critical - care nursing at Glendale Adventist Medical Center .
Her slaying stunned colleagues , who referred to her as a vital member of the staff , according to news reports .
On the day she was killed , she had reportedly stayed home from work after straining her back in an aerobics class .
In an article about the family ’s reward , her father said Rasmussen had entered college at 16 and had taught for a period at UCLA .
“ It ’s safe to say we have some closure , ” said Ruetten , the victim ’s husband , when reached at his home in San Diego .
“ It ’s been a horrible thing to go through it all again . ”

Start at the front and stay at the front .
Or , if you ca n’t start there , get there ASAP .
There ’s no use dawdling around in the middle or at the back waiting for the “ right ” time to move up .
Here 's a very quick lesson in foreign - language menu reading .
Imagine this :
You 're ordering off a very short menu in a restaurant in a country that speaks a very unfamiliar language .
You know that one of the two entrées listed involves brie and the other , lots of tart , tangy cranberries .
Can you figure out which is which ?
Would it help you to know that one item was called takete and the other , maluma ?
If you 're like a lot of people , once you hear the words , you can figure which of the two entrees they apply to .
In fact , the sound symbolism is so strong that in phrasing the question in the paragraph above , I took the liberty of transposing the " right " answers .
Takete and maluma are n't real words in any language I know .
But Oxford University scientist Charles Spence has been working with hot - ticket English chef Heston Blumenthal on experiments to find out how people combine auditory and gustatory experience .
They 're looking into what certain words " taste " like .
And he 's found that the connections between brie and maluma and cranberries and takete are very strong .
As they told the BBC recently , " The idea is that you get people to take part in the experiment by giving them two plates of food , and saying ' one of these is a takete and one is a maluma , ' but not tell them which is which until they 've eaten it . "
Dr. Spence and Chef Blumenthal 's work goes way beyond the kind of menu- prettification efforts such as the renaming of " dogfish " as " rock salmon " or " grayfish . "
What they 're exploring is the phenomenon of synesthesia , in which stimulation of one sense produces a secondary response in another sense .
People who experience this may associate color with sound – they " hear " music as color , for instance .
An extreme case of this may be James Wannerton , president of the UK Synaesthesia Association , who last year told a conference in Edinburgh , Scotland , how images and words trigger taste sensations in his mouth .
Saying the name of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair left him with a taste of dried coconut .
" ' George Bush ' gives me a taste similar to the crusty potato bit on top of a cottage pie . "
But Spence 's work suggests that synesthesia is a far more widespread phenomenon .
He and his colleague Cesare Parise conducted an experiment in which subjects were exposed to an image of a black dot , either smaller or larger , and to one of two tones , higher or lower pitched .
They were asked which came first .
Did they hear the tone first , or see the dot ?
Researchers found that their subjects naturally matched the larger dot and the lower - pitched tone , so much so that they saw them as one phenomenon .
When the dot and the tone " matched , " the research subjects had trouble telling which came first .
When the dot and the tone did n't match , subjects found it easier to separate them perceptually .
Something similar happened when they experimented with two other images , one a vaguely starfish shape and the other more sharply angular .
The angular shape " matched , " in the minds of subjects , the higher pitched tone .
Spence thinks his findings can be built upon to enhance people 's experience of flavor .
Blumenthal may be able to incorporate words in some fashion into the dining experience at The Fat Duck , his much - honored restaurant in Bray , England .
It all gives new meaning to the idea of " I 'll eat my words . "
And meanwhile , make mine maluma .

[ RedState 's ] Erick Erickson ’s trying to get a counter - boycott going because " If they are successful , they will move beyond Beck to others . "
A noble impulse , but is that really true ?
My hunch is that companies have limited patience for this sort of thing ; they ’ll throw a bone to an angry constituency if it ’s sufficiently large and focused on one show , but the more targets the boycotters add , the greater the headaches for corporate advertisers who are looking for airtime and sensitive about not alienating other constituencies by getting too political .
Even here , the great lefty victory over Beck appears only to have resulted in ads being shifted to other Fox programs .
If Media Matters et al. suddenly decide they want O’Reilly and Hannity boycotted too , how many companies will oblige them knowing that it means sacrificing the biggest viewing audience in cable news ?
The most depressing thing about this is n’t the fear of lefties taking down conservative broadcasters , it ’s the fact that Beck is catching hell while [ Keith Olbermann ] , a man who eagerly compares Republicans to terrorists when he is n’t busy screaming about right - wing " hate speech , " rests easily in the thought that his own advertising is secure .
Uh-oh !
Are they worried about a " chilling effect " on hateful rhetoric ?
As we continue press corporate enablers on their de facto support of this kind of hate speech , the right is beginning to understand that this sort of beyond - the - pale , formerly unchecked game of " who can take it the furthest " has it 's limits .
Now , it may finally have started to backfire on them .
They know we are watching , waiting to seize on these sorts of moments in the future .
There is blood in the water , and they know it .
Even the MSM is taking notice of a boycott in a non-dismissive way for once .
From NewsCorp 's own Marketwatch.com today :
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
In what is shaping up to be one of the more effective boycott campaigns in years , advertisers are abandoning the " Glenn Beck " show on Fox News following the host 's incendiary comments that President Barack Obama is a " racist " and has a " deep - seated hatred for white people . " ...
Whether the show can survive with advertisers deserting it depends on whether they can replaced and how much money Fox News is prepared to lose before pulling the plug .
It also , [ Northwestern University Professor ]
Greening said , " depends on Beck 's level of contrition or how he explains it .
But unless he does something to rehabilitate himself , he has probably crossed the line into obscurity . "
Their response has been varied , from a spattering of insignificant counter boycotts to a bizarre , petty counter boycott against Jon Stewart 's advertisers of all people .
Of course none of this will work , but at this point they are powerless and do not know how to respond .
We however do know how to respond .
If you have n't already , contact the remaining Glenn Beck advertisers , and be firm but respectful !
If you already have , contact more of them .
We 've made great progress , we 've got them running scared , let 's not quit now !
Remember Dan Rather !
[ UPDATE ]
The rec list ?
I 'm speechless !
We 've got a whole week , keep those letters , emails , and phone calls coming , we wo n't stop until there is no one but Cash4Gold.com left !
UPDATE X2 : Looks like we 've struck a nerve in Glenn , but based on his past emotional breakdowns that is no major feat .
Naturally , he has developed a Palin - esque persecution / faux populism reaction .
From his Twitter :
" I have made VERY powerful people VERY angry .
They have tried to cover their tracks .
They have failed .
Will expose and ask 4 your help VERY soon .
Gee Glenn , why do n't you cry about it ?
UPDATE X3
Thanks to schmiss for this delusional screed from Legal Insurrection :
Is it any surprise or coincidence that this boycott is taking place against a vocal opponent of Obama 's health care restructuring and cap - and - trade plans just at the moment that opposition to such plans is coming to a head ?
No , the boycott simply is one part of the overall push to silence opposition , much like calling protesters un-American and political terrorists .
Nonetheless , I am happy to see this boycott .
Here are my ten top reasons : 1 . The boycott will fail , as do virtually all boycotts .
2 . The failure of the boycott will be a huge victory for freedom of speech .
3 . The failure of the boycott will diminish the power of the boycotters .
4 . The diminished power of the boycotters will empower grassroots opposition to health care restructuring and cap - and - trade .
5 . The boycott reveals once again that many liberals are hypocrites who only want freedom for their speech .
6 . The boycott reveals that the left - wing blogosphere is afraid of other voices being heard .
7 . The boycott reminds us that large corporations are spineless in the face of liberal pressure groups .
8 . The boycott reminds us also that we should not confuse large corporations with free markets or free enterprise or freedom .
9 . The boycott will tell us whether Fox News has a spine .
10 .
The boycott is a reflection that Democrats have few positive arguments in support of their agenda and need to create enemies .
UPDATE : And now a boycott of Whole Foods !
The Left is feeding on itself , like people stranded at a plane wreck on some mountaintop .
In case you were wondering , corporate Whole Foods has no spine .
See ?
The success of the boycott is bad news ... for OBAMA !
UPDATE X4 Many have requested a recent list of Glenn Becks remaining sponsers .
anon2008 has posted a great diary with a list of Glenn Beck 's remaining sponsers .
Many fathers do discuss dating with their tween daughters , but they may be in the dark about what really goes on .
About two thirds of parents think they know " a lot " or " everything " about their tween 's relationships .
But only about half of all tweens agree . [...]
What can you do ?
Before your daughter starts dating , she needs to learn that good relationships are built on respect . [...]
Teach your daughter to recognize the warning signs of abuse . [...]

From a Nebraska TV article by Howard Seidman : What I appreciate about this article is that it does n't fall into the trap of making the victim of dating or relationship abuse responsible for prevention .
The only problem with the article is that it fails to ask fathers to have similar talks with their sons so they too will understand the importance of having healthy relationships .
If parents do n't talk to their sons then those sons may learn by watching boys who develop unhealthy relationships .
Since abuse can have short - term benefits for the abuser , boys may incorrectly view abusers as being successful at relationships .
While more girls are victims of relationship violence than boys we can't forget that boys can also be subjected to abusive or unhealthy behavior .

First Madoff Interview : Can't Believe I Got Away with
It Bernie opens up in prison to talk with lawyers suing his family .
July 28 , 2009  --
In his first prison interview , a buff - looking Bernie Madoff said he could n't believe he got away with his massive Ponzi scheme for so long .
" There were several times that I met with the SEC and thought ' they got me , ' " Madoff told Joseph Cotchett , a San Francisco lawyer threatening to sue his wife , sons and brother on behalf of a group of victims .
Cotchett said he and his partner , Nancy Fineman , met with Madoff for four and a half hours Tuesday afternoon at the federal prison in Butner , NC , where Madoff is serving his 150 - year sentence .
" He looked pretty good and seems to be working out , " said Cotchett .
" He looked a lot better than he has in some months since I 've seen photographs of him . "

Cotchett said Madoff was " very articulate , very direct " and did not appear to hold back anything .
" He talked about how he pulled it off , how many years he got away with it , " the lawyer said .
" I was surprised at how candid he was , " Cotchett told ABCNews.com after the session , the first time Madoff has talked with outside lawyers .
Madoff refused to cooperate with the FBI after his initial , largely untruthful confession last December .

Cotchett said Madoff " did not dodge " any of the questions he asked and that Madoff 's lawyer did not object to any of the questions .
" He obviously wanted to speak with us because in his opinion , certain members of his family knew nothing about it , had no involvement of it , " said Cotchett who was able to arrange the unusual session after threatening to sue Madoff 's wife Ruth .
" He cares about Ruth , " said Cotchett , " but he does n't give a ---- about his two sons , Mark and Andrew . "
The sons have not spoken with their father or mother since Madoff 's arrest on December 11 .
They say there were unaware of the fraud scheme until he confessed to them as his money was running out and it appeared the crime would be exposed .
Cotchett said he did not yet know if he would name Ruth or the sons in the lawsuit , but that he was almost certain to name Madoff 's brother , Peter , who served as the firm 's chief compliance officer .
Peter Madoff has declined to comment but others with knowledge of the case say he maintains he did not know of the scam until two days before his brother 's arrest .

If you need to cheat a polygraph or lie detector test , make sure to only respond to questions with " yes " or " no , " so you do n't reveal any details .
When you 're asked relevant questions , slow your breathing to 15 to 30 breaths each minute , without breathing too deeply , and answer them firmly , seriously , and without hesitation .
Keep in mind that the interviewer will also ask you control questions , which are n't relevant but will help the polygraph measure your physical response when telling the truth .
During control questions , vary your breathing rate by speeding it up , slowing it down , or holding your breath for a few seconds .

Carol is intelligent and beautiful : the perfect mix .
All images by Gianni Peg .
My friend Carol is nice and beautiful .
Anyone would bet she has plenty of dates .
But it turns out that this is not the case .
The fact is that Carol has dated no - one for ages .
And although she is shy by nature , she is also open to adequate proposals and would love to find someone special .
But Carol claims that men do not usually approach her .
She thinks she frightens them away .
Is it just a matter of bad luck ?
Or is it something else ?
Maybe Carol has a distorted perception of reality ?
Luck is an issue that 's naturally addressed in mathematics .
If it is a question of luck , mathematics may shed some light on Carol 's problem .
Let us see .
The Carol dilemma
Consider a man — let 's call him Guy — who is attracted to Carol and has the opportunity to talk to her , let 's say at a coffee bar .
Realising that Carol is shy he considers whether or not to approach her .
Guy considers the possible outcomes :
He talks to Carol and she responds in a friendly manner .
He gets her phone number and a proper date next week .
He does not approach Carol .
He can enjoy another rewarding task ( like reading the last issue of Plus ) .
He talks to Carol and she proves uninterested .
He will feel miserable for a week .
Guy evaluates the outcomes assigning the numbers a , b and 0 to options ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively , with a >b > 0 .
By this he means that he prefers ( a ) to ( b ) and ( b ) to the worst scenario ( c ) .
Now Guy realises that he is not the only man in town .
He is aware of the fact that the outcomes depend dramatically on the actions of other guys independently considering whether to approach Carol or not .
Assume that Guy thinks that he will get ( a ) only if no one else approaches Carol and ( c ) when he is not the only one approaching Carol .
Of course if he does not talk to Carol , he gets ( b ) .
Guy 's modesty seems understandable if he does not trust himself as a strong candidate in the face of competition .
The fact that his choices depend so strongly on the choices of others is what makes his an interactive decision problem .
The study of how individual behaviour is conditioned by the social environment is the objective of social psychology .
The interaction involved here is the trademark of game theory , which was developed in the twentieth century .
Maths about Carol
The solution of Guy 's problem , and that of all of the guys , is a bundle of actions deemed rational within the described framework .
The assumption that everyone behaves rationally may seem slightly unrealistic , but it 's crucial in the game theoretical approach , since mathematics can't account for someone behaving irrationally or against their own interest .
The symmetry of the problem —
Guy may be anyone — implies that all will act in the same way , since all will make the same rational considerations .
Rationality permits to discard the symmetric solution in which no one talks to Carol : given that none of the others talk to her , Guy gets a better outcome by approaching her , so rationality would imply that Guy does approach her .
A similar reasoning permits the discarding of the solution in which everyone talks to Carol .
There are no more apparent symmetric solutions .
To approach or not to approach Carol .
Guy needs to be subtle to proceed .
He may think of solving his dilemma by tossing a fair coin .
This amounts to Guy being totally uncertain about what to do .
If we admit that " being uncertain " is a possible solution to his dilemma , is the 50 - 50 chance truly rational , or would another level of uncertainty , say 30 - 70 in favour of approaching Carol , be better ?
Is there even a rational way to be uncertain ?
This seems an interesting idea .
Let us see where it takes us .
Guy 's uncertainty is described by the probability of approaching Carol ( so is the probability of not approaching her ) .
By symmetry , everyone 's uncertainty is represented by the same number - everyone independently makes his choice according to .
The goal is to find the best value of .
The value can be obtained indirectly via the following observation .
The bundle of common uncertainties defined by is rational only if Guy ( and any other guy ) associates the same level of " reward " with his two possible actions , approaching Carol or not approaching her , given that the rest are all uncertain with probability .
Otherwise there is no uncertainty about what to do :
Guy would go for the action with the higher reward .
But how can Guy assign a reward value to a bundle of uncertainties ?
One possible answer , given by John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern , is to average the reward values assigned to all possible bundles of actions with weights equal to their probability of occurrence .
This is called expected valuation .
Rationality based on expected valuations has been the major paradigm for decision making analysis since the 1950s .
If there are guys deciding independently , then there are possible bundles of actions .
Guy makes his calculation as follows :
The bundle in which only our Guy approaches Carol yields ( a ) - with reward value – and occurs with probability since all decisions are taken independently .
Any bundle in which both Guy and someone else approach Carol yields ( c ) and has reward value 0 .
Thus the expected value of approaching Carol is
Any bundle of actions in which Guy does not talk to Carol has value whatever the others do .
Thus the expected value of not approaching Carol is clearly .
Guy is uncertain about what to do when these two values coincide :
Solving for he gets
Calculating chances .
Sincelies between 0 and 1 and therefore defines a proper probability .
The conclusion is that anyone should approach Carol with probability This is the rational solution for the Carol dilemma when she has identical admirers .
Since , for not too large it is possible that in which case and the odds are that Guy will talk to Carol .
However , as soon as is large enough , the possibility of no one approaching Carol becomes more likely .
In fact , approaches as gets large , no matter how stunning Carol may be .
Hence the following ( un ) veiled mechanism may be inhibiting Guy from approaching Carol : ( 1 ) The larger the number of Carol 's admirers the more probable it is that Guy will not talk to her ; ( 2 ) The more attractive Carol is , the more likely it is that there will be lots of guys considering this decision problem .
Guy is thus led to believe that is large and correspondingly small .
In consequence he will very likely choose curling up with Plus rather than risking Carol 's rejection .
The Carol syndrome
The important point of Carol 's feeling about frightening guys away is not the probability but the probability of no one talking to her .
Since all the guys act independently ,
In this expressionincreases asincreases .
The entry of new potential dates adds to the probability that Carol is left alone .
Also , as gets large , does not vanish but tends to Therefore , always lies between two values :
and the odds are that nobody will talk to Carol .
This is true irrespective of the number of guys and it becomes worse for Carol as that number increases .
Carol 's perception that she scares men away is not a delusion after all .
According to the mathematics above , she may be justified in thinking that guys stay away from her .
It is not a matter of bad luck but a collateral effect of interactive rationality .
A paradoxical consequence is that Carol 's attractiveness acts as a repellent .
This surprising phenomenon — which we call the Carol syndrome — is a by - product of psychological social interaction .
The Carol syndrome in operation .
Scary evidence
The Carol syndrome is not a theoretical artifact .
As striking as it may appear , the syndrome is often reported by attractive women and men .
A web search brings up some notorious cases .
In an interview for The Sunday Times in February 2008 , American actress Uma Thurman was reported as saying that " men rarely chatted her up . "
She considered her bad luck with men a life - long curse .
The same was true of American star singer Jessica Simpson who declared in a TV show in September 2006 : " I scare guys away " .
Another example , reported in March 2009 by The Telegraph online , is that of 19 - year old British actress Emma Watson , who said that her starring character in Harry Potter ’s saga , while bringing her worldwide fame , " scared boys away " .
Hence Carol 's luck is not odd , although it obviously differs from celebrities like Ms Thurman .
Mathematics can explain how .
The number of Ms Thurman 's admirers is huge so that the ceiling value is a good approximation for and this somehow eases Thurman ’s sufferings .
For Carol , is not as large , but the ratio – and in turn – is closer to 1 .
This is what causes Carol 's Carol syndrome .

( CNN ) --
A sailor found dead earlier this week at California 's Camp Pendleton was shot while standing sentry , and a fire was set in an attempt to cover up evidence , the U.S. Navy said .
Seaman August Provost , shown on his MySpace page , was killed while on sentry duty at Camp Pendleton .
The death of Seaman August Provost of Houston , Texas , is being investigated as a homicide , Capt .
Matt Brown told reporters on Thursday .
A sailor is in custody in the case , Brown said .
Although at least one of Provost 's relatives said she believes he was killed because of his sexual orientation and his race , Brown said there was no indication the killing was a hate crime .
A U.S. congressman also said on Friday there are indications Provost may have been killed because of his sexual orientation .
Provost was killed while he was standing guard as a sentry for the Assault Craft Unit 5 compound at Camp Pendleton , Brown said .
He had begun the shift at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday , and his body was discovered by his replacement around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday .
" Preliminarily , it appears that Seaman Provost suffered gunshot wounds and it appears that someone attempted to destroy evidence by lighting a fire at Seaman Provost 's assigned place of duty , " Brown said .
Provost 's aunt , Rose Roy , of Beaumont , Texas , said by telephone on Friday that her nephew had told her he was being harassed because of his sexual orientation and because he was African - American .
She described him as bisexual .
" He mentioned it to me and a couple other family members , " she said of the harassment , and said he had first told her about it sometime last year .
" He was frustrated by it , " she said .
She said she had advised him to speak to someone of higher rank , but said she was n't sure if he had done so .
" He went to serve and protect , but he did n't get the protection , " she said .
Brown said Thursday that he had no information on claims of harassment .
Asked whether she believed her nephew was killed because of race and sexual orientation , she said , " In my heart , I do . "
She added , " it was like an execution - style killing , and nobody does that unless you have that kind of hatred in your heart . "
The Navy has one sailor in custody who " has been linked to the commission of this crime through both physical evidence and his own statement , " Brown said .
Watch Brown talk about the killing as a random act »
He did not identify the sailor , who has not been charged with wrongdoing .
It is unclear if the sailor served with Provost in the same unit .
A second sailor whom authorities initially questioned has since been released , Brown said .
He said the Navy has no indication that Provost 's death is a hate crime , although he emphasized the investigation is ongoing .
" What I can tell you , unequivocally at this point , based on the preliminary information that we have , is that regardless of the person standing watch in that sentry station , this crime would have most likely been carried out in the same way , " he said .
" In other words , another sailor could have been on that post and would have been the victim of this crime . "
Rep. Bob Filner , a California Democrat , has called for a full and transparent investigation .
Asked Friday if Provost was killed because of his sexual orientation , he said , " There are indications that that 's the case .
His family says he was harassed . "
Filner said he was on Camp Pendleton hours after Provost 's body was found , although no one told him of the killing .
" When I was on the base for another event , the commander of the base was sitting next to me and never mentioned a word , which I find very strange , " he said .
He said he was asking for the " truth of what happened . "
" We 're going to ask , if I may coin a phrase , and we hope that they tell , " he said .
Roy said her nephew was " a good kid , " who did n't have a " bad bone in his body " and had loved the Navy .
He joined the service in March 2008 , according to Brown .
" He was a people person , " Roy said .
" If he could give you the shirt off his back , he would . "
A funeral has been planned for July 10 in Houston , she said .
" We loved him dearly , " she said .
All About Murder and Homicide • Camp Pendleton
Cyber attacks that caused a wave of Web site outages in the U.S. and South Korea used 86 IP addresses in 16 countries , South Korea 's spy agency told lawmakers Friday , amid suspicions North Korea was behind the effort .
The countries include South Korea , the United States , Japan and Guatemala , Chung Chin-sup , a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee , told reporters .
He spoke after being briefed by the National Intelligence Service , or NIS , on preliminary investigations of the IP addresses _ the Internet equivalent of a street address or phone number .
The assaults on Web sites in the U.S. and South Korea have been described as so - called denial of service attacks in which floods of computers try to connect to a single site at the same time , overwhelming the server .
The NIS also briefed lawmakers on circumstantial and technical reasons for believing that North Korea could be behind the attacks , Chung said without elaborating .
But the spy agency cautioned it was too early to conclude that North Korea was responsible as the investigations were still under way , according to Park Young - sun , another member of the intelligence committee .
" So far , North Korea was not included among the 16 countries ' IP addresses , " she told reporters .
U.S. authorities also eyed North Korea as the origin of the trouble , though they warned it would be difficult to identify the attackers quickly .
Three U.S. officials said this week while Internet addresses have been traced to North Korea , that does not necessarily mean the attack involved Kim Jong Il 's government in Pyongyang .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter .
It follows a turbulent few months in which secretive North Korea has engaged in a series of threats and provocative actions widely condemned by the international community , including a nuclear test and missile launches .
North Korea has not responded to the allegations of its involvement in the Web site outages .
On Thursday , seven South Korean Web sites _ one belonging to the government and the others to private entities _ were attacked in the third round of cyber assaults , said Ku Kyo - young , an official from the state - run Korea Communications Commission , but most were back up and running quickly .
As previously , it was caused by so - called denial of service attacks , Ku said , adding that attacks were continuing on the seven sites Friday , but they were still accessible .
Some 50 cases of problems regarding computer hard disks or data were reported Friday morning in South Korea , the commission said , without giving details .
Park , the South Korean lawmaker , said Thursday that a senior intelligence official told her the NIS suspects the North because the country earlier warned it wo n't tolerate what it claimed were South Korean moves to participate in a U.S. - led cyber warfare exercise , according to a statement from the opposition Democratic Party .
South Korean media reported in May that North Korea was running a cyber warfare unit that tries to hack into U.S. and South Korean military networks to gather confidential information and disrupt service .
Japan was also being extra vigilant against possible cyber attacks , although there was no sign it had been targeted , officials said .
Japan has a " cyber clean center , " set up in 2006 , to protect its government computers from attacks , including a decoy computer to analyze possible viruses , Kazuaki Nakakoshi , an information security official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications , said Friday .
" No attacks targeting Japan have been confirmed , " he said in a telephone interview .

An Old Time Western Christmas
Many times I sit of when I was a youngster under the age of five when I lived in Kaycee , Wyoming .
All of the traditions we had when I was a child that still to this day brings back joyous memories and warmth in my heart .
Our traditions were almost similar to some but in a way a lot different since we grew up the 1800s way of doing things on the ranch .
We had traditions such as going out with my grand daddy with our sled and hand cutting down the Christmas tree in our woods behind our house , then loading the tree on our sled to bring it back home to set it up in the living room next to the fire place .
Another of our traditions was while my grand daddy and my brothers were setting up the tree and getting it straight us girls ( a family of 8 grand children ) would be in the kitchen with my grandma making crafts and Christmas decorations for the door and the tree .
We would make stars out of shell noodles , paper chains , popcorn balls and paint these different colors , we would make chains out of wire , paper cut outs to place on the tree and Christmas stars and decorations out of dough .
Grandma would make a huge turkey , home made mashed potatoes , a ham , home made bread and biscuits , apple pies from scratch and last but not least her famous pumpkin pie .
Oh the aroma in that kitchen I can still smell to this day .
All of us girls would help her in the kitchen as well preparing all of the food .
When the wranglers and their families came in for supper we would all gather around the piano as my grandma would play Christmas songs and sing carols until it was time to open the presents .
After singing Christmas carols we would all gather around the table and grab a plate of food and fill our selves so full of grandmas great cooking .
On Christmas day grand daddy used to always hitch up a team of horses to the sleigh to take us kids for a sleigh ride .
Oh what a joyous time we all had when I was very young living with my grand daddy and my grand mother .
These are the joyous Christmas traditions that times I miss the most .
After Sami Salameh 's house was destroyed ( l ) his 14 - member family moved to an illegally built three - room house ( r )
After Israel 's housing minister called on Jews to move to the north of the country to stop what he described as " the spread of Arabs " there , the BBC 's Katya Adler reports on the struggle for land in the area .
Sami Salameh has taken me to what used to be his home before the Israeli authorities flattened it .
Metal rods and slices of skirting board are all that 's left , among an expanse of sun-scorched wild grass .
He has brought along some photographs and kicks the earth as he shows them to me .
The wiry 65 - year - old man is angry and emotional .
" When the house collapsed so did my dreams , " he says .
He insists this plot of earth belonged to his family dating back to Ottoman times .
But Israel has claimed it as state land .
He is not allowed to build here now .
Mr Salameh 's new home is in the Arab town of Majdal Krum , in northern Israel .
It 's illegally built , as is the whole neighbourhood .
" Zionism is not racism ...
Northern Israel is Arab , it 's Jewish , it 's Druze - we have to value and admire each other "
Ron Shani
Head of Misgav regional council
His family of 14 lives in three rooms .
The sewage system is poor .
Mr Salameh 's wife , Ashi , tells me the atmosphere in the house is listless and depressed .
He blames their birthright - living as Arabs in the Jewish state of Israel , he says .
" I lost everything when they demolished my house .
If I had equal rights , I would n't be in this mess .
Jewish communities get building permits easily .
They have electricity , water , sewage , street lights and parks .
How come they live like that and we do n't ? "
Just outside Mr Salameh 's home , a group of boys plays football in the street .
Their identity , like his , is complex .
They are Israeli but also Arab .
Their families stayed put in Israel after its war of independence 60 years ago .
Israel 's Basic Law says all its citizens are equal , but Israeli Arabs say some Israelis are more equal than others .
Neighbouring the town is the leafy , affluent , self - proclaimed Zionist village of Manof .
It is one of the growing predominantly Jewish communities encouraged in the north by Israeli governments since the late 1970s .
' No discrimination ' Northern Israel is home to the highest concentration of Israeli Arabs .
Q&A : Israeli Arabs Israeli - Arabs defiant on loyalty laws Israeli Arabs torn by Gaza conflict
They complain they are being squeezed .
Intentionally .
But Ron Shani , the head of the Regional Council , insists there is no discrimination here .
" Zionism is not racism .
Not for me .
Not for most people who live in Israel .
Northern Israel is Arab , it 's Jewish , it 's Druze .
We have to value and admire each other .
" We have a few Bedouin villages in my council .
And it 's not true that Israeli Arabs are barred from our Zionist Jewish villages - as long as they understand and accept this is a village under the Jewish Israeli ethos .
" Of course I came to live in the north with Zionist ideals in mind but Misgav villages were formed on government - owned land .
No confiscation was done from Arab - owned land . "
But a lot of Arab land was turned into Israeli state property in the years following Israel 's independence .
The majority of Arab land expropriated was labelled " deserted property " by Israel 's authorities before its acquisition by the state .
Towns ' restricted ' Hanan Swaid is an Israeli - Arab member of Israel 's parliament , the Knesset .
He takes me to a vantage point overlooking the Israeli - Arab town of Sakhnin .
An Israeli government commission found many Israeli - Arab towns are effectively blocked from expanding
He points out the problems Israeli Arabs face - overcrowding , poverty and the ways , he says , Israel 's authorities strangle Arab towns , restricting construction , progress and growth .
" You can see surrounding Sakhnin this military base - which of course prevents Sakhnin and the people from using these lands which they used to own , " he says .
" You can see there are only tens of metres between the houses of Sakhnin and the industrial zone .
" Of course all the benefits of this industrial zone go to Misgav - which is the Jewish regional council . "
An Israeli government commission came to the same conclusions .
The Orr Commission published a report on the status of Israeli Arabs in 2003 .
It says Israel has effectively blocked the expansion of its Israeli Arab towns by surrounding them with highways , nature reserves , Jewish councils , military zones or other entities .
' Cultural , not political '
The Israeli - Arab population has roughly increased sevenfold since Israel 's independence .
Bearing in mind loss of land and building restrictions , human rights groups say the land available to Israeli Arabs has actually shrunk over the years .
" We do n't intend to put them in ghettos , or limit their growth , they receive all the rights "
Ariel Atias ,
Israeli housing minister The Orr Commission concluded that " [ the Israeli ] government 's handling of the Arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory " .
Hanan Swaid says it is not that the rights of Israeli Arabs are ignored , but they are given low priority .
" Israel is Jewish and democratic in theory but on the ground the two things do n't mix .
" The definition of Israel as a Jewish state leads to giving the best to Jewish citizens .
We Arabs are therefore discriminated against . "
In Jerusalem I put the complaints and concerns of Israeli Arabs to Israel 's Housing Minister Ariel Atias .
He dismissed them .
He has caused quite a storm here , suggesting what he called the " spread of the Arabs " in northern Israel should be curbed and urging Jews and Arabs in Israel to live separately .
" We believe that the land of Israel was given to us Jews by the Lord .
Eighty percent of Israelis are Jewish , " he says .
" Having said that , there are citizens of Israel who are Arab .
We want them to identify with the goals of the state of Israel .
We do n't intend to put them in ghettos , or limit their growth , they receive all the rights .
" They work for us , with us in factories , in all the restaurants .
But each one wants to live with his own culture .
It 's not that , God forbid , we have anything against Muslims .
We want to prevent friction .
You may not like what I 'm saying , but it 's cultural .
Not political . "
One in five Israelis is Arab .
But academic studies , such as those completed by Oren Yiftachel , a professor at Israel 's Ben Gurion University , suggest this 20 % of Israel 's population lives on around 3 % of Israel 's lands .
Living separately is one thing , but Israeli Arabs say no new Arab town has been built for them since 1948 , when the state of Israel was created .

The outpouring of local memorial support was overwhelming .
Photo Gallery Germany 's Most Beautiful Natural Wonders
What is Germany 's favorite natural wonder ?
This is the question posed by the Heinz Sielmann Foundation , which is putting 42 of the country 's most beautiful sites to the public vote .
The Obama administration relaxed the requirements for government - backed mortgage modifications yesterday .
The program , a $ 75 billion assistance plan announced earlier this year , originally allowed homeowners with loan - to - value ratios up to 105 % qualify for refinancing , provided the loan is backed by Fannie Mae ( NYSE : FNM ) or Freddie Mac ( NYSE : FRE ) .
That limit has now been upped to 125 % .
The rationale here is simple :
As home prices keep nosediving , more and more homeowners are grossly underwater ( they owe more than their home is worth ) .
The original mortgage modification program was failing to help as many people as Washington wanted .
And focusing on housing makes sense from a recovery standpoint .
This mess started in housing , and it'll surely end there .
The root pain of everyone from Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) to Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) to Home Depot ( NYSE : HD ) is all linked back to housing in one way or another .
As Warren Buffett recently noted , fix housing and " the world will change in a big way . "
But -- and this is a very significant but -- past evidence of the effectiveness of mortgage modifications is really , really atrocious .
A recent report by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency detailing the amount of redefaults , or troubled loans that find their way back into default after modification , shows just what I 'm talkin ' about .
Of the modified loans 30 or more days delinquent , here 's what it found :
Modification Date ( 2008 ) Three Months After Modification Six Months After Modification Nine Months After Modification 12 Months After Modification Q1 40.4 % 53.0 % 59.9 % 63.3 % Q2 46.6 % 58.8 % 61.1 % -- Q3 50.4 % 59.5 % -- -- Q4 45.9 % -- -- --
Source : Comptroller of the Currency , Office of Thrift Supervision , June 2009 .
One year out , over 60 % of modified mortgages end up where they started … in default .
What 's really amazing is how quickly things reverted : Just 90 days after modification , almost half of mortgages were back in default .
That 's utterly pathetic .
Rising joblessness is the most obvious answer to why so many modifications fail .
But that alone hardly accounts for the ungodly redefault rate .
When unemployment goes up a few percentage points while redefaults hit 60 % , something else is surely at play .
And it is
One of the big factors fueling redefaults is just what the Obama administration seems to be pooh - poohing : underwater homeowners .
When your house is worth less than your mortgage , there 's a huge incentive to give up and walk away even if you can make your monthly payments .
The logic here is simple :
The beauty of homeownership is based on a saying that goes something like " with every mortgage payment , you 'll own a little bit more of your house . "
But when you 're underwater , the only thing you " own " is the liability .
Monthly payments decrease your debt , but you still do n't own one inch of the house .
The bank does .
Taking away this fundamental sense of ownership zaps the incentive to keep making payments .
The sensible thing to do , many find , is to stop paying and walk away .
This is suicide on your credit rating and a nightmare for housing - heavy banks like Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) and Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) , but the pros often outweigh the cons .
When the job market is this tight , becoming mobile again is worth its weight in gold .
When it comes down to it , high monthly payments are n't what are pushing many homeowners into default .
It 's the fact that their mortgage balances are so high that it does n't make sense to keep making payments .
Moving on
Now back to our Office of Thrift Supervision report .
In the first quarter , a scant 1.8 % of modifications actually reduced mortgage principal -- the kind of alteration that entices underwater homeowners to keep making payments .
Most were interest rate reductions , or capitalizations of missed payments and fees .
The latter is literally just taking debt you owed yesterday and tacking it on to what you 'll owe tomorrow .
Sober people think this is an effective way to solve an excessive debt problem .
Honestly .
And that 's why the redefault rate is so high : Underwater homeowners are still highly incentivized to default , even with reduced monthly payments .
And as home prices fall , their ranks are growing by the day .
Modifications in their current form are , more often than not , just delaying the inevitable .
This all loops back to a painful reality :
The only way to climb out of the housing mess is to let prices find a true bottom .
Ultimately , that means those who bought homes they could never afford will have to bite the bullet and move on .
There 's really no way around that .

- Other atheists enraged -
Copenhagen , Denmark ( Berlingske Tidende ) —
Danish atheist threatens illustrator at Danish newspaper " Information " after discovery of blank illustrations .
In an angry letter to the illustrator , a Danish atheist warned the illustrator that he will suffer fatally from the twelve blank pages that were discovered on his desk last week .
Twelve blank illustrations have triggered the rage of Danish atheists who demand an apology .
The Danish Atheists and Non-believers Group ( DANG ) feels that the twelve drawings are intentionally mocking their non-belief , but have until now remained relatively calm as the story about the blank pages had not hit mainstream media until the threat was issued .
The police believe that the atheist may have been inspired by the rage following the spiteful Danish caricatures of the Moslem prophet Mohammed , but a spokesperson from DANG denies the connection :
" The illustrator himself may have been inspired to not create twelve drawings , but our reaction cannot be compared to the Moslem protests .
The caricatures of Mohammed are a Danish tradition of maintaining a national identity by mocking out - groups that Moslems must learn to accept .
That 's what we mean by freedom of speech in this country .
It 's the right of the majority to say what they want against any minority .
But the twelve blank pages is the complete opposite .
It is an abuse of the freedom of speech .
The illustrator is mocking our right to say nothing . "
DANG has complained to the Danish Prime Minister , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , but the Prime Minister refuses to acknowledge the atheist complaints .
" Our country is founded on Christian principles , and atheists must learn to accept our dedication to that tradition , " says Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen .
" That left - wing subversive newspaper should stay put on most issues , but as was the case for our official political newsletter , Jyllands Posten , I will not deny any newspaper its right to say anything that supports our government 's policy . "
The editor of Information , Palle Weis , will not apologize to the atheists , who argue that the newspaper supports its illustrator 's intent by not publishing the blank pages , thus making the absence of religion even more evident .
Palle
Weis denies any such intent in today 's editorial where he explains that :
“ ” Democracy demands a free press , and the very minute any media were to publish specific material on demand , it would be the end of our civilization as we know it .
When certain areas are consistently omitted by the media , then it is not a sign of persecution when one particular such occasion is not mentioned in the media either .
The media propagates religious views , and if this tradition were broken and atheism or other scholarly or secular aspects were to receive attention , our believing readers would experience persecution in the form of a deliberate deemphasis of their role .
No atheist can honestly say today that they are suddenly being targeted when there was nothing about them to begin with .
The atheist rage in Denmark has already spread to other countries .
Atheist spokesperson in the US , Bill McConnell , states that atheists in the US would be wise to support their Danish brethren , as the Danish illustrator portrays a deliberately misleading image of the atheist stance .
Bill McConnell explains :
" Open any publication of ours and you 'll find that ninety - five percent is bashing of Christian theology .
Most of us are former Christians , and we need Christianity as a counter - belief .
But these twelve illustrations do n't even have a caricature of Jesus on them , and no atheist would be caught dead not thinking about Jesus or God .
It is completely wrong to assume that atheists can exist outside of a Christian discourse , but that 's exactly the misrepresentation that these illustrations are deliberately trying to convey . "
The furor over the twelve illustrations has birthed a new group , Moderate Atheist Danes ( MAD ) , whose goal is to ease the tension between non-believers .
MAD calls for a broader non-belief and disagrees with the traditional dependency on Christianity .
In a press release , MAD explains that in a nation with multiple cultures atheism cannot focus exclusively on traditional Christianity , but must also take into account the non-existence of other gods .
Fearing another wave of boycotts of Danish products , Danish manufacturers urge the libertarian Danish Prime Minister to remember that economy has higher priority than human beings .
Industry analysts say that the manufacturers need not worry , however .
" When Danish dairy giant Arla recently lost money as a result of the Mohammed caricatures , it was this very concern that softened the Prime Minister 's stance against the ethnic groups that he had previously declared arch - enemies of our state and culture .
Arla is great , and the Prime Minister will follow the will of Arla , " says chief of the Danish government 's Industry Interest Group , Thorleif Nielsen .

The California Extreme classic arcade games show returns in Santa Clara this weekend .
The Cal Extreme show is a time travel experience .
You 'll see kids dressed like extras from " Happy Days " playing pinball , heavy metal types resting in front of a big screen television watching Rush videos and a lot of people playing doubles on Asteroids , while debating the eternal video game geek question :
What 's the best arcade game of all time ?
Below is a nine - best list , compiled by myself and fellow Chronicle video game critics Erick Wong and Christopher T. Fong .
We stipulate that other gamers ' lists will be different , and invite readers to add more to the comments section of the SFGate.com version of this story .
( Just do n't argue with our Tron choice .
If you did n't think that game ruled , then you did n't play it . )
9. Dragon's Lair ( 1983 ) : So what if the game was difficult to play , repetitive and always seemed to always be broken at your local pizza parlor .
The laserdisc game provided an unbelievable leap in video game graphics , the animation by Disney exile Don Bluth was amazing and Dirk the Daring made gangly guys look heroic .
( Peter Hartlaub )
8. Battlezone ( Atari , 1980 ) : With its periscope monitor and radar - assisted , 360 - degree combat mechanics , this tank fighting simulation was one of the first truly immersive video games .
The vector graphics were awesome and the game looked simple but played complicated , so no two battles were the same .
( P.H. )
7. Final Fight ( Capcom , 1989 ) :
The game was n't played for its typically bad 1980s story line but for its bad ' 80s arcade violence .
Final
Fight defined the term " button mashing , " where the gamer honed their finger 's stamina and dexterity .
With its popularity , Final Fight was copied by others , ushering in a Golden Age of beat - 'em - up action games .
( Christopher T. Fong )
6. X - Men : ( Konami , 1992 ) : The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game may have provided the blueprint , but X - Men upped the ante by hosting six players at once with two monitors side by side for a widescreen experience .
Some characters were less fun than the others ( you 'd think Cyclops would use his optic blasts more often ) , but the diversity made for a good team dynamic .
( Erick Wong )
5. After Burner ( Sega , 1987 ) :
The joystick itself was a standout - how cool were the separate buttons for missiles and guns , as well as the force feedback ?
But the sit - down version that rocked back and forth was as close as you could get to experiencing the dogfighting of " Top Gun " at the time .
Well worth the then - extravagant 75 cents .
( E.W. )
4. Robotron 2084 ( Williams Electronics , 1982 ) :
The controls of this game were the big innovation - one joystick moved your character in any direction and a second joystick fired your laser cannon .
But the simple survival horror game play was the biggest draw , providing a nonstop adrenaline - pumping experience .
( P.H )
3. Tron ( Midway , 1982 ) : Probably the biggest no - brainer in gaming , and with the exception of the disc dueling ( which would come in a later game ) , the four mini - games that you actually got to choose from captured the movie perfectly .
And Wendy Carlos ' film score probably sounds better here than in the movie .
( E.W. )
2. Star Wars ( Atari , 1983 ) : You 've got to love a video game that has Sir Alec Guinness doing the voice work .
Even better , the game play was exciting and felt like you were immersed in the movie .
You could play Star Wars for hours and never get tired of it .
And did we mention we love vector graphics ?
( P.H. )
1. Donkey Kong ( Nintendo , 1981 ) : Nearly three decades later , they 're making entire documentaries about this incredible video game .
Donkey Kong helped launched Nintendo , which remains a video game juggernaut .
And the game is still easy to pick up and nearly impossible to master , with no end of surprises .
( P.H. )
Honorable mentions : Space Invaders ( Midway , 1978 ) ; Defender ( Williams , 1980 ) ; Food Fight ( Atari , 1983 ) ; Omega Race ( Midway , 1981 ) ; Tempest ( Atari , 1981 ) ; Galaga ( Midway , 1981 ) ; Sinistar ( Williams , 1982 ) ; Punch Out !!

A small Web development and open source software company called CityWare was recently named alongside Google , Yahoo , Amazon and other software giants in a patent infringement lawsuit .
What makes this unusual is that CityWare has no products or customers and no longer exists .
The company was formed by software developer Nate Neel in 2004 , but folded soon after due to lack of customers .
The art of patent trolling has inherited an important maxim from the real estate business : location is everything .
The defunct company became the victim of a patent infringement lawsuit because it was operating in the Eastern District of Texas , a jurisdiction that is notoriously friendly to patent trolls .
Bedrock Computer Technologies , the company that filed the patent suit , likely named CityWare in the suit solely to increase the chances of having the case heard in that region .
Another characteristic that makes this case unusual is the person behind it .
Bedrock Computer Technologies is owned by David Garrod , a former Goodwin Procter lawyer who is an active contributor to patent reform efforts .
Garrod is leading an initiative against false patent markings in collaboration with PubPat , a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2003 to fight against abuses of the patent system .
Garrod contends that the technology companies infringe Patent 5,893,120 , which describes " methods and apparatus for information storage and retrieval using a hashing technique with external chaining and on - the - fly removal of expired data . "
It 's a textbook example of patent trolling : a lawsuit over a relatively broad and dubious patent executed by a company that makes nothing itself against a random assortment of deep - pocketed industry leaders .
The fact that CityWare , which does n't even exist , was named in the suit to help obtain a favorable venue further erodes the credibility of the lawsuit 's claims .
IP reporter Joe Mullin tracked down PubPat founder Dan Ravicher and asked if he was aware of Garrod 's outside activities .
Ravicher has a pragmatic view of the issue and says that Garrod 's commitment to fighting against false marking makes him a valuable partner for PubPat despite his outside trolling work .
" Without Dave 's assistance we could n't do this campaign , which I 'm convinced is a public good , " Ravicher told Mullin .
" We disagree about software patents .
Dave 's going to do that other stuff , with or without the false marking campaign . "
False marking primarily describes scenarios where companies mark their products as patented when they do not have a patent or when the relevant patent has expired .
On behalf of PubPat , Garrod has filed several lawsuits against companies that perpetrate false marking .
He does this as a volunteer without compensation from PubPat .
This situation reflects the diverse spectrum of ideological views about what constitutes abuse of the patent system .
Garrod clearly recognizes the problematic nature of false marking , but seemingly feels no ethical compulsion to refrain from filing arguably spurious patent infringement lawsuits .

public education in texas , doomed
Texas ' new potential chair of the Board of Education will make you long for the good old days of anti-evolution dentist Don McLeroy .
Public school teacher creating lesson plans according to Cynthia Dunbar .
Illustration by Coke Navarro
Only a month ago there seemed to be a glimmer of hope for science education in Texas as a fundamentalist who thought he was on a mission from God to inject theology into the school curriculum was stripped of his title as Chairman of the State Board of Education .
But apparently , deciding that trying to dismantle the state ’s public education is a good idea , Governor Rick Perry has his eye on Cynthia Dunbar as the new SBOE chair , a woman who seems to be a living stereotype of a right wing ideologue .
She even wrote a book in which she declares that only people who interpret the Bible the way she does are fit to govern and flashes her hatred of public education , comparing sending kids to public schools to throwing them into the maws of demons .
Is it just me or does anyone else think that maybe , just maybe , someone who loathes education and invokes her religion for a free pass to do whatever she wants is not the best person in charge of the curriculums for all of the state ’s schools ?
Even worse , she ’s encouraging the other barking mad zealots on the board .
In a quick interview with the Houston Chronicle , one such loon , David Bradley , bragged that her appointment would be a cause angst against for “ the same members of the pagan left that rejected Don McLeroy because he was a man of faith , The pagan left ?
Are you serious ?
And this is a board member deciding what kids will learn in a public school ?
He sounds more like a guy on a street corner wearing a sandwich board about the the end of days and shouting at those who pass by to repent .
Just to set the record straight , McLeroy was rejected because he was a crank with utter contempt for anyone who did n’t agree with his personal ideology and because he was the leader of other cranks who decided that it was their moral duty to dismantle public education and rebuild it to adhere to their narrow little worldview in which science , logic and reason are despised on a primal level .
There are plenty of people who have faith in the supernatural but would much rather see every zealot gone from the board .
If you read my discussion with Dan Quinn from the Texas Freedom Network , one of the very few organizations actually defending education from these crazed cranks , you may recall his point that we have intelligence for a reason and instead of blind obedience to dogmas , we should be using all that brain power and encouraging kids to do the same .
It never ceases to amaze me how hardcore , right wing ideologues have such a vested interest in securing a spot in an institution they hate and spend years trying to wreck it .
And the funny thing is that they ’re paid in our money to do it .
From lawmakers who insist that the government is always the cause of any problem , to angry proselytizers who have absolutely no intention of listening to anything but the voices in their heads , they all get to wreck the very things we rely on in our daily life at our expense .
If you live in Texas and wonder where your money ’s going , part of it ends up in the bank account of a woman who homeschooled her kids because she was convinced that public schools are evil incarnate , yet sits on a board which has the power to dumb down the entire state ’s schooling to her extremely low and willfully ignorant standards …

There are many hands involved with the creation of this game engine – every member of the Upper Deck R&D team has worked hard to put it together .
Mike Hummel , Dave Humpherys and Jeff Liu were pivotal in providing the foundation of the game engine , and myself , Dan Scheidegger and Justin Reilly also had a hand in developing the engine .
What do you hope players will experience when they play a game of Marvel Superstars ?
The excitement of playing your favorite super - hero that you have seen on the silver screen !

The origin of ' My bad '
The best evidence obtainable at present points to Manute Bol ( above ) , the 7 ' 7 " Sudanese NBA player whose native tongue was Dinka , as the inventor , sometime in the 1980s , of this now–ubiquitous phrase .
Geoffrey K. Pullum told the story in his December 7 , 2005 blog post .
Here is the relevant portion : Ken Arneson emailed me to say that he heard the phrase was first used by the Sudanese immigrant basketball player Manute Bol , believed to have been a native speaker of Dinka ( a very interesting and thoroughly un-Indo - Europeanlike language of the Nilo - Saharan superfamily ) .
Says Arneson , " I first heard the phrase here in the Bay Area when Bol joined the Golden State Warriors in 1988 , when several Warriors players started using the phrase . "
And Ben Zimmer 's rummaging in the newspaper files down in the basement of Language Log Plaza produced a couple of early 1989 quotes that confirm this convincingly : St. Louis Post - Dispatch , Jan. 10 , 1989 : When he [ Manute Bol ] throws a bad pass , he 'll say , " My bad " instead of " My fault , " and now all the other players say the same thing .
USA Today , Jan. 27 , 1989 : After making a bad pass , instead of saying " my fault , " Manute Bol says , " my bad . "
Now all the other Warriors say it too .
So all of this is compatible with a date of origin for the phrase in the early 1980s ( Manute Bol first joined the NBA in 1985 but came to the USA before that , around 1980 ) .
Professor Ron McClamrock of the Philosophy Department at SUNY
Albany tells me he recalls very definitely hearing the phrase on the basketball court when he was in graduate school at MIT in the early 1980s , so the news stories above could be picking the story up rather late ; but it is still just possible that Manute Bol was the originator , because he played for Cleveland State and Bridgeport University in the early 1980s , and his neologism just could have spread from there to other schools in the northeast , such as MIT .

When I moved to Kentucky in August , 1977 , the high school kids were using it all the time .

Dear Author ,
I uttered this phrase in 1974 to a friend of mine .
My tongue got twisted when I mean't to say , " my fault " for a bad move .
I take the credit for beginning this phrase .
I knew it would take off because my friend Barry continued to say it .

This came up today in a conversation and a couple of the older guys said that they used to say it in their high school basketball teams here in North Carolina back in the 70's .
I have a suspicion the origin goes back further than that .
Wish I had a source , but you might look back further than you had been .
